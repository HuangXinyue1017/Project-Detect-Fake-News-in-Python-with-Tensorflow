Pakistan has declared an Indian diplomat persona non grata and given him 48 hours to leave the country, in a tit-for-tat move that comes a day after India said it would deport a Pakistani official. 
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said it had declared Indian diplomat Surjeet Singh persona non grata and that it had informed India’s diplomatic mission in Islamabad of the decision. 
The statement said Singh was accused of activities “that were in violation of the Vienna Convention and the established diplomatic norms.” 
An aide to India’s prime minister in New Delhi said the Indian government was looking into the matter. 
The decision came after India said on Thursday it had declared a Pakistani consular official persona non grata for “espionage activities” against New Delhi. 
Mehmood Akhtar, the visa official at the Pakistani mission, had been briefly detained by Indian police on Wednesday outside the gates to the Delhi Zoo where he met two Indian associates. 
Indian police said the Pakistani diplomat and his alleged accomplices were found in possession of forged documents, defense-related maps, deployment charts and lists of officers working along India’s border with Pakistan.

Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi dismissed the allegation, saying it “never engages in any activity that is incompatible with its diplomatic status.” 
Relations between India and Pakistan have been strained in recent months, with New Delhi blaming Islamabad for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. They have fought four wars with each other, three of which have been over Kashmir. 
'Indian soldier, civilian killed in Kashmir' 
An Indian paramilitary officer claimed that Pakistani troops had opened fire along the volatile frontier in Indian-controlled Kashmir, killing a civilian and a soldier. Pakistan's army denied the claim. 
The Indian officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Pakistani soldiers fired mortars and automatic gunfire at several border posts in Jammu region on Friday in an ""unprovoked"" violation of a ceasefire accord between India and Pakistan in the disputed region. 
Troops from the two countries regularly trade fire, causing casualties. 
On Thursday, protesters in Kashmir and Pakistan observed the Black Day, demonstrating against what they called Indian occupation. Loading ...",0
4197,BREAKING: Trump Fires 500 Obama Staffers… Dems Panic | EndingFed News Network,"Email Print Donald Trump is reportedly firing around 500 of Barack Obama’s staffers, as he plans to completely fill the White House with his own team. The Federalist Papers reported that though it’s likely that Hillary Clinton would have let most of Obama’s people go so that she could hire her own staff, Trump’s win closed the door on the possibility of any of Obama’s staffer sticking around. The fired staffers have gotten so desperate about their employment situation that Obama has brought in representatives from Facebook, Instagram and other companies to offer insights into the job market. According to CBS News , Linkedin officials are helping Obama’s staff find ways to market their skills. Georgetown University, which is located close to the White House, has designed a custom professional development program they call “Future44,” Obama is the 44th president, to teach Obama’s political appointees how to build their lives after the White House. The program is free of charge thanks to an anonymous donor, and participants register for either four 2-hour evening sessions or one 8-hour “boot camp.” “We designed this unique curriculum to help these staffers think through how to market themselves or market their competencies,” said Kelly Otter, dean of Georgetown’s School of Continuing Studies. Many of Obama’s staffers will likely end up in liberal cities like New York or San Francisco working for companies that cater to millennials such as Amazon, Snapchat, Google, Vice, etc. “The transition out of government is a reality for most appointees, which brings both excitement about prospects for the next chapter or a long-awaited chance to recharge batteries, and a keen awareness about a big, impending change,” said White House spokeswoman Jennifer Friedman. Ivan Adler, a headhunter at McCormick Group, explained that Obama’s staffers are about to face a major change in life that may be hard to get through. “I tell everybody: You have to understand there’s likely nothing you will do professionally that will have the same amount of excitement you’ve just gone through in the White House, unless you become a racecar driver or an astronaut,” he said. Too bad, so sad…Don’t let the door hit you on the way out, Obama staffers!

4198,BREAKING: Honey G Fatally Gunned Down In Bitter Rap Feud,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] BREAKING: Honey G Fatally Gunned Down In Bitter Rap Feud November 8, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS , ENTERTAINMENT Share 0 Add Comment 
FANS of London rap artist Honey G have flooded social media with condolences this afternoon following a fatal shooting linked to a West London rap feud. 
Real name Anna Georgette Gilford, the X-Factor contestant was reportedly shot 17 times by a group of unknown assailants who cut off the car she was a passenger in. 
“I saw the blacked out jeep overtaking her car, forcing her driver to stop,” one eyewitness recalls, “Five men in balaclavas got out and began trying to open her door, but then she seemed to open fire on them from the inside, hitting one in the shoulder and another guy in the chest”. 
CCTV footage from the scene showed the two men hitting the ground, before the other three men took out semi-automatic machine guns and opened fire. Honey G can be seen crawling out of the opposite side of the car. She then began shooting at her assailants. 
“She started shouting ‘you East side pansies will never take me alive’,” said another witness, “She went at them all guns blazing”. 
Police confirmed Honey G stood up from behind the car, wielding duel gold plated desert eagle handguns in each hand before slowly firing off rounds while walking calmly towards the men. 
“They fired back, and hit her several times. She was bleeding from several areas on her torso, but it didn’t seem to stop her,” police investigators confirmed, “She took out the three guys, executing one of them on the ground to the line ‘I say Honey, you say…’ before then putting two slugs behind his ear, finishing him off to the letter ‘G’. Unfortunately, she didn’t see the driver of the vehicle coming around from the other side”. 
In a split second, the X-Factor hopeful was gunned down by the driver of the vehicle, who then sped off through the busy London streets. The SUV was later found burned out in the East side of the city. 
It is understood Honey G was involved in a bitter East/West feud which has been spanning over 5 years.

According to the Syrian dissidents' news website, Enab, Muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated Riyadh and other Arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles.
The Saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the Syrian army and its allies' siege of Aleppo.
He also thanked Turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals.
Jaish al-Fatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with Al-Nusra (Fatah Al-Sham) Front comprising its main body.
In relevant remarks in June, a source said that Saudi Arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in Aleppo in Northern Syria to strengthen them against the Syrian army and its allies' fresh attacks.

The Criminal West’s State Sponsorship of Terrorism Israel wants Syria destroyed as presaged by the Oded Yinon plan ""The Saudi regime has recently sent small arms and new equipment, including 5 drones, to the terrorists in Syria,"" the source said.
To this end, Riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in Northern Aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the Syrian army and popular forces, the source added.
Also, a prominent Syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in Aleppo take orders from outside and don’t dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
""Violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of Aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decision-making for remaining or leaving the city, rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working,"" Turki Hassan told FNA last Saturday.
Noting that the main cause of the terrorists' stubborn stay in Aleppo is that leaders of Fatah al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham) are afraid of punishment by their Qatari, Saudi and Turkish masters, he said, ""If they move in defiance of their Qatari, Saudi and Turkish lords, they might be killed and their properties be seized.""",0
4200,Appellate Court Overturns Five-Year Durational Limit for Historic Mim’s Restaurant’s Parking Lot | The Law,"(Before It's News)
UNIONDALE, NEW YORK — Sahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC has announced that Christian Browne, a Partner with the Firm, successfully appealed a New York State Supreme Court decision that dismissed a restaurant’s request to annul a five-year durational limit on the eatery’s parking lot that extends into the Town’s Residence District.
On April 22, 2015, the Board of Zoning and Appeals (BZA) imposed a five-year durational limit on an approval that allows Mim’s Restaurant to provide parking in a part of its property that is within a residential zoning district.
The restaurant then commenced an Article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the durational limit. On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.
On October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court’s decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant’s parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.
Zoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.
“We are pleased with the Court’s decision,” Mr. Browne said. “We believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.”
Nicholas J. Cappadora, an Associate with the Firm, assisted Mr. Browne on the case.

4201,Comment on U.S. federal judge asks: Where are the Christian refugees? by Auntie Lulu,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 2 Comments 
Christians are one of the main targets of the Islamic State as they cut a murderous swath through Syria and Iraq. And yet, Christians constitute only 0.5% of the Syrian refugees whom the Obama administration has admitted into the United States. 
On October 21, 2016, in his concurrent opinion in the case of Heartland Alliance National Immigrant Justice Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security , Judge Daniel Manion , a federal appellate court judge for the U.S. Seventh Circuit, issued a sharp rejoinder to the Obama administration over the almost complete lack of Syrian Christian refugees being admitted to the U.S. Note: Heartland Alliance National Immigrant Justice Center is a “progressive” liberal advocacy organization. The Heartland Alliance v. DHS case has nothing to do with Christian refugees, but pertains to Heartland Alliance’s FOIA request to the DHS for information on Tier III terrorist organizations. 
While concurring in the 7th Circuit Court’s ruling, Judge Daniel Manion explains why he’s writing separately. On pages 7-8 of U.S. Court of Appeal for the Seventh Circuit No. 16-1840 Heartland Alliance National Immigrant Justice Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security , Judge Manion writes: “I write separately for a second, critical reason, which is my concern about the apparent lack of Syrian Christians as a part of immigrants from that country . It is possible that our case bears a direct link to this enigma. It is well‐documented that refugees to the United States are not representative of that war‐torn area of the world. Perhaps 10 percent of the population of Syria is Christian, and yet less than one‐half of one percent of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States this year are Christian. ¹ Recognizing the crisis in Syria, the President in 2015 set a goal of resettling 10,000 refugees in the United States. And in August the government reached this laudable goal. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 refugees admitted by mid‐September, only 56 were Christian. To date, there has not been a good explanation for this perplexing discrepancy.” 
Judge Manion also noted that while the Obama administration is bringing Syrian refugees into the country by the thousands, it is concealing basic information about those refugees behind a wall of government secrecy, including whether terrorists are among the refugees. The administration refuses to tell the American public or the states how it is making its decisions on who are accepted for resettlement in the U.S., or even what steps it is taking to ensure there are no terrorists among the refugees. Nor is Congress exercising its oversight functions. 
As Manion writes in his concurrent opinion: “The good people of this country routinely welcome immigrants from all over the world. But in a democracy, good data is critical to public debate about national immigration policy. When we demand high evidentiary burdens for states seeking to keep their citizens safe, and then prevent the states from that evidence, we create a Catch-22.² […] And yet, Congress, through the exemptions to FOIA, has consciously made the decision to limit what governmental information is available to the public. If Congress is concerned about how immigration officers are making their decisions related to the designation and application of the Tier III terrorist organization affiliation, Congress has the authority to act. Congress has its own oversight capabilities and subpoena power, and Congress could choose to amend our nation’s sunshine laws or our immigration laws. Until that time, however, many of us remain in the dark as a humanitarian catastrophe continues.” 
Daniel Manion , 74, is a senior jurist on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit whose chambers are located in South Bend, Indiana. He was an Indiana state senator (R) from 1978-82. In 1986, Manion was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the 7th Circuit Court.",0
4202,Architecture Firm Unveils Plans for Space Skyscraper Hanging from Asteroid - Breitbart,"Clouds Architecture Office has designed a skyscraper that would stretch toward Earth from the sky, suspended from an orbiting asteroid. [The New York architecture firm wants to build a   skyscraper 31, 068 miles above the Earth. Analemma Tower is a project meant to “apply design thinking on a planetary scale” to create “the world’s tallest building ever. ”  The building will float in a massive figure eight through the northern and southern hemispheres, passing over several major cities as it goes. The firm’s plan suggests building in Dubai specifically because of the country’s ability to craft massive superstructures for about   the cost of building in the U. S. Analemma would employ a Universal Orbital Support System (UOSS) to hang   by “high strength cable” from the aforementioned asteroid. And if it becomes reality, Analemma would be a sectional world all its own. Business centers would dominate the lower levels, with apartments situated above. Gardens, religious areas, as well as commercial and entertainment areas all have their place. The tower is full of   engineering, including   windows that adjust their height for differences in temperature and air pressure. Solar panels placed on the uppermost levels will harness energy to keep the whole thing running, while fresh water is harvested from the clouds below. Of course, they’ll need to position an asteroid of appropriate size to accomplish their science fiction Wonderland. The firm cited the European Space Agency’s “Rosetta” mission and NASA’s 2021 asteroid retrieval mission as evidence that the concept doesn’t stray too far from modern realities.

4203,Can We Live in a Constant State of Love?,"Leave a reply 
Toni Emerson – When we fall in love, our heart becomes full of feel-good qualities that infuse our life with joy and excitement. Everything feels light, fresh and more vibrant. We wake up to a brighter day, the air is warmer, the sun is brighter, everything is right with the world. 
Living life through the interactive and colorful kaleidoscope of love is one of the highest human experiences . Wouldn’t it be fantastic to capture this experience and transform it into a permanent state of being? In my next few articles, we will formulate our unique blueprint to reconnect to our love source and transition from experiences of love which come and go to living love at its fullest moment to moment. Love & Emotions 
Understanding the difference between love and the many feelings inspired by love is essential in realizing that love is the baseline from which everything else emerges. 
As human beings, we experience many emotional states under love’s vast umbrella, yet each one of them fails to convey the totality of what love is. Love is not equal to the sum of its parts. It is far more powerful than transient emotions. It is an integral state of being waiting to be rediscovered. 
Each deeply nourishing emotion ushered by love stands on its own merits and offers its own specific gifts. These emotions assist us in reaching our full potential as human being by deepening our interior faculties and also by giving us the human qualities that propel us into action to help others in need and to make our world a better world. Love’s Ambassadors 
Love’s ambassadors enrich our life experience and increase our range of perception. Love’s ambassadors are: compassion, joy, kindness, wisdom, peace, gratitude, equanimity, appreciation, pleasure, acceptance, intimacy, benevolence, grace, generosity, respect, sympathy, among others. 
All these supreme heart qualities advocate on behalf of love and fall under its vast umbrella, but none of them define what love is. They suggest what love might feel like, they point in the direction of love, but they individually and collectively do not come close to the full spectrum of love’s power. Each heart quality is unique and offers special gifts. For example, appreciation may feel like love but actually represents a recognition of a certain quality. It has a finite characteristic. So does gratitude which has many uplifting vibrations and is essentially the crystal clear awareness and heartfelt acknowledge-ment of life’s gifts. Compassion, Love’s Favorite Wingman 
Many of these qualities are considered to be divine in nature because they embody the highest human values. Wisdom traditions foster these qualities of the heart while making the distinction between love and its ambassadors, most notably between love and compassion. The tender feeling evoked by compassion is considered to be a universal virtue, one we extend towards ourselves but more frequently towards other people’s suffering. Compassion has a global history with various ways of expression, depending on cultural differences, yet it has held throughout times its distinct benevolent meaning and its position as love’s favorite wingman. 
One of the Buddhist interpretation of compassion is the desire to relieve sentient beings of suffering, while love is the desire to bring happiness to sentient beings . 
The Christian tradition holds universal love to be the principal message of Jesus (the Gospels), with many direct references of love in the Bible, and compassion is viewed as the method for enacting this love as part of our responsibility to alleviate human suffering in the world. 
In Hinduism, all love for others is considered self love as brahma (universal soul) manifested in the individual ( atman ) while seva (selfless service) is a central theme of life, practical compassion in action and our duty to humanity. Love Is A State Of Being 
“I’m not interested in being a “lover.” I’m interested in only being love.” — Ram Dass 
Love evokes the largest colony of feelings known to man. Nothing else comes close. It commands basic emotions, activates a host of feel good feelings and also has the unique capacity to deactivate negative feelings on contact. 
The power of love to dissolve negativity cannot be underestimated. This power becomes our closest ally in removing the emotional blocks that keep us isolated from our love source. 
Love is not an emotion. Happiness, in contrast, is an emotion, and as with any other emotion, it comes and goes depending on the circumstances triggering it. 
We often make the mistake of reducing love to the level of emotion, thereby diluting its power and settling for small love experiences that indeed come and go. If we become aware of this type of love, its qualities, where it comes from, why it comes up in our lives, we notice that generally the emotion we call love is but a shadow of the deeper state of love which is our essence. 
Love is not sentimentality or even romanticism. Those are what we do with love to express its many delicious ways and plays. 
When love is a state of being , we can actually experience unhappiness and still be rooted in love. We can feel love amidst other emotions. Love is the background on which all other emotional scenery go by. 
These distinctions are sometimes faint, delicate, because they are translated according to the depth of our perception. Psychological well-being does not indicate the presence of love, but rather the absence of turmoil, and remains very dependent on the pendulum of life forever swinging from one side to the other, from pleasure to pain. Love as a state of being is independent of outside circumstances. 
So far, we have been used to the smallest indication of what love really is. We have limited love to an intellectual idea or a set of well delineated beliefs. That is hardly satisfying to the soul, isn’t it? It does not come close to the actual experience of living in a state of love. The absolute difference is to be felt, not just understood. 
Searching for the state of being called love leads us to the ultimate discovery of who we really are and what our purpose is. Please join me on this adventure, and In the next articles let’s recognize together love in a new light and realize that it has been inside of us all along. 
Love is just waiting to be discovered, again. SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality  ",0
4204,Comment on Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter by T. Mohr,"Home / Be The Change / Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Mark Ruffalo Delivers Mobile Solar Trailers to Standing Rock Camps in Preparation for Harsh Winter Jay Syrmopoulos October 30, 2016 2 Comments 
Cannon Ball, ND – In a show of kindness and solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux, actor Mark Ruffalo and Native Renewables founder Wahleah Johns presented Sioux tribal elders with mobile trailers equipped with solar collection arrays. The trailers provide a clean energy source for the protest encampment where over 500 Native American tribes have taken a stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the largest gathering of American Indians in modern history. 
“This pipeline is a black snake that traverses four states and 200 waterways with fracked Bakken oil,” said Ruffalo, co-founder of The Solutions Project, a venture that works to transition society to clean and renewable energy. 
“We know from experience that pipelines leak, explode, pollute and poison land and water. But it doesn’t have to be that way.” 
The solar trailers will allow for medical tents and numerous other critical facilities to be powered with clean energy, and represent exactly the healthy/abundant future of energy for which the Standing Rock Sioux are currently fighting. 
“Water is life,” said Johns, a Navajo leader. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” 
According to a report by EcoWatch : 
Johns’ company, Native Renewables, promotes low-cost clean energy solutions for Native American families throughout the U.S., with an emphasis on job creation and on benefiting the community as a whole. The trailers were built by members of the Navajo nation and were financed by Empowered by Light and Give Power. 
Research led by Stanford Prof. Mark Jacobson, another Solutions Project co-founder, shows that it would be technically possible and economically beneficial to transition to 100 percent clean renewable energy in each and every state across the country. In North Dakota, for example, wind and solar energy would be the primary sources of clean power and transitioning to 100 percent renewables would create 30,000 jobs. 
The reality of the situation is that the Standing Rock tribe is fighting to protect their source of clean water. The Dakota Access Pipeline puts the tribe’s clean water supply, as well as that of millions of others, in danger, as the pipeline is scheduled to go directly under the Missouri River. 
— Dan Zukowski (@danzukowski) October 25, 2016 
The construction of the “black snake” marks the conglomeration of corporate/banking interests being elevated above that of the public interest. Furthermore, the ongoing construction has already desecrated sacred burial sites and cultural artifacts. “Around the world, more than 80 percent of the forests and lands with protected waterways and rich biodiversity are held by indigenous tribes. This is no coincidence,” Ruffalo said. “As so many of us suffer from polluted water, air and land in our rural and urban communities, the water defenders at Standing Rock are showing us another way.” 
Imagine how you would respond if an oil pipeline was being dug through the cemetery where your grandparents and great grandparents were buried. 
Mark Ruffalo taking a stand for the Standing Rock Sioux is a great example for all individuals, celebrity, and non-celebrity alike. Rather than simply donating some money to a cause, he has utilized his celebrity to bring much greater attention to the continued injustices being perpetrated against the Native American community. 
It’s clear that Ruffalo has taken a page out of Ghandi’s book, and is “being the change he wishes to see in the world.” 
Please share this inspiring human story — and take a stand for Standing Rock! Share",0
4205,"The Hunt for Hatchimals, the Elusive Toy of the Holiday Season - The New York Times","Two years ago, the creative and design teams at the toy company Spin Master came up with a big idea they called “Hatchimals” —   an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes. Coaxing a creature out of its shell “resonates very well with kids,” said James Martin, senior vice president and head of global business at Spin Master, a Canadian toy company that also sells Etch A Sketch, among many other products. “They don’t know what’s inside and they get excited about what they may get. There’s this anticipation that builds. ” The company, however, did not bargain on quite this much anticipation. Since their introduction in October, Hatchimals, which have a suggested retail price of $59. 99, have become the hot toy of the holiday season that nobody can find. Desperate parents intent on buying a Hatchimal are waiting in long lines at retailers, putting their names on waiting lists, and even buying lottery tickets for the toy. Sellers on Amazon and eBay were asking more than three times the retail price on Friday. Hatchimals arrive inside a colorful spotted egg. They come in five species  —   Draggles and Pengualas (which look like penguins) Owlicorns (owls with a unicorn horn) and Burtles and Bearakeets (which look like little turtles and bears). Rub, tap and warm the egg and it will coo, light up and tap back at you for about half an hour, as it eventually gurgles, hiccups and slowly pecks its way through the hard shell. (A video review showing the hatching and growth of a Draggle has more than 1. 3 million views.) Though Spin Master is rushing distribution by airfreighting the remaining Hatchimals from factories in China, the company has not said how many more will be available throughout December, and the shortage is expected to continue. A new batch of Hatchimals will not be available until early in 2017. Spin Master worked to generate buzz for Hatchimals with a secretive launch, and managed to keep all images off the internet until the toy officially “hatched” on Oct. 7, which it called “Global Hatchimals Day. ” Company executives also planned for what they thought would be the right amount of product supply to meet the holiday demand. The company declined to release sales figures. “By all analyses, we thought we had enough,” Mr. Martin said. “We had no idea that it would be this big. It’s been exciting but it’s also been daunting as we try to catch up and fill that demand. ” The toy is finding an audience in both boys and girls ranging in age from 3 to 12 years old  —   which is a larger demographic than the company expected. “Nobody knows why these things happen. They’re an act of God,” said Richard Gottlieb, chief executive of Global Toy Experts and publisher of Global Toy News. While the product may be clever, said Mr. Gottlieb, “it’s all about a moment in time, and it’s hard to predict what makes a product connect. ” Mandy Nigbur, a stockbroker in Riverton, Utah, knew it wasn’t going to be easy to find a Hatchimal when her    daughter requested one from Santa. So when Santa Claus made an appearance at her family party over Thanksgiving weekend, he “knew to tell her his elves weren’t making very many and they might be hard to come by,” Ms. Nigbur said. “But I was on the hunt. ” Ms. Nigbur and three of her friends took to the internet and found a website that alerts customers to what’s in stock at retailers near them. They learned that their local Target was supposed to get a small shipment of Hatchimals on Friday, so the women arrived at Target at 4:45 a. m. and waited outside in the   cold. Their efforts paid off. They each purchased a Hatchimal, which Target sold for the suggested retail price  —   and quickly sold out of. “I haven’t decided if Mommy gets to be the star or if Santa will be the one who gets to bring it to her,” said Ms. Nigbur, who said she may be more excited about nabbing the product than her daughter will be to receive it. The chase and the rush to find the item is actually part of the appeal when a certain toy  —   such as Cabbage Patch Kids and Tickle Me Elmo  —   becomes a phenomenon, according to Mr. Gottlieb. “There is an irrational exuberance on the part of the consumer with these buying frenzies, which leads to a scarcity of product and crazy high prices,” he said. Some parents have given up on finding a Hatchimal before the holidays. “I am not proud to say I entered into a raffle to win a Hatchimal on a Facebook group,” said Lindsey Hunter Lopez of Los Angeles, whose    daughter asked for the toy. “It was a $10   for a spot, with 16 spots,” she said. Ms. Lopez did not win the raffle, and said that she would not be hunting for the toy any further. Spin Master hopes to keep the excitement going well past the holidays, and promises that 2017 will bring new species of Hatchimals with more features. “We’re telling consumers to just be patient,” said Mr. Martin. “The magic is just as magical in January as it is in December. The experience is just as exciting then. In fact, it may be even a little more because you’ll be getting the first batch of 2017. ” But will kids still want Hatchimals next year, or will they have moved on? “It’s a   industry and this is an expensive item, which really tend to sell only at holiday time,” said Gerrick Johnson, an equity research analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. “That’s why the company is willing to airfreight, which is expensive, in order to capture those spending dollars now rarely do you have an item like this that works two seasons in a row. ” Sarah Gough, who lives near Guatemala City, is still halfheartedly searching for a Hatchimal for her    daughter, but is not expecting to find one soon. “I looked at our major retailer twice and they don’t have it yet,” Ms. Gough said. She plans to ask her parents to look for the toy in the United States. “But they aren’t really into standing in any lines to pick up toys,” she said. To those parents who are not able to buy the toy in time, Dr. Deborah Gilboa, a family physician in Pittsburgh and a parenting and youth development expert, said: “It’s a great lesson in delayed gratification. ”",0
4206,5 Giant Footprints That You Won’t Believe Are Real,"It’s easy to talk about how giants existed and how ancient mankind created myths around alleged beings of incredible proportions. But apparently, not everything is pure myth. In this article, we take a look at three fascinating MASSIVE footprints that according to many prove ancient Giants did exist. 


Interestingly, in nearly all ancient writings we find that in the distant past, giants walked among ordinary humans.

If we look at ancient writings from South America, North America, Europe and Asia, we will find that ancient cultures mentioned giants in their ancient writings. However, some ancient texts not only mention giants but suggest they were real.

Ok so, if giants did exist, then… show me the evidence! 

Well, the evidence may well be all around us.

It doesn’t matter where we look, Asia, North America, Africa, we will see that there are ‘footprints’ embedded into a rock which are indicative of SUPERSIZED beings.

We can find stories in many mythologies of the ancient world: Greek, Norse, Germanic, Indian, Indo-European, and also in the new world as in the traditions of the Mayans, Aztecs and Incas; but most importantly in almost all major sacred books of antiquity: the Lebhar Gabhale, the Hindu Ramayana and even in the Bible.

However, in addition to the massive footprints found around the globe, there is written evidence which also suggests these beings were real.

A 2,000-year-old book called ‘The Book of Giants’ is what many are referring to as the ultimate proof of the existence of giants.

Over 50 years ago, scholars came across this fascinating book which details the Nephilim and how these beings were destroyed. Please note that the word ‘Nephilim’ is still not fully understood. Throughout the years, scholars have proposed some etymologies, among them: ‘The Fallen, ‘Apostates,’ and even ‘those that cause others to fall.’ But regardless of their name and the meaning, the enigmatic Nephilim have long been considered the giant beings that inhabited our planet in the distant past.

The ‘Book of Giants’ was found nearly half a century ago in the Qumran Caves where experts recovered thousands of ancient scrolls that offer invaluable details of mankind’s past.

But Giants are also mentioned in the Bible. 
“There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.” -Genesis 6:4 So in addition to ‘footprints,’ we have ancient texts that speak of Giants and how these beings existed on Earth.

But not everyone is convinced that these ancient texts are proof of giants. As a matter of a fact, many believe that these are just myths created by our ancients.

But if giants are just a myth… how come we have MASSIVE footprints in different parts of the world?

Recently, photographers exploring an area near a Chinese village came across a sensational finding. They discovered (and photographed) a footprint left behind by a massive being. In the image –se below— you can clearly see the footprint embedded into rock. Compared to an ordinary foot of a human being, the footprint embedded into rock is at least twice as big.


Furthermore, in South Africa near the Swaziland border in the Mpumalanga province, another massive footprint was found embedded into rock.

There a massive 1.2-meter long footprint stands firmly embedded into granite. Locals call it Goliath’s Footprint or ‘The Footprint of God’. Its big. Really big.

Locals consider the region where the footprint is located as a place of love, peace, and healing and that the Mpuluzi footprint is there to serve the power of good. How the gigantic footprint was imprinted into granite is another mystery, local shamans tell the story that this particular footprint was left by a being which was running across the ground covered with warm lava ash and that this is how the footprint came to be imprinted in granite.


However, many remain skeptical. Dr. Jay Wile, a nuclear chemist, asserted that “it is almost certainly not a footprint.”

However, as we can read on other websites , more controversial footprints have been found around the world.

A news article published in the Strand Magazine, December of 1895, reprinted in “Traces of the Elder Faiths of Ireland” by W.G. Wood-Martin mentions this fossilized giant discovered during mining operations in County Antrim, Ireland: “Pre-eminent among the most extraordinary articles ever held by a railway company is the fossilized Irish giant, which is at this moment lying at the London and North-Western Railway Company’s Broad Street goods depot, and a photograph of which is reproduced here… This monstrous figure is reputed to have been dug up by a Mr. Dyer whilst prospecting for iron ore in County Antrim. The principal measurements are: entire length, 12ft. 2in.; girth of chest, 6ft. 6in.; and length of arms, 4ft. 6in. There are six toes on the right foot. The gross weight is 2 tons 15cwt.; so that it took half a dozen men and a powerful crane to place this article of lost property in position for the Strand, magazine artist. Dyer, after showing the giant in Dublin, came to England with his queer find and exhibited it in Liverpool and Manchester at sixpence, sixpence a head, attracting scientific men as well as gaping sightseers”.

The idea that Giants walked on Earth —and that there is even possibly evidence to support claims of their existence— is something fascinating. So, while looking for more massive footprints, we’ve stumbled across the image posted below which seems to depict another GIANT footprint embedded into rock.

While we have no information as to where the image was taken, we can provide the source where we found the image.


Furthermore, another massive footprint embedded into solid rock can be found at Bheemana Hejje near Bangalore. It is referred to as the Giant Footprint of Bheema.

Benefit claimants have defied critics who say they don’t contribute anything by receiving an award for their outstanding contribution to Channel 5’s TV schedule. 
Editor of What Scapegoat? magazine Simon Williams presented the award at an arsehole-studded event in London yesterday evening. 
“What better way to unwind after a hard day at work than by getting angry because an overweight man on benefits has a pet cat and a dirty fridge,” he said. 
“Why get worked up about tax avoidance on a massive scale when you can experience the fury of watching a work-shy teenager playing Call of Duty on his Xbox?” 
Iain Duncan Smith, who accepted the award on behalf of benefit claimants, said: “Creating the impression that everyone on benefits is undergoing plastic surgery in a bid to become a glamour model has been invaluable in gathering support for welfare cuts. 
“When people think of benefits claimants, it’s important they don’t think I, Daniel Blake , but that they think iPhone and iPad. 
“If you or your family have ever gone hungry or cold because of welfare cuts then I will treasure this award on your behalf.

4208,"Egypt Declares State of Emergency, as Attacks Undercut Promise of Security - The New York Times","TANTA, Egypt  —   Rattling a country already wrestling with a faltering economy and deepening political malaise, two suicide bombings that killed 44 people at Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday raised the specter of increased sectarian bloodshed led by Islamic State militants. The attacks constituted one of the deadliest days of violence against Christians in Egypt in decades and presented a challenge to the authority of the country’s leader, President Abdel Fattah   who promptly declared a   state of emergency. Security is the central promise of Mr. Sisi, a strongman leader who returned on Friday from a triumphant visit to the United States, where President Trump hailed him as a bulwark against Islamist violence. Mr. Trump made it clear that he was willing to overlook the record of mass detention, torture and extrajudicial killings during Mr. Sisi’s rule in favor of his ability to combat the Islamic State and defend minority Christians. On Sunday, Mr. Sisi found himself back on the defensive, deploying troops to protect churches across the country weeks before a planned visit by Pope Francis. Mr. Sisi rushed to assure Christians, who have traditionally been among his most vocal supporters and now fear that he cannot protect them against extremists. “I won’t say those who fell are Christian or Muslim,” Mr. Sisi said in a speech shown on state television on Sunday night. “I will say that they’re Egyptian. ” One attack on Sunday struck at St. Mark’s Cathedral, the seat of the Coptic Church in Alexandria, where the bomber blew himself up at the church gates as the Coptic patriarch, Pope Tawadros II, led a Palm Sunday service inside. The other struck in the Nile Delta city of Tanta, where the attacker slipped past security to the front pews of the church and blew himself up, turning a religious celebration of joy into a ghastly scene of bloodshed and death. The Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the attacks through its Aamaq news agency, signaled in December its intention to step up attacks on Christians when a suicide bombing at a major Cairo church killed at least 28 people. In February, hundreds of Christians fled their homes in north Sinai after a concerted campaign of assassination and intimidation in the area. Although Mr. Sisi had already stepped up security at churches, Sunday’s bloodshed underscores the difficulty of stopping suicide attacks. More starkly, it highlighted the failure of Egypt’s powerful intelligence agencies to anticipate a coordinated wave of devastating attacks. The explosion in Tanta, about 50 miles north of Cairo, occurred at St. George’s church, where the authorities had already sealed the main door to prevent attacks. The bomber managed to slip past security measures, including a metal detector, at one of the side doors, and blew himself up near the altar. At least 27 people were killed and 78 others injured, officials said. Children, their parents and deacons  —   lay Christians who help with the service  —   accounted for many of the dead. Hours later, victims’ relatives stood silently outside the city morgue, waiting to identify and collect the remains of their loved ones. The Rev. Daniel Maher, a priest who had been leading the Mass, was still wearing his bloodstained white vestments. The priest said he had not been harmed in the attack, but he lost his son, Bishoy, who was to get married later this year. “What can I say? Thank God,” he said in a cracking voice. Next to the priest, a young woman sat on the sidewalk, sobbing as a group of women tried to comfort her. “God, what did he do to deserve this?” she asked, bemoaning the loss of her own loved one. The second attack occurred just over two hours later in the coastal city of Alexandria, where a suicide bomber tried to enter St. Mark’s Cathedral. Surveillance footage, later aired on a private Egyptian television channel, showed a man wearing a bulky jacket being directed into a metal detector at the church gates, where he paused to be searched by a police officer. A moment later, a giant blast rang out. At least 17 people were killed, including a district police chief and a police officer, and an additional 48 were wounded, according to the Health Ministry. Pope Tawadros, who is due to meet with Pope Francis during his visit to Egypt at the end of this month, was not injured in the blast. He later issued a statement saying that “these acts will not harm the unity and cohesion of the people. ” Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt’s 90 million people, who are mostly Sunni Muslim, and have long complained of discrimination and sporadic violence at the hands of extremists. Christian leaders were vocal supporters of Mr. Sisi after he came to power in 2013 when the military ousted the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Many Christians see Mr. Sisi as their defender, but Sunday’s events underscored how difficult it is for him to deliver on that promise, and raised pressing questions about security arrangements for Pope Francis’ visit on April 28 and 29. As forensics specialists combed through bloodstained wreckage at the site of the two church bombings, security officials found and defused explosive devices at other locations in Alexandria and Tanta, the state news media reported. Two devices were found at the Sidi Abdel Rahim Mosque in Tanta, home to one of the most famous Sufi Muslim shrines in the city, and another was found at the Collège St. Marc, an   school in downtown Alexandria. Hours later, Mr. Sisi convened a meeting of the National Defense Council, which includes the prime minister and commanders of the Egyptian armed forces, in response to the bombings. He then declared a   state of emergency, though it was not immediately clear what extra powers he required, given that his government enjoys largely unfettered powers, has already imprisoned or exiled thousands of political opponents, and oversees a Parliament that is dominated by his supporters. In his televised speech, Mr. Sisi indicated that news media coverage of attacks that embarrass his authority could be restricted. “The media discourse has to be responsible,” he said. “It’s not acceptable to have the incident aired repeatedly on television stations all day. ” Egyptians are used to such moves. The country was officially under a state of emergency for all of Hosni Mubarak’s   rule, and again for three months in 2013. When Pope Francis arrives in Egypt, he will find a country where the Islamic State is intent on driving a wedge between Islam and Christianity. The pontiff offered his condolences to the Copts and all Egyptians, and in his statement from Rome he referred to the Coptic patriarch as his “brother. ” Francis’ scheduled visit to Egypt has been billed as the latest step in a   effort to forge stronger ties between the Roman Catholic Church and Muslim leaders. Relations became strained in 2011 when Francis’s predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, denounced what he called “a strategy of violence that has Christians as a target” after a bombing at a church in Alexandria killed at least 23 people. Francis has sought to rebuild ties with Muslim clerics since becoming pope in 2013. And last year he welcomed to the Vatican Sheikh Ahmed   the grand imam of Al Azhar, a    mosque and university that is revered by Sunni Muslims In Egypt, the pontiff is to visit with Mr. Sisi the leadership of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the grand imam. The grand imam condemned Sunday’s attacks as a “despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents. ” For many Christians, though, the attacks at the start of the Holy Week before Easter are a harbinger of worse to come. “I think people will not only be too scared to be inside a church, they will be too scared to pass by one now,” said Mina Mansy, a prominent Christian rights activist. “This will continue to happen because the state is not interested in protecting Christians, or anyone else for that matter. The police’s only job is to crush political opponents. They don’t care about the real terrorists. ”",0

Speaking in front of decorated veterans at a foreign-policy focused rally, Trump said members of the military are “so much braver” than he is. 
“They’re so much braver than me. I wouldn’t have done what they did,” Trump said, going off-script in a foreign-policy focused address Thursday evening in Selma, NC. “I’m brave in other ways. I’m financially brave.” 
The Republican nominee also argued that the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was Secretary of State should make the military wary of promoting her to Commander-in-Chief.

4210,Argentina’s Trump-Like Immigration Order Rattles South America - The New York Times,"BUENOS AIRES  —   Argentina is so used to celebrating immigration as a cornerstone of society that a   saying  —   to govern is to populate  —   remains in use to this day. But in an abrupt shift coinciding with the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration, President Mauricio Macri has issued a decree curbing immigration to Argentina, with his government declaring that newcomers from poorer countries in Latin America bring crime. The measures announced by Mr. Macri in recent days made it much easier to deport immigrants and restrict their entry, prompting irate comparisons to President Trump and igniting a fierce debate over immigration. “A decree like this scares people,” said Arfang Diedhiou, 33, a Senegalese immigrant who runs his own clothing store here in the capital, Buenos Aires. “It came out just after what Trump did, a coincidence that seems very strange to me. ” Argentina’s president, the son of an immigrant, has echoed some of Mr. Trump’s “America First” theme, making it clear that his “first concern” should be “caring for Argentines, caring for ourselves. ” “We cannot continue to allow criminals to keep choosing Argentina as a place to commit offenses,” Mr. Macri said during a news conference. His decree has also rekindled criticism of his ties to the American president, whom he calls a friend. In the 1980s, Mr. Macri worked with his father, an Italian immigrant and industrial magnate, on a real estate project in New York that the family ended up selling to Mr. Trump. Mr. Macri’s immigration measures, while not as   as Mr. Trump’s decision to halt refugees from around the world and freeze visas from seven predominantly Muslim nations, are raising diplomatic tensions in the region. Some South American leaders are attacking what they view as an attempt to mimic Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and nurture xenophobic sentiment. “Brothers, Latin American presidents, we can’t follow the immigration policies of the North,” President Evo Morales of Bolivia said. But opinion polls in Argentina showed widespread support for limiting immigration, and some say the new decree does not go far enough. One   congressman is even calling for a wall to be built on the border with Bolivia. Claudio Suárez, 65, a worker at a bakery in Buenos Aires, called the immigration curbs “fantastic. ” “Nobody wants scum to come in from other countries,” he said. “Many foreigners come here because health services and education are free. The law should be even stronger. ” Argentina’s history has been written by waves of immigration over the decades. After   wars of conquest killed off many indigenous people, the authorities encouraged millions of immigrants to come, largely from Europe, to help populate and develop the country. More recently, governments welcomed newcomers from Latin America, Asia and Africa, opening a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and ensuring their access to public schools and health care. Officials in Mr. Macri’s government, which took over in 2015 by vowing to ease polarization and roll back the economic policies of his leftist predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, contend that they are still upholding Argentina’s openness to immigrants. “Everyone should remain calm, because Argentina will continue to be a hospitable and open country,” said Horacio García, Argentina’s top immigration official. The new immigration decree says it is focused on fighting crime, arguing that 22 percent of inmates in the federal penitentiary system are foreigners. (When all of the country’s prisons are taken into account the figure is closer to 6 percent.) The decree specifically mentions “organized crime” as a reason for the crackdown, but it expands the offenses that justify expulsion or blocked entry to include any crime that could lead to a prison sentence. Many worry that immigrants can now be expelled for minor crimes, like blocking a road during a protest. Immigrants hoping to fight a deportation order will have less than a week to file appeals. Previous measures granted 30 days to prepare a defense and the right to a government lawyer. “Immigrants are hanging by a thread because anything could be cause for deportation,” said Gabriela Liguori, director of the Argentina Commission for Refugees and Migrants, an immigrant rights group. But the immigration official, Mr. García, said deportations “will only focus on serious crimes. ” He contended that the measure was necessary because Argentina had become “defenseless to criminals from other countries. ” Faced with criticism, officials in Mr. Macri’s government have had to make it clear that they are ruling out building a   wall on the Bolivian border. “The problem isn’t immigration, but drug trafficking and contraband,” Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said after the Bolivian authorities questioned why she was publicly singling out Bolivian, Paraguayan and Peruvian immigrants for scrutiny. Despite Mr. Macri’s longstanding connection to the American president, Mr. Trump’s victory put the government here in an awkward spot. After all, Mr. Macri had made no secret that he was rooting for Hillary Clinton, saying that Mr. Trump was focused on building walls. But then Mr. Macri seemed to draw on his ties to Mr. Trump, becoming one of the first Latin American leaders to speak with him after the American presidential election. The call was quickly mired in controversy. A prominent Argentine journalist claimed that Mr. Trump had used the occasion to request Mr. Macri’s help in obtaining regulatory approval for a real estate project in Buenos Aires. Spokesmen for both leaders denied the assertion, though it emerged that Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who had no security clearance, had joined the phone call. Argentine authorities later confirmed that the Trump venture did not have the permits needed to begin construction. But in the end, plans for a Trump tower in Buenos Aires were called off as Mr. Trump came under pressure over potential conflicts of interest involving pending international deals. Critics say the new restrictions focus on poor immigrants to distract attention from the economy, which remains sluggish more than a year after Mr. Macri rose to power promising that   policies would usher in growth. Scrutinizing immigrants at times of stress is nothing new in Argentina, with the authorities long praising the country’s history of receiving European immigrants while portraying immigration from neighboring countries as less desirable, said Guillermo Cantor, a sociologist who specializes in immigration. In the late 1990s, President Carlos Menem’s government similarly cracked down on immigrants by associating them with street crime. In 2014, Mrs. Kirchner, the former president, threatened to expel foreigners who committed crimes in an overhaul of the penal code even after her government had legalized the irregular status of many immigrants. Other parts of Latin America are also grappling with bursts of   sentiment. With his nation suffering broad economic declines, Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, ordered a crackdown on Colombian immigrants in 2015, forcing many to flee across the border. An influx of Haitian immigrants to Chile is fueling a debate there over racism and discrimination. On the streets of Buenos Aires, immigrants had varying reactions to Mr. Macri’s decree. Jesús Oriona, 45, a Bolivian who moved to Argentina as a teenager, said the government was simply “throwing the blame at immigrants. ” But Maria Alejandra Alviarez, 39, a nurse from Venezuela who moved here a year ago and works in a health food store, said Argentina had been “too free and open” before the decree. “Macri’s not saying people can’t migrate, and qualified people like me will still be able to come here,” she said. Still others here contend that the shift is strategic, seeking   political points by blaming foreigners for ills in Argentine society ahead of legislative elections this year. “Of course, we have our share of xenophobia, and now, in the glow of Donald Trump, they want to dilute the fact that a large share of us are children or grandchildren of immigrants,” said Raúl Kollman, 68, a radio show host whose mother emigrated illegally to Argentina to flee the Nazis.",0

4212,Why You Should Tell Your Children How Much You Make - The New York Times,"When Scott Parker wanted his six offspring to know more about the value of money, he decided to do something that many parents would consider radical: show them exactly what he earned. One day, he stopped by his local Wells Fargo branch in Encinitas, Calif. and asked to withdraw his entire monthly salary in cash. In singles. It took 24 hours for the tellers to round up that many bills, so he returned the next day and took away the $100 stacks in a canvas bag. His oldest son, Daniel, who was 15 at the time, remembers the moment his father walked into the house and dumped the $10, 000 or so on a table. “It looked like he had robbed a bank,” he said. After a pause to let it all sink in, Mr. Parker began peeling off bills. He told them about taxes, set aside money for a tithe to their church and made a big pile for the house payment. The singles piled up for soccer and scouting and hamburger night. By the end, there wasn’t much left over. “I was trying to make as big of an impact as I could, and I definitely had their attention,” he said recently. Your children deserve to know what you make, too. It may sound improbable, but you can begin to initiate them when they’re as young as 5 or 6, building their knowledge slowly and giving them the real answer while they’re still teenagers. Handle it right, and it will be one of the most valuable lessons of their childhood. Here’s the bigger problem this helps to solve: Money is a source of mystery to children. They sense its power, so they ask questions, lots of them, over many years. Why isn’t our house as big as my cousin’s? Why can’t I have a carnivorous plant terrarium? Why should I respect my teachers if they earn only $60, 000 per year? (Real question!) Are we poor? Why didn’t you give money to the man who asked you for some? If my sister can have    Beats by Dre headphones, why won’t you get me the   Lego Mindstorms set? (It’s only $349, and it’s educational, Mom!) We adults, however, tend to do a miserable job of answering. We push our children’s money questions aside, sometimes telling them that their queries are impolite, or perhaps worrying that they will call out our own financial hypocrisy and errors. Sometimes we respond defensively and viscerally, barking back, “None of your business,” unintentionally teaching our children that the topic is off limits despite its obvious importance. Others want to protect their children from a topic many of us find stressful or baffling: Can’t we keep them innocent of all of this money stuff for just a little bit longer? But shielding children from the realities of everyday financial life makes little sense anymore, given the responsibilities their generation will face, starting with the outsize college tuitions they will encounter while still in high school. “It’s dangerous, like not telling them about how their bodies are going to change during puberty,” said Amanda Rose Adams, a mother of two in Fort Collins, Colo. “That’s how kids come out of college $100, 000 in debt with an English degree. ” Or not knowing how and why to start saving right away for retirement, or how to pick a health insurance plan. This does not mean that children are entitled to your tax returns the first time they ask how much you earn. Financial transparency comes only with readiness, as Joline Godfrey, a family financial education consultant, puts it, and it takes a decade or so to give them enough knowledge and context to make the information meaningful and for you to feel safe sharing it. Start by using the same, simple line every time your child asks you a money question: “Why do you ask?” Don’t say it with disapproval or defensiveness make it clear that you’re glad your child asked. This is a stalling tactic to give you time to think of an answer. (It also works well with questions about sex and drugs.) Even better, it can allow you to figure out exactly what is on your child’s mind. If two parents are fighting about money and a child overhears, it’s natural to wonder how much the family has or if it has enough. At that moment, it can be easy to reassure a child that the family is fine  —   if that’s true  —   and that the argument was merely about the best way to use what it does have. Still, when it comes to your children’s financial initiation, you don’t want to play defense, merely responding to their inquiries. Instead, you want to build their awareness slowly of how to build a household budget. Start with something that you spend money on regularly  —   anything, really. Children as young as 6 or 7 can begin to understand the grocery bill. They often tag along to the store or add to the wish list each week, so it’s a great opportunity to introduce the idea of wants and needs as you navigate the aisles. Some children even get in on the couponing, collecting a portion of the savings from the parents. This is all part of helping them answer basic family budget questions: What do we spend each month to cover the necessities, and what do we choose to spend on things that we merely want? Our spending isn’t a secret in the first place children see plenty. But watching us whip out plastic cards in the store or in front of the computer, completely out of context, may give them the wrong impression entirely, which is why it’s good to introduce them to all of the expenses before they are teenagers. Some parents start with even larger line items. Trisha Jones, a    mother in Norfolk, Va. sends her children, who are 6 and 8, to private school. Each month, she has them sit with her while she pays the tuition online, asking them to click the button. “We jokingly say that it costs $92. 50 to send them each to school every day,” she said, adding that they know that the daily number is akin to a nice Lego set. “But it’s a privilege to go to the school that they do, and we want them to know that we are making sacrifices to send them there. ” Other families focus on expenses that derive from the children’s extracurricular interests. When the local ballet studio raised prices just as her    daughter was increasing her commitment to dance, Rebecca Miller Goggins showed her the bills. A professional   who lives in Northampton, Mass. Ms. Goggins is used to being direct about money and gave her daughter the option of having one fewer lesson per week or cutting back elsewhere. Rather than reducing the number of lessons, her daughter started babysitting more and contributing money toward her pointe shoes. In the Adams house in Colorado, every line item in the budget is available for inspection by the children, who are 10 and 11. Each Sunday, the family reviews it. “You feel deprived if you’re not part of the   process,” said Ms. Adams, a program manager for a technology company. Her children are now involved in deciding on   too. Skipping dinner at the Vietnamese restaurant means more money in the Disneyland fund. One idea one of the children had: Rather than hang out at the Barnes  Noble after dinner, where spending temptations abound, they head to the public library. If your child knows how to use the Internet, you might be shocked by how much financial information about your family he or she may already possess. Search your home address: Did the approximate value of your home pop up? Mine, too, and it will happen when many children search their addresses for the first time and find the Zillow estimates. Once a child discovers this, it’s a quick step to looking up the address of every friend. Then comes research into salary information. If it can’t be found, the child may go looking through your belongings for your tax returns, as I did as a young snooper. At this point, you may be in a bit of a pickle. Information about household income and home values is   data it ought to stay in the family. But if you can’t control exactly when family members acquire some of it, you need to at least try to imprint the idea of discretion. The script can go something like this: We’re trusting you with this information because we want you to know where our income goes, and we expect you to show the same maturity with other information you’ve found yourself. The same principles apply with medical information, friends’ secrets and other private things. “We’ve had other issues that we’ve talked about that are private and confidential,” said Ms. Goggins, the   in Massachusetts. So she and her husband recently told their   and    daughters what they earn. “They’ve proven themselves. ” As will many children in middle and high school. Most of them don’t want their peers singling them out as having more or less than others, so they may try harder than you think to keep the information private. For some families, this advice will work only selectively. Ms. Adams, who wrote the book “Heart Warriors” about her son’s heart disease, shields him from knowledge of the family’s medical bills. Child patients often feel guilty for inconveniencing their families. Families who struggle generally, or are experiencing a period of unemployment, are naturally among the most reticent. Still, even the youngest generally understand when budgets have become tighter and want to know why. Pretending that there hasn’t been a reduction in income or some other difficult circumstance doesn’t help them. “If you are not talking to them, then they are drawing their own conclusions,” said Sara Solnick, an associate professor of economics at the University of Vermont who has written about social comparison. Leveling with them about the reality and how you’re managing it may help ease their fears. When Andrea Dutton and her husband separated and she moved with her    daughter and    son to a smaller house in Gainesville, Fla. she addressed the matter simply. “I’m not apologizing to them about it,” she said. “I want them to realize that the right decision is not always the easy one. I’d rather have them see that you can do the right thing and get out of a bad situation even if it means taking a hit financially. ” Keep in mind that if you are planning on applying for financial aid for college, you will have no choice but to disclose your financial information when your child is a senior in high school. That’s because anyone who wants financial aid must fill out a form called the Fafsa. It asks for information about income and assets. Parents sign it, and so must the students everyone attests to the accuracy of the information. Coming clean about income and assets can pose special challenges if you are truly wealthy you may worry that children will flaunt their good fortune or think they never have to work. But you don’t get a pass: If you don’t work (or don’t work much) older children will wonder how the family affords its life. At the very least, it’s worth trying some starter exercises, like showing your children the details of what a vacation or a second home actually costs. Explain, too, that it requires a great deal of money to throw off whatever dividends and interest contribute to the family budget, and that the investments that do so may not last or may not fall to the next generation if the children don’t make something of themselves in college and beyond. Given the near inevitability that parents will have to disclose their incomes or their children will find out some other way, it’s best to think of that moment of revelation and the years leading up to it as opportunities. For those of us who have at least a little bit more than what we need to scrape by, what we spend says a lot about what we stand for how we determine value is a reflection of our values. The same is true for whatever we have left over each month. How much do we save? Why does it fluctuate? Who has helped us, what do we give to people who have less, and why don’t we give more? It’s impossible to answer these questions for children with conviction and clarity if they don’t know the size of the number at the beginning of the equation. When Mr. Parker came home with his big bag of money from Wells Fargo 20 years ago, he was acting as much on reflex as anything else. “I just remember distinctly that I never knew myself growing up, and I felt it was a big disadvantage,” he said. “I had no idea what it would take to take care of a family. ” That night, the lessons couldn’t have been clearer: The family’s life was expensive. Every decision mattered. Savings and faith were high priorities. And there wasn’t much left at the end of the month. His son, Daniel, is now an adult and has two small children. He and his wife intend to share their financial information with their children as they grow. “He had little tolerance for entitlement in any of us,” Daniel said of his father. Scott Parker did have confidence that his children would know what to do with the information he had literally dumped onto the table. “I wasn’t swearing anyone to secrecy,” he said. “But I can tell you, it never became an issue. I figure that whatever the risk was, it was worth it. ”",0
4213,Can the American People Defeat the Oligarchy That Rules Them?,"Email 
Aren’t you surprised that Hillary and the presstitutes haven’t blamed Putin for FBI director Comey’s reopening of the Hillary email case? But the presstitutes have done the next best thing for Hillary. They have made Comey the issue, not Hillary. 
According to US Senator Harry Reid and the presstitutes, we don’t need to worry about Hillary’s crimes. After all, she is only a political woman feathering her nest, just as political men have done for ages. Why all this misogynist talk about Hillary? The presstitutes’ cry is that Comey’s alleged crime is far more important. This woman-hating Republican violated the Hatch Act by telling Congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened. A very strange interpretation of the Hatch Act. During an election it is OK to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not OK to say that a candidate is under investigation. 
In July 2016 Comey violated the Hatch Act when he, on orders from the corrupt Obama Attorney General, announced Hillary clean. In so doing, Comey used the prestige of federal clearance of Hillary’s violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls. 
Actually, Hillary’s standing in the polls is based on the pollsters over-weighting Hillary supporters in the polls. It is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions. If you look at the crowds attending the two candidate’s public appearances, it is clear that the American people prefer Donald Trump, who is opposed to war with Russia and China. War with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election. 
Hillary’s problem has the ruling American Oligarcy, for which Hillary is the total servant, concerned. What are they going to do about Trump if he wins? Will his fate be the same as John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, George Wallace? Time will tell. Or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the Oligarchy got rid of Dominique Strauss-Kahn? 
All of the American and Western feminists, progressives, and left-wing remnant fell for the obvious frame-up of Strauss-Kahn. After Strauss-Kahn was blocked from the Presidency of France and resigned as Director of the IMF, the New York authorities had to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn. But Washington had succeeded in putting its French vassal, Sarkozy, in the presidency of France. 
This is how the American Oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests. The corrupt self-serving Oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media, the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities, and, of course, through the presstitutes, Americans’ minds. 
The Oligarchs are now hard-pressed to rescue Hillary as US president, so let’s see if the Oligarchs can once again deceive the American people. 
While we wait, let’s concern ourselves with another important issue. The Clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the 20th century allowed a small handful of mega-corporations to consolidate the US media in a few hands. This vast increase in the power of the Oligarchy was accomplished despite US anti-trust law. The media mergers destroyed the American tradition of a dispersed and independent media. 
But really, what does federal law mean to the One Percent. Nothing whatsoever. The One Percent’s power makes them immune to law. Hillary’s crimes might cost her the election, but she won’t go to jail. 
Not content with 90% control of the US media, the Oligarchy wants more concentration and more control. Looks like they will be getting it, thanks to the corrupt US government. The Federal Trade Commission is supposed to enforce US anti-trust law. Instead, the federal agency routinely violates US anti-trust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests. 
Because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law, we now have “banks too big to fail,” unregulated Internet monopoly, and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media. 
Not so long ago there was a field of economics known as anti-trust. Ph.D. candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power. I assume that this field of economics, like the America of my youth, no longer exists. 
Rahul Manchanda explains that “yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate, to create another gargantuan media outlet, in another consolidation of the enormous power, money, wealth, intimidation, conspiracy and control” that eviscerates the US Constitution and the First Amendment.

4214,‘Systemic’ Lapses Found in Escape of 2 Killers From Dannemora Prison - The New York Times,"The two murderers who escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility last year intentionally picked a Friday night when they knew an officer named Ronald Blair was on duty. They had watched him for months, recording his movements on a calendar and knew he never made the   rounds he was supposed to. They were right: Officer Blair did not discover them missing until hours after they had made it through the tunnels under the prison and climbed out a manhole to freedom. Officer Blair’s failure was just one of scores of serious security lapses detailed in a report released on Monday by state investigators to coincide with the first anniversary of the escape at the maximum security state prison in northern New York. The breakout touched off a   manhunt that drew nationwide attention to the dense woods around Dannemora, home to the prison. The   report from the state inspector general, Catherine Leahy Scott, documented a host of “systemic deficiencies” that gave the two men, Richard W. Matt and David Sweat, time and space to plan and execute an intricate and sophisticated prison break. At the start of overnight shifts, guards would falsify records to make it appear as if they were conducting rounds when they were in fact not instead, officers acknowledged to investigators that they would read books or play crossword puzzles, the report said. “We’d get lazy,” said Officer Blair, according to the report. As a result, Mr. Sweat was able to spend 85 nights outside his cell exploring the tunnels beneath the prison in search of an escape route. That added up to about 400 compulsory bed checks, the report said, that should have been carried out by guards, who never once noticed his absence. Three months before the escape, a random search of Mr. Matt’s cell failed to detect an 18       hole in the rear wall. Tools were left unsecured in the tunnels, allowing Mr. Sweat to obtain an   sledgehammer that he pounded away with underneath the prison for over a month. “I couldn’t have asked for anything better,” Mr. Sweat later told investigators. The two murderers took six months to plan their escape, beginning in January 2015. “Just one properly performed night round during this monthslong period would have foiled the escape,” the report said. Night after night, Mr. Sweat, whom the report described as the mastermind, left a dummy in his bed and slipped out a hole cut in the back of his cell. He climbed down five stories using piping along the walls and spent hours exploring tunnels beneath the prison looking for a way out. The two inmates eventually crawled out through a steam pipe. Over 1, 000 law enforcement officials chased down leads from the Canadian to the Mexican borders. In the end, they never made it far. Mr. Matt was shot and killed about 40 miles from the prison Mr. Sweat was caught just days later after he was shot and wounded by a New York state trooper. While the broad contours of the events leading to the escape have been known for months, the report for the first time constructs a coherent narrative, in detail, from when the men hatched their plan to the moment Mr. Sweat and Mr. Matt emerged from a manhole, carrying a guitar case filled with assorted clothes, 20 packs of peanuts, 40 granola bars and a dozen sticks of pepperoni. Investigators from the inspector general’s office interviewed 170 people for the report, including corrections officers, their supervisors and inmates. They also conducted extensive interrogations of Mr. Sweat, who was put into solitary confinement at Five Points Correctional Facility after his capture. In response to the findings, the State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said it had instituted a number of reforms at Clinton, including installing new security cameras, disciplining employees involved and appointing a new superintendent. Crucial to the escape plot was the assistance of Gene Palmer, an officer, and Joyce E. Mitchell, a civilian employee who was a supervisor at the prison tailor shop where both Mr. Sweat and Mr. Matt had worked. Ms. Mitchell, described in the report as a lonely   women with a shaky marriage, acknowledged to investigators that she allowed herself to be seduced by Mr. Sweat and her belief that “a younger guy would actually like an older woman. ” Mr. Sweat told investigators that he became aware that Ms. Mitchell harbored “some kind of star lust thing in her mind where she was like in love with me,” and sought to manipulate her. For months, Ms. Mitchell had been smuggling them food, including packages of cookies,   bags of Café Bustelo coffee and 70 containers of black and cayenne pepper that the inmates planned to use to throw off tracking dogs. In time they persuaded her to bring in tools for their escape. She bought six hacksaw blades for about $6 from Walmart and was able to smuggle them into the prisons because her bag was not searched, the report said. She gave them to Mr. Matt, “who carried them to his cell taped to his side under his shirt,” being careful to avoid metal detectors. In the weeks that followed, she hid two chisels, a steel punch, two concrete drill bits and two additional hacksaw blades in frozen ground beef that she gave to Mr. Palmer for delivery to the inmates. Both Mr. Palmer and Ms. Mitchell later pleaded guilty to aiding the inmates. Ms. Mitchell was sentenced to up to seven years in prison Mr. Palmer received six months in jail. The inspector general’s office has referred the findings of their investigation to the Clinton County district attorney’s office for potential additional criminal charges. After obtaining the tools from Mr. Palmer and Ms. Mitchell, the two inmates took about three weeks to cut holes in the rear walls of their cells, working from 6:30 to 8 p. m. while other inmates were at recreation or in the mess hall, the report said. Mr. Sweat said that the first night he climbed out of his cell he was surprised at the almost complete lack of security in the tunnels below the prison. Inspections were supposed to be done quarterly, but there had not been one since September 2014. During the months he toiled in the tunnels, Mr. Sweat lost 30 pounds. He said he loved his nights out. “You kind of felt free,” he told investigators, adding that he would leave his prison ID behind in the cell “so I didn’t feel like an inmate anymore. ” “I was having a hell of a time,” he said. He carried his escape tools in a tote bag he had sewed in the tailor shop out of the green fabric used for prison uniforms. Mr. Sweat said he had a particular dislike for Officer Blair, the regular night shift officer, and hoped that because of the escape he would face disciplinary charges. It worked: Officer Blair and a second guard on duty that night, Thomas Renadette, were among nine officers suspended after the escape. Both officers retired from the department in March, according to state comptroller records. The night before the escape, Mr. Sweat made a trial run, according to the report, finding his way through the tunnels to a manhole cover outside the prison. He lifted it up, “just enough to confirm his location on a village street,” the report said. “I actually had my head out into freedom,” he told investigators. He then “hastened back to his cell and advised Matt that the escape route was complete,” the report said. It was about 4 a. m. on June 5. To celebrate, the two men smoked a Marlboro in their cells. A little before midnight the next night, they left for good. Mr. Matt put a handwritten note on a table in his cell: “You left me no choice but to grow old and die in here. I had to do something. ” And a second note on a picture of Tony Soprano: “Time to go kid. ” It was not until 5:17 a. m. on June 6 that Officer Blair finally did a round of bed checks and noticed the killers were gone. “I grabbed the sheet and I almost threw up, then saw the dummy,” he told investigators. He set off in a “dead run” to tell his supervisor, the report said, but on the way, he was so worked up, he fell down the stairs.",0
4215,Pennsylvania’s Attorney General Is Convicted on All Counts - The New York Times,"NORRISTOWN, Pa.  —   She was a rising Democratic star. She was the first in her party to be elected state attorney general. She was one of the most powerful women in Pennsylvania. But on Monday night, Kathleen G. Kane, the state’s top prosecutor, became a convicted criminal. Update: Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane resigned Tuesday. A jury found Ms. Kane, 50, guilty of nine criminal charges, including perjury and criminal conspiracy, convicting her of leaking grand jury information, and then lying about it, in an effort to discredit a political rival. Ms. Kane was caught up in a web of scandal and counterscandal, threaded with lewd emails, political rivalries and alleged leaks. It has cost other state officials, including two State Supreme Court justices, their jobs and Ms. Kane her law license, although she has remained on the job as attorney general. Ms. Kane stared straight ahead as the word “guilty,” uttered decisively by a juror in a flowered dress, echoed nine times around the courtroom. The lawyers immediately went into a private conference with the judge, leaving Ms. Kane, who campaigned on a promise to uncover political interference in Pennsylvania, alone at the defense table. And when Judge Wendy   returned to the courtroom, she turned directly to Ms. Kane with a stern warning, her words slicing through the silence. “There is to be absolutely no retaliation of any kind against any witness in this case, either by your own devices, from your own mouth or your hand, or directing anybody to do anything,” the judge said. She threatened Ms. Kane, who is currently free on bail, with immediate incarceration if she failed to comply. “Is that clear, Ms. Kane?” the judge asked. “Yes it is, your honor,” Ms. Kane said. After the verdict, Gov. Tom Wolf immediately renewed his call for her to step down. “The Office of Attorney General and its employees, as well as the people of Pennsylvania deserve to move on,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. Gerald Shargel, a lawyer for Ms. Kane, said a decision about her job would be made in the coming days. Ms. Kane was elected in 2012. The first half of her tenure was marked with moments that she claimed as successes, like closing a loophole in gun laws. But she soon became embroiled in scandal, in a state with a rich history of them. “It turns on the perception that she abused her power. She is the chief law enforcement officer for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” said David Zellis, a former prosecutor in Bucks County who has observed the trial but is not involved. He added, “I think that it’s turned the whole criminal justice system in the state upside down. ” To her detractors, she had abused her power and broken the law to her supporters, she had rousted the state’s  ’ network and become a victim herself. But in court, she was silent: Though her defense team   the prosecution’s witnesses, it rested without calling a single one of its own. Ms. Kane, who faced nine charges, including two felony perjury counts, criminal conspiracy and obstruction, was accused of leaking secret grand jury documents to the news media in an effort to discredit the prosecutor Frank Fina, and then lying to cover it up. “‘This is war,’ the defendant’s words,” said the lead prosecutor, Kevin Steele, in reference to an email written by Ms. Kane. “Wars have casualties. Wars leave scars. ” Earlier Monday, in a nearly   closing statement, wrought with text messages, newspaper front pages and grand jury testimony, Mr. Steele painted a picture of Ms. Kane trying to “go on the offensive” after a newspaper article that criticized her for shutting down an undercover investigation into possible corruption by Democratic state representatives. Prosecutors say she believed Mr. Fina was behind the story. Ms. Kane, he said, sought to leak details from a 2009 grand jury investigation into the financial affairs of J. Whyatt Mondesire, a former leader of the N. A. A. C. P. because she wanted residents to know that Mr. Fina had chosen not to prosecute. She then lied about it when a grand jury investigated, Mr. Steele said. A defense lawyer, Seth Farber, said the state had not proved its case, urging the jurors not to take Ms. Kane’s words out of context. “Things that the commonwealth says do not hold up to scrutiny when you look at the actual evidence,” Mr. Farber said, and cast blame instead on two prosecution witnesses: Adrian King, a former deputy to Ms. Kane, and Josh Morrow, a political strategist who was given immunity to testify. “Those are two witnesses who will say whatever they need to in order to protect themselves,” Mr. Farber said, adding, “You would not even buy a used car from one of them. ” Ms. Kane was elected after she campaigned with a promise to review the investigation into Jerry Sandusky, the assistant football coach for Penn State who was convicted of sexual abuse, which was led by the attorney general at the time, Tom Corbett, and Mr. Fina. She did not find evidence of political interference, but Ms. Kane did find that lewd and racist emails had been exchanged by state officials, and began to release them to the news media. She has said that some in the state’s   political establishment have concocted her political difficulties to retaliate for the disclosures and to prevent more emails from being leaked. Judge   limited discussion of those emails at the request of prosecutors  —   a point to which Ms. Kane’s lead attorney, Mr. Shargel, seemed to allude after he left the courtroom. “We have been denied the opportunity to mount a full defense,” said Mr. Shargel. Outside the courthouse, Michelle Henry, a prosecutor in the case, said she was “offended” by Ms. Kane’s crimes. “What she did while she was attorney general  —   the fact that she committed criminal acts when she’s the top prosecutor  —   is a disgrace,” Ms. Henry said. The judge has not yet set a sentencing hearing, but Ms. Kane could face prison time. The two felony perjury charges alone each carry up to seven years in prison.",0

4217,Russia Has Shot From 124th to 40th in 'Ease of Doing Business',"The Central Bank sees Russia’s moving up in the Doing Business rating as a good sign, Deputy CEO of the Central Bank Vladimir Chistyukhin told reporters. 
""That is a very significant leap and a very positive sign for us. It shows that the efforts we made in many fields, in particular in corporate management were not in vain,"" he said. 
Earlier this week it was reported that Russia moved up to the 40th position in the Doing Business-2017 rating, which is annually prepared by the World Bank. 
In 2012, Russia ranked 124th in that rating. 
In his May decrees issued in 2012 President Vladimir Putin set the task for the country to reach the 20th position in the rating of the World Bank by 2018. 
In 2016, Russia was on the 51st place in the Doing Business rating. 
However the methods of calculation of the World Bank’s rating changed earlier this year. Taking into account these changes Russia could have been on the 36th place already in 2015.  ",0

Tulsa, OK — (RT) Live footage has emerged on Facebook of a convicted felon stealing an unlocked police cruiser from outside a coffee shop in Oklahoma and taking it for a 40-minute joyride to his parents’ house. 
John Pinney, 25, is alleged to have taken the police vehicle from a parking spot on Halloween night, after a Tulsa Police Department officer left her keys inside while she went on an 8pm coffee break, reports CBS News . 
Oklahoma man Pinney is said to have then led police on a 40 minute chase across the state, using the police officer’s iPad to livestream the incident from inside the vehicle. 
Part of the livestream remains public on Pinney’s Facebook page and shows the 25-year-old singing to the “sh*t I want to go out to” while racing away from state police in one of their own vehicles. 
At one point Pinney appears to play with the sirens on the car while wishing viewers a “Happy Halloween.” 
“This is my last video for sure, probably. I don’t even know where the f**k I’m going, honestly. 
“I’m trying to learn how to work all these lights and stuff,” Pinney tells the camera. “I can’t believe I’m doing this for real. I’m driving with my knees right now trying to show you all this.” 
Tulsa police sergeant Steve Stoltz told reporters that the joyride prompted the response of “multiple agencies” and saw the suspect reach speeds of over 120mph before his arrest. 
“The suspect was seen [driving] at high speed towards Sand Springs [Oklahoma] and then went north. The vehicle was eventually located by Skiatook Police Department, who initiated pursuit. The suspect, at high speeds, led them to an address… turned out that was where the suspect’s parents were,” Stoltz said.

Pinney has since been charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, eluding and resisting arrest, as well as the possession of a firearm. Share",0
4219,"Potential Conflicts Around the Globe for Trump, the Businessman President - The New York Times","MANILA  —   On Thanksgiving Day, a Philippine developer named Jose E. B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila’s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for. In October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila’s financial district  —   a   symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan “Live Above the Rest. ” And now his partner on the project, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States. After the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the  ’s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio’s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including   resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio’s son Robbie Antonio said. “We will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,” the elder Mr. Antonio, one of the richest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his   celebration in Manila. Mr. Antonio’s combination of jobs  —   he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the    —   is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table. Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged “a separation” from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years’ time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration. Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America’s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family’s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite. “It is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,” said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department. The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump’s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What’s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump’s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders. In an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business  —   and his family’s ability to keep it running after he takes office. “I’ve built a very great company and it’s a big company and it’s all over the world,” Mr. Trump said, adding later: “I don’t care about my company. It doesn’t matter. My kids run it. ” In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings. “Vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both   Trump, his adult children and his executives,” she said. But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies. In Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro  —   one of Mr. Trump’s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake  —   is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project. Several of Mr. Trump’s real estate ventures in India  —   where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America  —   are being built through companies with family ties to India’s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump’s projects, including pressuring   banks to extend favorable loans. In Ireland and Scotland, executives from Mr. Trump’s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization’s plans to build a   sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail’s habitat  —   a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States. And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump’s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan  —   suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup  —   the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump’s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests. Mr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. “I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,” he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. “It’s a tremendously successful job. It’s called Trump Towers  —   two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It’s two. ” These tangled ties already have some members of Congress  —   including at least one Republican representative  —   calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them. “You rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,” Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. “If you have contracts   govts, it’s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp” David J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump’s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency  —   and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad. “This will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,” Mr. Kramer said. Even if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president’s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials. “The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,” said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. “They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world. ” At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump’s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies. Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president? What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump’s business interests and his transition effort, with the   or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization’s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders  —   of Turkey, Argentina and Japan  —   having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide. Mr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team. Federal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially the president is exempt from most    laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels. “I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O. K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can’t help that, but I don’t care,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “The only thing that matters to me is running our country. ”  Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in. “Let’s listen and not prejudge,” said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. “I want to see what he does as president. ” Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny Donald Trump Jr. the  ’s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish   beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a    nightclub. “This is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,” the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time. But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the   in their dealings in Latin America’s largest country. Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Brasília, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio. The Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds  —   Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a   information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State  —   put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra. Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil’s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries. But Brazil’s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades. The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where   were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic. The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of “highly suspicious” potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. “It is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,” Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October. In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large   banks and energy companies. Mr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of João Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil’s   military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently. In a statement, Mr. Trump’s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry. Alan Garten, the Trump Organization’s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company  —   given that it does not own the hotel  —   and “has no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry. ” The investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister José Serra, Brazil’s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a “nightmare. ” Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the  . Even if Brazil’s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent. “Brazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that’s about all they can do,” said Maurício Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “This is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years. ” Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles On the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing. In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state’s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization’s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed. The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump’s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a   meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were “requesting a concession that could not be given. ” By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump’s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after. “He thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,” Mr. Chavan said. Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai, the Trump Organization’s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor. “The notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,” Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. “The Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects   interacting with government officials related to its projects in India. ” This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians  —   officially or unofficially  —   to push projects through the bureaucracy. Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats “whose main goal in life is to attract rent,” said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India. One of Mr. Trump’s projects, Trump Towers Pune, is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country’s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad. In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest   black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs. It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official. Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans. Top officials might “think in some way the U. S. president will help them,” and “can put in a friendly word with the banks” to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure. “If the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,” he said. “They will think the president is meeting them. ” Another pitfall is that Donald Trump’s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits. Mr. Trump’s first projects in India, which are expected to increase in number over the next year, follow this pattern: His partner for Trump Towers Pune is Panchshil Realty, owned by a family that has a close and longstanding family relationship with one of the state’s most powerful politicians, Sharad Pawar, the head of the small but influential Nationalist Congress Party. (Mr. Trump was photographed  —   in an image distributed on Twitter but since taken down  —   with executives from Panchshil Realty on Nov. 15.) Mr. Pawar’s daughter, Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, holds a 2 percent share in Panchshil’s parent company, she said in an interview. Mr. Trump’s partner in the Trump Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party  —   currently the governing party in Parliament  —   in Maharashtra State. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the United States government it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the American government for 3. 75 billion rupees, almost $70 million. His partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the    of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. Mr. Mittal, in an interview, has denied having any connection with the real estate company. Suraj Hegde, the secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Mr. Trump and his family would play in Indian affairs  —   particularly given real estate’s important role in India’s   economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage. “Basically this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,” Mr. Hegde said in an interview. He added that he was already calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Mr. Trump’s real estate ventures in India. “Establishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. Trump is very worrisome,” he said. “This is not at all healthy for a democracy. ” Mixing Business, Politics and Islam Mr. Trump’s business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician. As a candidate, Mr. Trump railed against moving American jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company here, making luxury furniture in the firm’s factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide  —   a partnership that apparently remains active. Mr. Trump the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Mr. Trump the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan. One of the most visible   symbols of that contradiction is in the bustling commercial district of Sisli, on the European side of Istanbul, where a pair of cantilevered modernist towers, nearly 40 stories high, bear Mr. Trump’s name. Turkey’s leader, Mr. Erdogan, visited Trump Towers Istanbul  —   one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two  —   after their completion in 2012, with Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump appearing as part of the celebration the next day. “We look forward to this being the first of many   developments undertaken together in Istanbul and throughout Turkey,” Mr. Trump said in a statement issued during the visit. Beyond real estate, there is the Trump Organization’s 2013 partnership with Dorya International, a luxury furniture maker with a factory in Manisa Province, near the city of Izmir,  to build pieces sold under the Trump Home Collection. But the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Mr. Trump in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat. “We regret and condemn Trump’s discriminatory remarks,” Bulent Kural, the manager of the Trump Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Mr. Trump’s name. “Such statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the Trump family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the Trump brand. ” Mr. Erdogan weighed in on the issue, too, saying, “The ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it. ” Mr. Trump’s next move helped   his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Mr. Erdogan’s crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to “fix our own mess” before trying to alter the behavior of other nations. “I don’t think we have a right to lecture,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. “Look at what is happening in our country,” he added, referring to violence in the United States. “How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?” In between his two remarks  —   one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him  —   the calls for the renaming of the Trump Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers. Turkey is a key player in United States efforts to combat the Islamic State in the Middle East, and sits next door to Syria as the United States has armed rebel groups in an attempt to remove Syria’s president, Bashar   from power. The recent postelection telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed. According to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Mr. Trump told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter  —   who participated in the call  —   admired both Mr. Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Mr. Trump’s business associate in the towers, whom he called “a close friend. ” Ms. Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. “I’m of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,” she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump declined to comment about the call. Jennifer Harris, who served on the staff of the National Intelligence Council and on the State Department’s policy planning staff, said the twin hats that Mr. Trump and his family would be wearing in Turkey would almost certainly complicate the jobs of American diplomats there. “It makes me wonder if the Trump administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,” she said. What Stance Toward Duterte? President Duterte’s antidrug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists  —   and the Obama administration. In August, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States was “very deeply concerned” about reports of “extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities of individuals who are suspected to have been in drug activity in the Philippines. ” She added, “We have also made our concerns known. ” The question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the Trump administration will take as Mr. Trump and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands. Mr. Antonio first met Mr. Trump casually in the 1990s and has been his business partner in the Philippines for five years. President Duterte named him special envoy to the United States as the Philippines angrily pushed back at President Obama for criticizing his deadly campaign. At the time of the appointment, Mrs. Clinton was leading in the polls in the United States presidential election. Mr. Duterte has made clear that he does not appreciate American meddling in his country’s domestic affairs. “I am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,” Mr. Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Mr. Obama that never took place. “I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody. ” Mr. Duterte handpicked Mr. Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to China and the Philippine president’s “deep intuition about people. ” The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Mr. Abella added, because Mr. Trump already knows Mr. Antonio. Even before Mr. Trump has been sworn in, Mr. Antonio flew to New York and visited Trump Tower, where he met with Mr. Trump’s children, who are executives at the Trump Organization  —   which oversees the  ’s real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, Robbie Antonio, Mr. Antonio’s son and the managing director of the family business, said in an interview. The two families are considering new ventures as they finish work on the Trump Tower in Makati City, a financial center within metropolitan Manila that is one of the country’s wealthiest enclaves and home to many of the nation’s elite. The $150 million tower  —   one of the tallest in the Philippines  —   is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila’s most notorious   district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations. “We are bringing Trump to the Philippines because we believe that Trump exemplifies the best quality of real estate anywhere in the world,” Mr. Antonio said in a 2011 video promoting the project  —   in which Mr. Antonio is identified as “ambassador” and Mr. Trump also appears. “It also exemplifies luxury and it exemplifies exclusivity. ” In the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father’s priorities: He will put the Philippines’ interests above those of his company. “It is for the good of the country now,” he said. But Mr. Fuchs, who helped oversee United States relations with the Philippines as the deputy assistant secretary of state until early this year, said he was deeply troubled by Mr. Trump’s overlapping priorities, particularly given the long list of globally significant issues in play with the Philippines. These include planned joint military exercises in the South China Sea, the fight against militant Islamic groups based in the country’s southern islands, and the human rights abuses taking place. “What we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,” Mr. Fuchs said. “The biggest gray area may not be a President Trump himself advocating for favors for the Trump Organization. It’s the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the Trump Organization’s interests. It is seriously disturbing. ” Over a Tiny Snail, Big Concerns The vertigo angustior snail is only two millimeters long. But it punches above its weight. The endangered little snail has helped stall Mr. Trump’s plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his Trump International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare. Environmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Mr. Trump’s organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings. The battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said. The planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the Trump situation, which could involve a public hearing. “They can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,” said Sean O’Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country’s professional planners. He noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build. “The scale is slightly different,” he said. Local officials have said the Trump Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was “considering all potential coastal protection options at present” and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, “is thriving on the site. ” “Its only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,” it added. Certainly, Mr. Trump’s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the  ’s mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he urged a group of “Brexit” campaigners led by Nigel Farage, the head of the U. K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Mr. Trump’s in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts. After a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump initially denied that the matter had been raised with Mr. Farage’s group, Mr. Trump conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that “I might have brought it up. ” Tony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. Trump had once called him because Mr. Lowes’s group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. Trump’s Irish course on environmental grounds. “He certainly hates wind farms, that’s for sure,” Mr. Lowes said about the call. His group decided against working with Mr. Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall. “The dune system will not be able to develop naturally,” Mr. Lowes said. “It will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die. ” He added, “The whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that. ” Mr. Trump’s representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from a continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previously attracted attention because an   statement submitted by Mr. Trump’s team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on “coastal erosion rates. ” That was a noteworthy claim, since Mr. Trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated “by and for the Chinese. ” The Irish government has zealously courted Mr. Trump. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor. Malachy Clerkin of The Irish Times called it “a preposterous welcome” and “the worst kind of  . ” Many locals, however, support Mr. Trump’s development. Hugh McNally, the owner of Morrissey’s Bar in Doonbeg Village, about two miles from the course, said the issue had been “sensationalized by the media” because of the Trump connection. “I’ll give you an example,” he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it would close a plant in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. “If someone told them you’d save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,” he said. “The only reason people are objecting here is because of Trump. ” A Transition and a Business Plan Mr. Trump’s family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe. In April, even before Mr. Trump had secured the Republican nomination, his business moved to trademark the name American Idea for use in branding hotels, spas and concierge services, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It was one of more than two dozen trademark applications that Mr. Trump and members of his family filed in the United States and around the world while he was running for president. The applications offer a glimpse of where the Trumps may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the Trump Organization in Indonesia, where Mr. Trump has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the Trump name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union. Ivanka Trump has filed at least 25 trademark registrations for her brand of clothing, cosmetics and jewelry in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Mexico since the beginning of the year, most recently in October. Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, filed an American trademark application for a line of jewelry in August. As he prepares for the presidency, Mr. Trump has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times this past week. “In theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,” Mr. Trump said, before later adding, “but I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that’s happening right now. ”",0
4220,Russia’s Most Potent Weapon? Rapidly “Hoarding Gold” As Global Currency War Is Upon Us,"Russia’s Most Potent Weapon? Rapidly “Hoarding Gold” As Global Currency War Is Upon Us Posted on Home » Gold » Gold News » Russia’s Most Potent Weapon? Rapidly “Hoarding Gold” As Global Currency War Is Upon Us 
The Next World War Will Be Fought With Gold… 

by Jay Syrmopoulos. The Free Thought Project via SHTFPlan : 
Editor’s Comment: He who holds the gold makes the rules? Fresh attempts at containing Russia and continuing the empire have been met with countermoves. Russia appears to be building strength in every way. Putin and his country have no intention of being under the American thumb, and are developing rapid resistance as the U.S. petrodollar loses its grip and China, Russia and the East shift into new currencies and shifting world order. 
What lies ahead? It will be a strong hand for the countries that have the most significant backing in gold and hard assets; and China and Russia have positioned themselves very well. Prepare for a changing economic landscape, and one in which self-reliance might be all we have. 
Russia is Hoarding Gold at an Alarming Rate — The Next World War Will Be Fought with Currencies 
by Jay Syrmopoulos 
With all eyes on Russia’s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the “SATAN” missile, as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow’s most potent “weapon” may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical “weapon” brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia’s native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order – potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift – and much sooner than you might think. 

The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia’s national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed “reset” in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn’t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report: 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led “resistance bloc” breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led “Washington Consensus.” 
For those who don’t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system’s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book “Currency Wars,” wrote that “Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.” Rickards believes a “strong turnaround” is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation’s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman’s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are “an integral part of the state policy” in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia’s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia’s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia’s state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider: 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold’s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick’s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It’s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country’s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. 
Rickards, in his 2011 book “Currency Wars,” theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it’s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. 
Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF’s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it’s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall – thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it’s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a “weapon.” 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
It’s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the “rights” of corporations over that of people .

4221,"If Cannabis Can Kill “Incurable” Brain Cancer, Why Is It Criminalized? (VIDEO)","in: Medical & Health , Multimedia , Natural Medicine , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests Cannabis contains a compound that may kill brain cancers that chemotherapy and radiation can’t touch, so why isn’t it being used today? In recent years, we’ve focused heavily on educating our readers about the still relatively unknown role that cancer stem cells play in cancer, both in terms of conventional cancer treatment failure and the exceptionally promising role that natural interventions play in targeting these highly malignant cells. It is encouraging to witness a growing awareness that cancer has been completely misunderstood , and that in order to make progress against the global epidemic we will have to go back to the wisdom of the ancients by using foods and spices instead of toxic chemicals and radiation to fight a disease that should be classified more as a survival mechanism unmasked than an inexorably lethal, genetically-driven condition . Even the National Cancer Institute now admits that it had been wrong for decades about “early stage” breast ( DCIS ) and prostate (HGPIN) “cancers,” and that they should be reclassified as indolent or benign lesions of epithelial origin, i.e. not “cancer” at all! Essentially, therefore, millions were overdiagnosed and overtreated for cancers they never had. Even now, despite this admission, the vast majority of conventional doctors have yet to account for, acknowledge, or integrate this radically different definition of cancer and its implications for treatment into their “standard of care.” Only last week, we featured a new review on natural therapies that target cancer stem cells , many of which included common foods and spices. You can view it here. But one substance conspicuously absent from the list was cannabis , which is the herb we now turn to to give it a fair representation in the context of this topic. A recent article published in the Journal Neuroimmune Pharmacology titled, “ The Antitumor Activity of Plant-Derived Non-Psychoactive Cannabinoids ,” reviewed the therapeutic potential of a non-psychoactive class of phytochemicals found in cannabis known as cannabinoids . Unlike THC, cannabinoids do not activate the cannabinoid 1 and cannabinoid 2 receptors in the central nervous system in any significant way, making their activity less controversial as they do not produce changes in perception and sensation associated with “recreational” and/or “psychedelic” drugs. There are actually over 60 cannabinoids in cannabis, but the second most abundant one, cannabidiol (CBD), has been found to inhibit and/or kill a wide range of cancers in the animal model, including gliobastoma (a difficult-to-treat type of brain cancer), breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer. There have been a wide range of mechanisms identified behind these observed anti-tumor activities, including anti-angiogenic (preventing new blood vessel formation), anti-metastatic, anti-cell viability, but the one we wish to focus on in this report is its ability to to inhibit the stem-like potential of cancer cells. Stem cells are unique within the body as they are capable of continual self-renewal, theoretically making them immortal relative to regular body cells (somatic cells), which die after a fixed number or replication cycles. In their normal state of function they are essential for healing and bodily regeneration, as they are capable of differentiating into the wide range of cells that make up the body and need to be regularly replaced when damaged. This so-called pluripotent property of stem cells is also observed in tumor formation and maintenance, as cancer stem cells are capable of producing the entire range of different cells that make up a tumor colony. Unlike regular tumor cells, cancer stem cells are uniquely tumorigenic because they are capable of breaking off from an existing lesion or tumor and forming a new tumor colony of cells. In this sense, they are “mother cells” at the heart of cancer malignancy, whose ability to colonize other tissues by producing all the “daughter cells” necessary to form a new tumor make their existence highly concerning from the perspective of cancer prevention and treatment. Radiation and chemotherapy, while capable of reducing the size of a tumor, actually enrich the post-treatment residual lesion or tumor with higher levels of cancer stem cells , and in some cases transform non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells , ultimately making the post-treatment state of the treated tissue far worse than its pre-treatment condition. This is why identifying and using natural, safe, effective and affordable ways to target cancer stem cells versus the non-tumorigenic tumor cells in a lesion or tumor is the only rational way to treat cancer, and should be the primary focus of present day cancer treatment approaches. The new review discussed the way that cannabidiol targets and/or inhibits the cancer stem cell subpopulation in cancers such as the highly treatment-resistant form of brain cancer known as glioblastoma, which is widely considered by conventional medicine as “incurable.” A 2013 study, 1 mentioned in the review, found that patient-derived glioblastoma cells when exposed to cannabidiol saw a significant down-regulation of the genetic tumor marker Id-1, which has been closely correlated with brain cancer cell invasiveness. They also found that cannabidiol was capable of inhibiting neurosphere formation (a sign of cancer stem cell tumor formation), as well as was capable of inhibiting glioblastoma tumor invasiveness in an animal model. The results of this preclinical study were so compelling that the researchers concluded cannibidiol might make an ideal adjunct treatment: With its lack of systemic toxicity and psychoactivity, cannabidiol is an ideal candidate agent in this regard and may prove useful in combination with front-line agents for the treatment of patients with aggressive and high-grade glioblastoma tumors. Integrative approaches often focus on using natural interventions as “adjuncts” to conventional, inherently toxic approaches like chemotherapy and radiation, we believe that another possibility exists, namely, that cannabidiol in combination with a wide range of other natural substances studied for targeting glioblastoma is more effective (and certainly far safer) than a combination approach. To view other anti-glioblastoma substances, view our database on the subject . Another highly relevant study published in 2007 titled, “Cannabinoids induce glioma stem-like cell differentiation and inhibit gliomagenesis,” 2 found that cannabinoids target the stem-like properties of glioma cells, encouraging their differentiation into functioning, non-tumorigenic cells, and inhibiting the dysregulated increased production of glioma cells. A more recent 2015 study, 3 found that glioblastoma cells treated with cannabidiol inhibited their self-renewal by down-regulating “critical stem cell maintenance and growth regulators.” Another study, published last month, found that cannabidiol inhibits glioma stem-like proliferation by inducing autophagy, a natural form of programmed cell death. 4 Consider, finally, that the cancer stem cell targeting and killing properties of cannabidiol are only one of a wide range of potential mechanisms through which cannabis as a whole plant, comprised of hundreds of different phytochemicals and phytonutrients, can treat cancer. We have indexed hundreds of studies on cannabis’ therapeutic properties, a good subset concerning its ability to prevent, kill, or regress a wide range of different cancer types. You can view them all on our cannabis research database . Research on cannabis and brain cancer has only just begun, but considering the abject failure if not also sheer violence of conventional approaches, waiting for sufficient quantities of Pharma or government capital to flow in the direction of a non-patentable substance already saddled with archaic laws in some cases criminalizing its possession is a no win proposition. Anecdotes of healing with cannabis are not uncommon. One such report can be viewed on our colleague Dr. Jeffrey Dach’s website, titled, “ Cannabis Oil Brain Tumor Remission ,” demonstrating just how powerful cannabis and its cannabinoids may be for accomplishing what conventional approaches can not. A couple years ago, we reported on a similar case of temporary remission in childhood leukemia using cannabis extract . Also, consider reports like this one, where a woman clearly being victimized by conventional medicine was able to replace 40 different medications through using raw cannabis juice . The short of it is that the future of medicine , if it is to continue to advertise itself to be concerned with alleviating human suffering and being guided by “evidence,” must incorporate this safe, time-tested, affordable and effective healing agent into its standard of care. Failing to do so will not de-validate cannabis, rather, but the medical system itself. One might ask, if cannabis can treat “incurable” brain cancers, and is safer and more effective than chemotherapy and radiation, shouldn’t withholding it or information about its healing properties be considered criminal? Instead we still live in a time and age where simply possessing it or using it is in some jurisdictions classified as a criminal offense of dire if not irreparable consequence to our civil liberties. Perhaps we are at a critical turning point now and the aforementioned research will lead us all forward to a more enlightened medical ethos that respects the right of a patient to choose his or her treatment as long as it does no harm to others.

4222,Seth Meyers Takes ‘A Closer Look’ At The Final Stretch Of The Election Season (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
This entire election season has been insane and no one has broken it down like Seth Meyers has in his nightly segments A Closer Look. 
On the eve of the election, Meyers decided to focus this segment on how the two candidates have handled their campaigns during the final stretch. He took a few minor shots at Hillary, but the bulk of his time was spent incredulously trying to make sense out of what has gone on with Trump during the last 3 days in particular. He also shares a highly entertaining clip of President Obama’s “burns” on Trump. 
While Hillary Clinton has been campaigning with mega-stars like Katy Perry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen and Lady Gaga, Trump has…Scott Baio. Trump couldn’t seem to stop whining about Hillary’s celebrities all weekend, even saying how horrible and inappropriate Jay-Z’s lyrics were. Yes. This…coming from the man who inspired the newest phrase “p*ssygate” and had the likes of Ted Nugent grabbing his crotch and referencing his “blue balls” at a rally over the weekend. 
After showing a clip of Trump bitching about all of these A-listers and saying he doesn’t need them or their guitars and pianos, Seth had a message for the Republican candidate: 
“That’s okay, I’ve got an instrument for you Donald — the world’s smallest violin,” Meyers said. “It should be noted that with your hands, it would be a regular size violin.”

4223,"Like Trump, Europe’s Populists Win Big With Rural Voters - The New York Times","KULESZE KOSCIELNE, Poland  —   The   roofs of this tiny village cluster around the soaring steeples of St. Bartholomew Church like medieval cottages at the base of a castle, alienated from the cosmopolitan life of cities such as Warsaw by a chasm that is economic, cultural and political. Asking how many people here attend Sunday Mass elicits puzzlement. Everyone, of course. There are no shopping malls, no   boulevards and no doubt where political sentiments lie: The village voted 83 percent for Poland’s ruling populist party, joining a rural electoral wave that swept the party to power a year ago  —   even as urbanites in Warsaw gave it less than a third of their vote. “The elites in the city are detached from reality,” said Joszef Grochowski, 60, a lifelong village resident and mayor since 2003. “They no longer understand the needs of ordinary people. ” Populist,   political parties are on the move in Europe. If they are far from homogeneous, these parties share common ground in their core constituencies, rural voters. Just as Donald J. Trump rolled up a big rural vote in his unexpected presidential victory, Europe’s populists are rising by tapping into discontent in the countryside and exploiting rural resentments against urban residents viewed as elites. The parallels are striking: Mr. Trump played on issues such as immigration, trade and globalization, while attacking elites in both parties and mocking political correctness. European populists routinely hammer the same themes while also bashing the European Union as a technocratic colossus wrongly undermining the sovereignty of individual nations. As populists have steadily gathered strength in Europe, the   split has been telling in recent elections in Britain, Italy, France, Austria, Lithuania and elsewhere. In the countryside, residents, on average, are older, poorer, less educated and more receptive to the populist message that they are the true protectors of their nation’s culture and heritage. And voting against the   elites who they think belittle them can be doubly satisfying, analysts say. Rural residents say they are often mocked and marginalized as backward for choosing the traditional,   life their grandparents lived, and also derided as bigots for their reluctance to embrace the more ethnically diverse, sexually open worldview of the cities. “We are living the same lives, of course,” said Pawel Spiewak, a sociologist at the University of Warsaw. “We have the same cars. But we are listening to different music. We are using different words. We are even eating completely different things. ” Only last week, the Italian referendum that drove from power the country’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, showed glimpses of a similar   split. In predominantly rural Puglia, in Italy’s poorer south, more than   of voters rejected Mr. Renzi’s referendum. In cosmopolitan Milan, in Italy’s more prosperous north, only 49 percent voted no. Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union swung on the votes of marginalized, poorer rural residents, as well as people in smaller cities, who shared the same resentment of the cultural and economic dominance of London. Immigration was an especially potent issue in   England. France has already seen the steady ascent of the   nationalist Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front. But even the country’s establishment   party is turning toward the countryside. Last month, François Fillon, a former prime minister, was the surprise winner of the   primary, a race he ran on themes of nationalism and traditional values. His support was strongest outside Paris. Establishment Europe rejoiced last week when Alexander Van der Bellen of the Green Party won the presidency in Austria in a runoff against Norbert Hofer, a populist   leader. But Mr. Van der Bellen’s victory was at least partly explained by a concerted effort to woo rural voters after narrowly winning the first round of voting in May on the strength of urban votes. He visited dozens of rural settings, posed repeatedly in front of the Austrian flag and won 200 more communities than he did in the first round as his victory margin soared to almost 300, 000 votes. Romania has seen a similar situation, as the populist Social Democrats have lost ground in the countryside after the   National Liberals began to compete more vigorously there  —   indicating that there is a way to loosen the populist grip over rural areas through attentive politicking. In some cases, the politicians leading the populist revolt are similar to Mr. Trump in that they come from the ranks of the rich or the politically privileged. Andrej Babis, a Czech billionaire who started his own party, is considered likely to be his country’s next president. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Poland’s governing Law and Justice Party, has been a potent political force for decades but has deftly positioned his party as populist outsiders. “Trump may be a billionaire, but he is also absolutely despised by the elites and that alone has given him a tremendous advantage among people from poorer, rural areas,” said Jaroslaw Fils, a sociologist at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, noting that Mr. Kaczynski has exploited the same resentments in Poland. “On paper, he is hardly a hero for the underprivileged, but, again, he is so despised by the Polish elites that he has become someone the people in the country can identify with. ” Mr. Fils said   city dwellers deepen rural resentments by blithely portraying the countryside as a place of backwardness. “Residents of rural areas are perhaps the only social groups that we can still openly ridicule,” he said. “It’s not politically correct to laugh at gay people, ethnic minorities, obese people. But hardly anyone will tell you off for laughing at peasants. ” Europe’s populists cannot be defined strictly through a   lens. Some are right wing, while others are left wing. Some want to draw closer to Russia, others to the West. In the formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe, populists on the left and the right woo rural voters by playing off nostalgia for lost greatness, and the old era of authoritarian leaders and governments that provided for people. “Where the countryside was mobilized,” said Marian Lesko, a political analyst in Slovakia, “victory belonged to coalitions that weren’t the biggest fans of liberal democracy and democratic values. ” This is why populists on the left and the right are strong in the countryside. In the Czech Republic, Milos Zeman, the populist   president, draws greater support outside the capital. In Hungary, the   ruling party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban also does best outside the capital of Budapest. In the Baltic nation of Lithuania,   fervor has coalesced around the Peasant’s and Greens Union, which stormed to victory in the fall parliamentary elections on a populist platform and strong rural support leery of the immigrants filing into the country’s cities. “People who live in the countryside want the state to provide them with a sense of stability and predictability,” Mr. Fils said. “The state that wants to bring in thousands of refugees who come from the ominous Middle East doesn’t provide any of these things. ” The village of Kulesze Koscielne sits at a crossroads near the main highway connecting Warsaw with Belarus, down a series of increasingly narrow and unevenly paved roads. There is a small, unmarked general store, a village hall, a pub, a gas station and a   school building. Roughly 400 people live in the village. “This area has always been conservative, always,” Mayor Grochowski said. “The ethos of the people who live here is work and faith. ” Distrust of outsiders runs deep. When Poland voted in 2004 to join the European Union, a national majority voted yes. In Kulesze Koscielne, sentiment was strong the other way. Even as villagers now recognize the benefits brought to Poland by joining the European bloc, there is also irritation over issues such as homosexuality and immigration. “They can do this in the big cities where people are used to that, but it wouldn’t work in the country,” the mayor said. “People here are so set in their ways. What we believe in are the ground rules set by God. You cannot go around them. You cannot escape them. ” A short walk down the main street, Jolantyna Kaminska, the headmistress of the village school, sat in her sparse office with the sound of children occasionally permeating the thick walls. She said she knew many urbanites considered village life claustrophobic, yet it is this cultural conformity that makes people feel safe. Village residents do not feel antipathy toward those in the big city, she said. If anything, they pity them for losing touch with Poland’s traditional values. “In the big city,” she said, “they have the freedom  —   or, I would say, the frivolousness of thinking. ”",0
4224,Debate Over Role of ‘People’s Army’ in Israel Reflects Wider Fissures - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   In a politically fractious country troubled by monumental security challenges, Israel’s military has long served as an equalizer and unifier, a “people’s army” that, at least in the eyes of the Jewish majority, reflected the general interest. But the Israeli people, and with them the government, have shifted to the right amid an upsurge of Palestinian stabbings and other attacks. Now the military finds itself at the center of a tumultuous debate about its role as the nation’s conscience and most trusted institution. Some government ministers and an increasingly shrill segment of the public have been pushing for tougher action in the face of months of Palestinian attacks that have killed about 30 civilians and soldiers. Other Israelis want the military to remain a moderating force and a bulwark against extremism. The debate about the military’s role has been highlighted by a series of clashes among its high command, the government and an aggressive segment of the public in recent months. The pressure on the military is also growing in light of the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman, a   as defense minister. Mr. Lieberman has been among the harshest critics of Israeli security policies and will now serve as the army’s overlord. His immediate predecessor, Moshe Yaalon, a conservative and former military chief of staff who was pushed out, had staunchly backed the generals, who have spoken out against manifestations of extremism in the ranks and in broader society. “Generally, the image of an army is that it wants to push forward and it has to be restrained sometimes by the politicians, statesmen who think in a wider context and know that they need to make compromises,” said Shlomo Avineri, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “In Israel, the present situation is almost the opposite. ” The military chiefs, Mr. Avineri said, are “not   liberals. ” The fissure is not between the traditional Israeli right and left, he said, but between “strategic hawks,” or pragmatists who put Israel’s security first, and “ideological hawks” who are more concerned with historical rights and Jewish nationalism. In recent years, Mr. Avineri said, senior military officials, together with the Mossad and Shin Bet security chiefs, were widely credited with having opposed and ultimately blocked Israeli government plans  to prepare for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, believing that it would have disastrous consequences. The debate over the military’s role could have a profound impact in Israel, where most Jewish    are drafted for compulsory service, and many perform reserve duty for decades after. During Independence Day celebrations this month, millions looked skyward to catch a glimpse of the traditional   flyover of fighter jets, Hercules transport planes,    refueling craft and attack helicopters. The commanders of the air, ground and naval forces often become household names here. But the recent surge in violence has strained those views of the military. “The wave of terrorist attacks or intifada or whatever you want to label the events of the past eight months have raised the level of fear in Israeli society,” said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research group. “That puts a lot of tension on the military leadership and the soldiers who are put in situations where they are supposed to fight terror, protect themselves and comply with the I. D. F. ’s values,” he said, referring to the Israel Defense Forces. Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the chief of staff of the Israeli military, recently caused a stir when he told an audience of high school students that he would not want a soldier to empty a magazine on a Palestinian girl of 13 holding a pair of scissors. He was attacked by rightist politicians who advocate a policy based on the Talmudic lesson “Whoever comes to slay you, slay him first. ” The military chiefs have urged restraint and a strict adherence to   regulations, saying a soldier should shoot to neutralize a threat, but not beyond that. At the same time, Palestinians and human rights groups accuse the military of excessive use of force in the West Bank, where it enforces Israel’s   occupation. The military brass also came under fire for its swift condemnation of the actions of an Israeli sergeant, Elor Azaria, who fatally shot a disarmed and wounded Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay on the ground after he had stabbed and wounded another soldier. Many Israelis, including Mr. Lieberman, said the denunciation prejudged the case and undermined the troops as they battled Palestinian violence. Outraged Israelis flooded social networks and hailed Sergeant Azaria, who has been charged with manslaughter, as a hero. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed the military prosecutors but, sensing the public mood, also called the soldier’s father in a show of support. Then Maj. Gen. Yair Golan, the deputy chief of the military, caused an uproar in a speech for Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day this month, when he said he discerned disturbing trends in Israeli society that reminded him of processes that led to the rise of Nazi Germany. Mr. Netanyahu rebuked General Golan, criticizing his remarks as outrageous, and said, “The I. D. F. is the people’s army and must remain out of political debates. ” The military’s code of ethics, known as the Spirit of the I. D. F. states clearly that the army’s mission is to protect Israel and its independence while being “subordinate to the directions of the democratic civilian authorities and the laws of the state. ” Still, commanders are encouraged to voice their opinions freely in what the politicians call appropriate forums. Yaakov Amidror, a major general in the reserves and a former national security adviser, said that “there is no war” between the military and the prime minister. Instead, he said, General Golan crossed a forbidden line between the professionals and the decision makers. “Because we force everybody to serve,” Mr. Amidror said, “we have to be even more conservative in what officers can say. ” Underlying the complexity of the issue, Mordechai Kremnitzer and Yedidia Z. Stern, both vice presidents of the Israel Democracy Institute, penned opposing views about General Golan’s speech in the Hebrew edition of the Haaretz newspaper. In an article written with Prof. Avi Sagi, one of the authors of the “Spirit of the I. D. F. ,” Mr. Stern criticized General Golan for becoming involved in the public discourse while in uniform. Mr. Kremnitzer countered, “Army values do not spring up from within the military but are derived from the core values of Israeli society. ” He argued that it was General Golan’s right, and even his duty, to warn of any damage to those values.   lines are further blurred in Israel by the number of retired generals who try to capitalize on their army prestige by entering politics. But the army remains the one island of social solidarity where the country’s political and economic divides vanish. Micah Goodman, an   Jewish philosopher, had just returned from a week of reserve duty with his infantry unit in northern Israel where, he said, he slept in the field with   investors and truck drivers, all wearing the same uniform. “According to the ethos,” said Mr. Goodman, 42, “the people are meant to educate the army, meaning that the values of the army are a projection of the values of the people. ” But as in many other places in the world, he said, there is a sense that those social values are eroding. “The more that Israelis feel that Israel is losing its core values and that the army is the last bastion of those   Israeli values,” he said, “so the temptation of reversing the model grows. ”",0

4226,Crackdown: AG Sessions Vows ’New Era’ at Southern Border - Breitbart,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions broke from his tour of the U. S.  border Tuesday to announce his Justice Department’s sweeping plans for securing the border. [“For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era. This is the Trump era,” Sessions told the crowd of Customs and Border Protection personnel in the border town of Nogales, Arizona. “We hear you and we have your back!” he assured them.  Sessions proceeded to lay out a multifaceted plan to stop illegal aliens entering the country. All adults apprehended at the border are to be detained and at least 125 additional immigration judges are to be appointed and put in the field on an expedited basis.   immigration judges have already been deployed to detention centers along the border to help alleviate the massive backlog of cases already piled up there. Accompanying the address, the Attorney General’s Office issued a memorandum to all US Attorney’s offices, instructing them on dramatically stricter prosecution guidelines for immigration offenses: all repeat illegal entry offenders are to be referred for felony prosecution all cases in which an illegal alien is caught reentering the United States after removal are now to be considered for felony prosecution, with priority given to those with other criminal records or gang affiliations prosecuting those caught transporting three or more illegal aliens will now be a priority illegal aliens and their smugglers caught with fraudulent documentation, as they often are, are to be charged with aggravated identity theft and prosecuting any assault on federal law enforcement, included CBP personnel, is to be a “top priority. ” “The catch and release practices of old are over,” Sessions said. By the beginning of next week, every US Attorney’s office is to have a “Border Security Coordinator” to help carry out the Justice Department plan. Not only will those coordinators be charged with overseeing and advising on the new guidelines, they are commanded to assemble and report statistics on their implementation. The Attorney General touted the 40 percent reported drop in illegal crossings at the southern border since President Donald Trump took office while unveiling the plan. “This is no accident,” he said. “This is what happens when you have a President who understands the threat, who is not afraid to publicly identify the threat and stand up to it. ” Sessions closed by referring back to the crimes by “caught and released” illegals that captured the nation’s attention: Why are we doing this? Because it is what the duly enacted laws of the United States require. I took an oath to protect this country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. How else can we look the parents and loved ones of Kate Steinle, Grant Ronnebeck, and so many others in eye and say we are doing everything possible to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring again?",0

4228,Noam Chomsky: US Commenced Plan To Dominate ‘Grand Area’ Of The Globe After WWII,"Videos Noam Chomsky: US Commenced Plan To Dominate ‘Grand Area’ Of The Globe After WWII After World War II, Chomsky said the U.S. implemented a plan ‘in which the United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control’ over a massive percentage of the planet. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! U.S.Army 4.7mm anti-aircraft gunsare lined up in the final assembly area of the Grand Rapids stamping division of Fisher Body in Detroit on June 1, 1944, prior to shipping. 
MUNICH — World War II marked a crucial turning point for U.S. empire building and the growth of global capitalism, according to the historical analysis of noted political philosopher and scholar Noam Chomsky. 
Chomsky examined U.S. domination of world affairs in “ Who Owns The World? ,” a speech he delivered at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2012. In May, he published a book, “Who Rules The World?,” which examines similar themes. Watch ‘ Noam Chomsky: Who Owns the World? Resistance and Ways Forward ‘ : 
He revisited the topic in a recent conversation with Zain Raza, a senior editor at the independent media outlet acTVism Munich. An excerpt from that conversation was published on Tuesday as part of acTVism Munich’s “Reexamining History” series . 
Much of the U.S. government’s global strategy both during and after World War II was based on a plan proposed by the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations , which Chomsky describes as the “major, non-governmental institution concerned with foreign affairs” whose membership “draws from a wide range of elite elements, business, politics, academics, and so on.” 
Between 1939 and 1945, the State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations held regular strategy meetings to develop a post-war economic plan. These meetings led to proposal under which the United States would dominate a vast swath of the globe that came to be known as the “Grand Area,” Chomsky said. Explaining that the “Grand Area” would include “the Western Hemisphere,” Chomsky said: “It included the former British Empire, which the U.S. was intending to largely take over, maybe Britain would be a junior partner. And as much of Europe, the commercial and industrial center of Europe, as much of that as possible. Certainly Western Europe, its industrial, technological, commercial center.” 
Within the “Grand Area,” Chomsky continued, “the United States would have pretty much complete economic and political control.” 
With the collapse of the German economy after the war, and amid the beginnings of the Cold War with Russia and China, the United States was in a unique position to implement this plan. Chomsky said: “The war was very beneficial to the U.S. economy. Its industrial production virtually quadrupled, wartime spending ended the Depression, which had not been ended before — enormous stimulus to the economy. The technology that was developed just laid the basis for post-war growth. In that context ‘Grand Area’ planning of the kind I described was by no means unrealistic.” 
Far from a Pentagon pipedream, the “Grand Area” became concrete U.S. foreign policy, and its effects linger to this day. 
“If you look at the policies implemented and developed in the early post-war period, they follow these prescriptions pretty closely,” Chomsky said. 
As Chomsky and other historians have observed, Washington’s plans to dominate the “Grand Area” led directly to the Vietnam War. They were also crucial in the development of the International Monetary Fund , which continues to disrupt global economies for the benefit of multinational corporations and the military-industrial complex.",0
4229,Facebook Livestream Alleged Rapists to Be Prosecuted in Sweden,"A trio of asylum seekers will be prosecuted after they livestreamed the rape of a young Swedish woman on Facebook from an apartment in the Swedish city of Uppsala in late January. [Two of the asylum seekers involved, one aged 18 and the other 21, are to be tried for the rape of the unnamed victim. The third migrant, aged 24, will be prosecuted for being complicit in the rape and not disclosing the incident to Swedish authorities. The    is also said to have been the one who filmed the ordeal and will also be prosecuted for aggravated slander for broadcasting the incident over social media, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.  Stefan Wallin, the lawyer for the    suspect, claims it was not rape but was a consensual sexual act. The lawyer went on to say his client could prove the woman had been in the apartment willingly and showed consent throughout the incident. “In the witness evidence the prosecution presents, we have seen this movie, but the intimate moment between my client and the victim occurred about 45 minutes to one hour before this film,” Wallin said. Henry Stolare, another lawyer for the suspects, claimed the video was incomplete and said there was a large portion missing. Prosecutor Pontus Melander said the basis of the prosecution comes from the testimony of eight separate witnesses. Melander said the prosecution has contacted Facebook directly for the entire footage, but said Facebook has not provided it. Speaking to Swedish media, Melander said: “The footage we have collected is not nearly complete. ” He added: “We know that there is more material than we have so far received. We know this through the testimony. ” The three men, two of which have been identified as Afghan asylum seekers by Swedish conservative site Friatider, were arrested during the course of the live stream which was viewed by hundreds before being taken down by the police. Another witness came forward a day later claiming she had also been raped by the same men in 2015.  The    said one of the men in the video had attacked her while she was in the shower. “I had bruises and scratches all over my body, the throat, and where he squeezed my breasts. ” “I hope he is convicted, this should not happen again,” she said.

4230,Look At What Is Unfolding In China And Other Key Regions Right Now,"41 Views November 07, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
With stocks surging along with the U.S. dollar and gold and silver getting hit, here is a look at what is unfolding in China and other key regions right now. 
Here is a portion of what Peter Boockvar wrote today as the world awaits the next round of monetary madness: It IS the best of times, it IS the worst of times, it is the age of wisdom, it is the age of foolishness, it is the epoch of belief, it is the epoch of incredulity, it is the season of light, it is the season of darkness, it is the spring of hope, it is the winter of despair, we have everything before us, we have nothing before us, (I switched the Tale of Two Cities lines from Was to Is and to Have from Had), etc… The former because the most bizarre and embarrassing presidential campaign in our life time is about to end. The latter because someone is going to win… IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
In terms of the market and its possible response on Wednesday, today’s reaction to the FBI news is obvious evidence that market participants have wrapped up the world in a nice and easy box. Hillary wins, good for stocks. Trump wins, bad for stocks. But, anyone who thinks deeper than this knows that the response is going to be much more nuanced. Ask any owner of a healthcare, financial or defense stock. Ask any business person who cares about taxes, regulation and global trade. Also, no matter who wins, the FOMC will be most likely raising interest rates again next month just as the economy has slowed to a 1.5% growth rate. And lastly, who’s going to win the Senate? 
Over the 9 day market losing streak, the S&P 500 lost just 66 pts, thus this morning’s rally in the S&P futures is retracing almost half of that loss. 
China’s FX reserves continued to shrink in October. It’s pile now stands at $3.12T, down $66b m/o/m and was $12b less than expected. This level was last seen in 2011 and is now down $870b from its peak in 2014. Some of the decline is certainly outright outflows but some is the impact from valuation changes of the US dollar that rallied against many currencies in the China basket in October. I saw one estimate that said almost $30b of the decline was FX valuation related and about $10-15b was due to PBOC intervention. The dollar rallied about 1.5% against the yuan in October. China is fighting economic battles on many fronts. The War is the massive debt burden they now carry. The daily battles are how to keep growth continuing, how to transition the economy away from huge investments, and how to manage orderly weakness in its currency in the face of the fog of its debt war. The yuan is lower while the Shanghai comp index was up slightly. The H share index jumped 1.2% and the Hang Seng was up by .7% but property stocks in Hong Kong got slammed after Friday’s announcement of a hike in the stamp tax to 15% (from 8.5% for residents) for all purchases of residential housing except for 1st time buyers that are full time residents. The Hong Kong housing market is in an epic bubble. 
A few days after BoJ Governor Kuroda basically waved the white towel on achieving his 2% inflation obsession, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said base earnings for Japanese workers in September grew .4% y/o/y vs a .3% gain in August. It was 1997 the last time wage growth was 1% and it was 1994 the last time it saw 2%. Thus, it is a good thing Kuroda is waving that towel because he would have greatly damaged the standard of living of his citizenry. Of course all central bankers believe that higher wages come with higher inflation but theory doesn’t always work in practice.

4231,It’s Donald Trump’s Party Now - The New York Times,"The Republican Party’s trek into the darkness took a fateful step in Indiana on Tuesday. The Hoosier State delivered an    victory to Donald Trump, who beat Ted Cruz soundly in the state, sweeping up at least 51 delegates. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders won an unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton, though it was not enough to halt her march to the nomination. Shortly after the Republican race was called, Mr. Cruz announced that he was ending his campaign, leaving Gov. John Kasich as the sole rival to Mr. Trump in the G. O. P. contest. That the   had hoped to fall back on Mr. Cruz, perhaps the most reviled politician in his party, was a measure of their panic about the prospect now before them. With Mr. Trump’s success, “I’m watching a    political party commit suicide,” said Henry Olsen, an elections analyst with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Republicans will all but certainly nominate Mr. Trump, who would be the most volatile and least prepared presidential candidate nominated by a major party in modern times. A man once ridiculed by many prominent Republicans will become the G. O. P.  . This is a moment of reckoning for the Republican Party. It’s incumbent on its leadership to account for the failures and betrayals that led to this, and find a better way to address them than the demagogy on offer. Republicans haven’t yet begun to grapple with this. Instead they’re falling into line. Republican leaders have for years failed to think about much of anything beyond winning the next election. Year after year, the party’s candidates promised help for   people who lost their homes, jobs and savings to recession, who lost limbs and   to war, and then did next to nothing. That Mr. Trump was able to enthrall voters by promising simply to “Make America Great Again”  —   but offering only xenophobic, isolationist or fantastical ideas  —   is testimony to how thoroughly they reject the politicians who betrayed them. Now, myopic as ever, Republican leaders are talking themselves into supporting Mr. Trump. At a party retreat in Florida last month, Mr. Trump’s adviser Paul Manafort, brought in to make the candidate seem safer to the old guard, assured them that Mr. Trump will better prepare himself for the presidency. “That was all most of these guys needed to hear,” said an operative in the room. “Maybe he’s trainable. ” But within a day, Mr. Trump was back to making vile comments at his rallies. In his confused foreign policy address, he demonstrated nothing but a willful refusal to learn. Some Republicans still seem to hope they can direct voters’ attention past the Trump candidacy. Last week in Washington, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, told a dismayed young Republican at Georgetown University to try not to worry so much about Mr. Trump. “I would just ask you to raise your gaze and look at the horizon that we’re trying to paint,” he said, promoting #ConfidentAmerica, his plan to create a plan. Its mission reads like this: “We do not like the direction the country is going, and we have an obligation to offer an alternative. That’s why House Republicans are developing a bold,   agenda to take to the country. By giving the people a clear choice in 2016, we can earn a mandate to do big things in 2017 and beyond. ” It is the Republicans who are making a clear choice in 2016, one that seemed unimaginable a year ago: To stamp what they still like to call the party of Lincoln with the brand of Donald Trump.",0
4232,"Republican Party, Megyn Kelly, Titanic: Your Wednesday Briefing - The New York Times"," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Congress focuses on health care. Debate begins today on legislation to dismantle major parts of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama is scheduled to meet with Democrats about resisting efforts to repeal the law, while Vice   Mike Pence will meet with lawmakers from his party to gird them for a fight. • Rough first day back. Republican lawmakers abandoned on Monday a move to eliminate an ethics office after rebukes from constituents and from   Donald J. Trump. Our writer says Mr. Trump’s intervention raises “alarms among Republicans about his power to corral them via social media. ” • Trump on trade. The  ’s pick for trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, is a longtime advocate of protectionist policies, a choice in line with Mr. Trump’s focus on making products in America. That effort has made some Republicans uneasy, but some Democrats are ready to support it. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Trump criticized General Motors for making cars in Mexico. Hours later, Ford said it would expand production at a Michigan factory and would drop plans for a new plant in Mexico. • Getting ready for legal fights.  Democratic leaders of the California Legislature have hired the former U. S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to represent them in any legal fights against the White House. The state is preparing for battles on issues including the environment, immigration and criminal justice. • Latest in Istanbul attack. Turkish officials say they know who killed at least 39 people in an assault on a nightclub last weekend, although they did not release his name. A video appears to show the suspect recording himself as he walked through the city. • Challenges ahead for Netanyahu. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has been “the ultimate survivor” in a political system that destroyed many of his predecessors, our writers say, but the current graft inquiry could be different. The political turmoil comes as an Israeli soldier was found guilty of manslaughter today for shooting a wounded Palestinian attacker. The country has been highly divided over the case. • Rethinking death. One of our most popular stories this week is about Dr. B. J. Miller, who became a triple amputee after a horrific accident in college. He’s on a quest to change the way we die, and he pioneered a model of palliative care that aims to view death as a human experience, not just a medical one. • Megyn Kelly’s move to NBC from Fox News heralds a major shift in the cable news landscape, and it will give her a daytime show as well as a Sunday newsmagazine. Some industry executives outlined the challenges Ms. Kelly will face in those formats. • India has become a major center for cyberfraud, as a result of an abundance of young workers skilled in computers and English. A recent scheme targeting Indian immigrants in the U. S. came to light when two teenage workers blew the whistle. • The price of Bitcoin is soaring, thanks in part to a tilt toward isolationism in the U. S. and Europe, and to trading by Chinese speculators. The virtual currency is worth about $1, 025, or 140 percent more than a year ago. • U. S. stocks were up on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Welcome to Hell   …     Hell, Mich. Our 360 video follows John Colone, the unofficial mayor of the town, which has a population of 72. • New to read. We review Aravind Adiga’s new novel, “Selection Day,” about religion and cricket. Mr. Adiga “supplies further proof that his Booker Prize, won for ‘The White Tiger’ in 2008, was no fluke,” our critic writes. Also, we look at Roxane Gay’s new collection of short stories, “Difficult Women. ” • Alternate theory about the Titanic. An Irish journalist who spent 30 years investigating the famous sinking says he found evidence that a coal fire in the ship’s hull weeks before it set sail played a role in the tragedy. “It’s a perfect storm of extraordinary factors coming together: fire, ice and criminal negligence,” he said. • Recipe of the day. If you’re going meatless to start the new year, try this spinach lasagna. While it bakes, read about Ruby Tandoh, the popular British cookbook author who urges us simply to eat what we love. This month, Melania Trump  —   born Melanija Knavs in Slovenia  —   will become the second first lady to have been born outside the U. S. Louisa Adams, the wife of John Quincy Adams (president from 1825 to 1829) was the first. She was born in London in 1775. Her mother was English, her father the American consul. Their home became an essential stop for American visitors, including the future president, who met Louisa in 1795 and married her in 1797. Louisa arrived in the U. S. in 1801, when President John Adams brought his diplomat son home for a time. Wherever the couple was posted, her engaging personality stood out. Louisa dazzled imperial courts overseas, and her soirees were the heart of Washington’s social life when her husband was secretary of state, proving to be crucial to his ascension to the presidency. The question of her “Americanness” became an issue during his tumultuous term in office. Her efforts to defend herself only drew more attention to her background. Louisa continued to be a political partner to her husband as he served in Congress after leaving the White House, supporting his antislavery efforts. When she died in 1852, both Houses adjourned. A Washington publication wrote that hers was one of the “longest funeral processions ever witnessed in this city. ” Adeel Hassan contributed reporting. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

4235,Cartoon Reveals Just How Far The Clintons’ Reach Really Goes,"Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer reports that President Obama claimed back in March of 2015 that he found out about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private, unsecured email server the same way other Americans found out —“ through news reports .” But WikiLeaks has released emails hacked from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, that proved otherwise and may point to a big reason why the FBI let Clinton off the hook. 
“They know POTUS and HRC emailed,” Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton’s communications director, wrote in a March 2015 email approximately a month before Clinton announced her presidential run. 
“Josh has been asked about that,” Palmieri continued, in reference to Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. 
“Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm,” Palmieri wrote. “I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet’s email addresses.” 
Better things to do, like golfing? Drawing red lines in the sand? Even if Obama had “better things to do,” someone should have been concerned about cyber security and the fact that the secretary of state was using a private server. 
In the email exchange, Palmieri was discussing Obama’s CBS statement with Clinton aide Phillippe Reines who suggested that they should warn the White House about the likelihood that Obama’s statement to CBS would fall apart under scrutiny. 
“One of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense,” Reines wrote. “I’m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it’s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset.” 
“Especially if it’s some weird technical thing with the President’s email setup that he doesn’t see addresses,” Reines wrote. 
Some “weird technical thing?” Must have been the Russians’ fault, eh? The FBI found out, during their investigation of Clinton’s use of private servers run out of her New York home, that Obama used a pseudonym to email Clinton on her home brew server. That’s a big fat lie as part of a massive coverup, not some “weird technical thing.” 
In another March 2015 email released by WikiLeaks, Podesta asked Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills about emails between POTUS and Clinton: “Think we should hold emails to and from potus?” 
“That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will,” Podesta wrote. 
Well, this revelation may have been a big reason why the Obama administration let Clinton off the hook — Obama himself was in on it.",0

4238,"Peter Thiel: Globalization is Over, ’It Feels so Dated’ - Breitbart","Billionaire tech entrepreneur and adviser to President Trump, Peter Thiel, declared globalization to be over on Tuesday, claiming it’s “so 2005, it feels so dated. ”[“I’m naturally inclined to think of it in those terms,” said Thiel on the topic of how Trump’s victory showed the American people’s dissatisfaction with globalization. “There’s something around globalization that’s not been working that well. ”  “The internet was designed to survive a nuclear war, but even so, I think there are a lot of regulatory challenges that Silicon Valley will be facing from Western Europe and elsewhere in the years ahead,” he continued. “There’s a technological determinism story you can tell where this is the future and China will eventually buckle under and cave and eventually adopt all of these things. But then you might wonder, maybe this doesn’t happen at all, and maybe it’s possible for the internet to actually fragment and not to have this historical necessity to it. ” According to CNBC, Thiel added that “No one in their right mind would start an organization with the word ‘global’ in its title today,” before claiming “That’s so 2005, it feels so dated. ” “A decade ago, this was a group of people who were running the world, and now, it’s just a group of people who messed up the world,” concluded Thiel. “I’m not sure this is a good thing, but it is a fact that maybe politics is becoming more important, it’s becoming more intense, the range of outcomes is becoming greater, and that we’re in a world in which there’s a bull market in politics that’s getting started. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

4239,Robert Barnes: Trump Could ‘Go Full Andrew Jackson’ and Ignore Interference from Activist Judges,"Attorney Robert Barnes joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily to discuss his latest Breitbart News column, “Hawaii Obama Judge Rules Muslim Imam Has Special Constitutional Rights to Bring Anyone from Terror Countries into America. ”[Marlow asked Barnes to begin by explaining why Trump’s temporary ban on various terror countries was blocked.  LISTEN: “The district court judge in Hawaii, who was a fellow law graduate of Harvard law school with former President Obama  —   and, in fact, Obama was in Hawaii yesterday before the decision was issued, so some people have speculated on the coincidence of that. But he issued a decision that blocks the ability of anybody to enforce the order anywhere,” Barnes said. “So he went beyond just the district of Hawaii. He said no state can enforce it. Nobody in any part of the country can enforce it. Nobody anywhere in the administration can enforce it. He issued what’s called a nationwide injunction, and it precludes any application of the order, pretty much, on any aspect of the order, pretty much, until there’s further review. ”  “His basis for doing so was an extraordinary interpretation of the right to travel and the freedom of association, which before, has only been associated with U. S. citizens,” Barnes continued. “Every court decision in the 200 years prior to this has said that people who are not citizens of the United States, who are not present within the United States, have no First Amendment constitutional rights. The Constitution doesn’t extend internationally to anybody, anywhere, anyplace, at any time. Instead, this judge said it did, as long as you had a university here who wanted to assert,   the foreigner’s rights, or you had some physical person here. In this case, it was one of the leading Muslim imams in Hawaii he wants to bring over various family and friends from the Middle East. ” “The Hawaii judge’s decision says he has a First Amendment constitutional right to do so because he’s Muslim. It was one of the most extraordinary interpretations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ever given, which is that because these are Muslim countries that were banned where the issue of terror arises from that that meant they had a special right to access the country and visit the country,” he said.  “As long as there is somebody here that wants them here, no president can ever preclude them from coming here. He basically gave First Amendment rights to everybody around the world and gave special preferences to people who are Muslim under his interpretation of the First Amendment,” Barnes summarized. “So it’s an extraordinarily broad order. Its legal doctrine has no limits. If you keep extending this, it means people from around the world have a special right to access the United States, visit the United States, emigrate to the United States, get visas to the United States. There wouldn’t be any limit, and the president would never be able to control our own borders. It would be up solely to the whim of a federal judge who effectively delegated it, in this case, to a Muslim imam in Hawaii,” he contended. Barnes noted that the judge did not “cite any prior decision” that has ever established this astonishing new quirk of the Constitution. “Just last year, the Supreme Court implicitly said the opposite, when they said your right to association does not include a right to bring foreigners into the United States, in the Din decision,” he pointed out. “Now, there were several concurrences, so the binding precedent of that has been left open, but he does not even reference or mention or discuss the decision. He doesn’t even mention the statute, the main statute that gives the president the right to ban any alien from the country, for any reason the president deems appropriate, for any temporary time period, that the president yesterday cited in his national speech. Like the prior Ninth Circuit decision, the Hawaii judge never mentions the decision at all. ”  “So there’s no real legal precedent. He’s taking three or four different concepts that have been applied in completely different areas of law, that only ever have historically applied to U. S. citizens, and he’s magically adding it to foreigners and acting like that’s always been the case when it’s never been the case,” he said.  “It is a product of what I call liberal law school education that was happening when I was in law school, which is they’re increasingly teaching lawyers to replace objective analysis with their subjective preference, but to pretend their subjective bias was really objective reality, even when it wasn’t,” Barnes said. “They basically taught you to lie to yourself about what the law really was and what it really stood for. ”  “Obama reflects that, and this judge deeply reflects that,” Barnes asserted. “He’s someone whose opinion would be taken apart. If it was a   law school exam, he would get an ‘F’ because of how badly he misapplied the law. Unfortunately, in the liberal law school mentality, it’s what they’ve taught people to do. This judge, who’s a relatively recent judge, he’s been on the bench a few years, extended it in that way. ”  “To give you an idea of how bad it is, yesterday, five Ninth Circuit judges dissented from reviewing the decision about the prior Ninth Circuit decision,” he pointed out. “The prior Ninth Circuit decision effectively became moot when President Trump replace his old executive order with the new one, and these five judges said that prior decision was so bad that they needed to vacate the decision and should vacate the prior decision, even though that’s very rare under those circumstances. They referred to the obligation to correct the ‘manifest many, obvious, fundamental errors’ that went against all the precedent the guy overlooked or neglected in the prior panel decision. ”  “It was one of the harshest condemnations ever issued, and one of its authors was former chief judge of the Ninth Circuit Alex Kozinsky, who is regarded as one of the best and brightest judges from anywhere in the country, even though he’s usually more on the liberal side of the spectrum,” he noted. “What they all pointed out is it doesn’t matter what your politics are, the law is clear. There was no basis for the prior Ninth Circuit decision. Well, this Hawaii decision goes further than any court had ever gone before. Hopefully, it will get reviewed and reversed, but in the interim, the country’s safety is put into jeopardy because one federal judge decided to anoint himself the one Supreme Court of the country. ” Marlow asked if President Trump had any recourse, other than waiting for a higher court to overturn the Hawaii decision. Barnes suggested he could “always do a true Andrew Jackson, since he was there yesterday,” referring to Trump’s visit to Andrew Jackson’s grave. “When the Supreme Court issued a decision, Andrew Jackson’s famous comments were, ‘Well, they’ve issued their decision now, they can enforce it,’” Barnes recalled. “He was the last president to really challenge a Supreme Court usurping authority they did not have. ” “In this particular context, because it’s a district court decision  —   Professor Dershowitz even argued this, earlier in the cycle, when the Ninth Circuit even issued its decision  —   was that because there was a conflict between the courts, because you have a court in Boston that actually approved of the original Trump order, a great detailed order,   order, cited by the five Ninth Circuit judges yesterday  —   the president would be in his legal rights to say: ‘There’s a conflict between the courts. Until the Supreme Court addresses this, I’m going to do what’s appropriate to keep the country safe,’” he suggested.  “The flip side is if he did that, the media would go on a field day and say the president thinks he’s above the law and is refusing to honor a court order,” he acknowledged. “He’s more likely to wait for this issue to get adjudicated. It ties his hands, unfortunately, and endangers the country in the interim, but politically speaking, he’s sort of put between a rock and a hard place. His only real alternative is to either go full Andrew Jackson or let it play out in the courts, and in the interim, the order is not enforced. ” “You definitely can do impeachment proceedings,” Barnes said when Marlow asked if there was any course of action that could be taken against the Hawaii judge for abusing his authority.  “I do think that all the political pressure put on the courts and all the public criticism by legal scholars and everybody else publicly about these decisions, and how reckless they are, and how dangerous they are to the   and safety of the country, and how   they are, and how they mirror and reflect the aspects of Obama’s shadow government undermining the government through its Deep State connections and its undemocratically elected officials has real value,” he said.  “That’s even reflected in the decision of the five judges yesterday who were so harsh in the criticism of their former colleagues,” he pointed out. “They mention that the attention drawn to the court is a particular concern to them in jeopardizing the credibility of the court  —   because, at the end of the day, America’s courts only have power as long as people respect and believe and have confidence in the independence and integrity of those courts. ” “As that gets sacrificed, courts lose power, and we may return back to a time and place where someone like President Trump needs to go back to Andrew Jackson and invoke his tradition and legacy in order to challenge judicial usurpation of the safety and security of the country. At the current time, there’s not a lot we can do without being willing to go full Andrew Jackson against the court system,” he judged.  “Impeachment is always an option in the House. Some congressmen could pursue it because of these judges usurping their authority and invading the security and safety of the country, and violating the tripartite branches of power, where the judiciary is always supposed to have respected the president in this area. But right now, there’s not a lot we can do under the current political and legal environment,” Barnes concluded. He agreed with President Trump’s contention that this level of judicial overreach was unprecedented. “When you have law professors like Jonathan Turley or Alan Dershowitz or Jeffrey Toobin saying that the prior Ninth Circuit decision  —   which did not go as far as this case did, as the Hawaii judge did  —   saying it basically is bad law, then you know how bad the law actually is,” Barnes said. “It’s law that has no precedent, that has no historical application. For example, the Supreme Court and our Congress banned anarchists from coming into the country. It banned people that were Communists from coming into the country. We have always been able to use just mere ideology as a test. ” “We’ve also favored several religious groups, disfavored other religious groups,” he added, agreeing with Marlow’s example of how the Obama administration treated Christian refugees. “This Hawaii judge is close friends with Obama, may have met with Obama before the decision was issued, is here condemning President Trump from just trying to keep the country safe as to who can come in. Well, if you apply his doctrine legally, how was Obama   Americans and all kinds of people overseas? So you don’t have a right not to be   but you have a right to live next to somebody in the state of Hawaii or anywhere else in the country?” he asked sarcastically. “There’s no logic. If you start to apply logically all of the consequences of this judge’s ideas, it goes to places that would destroy the whole concept of borders, destroy the whole concept of nationhood sovereignty, destroy the presidential prerogative to destroy our borders. There’s just no limit to where this judge’s decision could go,” Barnes warned. He said there is no question executive power has been used in a discriminatory fashion against Christians “for almost the entire Obama tenure, particularly the Syrian Christians and others who were being actually harassed and persecuted. ” Barnes said the judicial action against Trump’s revised executive order dispelled the notion his first order was merely worded poorly or rolled out in a clumsy manner. “No, the problem is you have Deep State saboteurs, and you have unelected officials who think they’re above the law try to create the law, try to change the law, try to rewrite the law. ” “The problem wasn’t how he rolled out the prior order. The problem is, the opposition are people who don’t respect democratic elections and don’t respect the limits of their office,” he charged. “This problem is now right center with the way this judge issued his decision and particularly applying it nationally. He prevented every other federal judge, every other federal circuit, from weighing in on the decision because he unilaterally opposed it across the whole country  —   which both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have said you’re not supposed to do, in cases just like this,” Barnes said. “Judges think they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, wherever they want, however they want. The media will celebrate them. Nobody will do anything negative or adverse to them. And the only person pushing back on it is President Trump,” he said.

4240,Prostitute Who Gave Google Exec Fatal Drug Shot Is Deported - Breitbart,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  —   Federal immigration officials said Friday they were deporting a California prostitute to Canada after she completed a jail sentence for involuntary manslaughter for giving a fatal heroin shot to a Google executive she had been entertaining aboard his yacht. [Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman James Schwab said a judge ordered Alix Tichelman, 29, deported to Canada because of her felony convictions connected to the accidental overdose death of Forrest Hayes in November 2013. She also pleaded guilty to a felony charge of administering drugs.  Immigration agents arrested her after she finished her jail sentence on March 29. Schwab declined to disclose Tichelman’s immigration status in the United States or whether she was represented by an immigration attorney. The San Jose Mercury News reported Wednesday that Tichelman holds a permit to permanently work and live in the United States. The paper reported that Tichelman was raised in Georgia and spent little time in Canada. Police said a surveillance video at the harbor showed Tichelman at first panicking and trying to revive Hayes. Then it showed her casually step over Hayes’ body, finish a glass of wine and lower a blind before leaving the yacht. Hayes had hired Tichelman several times previously. They were doing drugs and having sex the night he died, authorities said. The   call girl was arrested eight months after Hayes’ death. After Tichelman was charged in California, police in Milton, Georgia, took another look at the 2013 overdose death of Tichelman’s former boyfriend Dean Riopelle, 53. He was the owner of a popular Atlanta music venue. Authorities said a panicked Tichelman had called Milton police, saying Riopelle had overdosed on drugs and wasn’t responding. Tichelman was not charged. An autopsy report listed Riopelle’s death as an accidental overdose of heroin, oxycodone and alcohol.",0
4241,The Hangman Diplomat: How Kissinger became a member of Russia's top academy,"November 1, 2016 - Fort Russ -  Anastasiya Kazimirko-Kirillova, Tsargrad - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


On October 28th, the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAN) selected its foreign members. This tradition dates back centuries and is of a more symbolic nature. In addition to bearing the honorary title, foreign members can participate in the life of RAN and even vote at the academy’s general meetings, even though they have no decisive vote.  
This year, the ranks of RAN’s foreign members expanded to include seven Nobel laureates, among them the well known diplomat and former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger… 
As reported by Boris Chetvertyushkin who announced the results of academicians’ voting, the procedure implies that scholars, including Kissinger, are informed of their nomination and give their consent. The Russian Academy of Science’s foreign members are chosen from among the greatest foreign scholars recognized by the scientific community. If it is clear why some were chosen for physics and chemistry, then Kissinger received the offer for his geopolitical studies. 
The historical role of Kissinger is still debated to this day, including in the US. He is usually respected for his agreement to end the war in Vietnam and the Cold War detente between the United States and USSR. Interestingly enough, the leader of the North Vietnamese Communists, Le Duc Tho, received the Nobel Prize together with Kissinger for the success of the Paris Agreement, but refused to accept the award.  
Then Kissinger overthrew the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia which, ironically, he had brought to power insofar as he was the initiator of secret missions in Cambodia which dropped 110,000 tons of bombs on the country and plunged it into bloody chaos and genocide. And the concept of the “honorable peace” which preceded the conclusion of the ceasefire in Vietnam and cost the lives of millions of Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans, not to mention wounded, injured and missing, is also one of Kissinger’s achievements. 
His other striking “achievement” was the fascist coup in Chile through which Augusto Pinochet came to power and submerged the country in mass purges and arrests. Only one month after the coup, 30,000 people had been killed.  
Kissinger also achieved rapprochement between the US and China against the USSR, which in the US is to this day considered to be one of his greatest successes. He has been called the modern Machiavelli and the architect of the new world order. 
Kissinger cannot but be admired as a worthy opponent. All the agreements, operations, and projects worked out by him, regardless of their cruelty and consequences, worked out brilliantly. This is why Kissinger’s services have always been used by all the powers in this world worth at least something. For decades, Kissinger has been a trustee of the Rockefeller clan. 
The 93-year-old diplomat came to Russia in 2016 to meet with Vladimir Putin and once again participate in the settlement of the new Cold War. Following their meeting, Kissinger wrote an article in which he expressed concern for the fate of the world. In his opinion, US-Russian relations are now worse than they were during his time as Secretary of State. He urged the two superpowers to work together, because this is the only way to maintain the otherwise shaky world balance. 
Kissinger is an old school diplomat symbolizing the peak of the US’ greatness. Today, he is a beneficial icon contrasted to the Obamas and Clintons who build their policies on the eternal dichotomy between imaginary US democracy and the imaginary totalitarianism of the US' opponents. Instead of ideology, Kissinger speaks of pragmatic things, real politik, and even his most ardent opponents' hatred for always contains an ounce of respect. 

The gesture of nominating Kissinger for the Russian Academy of Sciences can be perceived as Russia demonstrating its willingness to listen even to its geopolitical opponents. Russia supports a realistic approach and sober consideration of national interests, as opposed to the current American elite.

4242,Top U.S. General: ‘We Have Not Relaxed the Rules of Engagement’ in Mosul - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   The U. S. military has not “relaxed” the rules of engagement (ROE) to avoid civilian casualties in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State ( ) commonly known for using the home of innocent people as shelter and the inhabitants as shields, the top American commander in the region told lawmakers. [On Wednesday, American Gen. Joseph Votel, the chief of U. S. Central Command (CENTCOM) told the House Armed Services Committee:  The nature of this fight has evolved over the course of the operation on this two and a half year campaign, and our approach has evolved as well. One example of how we have evolved has been our effort to enable and entrust our leaders at the tactical edge with the authorities they need to help our partners win. We have not relaxed the rules of engagement. I have authorized Lt. Gen. [Stephen] Townsend to delegate the employment of rules of engagement to the appropriate level due to the tough urban fight that we knew was coming in Mosul. To be clear, there were no changes  …     to the rules of engagement that allows us to engage. Gen. Townsend is the top commander of U. S. ground troops in Iraq. Votel’s testimony came in response to an allegation by a human rights group that a recent decision to loosen the U. S. military’s rules of combat continues to fuel an ongoing spate in civilian casualties in the besieged Iraqi city of Mosul. The Amnesty International report explicitly highlights the death of an estimated 150 people in a U. S.  coalition airstrike on March 17, calling it “one of the deadliest strikes in years. ” Gen. Votel stressed that the U. S. military is investigating the allegation. Wednesday’s House panel hearing was focused on security challenges faced by Gen. Votel in his area of responsibility (AOR) which includes the Middle East and Northeast Africa as well as South and Central Asia. Echoing Gen. Townsend, the CENTCOM chief told House lawmakers, “There is a fair chance that our operations may have contributed to civilian casualties [in Mosul]. But I would highlight to each of you that this investigation continues, and there is still much to learn from this. ” Gen. Votel noted that the U. S. had assigned a general officer to dig up the facts of the incident and help the American military address the situation, adding: While we consider and establish accountability over our actions in this incident, I think is also important to clearly recognize that the enemy does use human shields, has little regard for human life and does attempt to use civilian casualty allegations as a tool to hinder our operations. And so they bear responsibility for this as well. Nevertheless, Amnesty’s report suggests that a loosening of American military combat rules under President Donald Trump are to blame for the high number of civilian casualties in Mosul. “The high civilian toll suggests that coalition forces leading the offensive in Mosul have failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” proclaimed Donatella Rovera, the senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty International, who carried out field investigations in Mosul. Alluding to the rise in civilian fatalities in Mosul, Votel told lawmakers, “This should be an indicator to you of how intense of a combat situation this is,” later adding, “The investigation [into the March 17 strike] will confirm or deny our initial impressions and highlight the lessons learned. ” The U. S. military believes ISIS may have rigged the building targeted by the coalition on March 17 with explosives after forcing civilians to hide inside. However, Amnesty insists alleged evidence collected in Mosul “points to an alarming pattern of U. S.  coalition airstrikes which have destroyed whole houses with entire families inside. ” Gen. Votel declared Wednesday: These are absolutely tragic and heartbreaking situations, And our hearts go out to the people of Mosul and of Iraq and other places where we are operating. We acknowledge our responsibility to operate at a higher standard. It is my responsibility as a combatant commander to ensure that our forces operate in accordance with those goals and standards. We take every allegation seriously, and we are executing  …    a   process to assess  —   and if necessary investigate each of these allegations  …    we are doing everything humanly possible to prevent these types of events and incidents from occurring as a result of our operations. The U. S.  coalition and its Iraqi allies believe Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria are ISIS’s last major strongholds in their ever diminishing   caliphate.",0
4243,Peshmerga forces won’t enter Iraq’s Mosul: Kurdish leader,"Iraq Leader of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, Masoud Barzani, (R) talks to Chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) Ammar Hakim (C) in Zartac Mountain, near Nineveh, October 27, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The leader of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region has assured that Kurdish Peshmerga forces will not set foot in Mosul during a joint operation with the army and allied fighters aimed at liberating the Daesh-held northern city. 
“The Peshmerga will not enter the city of Mosul,” Masoud Barzani said in a news conference with Chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) Ammar Hakim, in Zartac Mountain, near the city of Nineveh, on Thursday. 
Barzani further said the Kurdish fighters are coordinating their role in the Mosul liberation operation with the Iraqi military, adding that the collaboration will continue. 
The Kurdish leader further highlighted unity among different Iraqi political parties, adding that Daesh was no more a threat as most areas are back in control of the Iraqi forces. 
Last week, the Popular Mobilization Units, a mainly-Shia military group backing the Iraqi army in the Mosul offensive, also said its forces would not march into Mosul, adding that Iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city. 
Barzani further referred to recent Daesh terror activities in the Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk, saying the Takfiri terror group is making desperate attempts to cover up its defeats in the Mosul battle. 
“We were able to control the situation quickly and kill the terrorists,” the Kurdish leader said. 
Terrorists launched several rounds of attacks in the city of Kirkuk over the weekend as Iraqi officials are focused on the Mosul offensive. 
On Friday, at least 100 Daesh elements went on a rampage in Kirkuk to divert an Iraqi and Kurdish military advance on Mosul. The incident left 99 civilians and members of the security forces dead as well as 63 militants, according to Iraqi security officials.

(Photo by Reuters) 
For his part, Hakim highlighted the need for avoiding rifts in Iraq and staying focused on the fight against Daesh. 
He further stressed that a Turkish base present in Bashiqa near Mosul was not welcome. 
“This (Turkish) base, and the forces that came to the base, were present without coordination with the Iraqi government. They are armed forces, and we strongly refuse the participation of any non-Iraqi fighter in this battle,” Hakim said. 
Last December, Turkey deployed some 150 soldiers, equipped with heavy weapons and backed by 20 to 25 tanks, to the Bashiqa camp. 
Ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against Daesh, but Baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of Iraq’s sovereignty. 
Recently, Ankara claimed that his country is involved in the Mosul operation, but Baghdad denied such a role. 
Last week, the Iraqi army, volunteer Shia and Sunni fighters as well as Kurdish Peshmerga forces launched a long-awaited operation to wrest control of Mosul, the last stronghold of Daesh in the Arab country. 
Many believe that the recapture of Mosul, which fell to Daesh in 2014, would signal the terror outfit’s total defeat in Iraq. 
Iraqi Special Forces commanders said Thursday that the Mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city. 
“The operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned,” Special Forces Brigadier General Haider Fadhil said. 
In another development on Thursday, the US estimated that up to 900 Daesh terrorists have been killed in the Mosul liberation operation so far. 
General Joseph Votel, the head the US military’s Central Command, said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the Takfiris. 
There are between 3,500 and 5,000 Daesh elements in Mosul and up to another 2,000 in the broader area, according to US figures. 
More Daesh tunnels uncovered 
Also on Thursday, Iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by Daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of Bartella and Bazwaia, located between 5 and 7 kilometers east of Mosul. 
“When we entered the Khazna Taba neighborhood (in Bartella) and after we liberated it, we found several tunnels,” said Razed Qusai al-Kinani, a member of Iraqi Counterterrorism forces. 
One of the tunnels, which is 200 meters long and 10 meters deep, was used by Daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfit’s ringleaders to move around during the battle, he added. 
Elsewhere in the village of Tob Zawa, the Iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles. 
They also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road. Loading ...",0

4245,"South Korea to Elect New President in May, Government Says - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   South Koreans will go to the polls in May to elect a successor to Park   whose presidency ended last week in a historic court ruling, the government announced on Wednesday. The vote will be May 9, nearly two months after the Constitutional Court decision last Friday, which formally removed Ms. Park from office. The ruling approved the National Assembly’s December vote to impeach her. By law, the country must elect a new president within 60 days of the ruling, and all the major political parties have announced schedules for primary races to select their candidates. Prime Minister Hwang   who is serving as acting president, announced the date of the election. He also said that he would not run for the job, choosing to focus instead on his role as acting president during the transition period. Mr. Hwang, an ally of Ms. Park, had been cited as a potential candidate for conservatives in a race in which Moon   a liberal opposition leader, has been the consistent  . South Korea’s conservative camp, which has led the country for the last nine years, has been deeply discredited by the scandal engulfing Ms. Park and her former aides. In recent surveys, Mr. Hwang has been the only viable potential conservative candidate, but he has still ranked a distant second in the surveys, or third behind Ahn   a liberal provincial governor. “I know there are people who want me to run,” Mr. Hwang said on Wednesday. “But I have concluded that it is not appropriate for me to run and that I should focus on working for the stability of state affairs and the fair management of the presidential election. ” Ms. Park was the first South Korean leader forced from office under popular pressure since the country’s founding president, Syngman Rhee, fled into exile in Hawaii in 1960. Also on Wednesday, prosecutors summoned Ms. Park for questioning in the scandal. Although prosecutors have identified Ms. Park as a criminal suspect accused of bribery, extortion and abuse of power in recent months, they could not indict her or even summon her by force while she was president. But now that she is an ordinary citizen, prosecutors told her to appear for questioning next Tuesday. Prosecutors said that she conspired with her secretive longtime confidante, Choi   to collect tens of millions of dollars from big businesses like Samsung, and that some of the money represented bribes for political favors. Ms. Choi is already under arrest and on trial.",0
4246,Truth Will Out Radio: The Laconia Incident,"Radio Aryan October 28, 2016 
Sven Longshanks , Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt bring us another episode of Truth Will Out Radio, this week looking at the Laconia incident and the British Freikorps. 
Messerschmitt deviates somewhat with his Axis War Heroes series in that the main subject is not a person but the so-called “Laconia Incident”. In September 1942 a German U-boat under the Command of Werner Hartenstein torpedoed the British troopship Laconia. As Hartenstein realized that a lot of Italian prisoners of war and even civilians including women and children were among the survivors struggling for their lives he ordered that as many as possible were to be taken on board the U-boat. Even though he radioed his intentions to all surrounding vessels in plain English and had a Red Cross flag draped across the U-boat he and the survivors they were carrying were attacked by an American B-24. What happened to the survivors and what the response of the German Navy was when it learned of this atrocity is elaborated on by Schmitt and the presentation ends with a letter from a relative of one of the casualties, thanking the U-boat commanders for their courageous and honourable behaviour. 
This presentation shows how the Allies were breaking the rules of war while the Germans were keeping to their treaties. During the Nuremberg trials this incident was brought up in the hopes of convicting Admiral Doenitz for advising the U-boats not to pick up survivors, but it had the inadvertent effect of exposing the British and Americans of waging unrestricted submarine warfare, in itself a possible war crime as it breaks the law of the sea that any shipwrecked mariners must be rescued, no matter who they are. Dennis points out the hypocrisy of the British and Americans in this before reminding us that not all the British behaved like this during the war. Some became members of the Freikorps and fought to defend Europe from the Bolshevik menace alongside the other SS Volunteer Legions. These heroes were called traitors by the British establishment, yet their oath was to protect Europe from Communism, not to fight against Britain. It is a testament to the truthful ideology of National Socialism that prisoners of war could be set free to fight against Communism once they had heard the truth about it from their kinsmen in the League of St George. 
After giving us a brief history of these brave young British men, Dennis and Sven conclude the podcast by talking about the importance of race and how the Freikorps highlighted this in their propaganda.

More than a dozen copies of a mysterious text referred to as the Sumerian King Lists have been uncovered over the years by archaeologists in regions as disparate as ancient Babylon, Susa, and Assyria. They are all believed to be copies of a single original manuscript which is thought to have been written during the Third Dynasty of Ur by most historians, although some believe it might have been written even earlier. The best-preserved example of this ancient text is called the Weld-Blundell Prism and is on public display in the Ashmolean Museum. An ancient text tells of alien rulers of ancient Earth 
The Sumerian King Lists have baffled historians ever since they were uncovered by modern human beings. The text describes a fascinating period in history when beings referred to as gods ruled over humankind of tens of thousands of years. The manuscript makes reference to eight kings who ‘descended from heaven’ who ruled for an astonishingly long period of 241,200 years. Each of these deified kings met their end during the Great Flood which devastated the population of the world. After the flood, the text claims that another ‘kingship was lowered from heaven’ and that these beings took up control of the people of Earth once again . 
For a long time, it has been believed that the stories of these incredibly long-lived kings, their eventual demise, and their replacement were simply the mythology of the ancient civilization who compiled the Sumerian King List. However, some have speculated that the text might not be mythology at all. The fact that the kings are said to have descended from heaven has led a few people to suggest that they might have been of an otherworldly origin. This would mean that their incredibly long reigns over the cities might be literal rather than metaphorical as these alien beings might have had much longer lifespans than human beings. They may have even been immortal.

4248,Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs to Israel,"Fragment of Old Tax Bill Meant to Undercut Muslims' Claim to Important Mosque by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a “Muslim holy site of worship” was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. 
And the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they’re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. 
Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying Israel’s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” 
The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
4249,FLYNN: Obama Would Not Be First President to Spy on Political Enemies - Breitbart,"The president charges that the Obama administration conducted surveillance on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. His critics charge him with making baseless accusations. [Bernie Sanders labeled Trump’s claim “delusional,” a Politico article by Bradley Moss calls the notion “preposterous,” and Al Franken dubbed it “ridiculous. ” John McCain reentered the fray over the weekend, opining, “The president has one of two choices, either retract, or to provide the information that the American people deserve. ”  Put another way, either Barack Obama snooped or he didn’t snoop. President Trump releasing Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court requests may go a long way toward proving or disproving his claim. While forthcoming information may substantiate or invalidate Trump’s specific accusation, the general notion that presidents, particularly Democratic presidents, remain above abusing the security apparatus to violate civil liberties of private citizens ranks as, if not delusional, preposterous, and ridiculous, at least slightly naïve. If Barack Obama spied on a political enemy under the guise of spying on a foreign enemy, he finds himself in bad company. Contrary to the “shocked, shocked” reactions, presidents other than Richard Nixon abused power to abuse political enemies —  and violate the civil liberties of strangers. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Alien Act, the Sedition Act, Espionage Act, and the Trading with the Enemy Act, which empowered the federal government to send socialist leader Eugene Debs to prison for opposing the draft, to revoke the postal privileges of the American Socialist, the New York Call, and other   publications, and to deport sundry radicals, most notably on the famous “Soviet Ark. ” Although the president’s prejudices recently sparked a reorientation of his legacy among   liberals, his vindictive use of federal power to punish adversaries goes barely mentioned. President Franklin Roosevelt, over the objections of “Mr. Republican” Robert Taft, instituted an internment and relocation program for those of Japanese, German, and Italian descent in America. The Korematsu decision, in which six justices —  five appointed to the court and the sixth appointed as chief justice by the 32nd president —  upheld Roosevelt’s 1942 executive order barring Americans of   including the   Fred Korematsu, from residing on the West Coast. The order and decision regularly receive condemnation from Democrats decades after the fact. In real time, Democrats devised, praised, and upheld the constitutionality of the policy. President John F. Kennedy’s administration launched a federal invasion of Martin Luther King’s privacy that ended only with the minister’s death. The president’s brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, authorized wiretaps and bugs to glean personal information about King. The president, himself a man of great appetites, shared stories of King’s sexual interests, including allegedly attempting to organize a sex party coinciding with 1963’s March on Washington, with intimates. The prying says more about the Kennedys than King. But historians don’t say much about the role of the eavesdroppers. Taylor Branch, for instance, maintains that J. Edgar Hoover “manipulated” the Brothers Kennedy into hounding the   leader. This popular narrative imagines that the FBI director ordered around the president and the attorney general rather than the reverse. So many policies decried as infringements on civil liberties by today’s Democrats came into existence because yesterday’s Democrats regarded them as enlightened. The Palmer Raids and the McCarran Act got their names from a progressive Democrat and a conservative Democrat, respectively. Samuel Dickstein, the congressman whose resolution launched the House Committee on   Activities (HCUA) actually served as a paid agent of the Soviet Union. Republicans controlled the House, and its controversial committee, in just four of the 36 years of the   HCUA’s existence. Democrats jailed Eugene Debs, forcibly relocated Fred Korematsu and barred Joe DiMaggio’s   from his profession, and authorized the bugs that mined the most personal details from Martin Luther King’s private life. But trust them. They don’t do such things any longer.",0

4251,"Pilot of Vanished Malaysian Flight Had Deviant Route on His Simulator, Minister Says - The New York Times","The pilot of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner that mysteriously vanished more than two years ago had used his personal flight simulator to practice a path over the remote southern Indian Ocean, where the aircraft is believed to have crashed, the country’s transport minister said on Thursday. The remarks by the minister, Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, represented the first time the Malaysian government had acknowledged that the flight simulator belonging to the pilot of Flight 370, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, contained such a path, leading far from any route his airline flew. The minister did not say when the pilot might have practiced that route, and he emphasized that it was one of many found on the simulator, which the pilot kept at his home. The minister also said it would be premature to draw any conclusions from the disclosure. Nonetheless, it added to telltale indications that the aircraft, a Boeing   jet carrying 239 passengers and crew members, might have been deliberately crashed into the sea by Mr. Zaharie after departing Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8, 2014. “Yes, there is simulation showing it flew to many parts of the world,” the minister was quoted by Malaysia’s Bernama News Agency as saying at a monthly Transport Ministry briefing. The remote southern Indian Ocean route was “one of many,” he said. The minister appeared to be responding to a report published on July 22 by New York magazine, which said it had obtained a confidential document from a Malaysian police investigation showing that Mr. Zaharie had practiced the route on his simulator less than a month before Flight 370 disappeared “under uncannily similar circumstances. ” The magazine called the revelation, which was not in the Malaysia government’s public report on the Flight 370 investigation, the strongest evidence yet that the pilot had “made off with the plane in a premeditated act of mass  . ” Flight 370’s deviation from its planned route, taking the aircraft thousands of miles off course, remains a mystery of modern civil aviation. One of the working theories is that the plane flew for hours on autopilot with its crew dead or incapacitated and then crashed when its fuel ran out. Technical signals sent by the plane suggested that it might have wound up in a    area of the southern Indian Ocean, but aircraft and ships have scoured the area without turning up a sign of the aircraft. Last month, the three countries leading the search  —   Australia, China and Malaysia  —   said they would suspend the operation, but would revive it if “credible new information” emerged about the plane’s whereabouts. A small amount of debris believed to be from the plane has been found thousands of miles to the west. The most significant pieces appeared to be a wing part known as a flaperon  —   discovered last year on Réunion, an island near Madagascar that is part of France  —   and another wing segment found more recently near the coast of Tanzania. A prominent crash investigator caused a stir last weekend by asserting that the flaperon appeared to have been placed in an extended position when it hit the water, and that it had to have been done deliberately. The assertion by the investigator, Larry Vance, who led an inquiry into the 1998 crash of Swissair Flight 111 in the Atlantic Ocean, has not been confirmed by officials in charge of the Flight 370 inquiry. “Somebody was flying the airplane at the end of its flight,” Mr. Vance said in an interview on Australia’s “60 Minutes” program. “Somebody was flying the airplane into the water. There is no other alternate theory that you can follow. ”",0
4252,Melania Trump’s ‘America First’ Inaugural Wardrobe - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   In the end, she checked every box. Elegant, unexpected dress? Check. Unknown designer elevated to overnight sensation? Check. New York brand? Check. Implicit message about cooperation and embracing the melting pot? Check. When Melania Trump took the stage with her husband, President Trump, on Friday night for the inaugural balls, she demonstrated that, while she may have been out of the spotlight since the election, she hasn’t been sticking her head in the sand. She has been closely studying the vernacular of first lady dress. In an architectural    white crepe column with a thin burgundy ribbon as a belt, a high slit and a gazar wave curving from sleeve to hip and then down the skirt, she looked  —   especially when compared with the younger generation of Trump women, most of whom opted for   sparkling princess gowns  —   understated and adult. Not remotely mired in the 1980s, though her husband’s look and rhetoric may be. And despite rampant speculation about the designer behind the dress, she cannily managed to surprise the entire fashion world. The gown was, according to a statement from her office, a “collaboration” between Mrs. Trump and the designer Hervé Pierre, a Frenchman who moved to New York in the early 1990s and eventually became creative director of Carolina Herrera, where he and Mrs. Trump met and where he worked on clothes for Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, though largely behind the scenes. He left that post last February. This is his first major dress under his own name (he does not yet have a   collection in that context). It will eventually join the exhibit of first ladies gowns at the Smithsonian stretching back to Helen Taft in 1909. Though rumors had surfaced earlier in the week that Mrs. Trump was working with Chanel’s creative director Karl Lagerfeld on her gown, in the end she used the opportunity  —   and indeed, her entire inaugural wardrobe  —   to do what her husband, standing on the steps of the Capitol building, said they would do: “follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. ” After over 20 years in this country, Mr. Pierre counts. Indeed, with one notable exception  —   Kellyanne Conway’s       coat at the   which looked like she might have borrowed it off a toy soldier (it was her “Trump revolution wear” she told reporters) but in fact turned out to be a $3, 600 design from the Italian brand Gucci  —   the inaugural weekend overall was a series of America First fashion moments, literally and metaphorically. And not just when it came to the women. There has been a lot of speculation over whether the office of president will change Mr. Trump  —   encourage moderation of his Twitter account, for example, or his language. As yet that is unclear, but it does appear to have changed how his family dresses. On Friday the president wore an overcoat and shirt to the   said to be by Brooks Brothers, the American men’s wear brand that outfitted 39 presidents before him. Lincoln, Grant, Chester Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Barack Obama wore Brooks Brothers for their   ceremonies, and Mr. Obama even wore his overcoat again on Friday when he stood with Mr. Trump. For a man who often overtly rejected the Washington establishment and what came before in his speech, it was nevertheless a nod to tradition and history. The day before, Melania Trump (who during the campaign tended toward European brands) stepped off the military jet that brought the Trumps to Washington for a   ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery in a strict,     coat by Norisol Ferrari, a small, independent New York designer who described herself to WWD as a “  minority woman. ” Then, that evening at the donors’ black tie dinner, the first lady wore a   nude sequined gown by Reem Acra, the   designer based in New York. And Ivanka Trump wore three different outfits from Oscar de la Renta, a   name of New York Fashion Week: a   coat and matching dress to Arlington a    gown to the donor’s dinner and a white pantsuit to the  . (Oscar de la Renta himself dressed both Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush for their husbands’ second inaugural balls the brand is something of an inaugural  .) For the balls, she donned Carolina Herrera. It was when Mrs. Trump wore a Ralph Lauren     cashmere dress and coat to the Inauguration Day festivities, however, that it became indubitable that something strategic was going on. It is not just because Mr. Lauren is a designer who has built an empire on the mythology of the American dream, or because he has outfitted the U. S. Olympic team and donated $13 million to help restore the   Banner at the National Museum of American History. And it is not because he had dressed four first ladies before, crossing political parties in service to the role. It is because the dress and coat he made for Mrs. Trump, in shape and shade, created an image that was redolent of nothing so much as Jacqueline Kennedy at her Camelot inaugural, with all the new beginnings and freighted history that implies. Whatever you think of the reality of that connection  —   and on social media, there was a lot of verbal    —   the outfit oozed appropriateness. If it looked like something of a first lady costume, and it did, it also suggested that Mrs. Trump had studied up and was prepared to assume the starring role she played later in the evening. Just as Ivanka Trump’s trouser suit, which was designed by Fernando Garcia, one half of the new young creative duo at Oscar de la Renta, seemed a sign of the unofficial role she has often suggested she will pursue: women’s advocate. White pantsuits, after all, became famous over the summer when Hillary Clinton wore one, also by Ralph Lauren, to accept the Democratic nomination for president, at least in part in acknowledgment of the suffragists, who chose white as one of their signature colors. Later, the white outfits were adopted as a uniform of sorts by   women as they went to the polls. It was thus a fairly pointed (and, to some, poignant) moment when Mrs. Clinton appeared in a final white Ralph Lauren pantsuit to accompany her husband to the inauguration  —   a suit that had been made as part of her campaign collaboration with Mr. Lauren, but never worn. And it was probably not by chance that Ms. Trump selected a similar look. The politics of clothing may be subtle, and may strike some as frivolous, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t a requisite part of the pageantry that surrounds the presidency  —   especially on a day with more photo opportunities than speeches. They paint a picture of the family that now represents the country, of their ambitions, goals and values, at a moment when the world is watching. This time, the brush strokes swirled: not with accessibility, but with aspiration, and nationalism. A case of the emperor’s new clothes, or a harbinger of things to come? We’ll have to keep looking to find out.",0
4253,"Vote as if your life depended upon it, because it does.","Eric Zuesse Here’s why: Hillary has repeatedly said: “We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe.” This would mean that U.S. fighter-jets and missiles would be shooting down the fighter-jets and missiles of the Syrian government over Syria, and would also be shooting down those of Russia. The Syrian government invited Russia in, as its protector; the U.S. is no protector but an invader against Syria’s legitimate government, the Ba’athist government, led by Bashar al-Assad. The CIA has been trying ever since 1949 to overthrow Syria’s Ba’athist government — the only remaining non-sectarian government in the Middle East other than the current Egyptian government. The U.S. supports Jihadists who demand Sharia law, and they are trying to overthrow and replace Syria’s institutionally secular government. For the U.S. to impose a no-fly zone anywhere in Syria would mean that the U.S. would be at war against Russia over Syria’s skies. Whichever side loses that conventional air-war would then have to choose whether to surrender, or instead to use nuclear weapons against the other side’s homeland, in order for it to avoid surrendering. That’s nuclear war between Russia and the United States. Would Putin surrender? Would Hillary? Would neither? If neither does, then nuclear war will be the result. Here are the two most extensive occasions in which Hillary has stated her position on this: To the Council on Foreign Relations, on 19 November 2015: We should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no-fly zones that will stop Assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air. Opposition forces on the ground, with material support from the coalition, could then help create safe areas where Syrians could remain in the country, rather than fleeing toward Europe. This combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the Turkish border from ISIS, choking off its supply lines. It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing. … QUESTION: When you were secretary of state, you tended to agree a great deal with the then-Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. Gates was opposed to a no-fly zone in Syria; thought it was an act of war that was risky and dangerous. This seems to me the major difference right now between what the president — what Obama’s administration is doing and what you’re proposing. Do you not — why do you disagree with Bob Gates on this? CLINTON: Well, I — I believe that the no-fly zone is merited and can be implemented, again, in a coalition, not an American-only no-fly zone. I fully respect Bob and his knowledge about the difficulties of implementing a no-fly zone. But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force. And I think we have a chance to do that now. We have a no-fly zone over northern Iraq for years to protect the Kurds. And it proved to be successful, not easy — it never is — but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans. I also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they’re going to do. And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now. So I see it as both a strategic opportunity on the ground, and an opportunity for leverage in the peace negotiations. … QUESTION: Jim Ziren (ph), Madam Secretary. Hi. Back to the no- fly zone. are you advocating a no-fly zone over the entire country or a partial no-fly zone over an enclave where refugees might find a safe haven? And in the event of either, do you foresee see you might be potentially provoking the Russians? CLINTON: I am advocating the second, a no-fly zone principally over northern Syria close to the Turkish (ph) border, cutting off the supply lines, trying to provide some safe refuges for refugees so they don’t have to leave Syria, creating a safe space away from the barrel bombs and the other bombardments by the Syrians. And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that. [She expects Putin to join America’s bombing of Syria’s government and troops and shooting-down of Russia’s planes in Syria, but no question was raised about this.] … To have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone … for Syrians so they wouldn’t have to leave but also for humanitarian relief, … would give us this extra leverage that I’m looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria. During a debate against Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries: Hillary Clinton, in a debate with Bernie on 19 December 2015, argued for her proposal that the U.S. impose in Syria a “no-fly zone” where Russians were dropping bombs on the imported jihadists who have been trying to overthrow and replace Assad: “I am advocating the no-fly zone both because I think it would help us on the ground to protect Syrians; I’m also advocating it because I think it gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.” She said there that allowing the jihadists to overthrow Assad “would help us on the ground to protect Syrians,” somehow; and, also, that, somehow, shooting down Russia’s planes in Syria (the “no-fly zone”) “gives us some leverage in our conversations with Russia.” Bernie Sanders’s response to that was: “I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.” He didn’t mention nuclear war as one of them. The “no-fly zone” policy is one of three policies she supports that would likely produce nuclear war; she supports all of them, not merely the “no-fly zone.” Hillary Clinton has never been asked “What would you do if Russia refuses to stop its flights in Syria?” Donald Trump has said nothing about the proposal for a no-fly zone (other than “I want to sit back and see what happens” ), because most Americans support that idea , and he’s not bright enough to take her on about it and ask her that question. Probably, if he were supportive of it, he’d have said so — in which case it wouldn’t still be an issue in this election. Trump muffed his chance — which he has had on several occasions. But clearly he, unlike her, has not committed himself on this matter. Hillary Clinton is obviously convinced that the U.S. would win a nuclear war against Russia . The question for voters is whether they’re willing to bet their lives that she is correct about that, and that even if the U.S. ‘wins’, only Russia and not also the U.S. (and the world) would be destroyed if the U.S. nuclear-attacks Russia. Every other issue in this election pales by comparison to the no-fly-zone issue, which is virtually ignored, in favor of issues that are trivial by comparison. But a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for nuclear war against Russia, regardless of whether or not the voters know this. And a vote for Trump is a vote for the unknown. Could the unknown be even worse than Hillary Clinton? If so, would it be so only in relatively trivial ways? This election should be about Hillary Clinton, not about Donald Trump.",0

4255,Australia Plans to Revoke Passports of Child Sex Offenders - Breitbart,"The Australian government is planning to revoke the passports of child sex offenders as part of a new law aimed at cracking down on pedophiles who engage in child sex tourism. [The proposed law, which was unveiled by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop Tuesday, would affect approximately 20, 000 registered sex offenders who already served their sentences but must periodically report to authorities if they are still under supervision, NPR reported.  The Associated Press reports 2, 500 newly convicted pedophiles are estimated to be added to the sex offender registry every year and would be required to forfeit their passports. Approximately 3, 200 serious offenders would be banned from travel outside the country for life, but less serious offenders would be able to get themselves off the registry if they report to the authorities regularly and comply with the law for several years and renew their passports. “This new legislation represents the toughest crackdown on child sex tourism by any government, anywhere,” Bishop said. Bishop added that the nation is “determined to prevent the sexual exploitation of vulnerable young children overseas. ” The law prohibits child sex offenders from traveling to what Bishop says are “vulnerable countries” where children susceptible to being harmed are not under the jurisdiction of Australian law enforcement. Child sex tourism can be defined as “the exchange of cash, clothes, food or some other form of consideration to a child or to a third party for sexual contact,” according to ECPAT International, a     that aims to combat sexual exploitation of children. NPR reports that in 2016 alone, 800 child sex offenders traveled abroad, and half of them traveled to southeast Asia, where these types of crimes are rampant. Lawmakers in the   group of countries called on Australia to do something about the issue. Australia’s ABC reports that sex offenders are required under the current law to tell authorities about any overseas travel, but many do not report their travel to authorities. The law will be introduced in Parliament this week.",0
4256,EPA Chief Scott Pruitt Calls for ’Exit’ of Paris Climate Agreement - Breitbart,"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Scott Pruitt, has called for America to “exit” the Paris Climate Agreement signed by Barack Obama last November. [In an interview with FOX and Friends, Pruitt said that “Paris [agreement] is something that we need to really look at closely. It’s something we need to exit in my opinion. ”  “It’s a bad deal for America,” he continued. “It was an America second, third, or fourth kind of approach. China and India had no obligations under the agreement until 2030. We   all of our costs. ” Pruitt’s comments increase the likelihood the U. S. will pull out of the agreement, which requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions to limit global temperature rise, as well as regularly report on their progress. Pruitt has previously referred to the agreement as a “bad deal,” but has never openly called for America to quit. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump was a prominent critic of the deal, promising to “cancel” it, and this week he refused to sign a statement endorsing the agreement. Although Trump could not instantly pull America out, he could initiate the process for the country’s exit. Since taking office, Trump has revoked a range of environmental legislation —  including Barack Obama’s climate orders —  with a plan to focus on energy independence and revitalize the coal industry. In his first White House budget, Trump also proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA’s overall budget. However, reports in March suggested that members of Trump’s senior team were divided over pulling out of the deal, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his own daughter Ivanka advising him not to pull the plug over concerns it would upset major allies. On Thursday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry confirmed that his department is conducting a review of all energy policy, adding that it was “the right to do. ” You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com",0
4257,Grace & Steel Podcast: Hillary Unveils Final Campaign Slogan: “Something Wicked This way Comes”,"November 8, 2016, 11:00 am A+ | a- Warning   
Episode 60 of my podcast is now posted here (with copious links) and on YouTube . I joked a few weeks ago that Hillary Clinton will not be elected President because “God doesn’t hate America.” And then I woke up on Saturday and learned that John Podesta, Hillary’s grey eminence, has an especial interest in a Satanic artist called Marina Abramović. Later that day, I learned that a DC pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong (which is owned by David Brock’s ex-lover) is an especial favorite of the Hillary team and has, shall we say, a sinister take on what constitutes “kid friendly.” 
After such knowledge, what forgiveness? We recorded this show before James Comey announced that the FBI investigation into Hillary’s emails is OFF ON OFF. Hillary’s supporters made a little holiday in their hearts, but I can’t but help think this is too late to save her. There has never been a major-party candidate for President who boasts such a unique combination of incompetence and corruption. The elite and the media are entirely on her side, but of course Wikileaks has revealed that so many members of the MSM can be regarded only as unofficial Hillary staffers, and in the event the people are no longer buying what they are selling. 
I daresay Hillary has a program, but the MSM has not deigned to inform us what it is. They know that the destruction of the American nation is no longer as popular as it once was, and that Hillary faces a challenger, Donald Trump, who has promised the American people that “Invade the world; invite the world; immiserate the world” will no longer be American policy when he becomes President. 
So the MSM has instead instructed Americans that they daren’t vote for Trump because he’s a sexual vulgarian and a big meanie who has engaged in fat shaming. They forget (or at least pretend to) that it was Hillary’s husband, Bill Clinton, who administered the coup de grâce to American public modesty. 
Trump has a program, one that is expressed powerfully and succinctly in his two-minute YouTube video, “Donald Trump’s Argument For America.” America First. America for Americans, not America for bankers, globalists and the theorists of “Cheap chalupas.” Fancy that. The MSM was roused to fury by Trump’s heartfelt patriotism and accused him of “anti-Semitism.” A serious error. These people have no idea of the force they have unleashed. In asserting that it is forbidden to criticize Jewish malefactors solely because they are Jewish, they have given credence to the most sweeping anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. You hear the words “failed”&“corrupt”& you think, “He means the Jews.” So revealing #Trumpslide https://t.co/TMVJCO4I3G 
— Kevin Michael Grace (@KMGVictoria) November 5, 2016 
The MSM forgets (or at least pretends to) that Trump is not John McCain or Mitt Romney. He has no interest in virtue-signalling, particularly to those who do not bother to hide their dishonesty and malice. Trump has demonstrated, repeatedly, that he cannot be cowed. 
This is indeed an existential election, and I remain confident that America will choose the candidate committed to the American nation.

4258,Fungus: The Hidden Cause of Almost Every Major Disease?,"Fungus: The Hidden Cause of Almost Every Major Disease? Oct 29, 2016 Previous post 
There is reason to believe that fungus could be the hidden cause of many diseases from the flu all the way to cancer. 
Sounds like a big claim and a sweeping generalization, but when you take a closer look at it, you will be staggered to discover just how ubiquitous the humble fungus is, and how much ill-health it can cause. 
Let’s start at the beginning. Nature has a way of eliminating old, decaying matter, whether plant or animal: the fungus. While bacteria are also decomposers, fungi are largely unrecognized for the role they can play in disease, and breaking down the human body prematurely. 
Not all every kind of fungus is “bad” or harmful to your health. For example, many of the Chinese and Japanese medicinal mushrooms, such as reishi, shiitake and maitake, are among the greatest stimulators of the immune system and are superb natural remedies. Other mushrooms like the common button mushroom are also good for your health and high in certain nutrients like vitamin D, which is hard to get from food sources. 
However, I am focusing here not on the more rare beneficial types of fungus, but on the more common and widespread deleterious types of fungus, including yeast (candida), strains of mold and mycotoxins.

4259,Time Is Not on Your Side When It Comes to Credit Debt - The New York Times,"THE decorations have been put away, and mailboxes are now filling with credit card bills instead of holiday cards. If you binged on gifts and entertainment in December and your card balances are higher than you were expecting, it’s important to make a plan to pay down the debt as quickly as possible, credit experts say. “Don’t put those bills aside, thinking they’ll look better if you come back to them later,” said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. When it comes to paying down   card debt, he said, “time is not your friend. ” If you have sound credit but got a bit carried away with   spending, you may want to consider transferring your balances to a   credit card. Zero percent balance transfer offers allow you to affordably pay the debt over time, and some cards are offering people with healthy credit scores terms as long as 12 to 21 months, said Nick Clements, a   of MagnifyMoney. The catch, he said, is that consumers must be disciplined and make the payments on time, or they risk losing the promotional offer. That means they will be back to paying   interest rates. Also, he said, try to find a card that doesn’t charge a transfer fee, which often is 3 to 4 percent of the balance being transferred. If you have a large balance, you may not be able to transfer the full amount, depending on the new card’s credit limit. But, he noted, you can save money by transferring even part of the debt to a 0 percent card. Another option that is becoming more common, Mr. Clements said, is a personal loan, often made by online lenders or, increasingly, traditional banks. The loans are unsecured, just like the debt from a credit card, but they have a fixed repayment term  —   typically three to five years. Some lenders will make loans for larger amounts, and interest rates can be as low as 5 or 6 percent for borrowers with good credit. But Mr. Clements cautioned that the loans might have upfront fees and, because they are   loans, borrowers must make uniform monthly payments. Borrowers can’t fall back on making low “minimum” payments, as they can with a credit card if money gets tight. “That flexibility goes away,” he said. Also, rates will be higher for those with    credit. So you will need to compare the rate on your card with the loan rate to see if you will actually save money. Often, he said, borrowers can check their potential rate without having the inquiry affect their credit report. To help keep card balances from getting out of hand in the first place, Julie Pukas, head of United States bank card and merchant services at TD Bank, suggests that cardholders make use of text or email alerts to notify them when their spending is approaching their credit limit, when their balance reaches a certain limit or when a payment is due. “They can help get control of their accounts just by receiving reminders,” she said. Ms. Pukas also suggested that cardholders using rewards programs check to see if they can receive their points or   rewards as a credit on their card statement to help pay down their balance. Bill Hardekopf, the chief executive of LowCards. com, recommended that consumers try making micropayments over the course of a month, rather than waiting until the account due date to make a   payment. If you have extra cash, you can make a payment at any time and reduce the interest you will pay if you carry a balance, he said. Here are some questions and answers about paying off credit cards: What credit cards currently offer 0 percent interest without a transfer fee? Chase Slate offers 15 months at 0 percent without a transfer fee, and some credit unions offer 12 months with no transfer fee, Mr. Clements said. Other cards have relatively low balance transfer fees of 3 percent and lengthy terms: Citibank’s Simplicity card offers 21 months, and Discover It offers 18 months. What is the best way to pay off multiple credit cards? One way is to list all your cards, in order of highest interest rate to lowest, regardless of the balance. You put all of your extra cash toward paying down the first card balance, then move down the list until all are paid off. (You must continue making at least the minimum monthly payment on all the cards, to keep them in good standing.) The thinking with this ladder method is that paying off the most costly debt first saves you money. But some consumers with multiple cards may do better paying off the smallest balance first. Most people don’t even know what the interest rates are on their various cards (the average consumer has four) and the rates on cards held by a single consumer tend to be similar, since they are based on one’s credit score, said Remi Trudel, assistant professor of marketing at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University. He and several colleagues recently published a study suggesting that paying off the card with the smallest debt first provides a feeling of accomplishment and encourages consumers to keep going and pay off more debt. “It’s more motivating,” he said. Once I pay off a card balance, should I close the account? Ms. Pukas of TD Bank says she generally doesn’t recommend closing card accounts, since doing so may actually harm your credit score. (Closing an account can affect your utilization score, a measure of how much credit you have available.) Rather, she suggests putting the card aside in a drawer for safekeeping.",0

4261,‘Doomsday Today in Aleppo’: Assad and Russian Forces Bombard City - The New York Times,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia  —   Syria’s war escalated abruptly on Friday as government forces and their Russian allies launched ferocious aerial assaults on   areas of Aleppo amid threats of a big ground offensive, while efforts at the United Nations to revive a   appeared to collapse. Repeated airstrikes that obliterated buildings and engulfed neighborhoods in flames killed about 100 people in Aleppo, the divided northern Syrian city that has epitomized the horrors of the war, turning the brief   of last week and hopes for humanitarian relief into faint memories. The bombings knocked out running water to an estimated two million people, the United Nations said. “It is the worst day that we’ve had for a very long time,” said James Le Mesurier, the head of Mayday Rescue, which trains Syrian rescue workers. “They are calling it  . ” A video shot by a witness showed buildings burning after an airstrike on the Mwasalat neighborhood in the eastern part of the city. The bombings shook the ground, left residents cowering in their homes and made streets impassable, according to   activists in Aleppo. “You don’t know if you might stay alive or not,” said Modar Shekho, a nurse at   hospital in an   part of the city. “There are no more roads to walk on,” said Zaher Azzaher, an Aleppo activist reached through WhatsApp. “Even between our neighborhoods, the roads are full of rubble and destruction. ” The assault left residents buried in debris, including a child in the   neighborhood of the city. The bombardment targeted   districts in eastern Aleppo and opposition communities in the surrounding countryside. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which opposes the government and tracks the conflict from Britain, said 72 people had been killed in all of Aleppo Province, including 24 women and children. But most of the dead were in the city itself. Mr. Le Mesurier reported 95 dead and 147 people hospitalized in Aleppo city alone. Rescue workers shared numerous videos of men digging children out of piles of debris and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. Hanaa Singer, the representative for Unicef in Syria, said in a statement that attacks had damaged the pumping station that provides water to eastern Aleppo, where 250, 000 residents are surrounded by government troops. In retaliation, she said, a pumping station in the city’s eastern side was shut off, stopping water from flowing to 1. 5 million residents in the city’s western side. The population would have to rely on well water, which is often contaminated and would raise the risk of outbreaks of disease, she sad. Ammar   head of the Aleppo branch of Syria Civil Defense, a volunteer rescue organization, said that three of his group’s centers had been bombed and that some of their rescue vehicles had been knocked out. “It is as if Russia and the regime used the truce only to maintain their weapons and plan on next targets,” Mr. Salmo said from Aleppo. “It is like doomsday today in Aleppo. ” The Syrian government announced the new offensive in its   news media, quoting an unidentified Syrian military official who described the Aleppo operation as “comprehensive” and said it could continue for some time. The official said the operation would “include a ground offensive. ” That appeared unlikely, as many analysts have said that the Syrian military does not have the manpower to seize and hold significant territory. Its air force, however, has been able to pummel   areas with relative impunity. As airstrikes intensified, any hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough between Russia and the United States, which support opposite sides in the conflict, disintegrated in New York, on the sidelines of the annual conclave of the United Nations General Assembly. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, met briefly but there was no indication that a   cessation of hostilities that ended early this week could be revived anytime soon. Speaking at his own news conference, Mr. Lavrov said the United States had failed to ensure that moderate Syrian rebels separated themselves from extremist militants of the   Nusra Front. That separation is one of the conditions in the    agreement Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov announced on Sept. 9. Until that happens, Mr. Lavrov said, any other measures would be “senseless. ”   Ayrault, the foreign minister of France and a member of the International Syria Support Group, the   effort led by Russia and the United States, said earlier on Friday that he feared that the diplomatic paralysis reflected a growing weariness with the daily brutalities in Syria. “Will we be inured to this?” he asked. “Let’s not let Aleppo become the   Guernica. ” Aleppo, Syria’s largest city and industrial center before the civil war began in 2011, has been divided for years between government and rebel forces. Before the partial   declared last week, rebels often shelled civilian neighborhoods in western Aleppo, and the government of Bashar   regularly bombed   eastern Aleppo, cutting civilians off from   aid. The map below, based on data from a United Nations report issued in February, shows the location of damaged buildings in Aleppo. A preliminary analysis of new satellite imagery from as recently as this month shows more damage, said Lars Bromley, a research adviser at Unosat, a branch of the United Nations that has analyzed satellite data since the conflict began. The more recent destruction has occurred on the northwest outskirts of the city and in industrial areas in the northeast. Despite the violence, most of the city’s front lines have remained stable, with both sides lacking the manpower necessary to seize and hold significant new territory.",0
4262,White House Fence Jumper Was on Grounds 17 Minutes Before Detection - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A California man who climbed over the White House fence last week managed to roam undetected on the grounds for about 17 minutes, as Secret Service agents appeared to ignore several alarms, officials said Friday. The new details indicated that the episode was more serious than the Secret Service had originally stated. A Republican lawmaker said it also suggested the Secret Service’s security measures remain inadequate two and a half years after a series of lapses tarred the agency and led to major upheaval. In a separate episode, officials also reported Friday that a Secret Service laptop was stolen from an agency vehicle in Brooklyn. But the Secret Service said in a statement about the theft that agency laptops are fully encrypted and “are not permitted to contain classified information. ” The   episode took place on the night of March 10, and President Trump was inside the White House residence at the time. Jonathan   Tran, 26, of Milpitas, Calif. breached the outer perimeter of the White House by the Treasury Department building while carrying a backpack holding two cans of pepper spray, a book by Mr. Trump, a letter to the president and other items, the authorities said. After an officer ultimately detained him, Mr. Tran  —   who appears to have a history of mental illness  —   said, “I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,” according to a court filing. “Secret Service did a fantastic job last night,” Mr. Trump said the next day. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote in a letter on Friday to the Secret Service that the committee received “additional information” about the episode, including indications that Mr. Tran “may have moved around on the White House grounds undetected for a considerable amount of time. ” The Secret Service said in a statement late Friday that Mr. Tran, after climbing several gates as high as eight feet, was inside the grounds for about 17 minutes before he was apprehended at 11:38 p. m. The agency said it is conducting an investigation. CNN first reported on the new details in the case. Mr. Chaffetz also said that the committee had received information indicating that the Secret Service “ignored” alarms that Mr. Tran tripped and that he may have attempted to get into the White House itself. “If true, these allegations raise questions about whether the agency’s security protocols are adequate,” Mr. Chaffetz said, stressing “longstanding concerns” about security episodes at facilities protected by the Secret Service. Last week’s   recalled an embarrassing episode for the Secret Service in September 2014, when an intruder with a knife, Omar J. Gonzalez, managed to run through the ceremonial East Room of the White House before he was apprehended. The Secret Service was criticized for playing down the severity of the episode until a fuller account emerged in an investigation by a House subcommittee led by Mr. Chaffetz. That episode, along with a series of other safety lapses revealed at the time, led to intense congressional criticism, a   of the Secret Service’s top management and the addition of spikes atop the White House fencing to deter climbers. Plans were recently approved for a taller, stronger fence. A 2015 report by the House Oversight Committee called the Secret Service “an agency in crisis” and found that over a   period, there had been 143 security breaches and attempted security breaches at secured facilities.",0
4263,Norway Moves Towards ’Third Gender’ Option for Passports - Breitbart,"Norway’s Labour party will look at introducing a third gender category if they are voted to power in the general election due to take place later this year. [And it’s only a matter of time before the other parties get behind the idea now that Labour’s draft programme for   says Norway “should consider introducing a third gender category” according to a member of the programme committee.  “People who define themselves as neither male nor female would have the opportunity of being legally recorded as a third gender” Mani Hussaini, who also leads the   Workers Youth League, told NRK. “For example in a person’s passport it would say they were not male or female but instead belong in a third gender category. “I believe all people should have the opportunity to live out their identity and then have to adapt the laws to reality and not vice versa,” he explained. Asserting that there’s a “broad mood” in favour of the proposal, Hussaini told the public broadcaster he’s confident that other parties will back the option for Norwegians to legally ‘become’ a third gender. “I feel that [people who claim to be neither male nor female are] a movement. When the country’s largest party backs [creating a third gender option] I expect we’ll see all the other parties following suit. ” Health spokesman for Centre, part of the   coalition which governed Norway until 2013, said her party isn’t ready to support the creation of another gender category. Kjersti Toppe told NRK: “It is an issue, but to amend the law to introduce a third gender would affect us all. It’s a proposal that Centre are nowhere near ready to consider. ” Left party politician Kjetil Kjenseth said it’s “only a matter of time” before a third gender is written into law, asserting that “support is high among younger representatives of several parties”. Proposed by the Left party, but supported by just the Greens and the Socialist Left Party, Norway’s parliament overwhelmingly voted against the introduction of a third gender category last April. Explaining his support for the policy, Kjenseth told NRK: “[The introduction of a third gender] doesn’t mean much for the rest of us, but would greatly benefit those who don’t find their gender expressed in the categories of male and female. “This applies not only to transgender people but also a great number of heterosexuals who have alternating gender expression. ”",0
4264,"Kim Jong-nam, the Hunted Heir to a Dictator Who Met Death in Exile - The New York Times","SEOUL, South Korea  —   When North Korea held a state funeral for its leader, Kim   in 2011, one son was conspicuously absent. The absence of Kim    —   the eldest son of the family, who was bound by Korean tradition to preside over the funeral  —   was all the evidence outside analysts needed to see how isolated he had become from the center of power in North Korea, the world’s most secretive regime. Never fully accepted by his family, sidelined by his powerful stepmother and haunted by fears of assassins, Mr. Kim lived much of his life wandering abroad, in Moscow, Geneva, Beijing, Paris and Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave. On Monday, Mr. Kim, 45, met his end at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. According to the National Intelligence Service of South Korea, he was poisoned by two women who appeared to be carrying out an assassination order from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr. Kim died on his way to the hospital. Two women have been detained in connection with the killing. It remains uncertain if Mr. Kim was traveling alone or if bodyguards were present. It was also unclear how many people were involved in the attack. Grainy footage released on Wednesday showed a woman suspected of being one of the assassins, who appeared to be of Asian descent and wore a shirt emblazoned with “LOL” in large letters, before she fled the airport. The Royal Malaysia Police announced late Wednesday afternoon that they had arrested a woman that morning and that she had been carrying a Vietnamese passport in Terminal 2, where the attack occurred. They said she was “positively identified” from   video, and was alone at the time of her arrest. She was identified as Doan Thin Hoang, 28, according to the inspector general of the police, Khalid Abu Bakar. On Thursday, the Malaysian police said they had detained a second suspect, a woman with an Indonesian passport. A police official told the Bernama news agency that more arrests were expected. The authorities also said that an autopsy on Mr. Kim had been completed. There were no markers or police tape at Terminal 2 on Wednesday to indicate that a crime had been committed. Airport workers said that they had been ordered not to discuss the case. South Korea’s acting president, Hwang   said on Wednesday that his government was working with the Malaysian authorities to find the assailants. But officials in Seoul quickly pointed fingers at Mr. Kim’s half brother, the North Korean leader Kim   who has ordered the executions of  a number of senior officials, including his own uncle, who have been deemed potential challenges to his authority. Ever since Kim   succeeded his father in 2011, “there has been a standing order” to assassinate his half brother, Lee   the director of the South’s National Intelligence Service, said during a   briefing at the National Assembly, according to lawmakers who attended it. “This is not a calculated action to remove Kim   because he was a challenge to power per se, but rather reflected Kim  ’s paranoia,” Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. Kim   wanted his half brother killed, Mr. Lee said, and there was an assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid of assassins that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012. “Please withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape is to choose suicide. ” Mr. Lee said that Kim   had no power base inside North Korea, where Kim   had swiftly established his monolithic rule with what the South called a reign of terror. Kim   arrived in Malaysia last week, Mr. Lee said. He was in line at the airport to check in for a flight to Macau on Monday morning when he was attacked by the two women, Mr. Lee said, citing security camera footage from the airport. The women fled the airport in a taxi, Mr. Lee said. If North Korea’s involvement is proved, Washington could face intense pressure to put the country back on its list of nations that sponsor terrorism, said Cheong   an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. North Korea was first put on the terrorism list after the South caught a woman from the North who confessed to planting a bomb on a South Korean airliner that exploded over the Indian Ocean, near Myanmar, in 1987. The North was taken off the list in 2008, after a deal aimed at ending its nuclear program. South Korea’s military plans to use loudspeakers along the shared Korean border to inform North Koreans of Mr. Kim’s killing and of their government’s brutality, a South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported on Wednesday. The Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report. “By assassinating Kim   Kim   may have removed a thorn in the side, but it will further isolate his country,” Mr. Cheong said. “It is also expected to worsen his country’s relations with China, which has been protecting his brother. ” Kim  ’s life illuminates the hidden intrigue in the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for almost seven decades. While the lives of the rest of the family remained shrouded in mystery, Mr. Kim, the oldest of three known sons of Kim   has been the closest thing the isolated Stalinist state has had to an international playboy. He was often seen with fashionably dressed women in international airports and spent much of his time in  casinos in Macau, where he also kept an expensive house. Outside analysts often saw him as a possible candidate to replace Kim   if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state. Chinese experts on North Korea said they doubted that Kim   had special security protection from Beijing. “Chinese elites had no expectation this guy could play an important political role,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. “If China wanted to use him as an alternative leader, China would have offered good protection, but this assassination shows he had no security protection. ” In Macau, where Mr. Kim was headed, he was safe just by being there, said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “Macau is part of China and is a safe haven in itself,” he said. Mr. Kim was a prince in exile with little chance of returning home, analysts and officials in South Korea said. His wife and a daughter and son are in Macau under Chinese protection, Mr. Lee said. The South Korean intelligence agency did not disclose how it had obtained the letter from Mr. Kim begging his half brother to spare his life. But government sources said that emails Mr. Kim sent home through North Korean embassies had been obtained in a hacking operation. In one of the emails, they said, Mr. Kim bitterly complained that the North Korean government stopped sending him cash after his father died and Kim   took over. In 2012, a news report said Mr. Kim was thrown out of a luxury Macau hotel, unable to pay a $15, 000 bill. The Kim family has never been known for its togetherness. Kim  ’s mother, Sung   a decorated “people’s actress,” was already married and the mother of a child when Kim   forced her to divorce her novelist husband to marry him. Kim   adored his first son, Kim  . He once seated his young son at his desk and told him, “This is the place where you will one day give orders,” according to Lee   a relative who defected to the South in 1982. But Kim  ’s grandfather, the North’s founding president, Kim   never approved of the marriage. “My father was keeping highly secret the fact that he was living with my mother, who was married, a famous movie actress, so I couldn’t get out of the house or make friends,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a 2012 book by a Japanese journalist. “That solitude from childhood may have made me what I am now, preferring freedom. ” Mr. Kim was born in secret, and when his mother fell out of favor with Kim   and was forced to live in Moscow, he was left in the care of her sister. He was later sent to Geneva, where he learned English and French. (His mother was alone in Moscow when she died in 2002.) Kim   would later begin a relationship with Ko   a star of Pyongyang’s premier opera, who gave birth to Kim   and then Kim  . According to a Japanese sushi chef who published a 2003 memoir about his experience working for the Kim family, Kim   was by that time the father’s favorite. Kim   squandered what little chance he may have had to succeed his father when he embarrassed Pyongyang in 2001 he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport from the Dominican Republic. He told Japanese investigators that he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. But rumors of intrigue never left Mr. Kim, as analysts speculated that if the young, inexperienced Kim   failed to meet the expectations of   generals, they might summon home the eldest brother. In a way, Mr. Kim helped fuel such rumors. In the 2012 book by the Japanese journalist, Mr. Kim called his younger brother “a figurehead. ”",0

4266,Tom Cotton: Paul Ryan’s Healthcare Bill Does Not Deliver,"Sen. Tom Cotton ( ) a leading GOP senator, is warning his friend House Speaker Paul Ryan to “take a pause” and slow down when it comes to healthcare reform. [Cotton told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview when asked what he would say to Ryan were he speaking directly to the embattled Speaker:  Take a pause, lower the stakes, we don’t need to meet arbitrary legislative deadlines. We need to keep our promise to make healthcare more affordable, more accessible and   for all Americans. The legislation they’ve introduced can be a starting point but it needs major changes. Those changes can be perused and analyzed and tested at hearings. Then we can move forward with a more deliberative fashion in committee to propose amendments and cast votes so we’re not rushing through in the dark of night 36 hours after the bill is introduced. Then the Senate can take the same process and we can work out what differences we might have. That, ultimately, would yield the right result even if it takes a little bit longer. Our healthcare system has had many problems for many years, well before Obamacare —  and Obamacare has made them worse —  what we need to do is not focus on arbitrary deadlines but focus on finally solving these problems. Ryan is rushing a bill —  the American Health Care Act, or Obamacare 2. 0, or Obamacare Lite, or Ryancare as it has become known —  through the House of Representatives right now. But Cotton, a U. S. Senator, tells Breitbart News in this exclusive phone interview on Thursday afternoon that Ryan should back off. Cotton told Breitbart News that this plan by Ryan does not follow through on President Trump’s and other Republicans’ plans to repeal Obamacare, then replace it with a healthcare system that works better for all Americans. Cotton told Breitbart News: We need to get healthcare reform right. We don’t need to get it fast. The House bill as drafted will not deliver on the main promises of President Trump and congressional Republicans, which is making healthcare affordable, keeping it accessible and reducing the level of stress and hassle in the lives of Americans. The process by which the House is considering this legislation and the breakneck pace at which they’re operating is not going to fix this. You can’t introduce major legislation on a Monday night and vote on it Wednesday morning without even having time to process it. We’re not having any hearings to lay a   foundation of knowledge to understand the very thorny questions that healthcare reform poses. It’s much better that we take a pause and do so to get healthcare reform right than to get it right. The bill as introduced does not repeal Obamacare as proponents falsely claim —  it only amends it —  and it keeps Obamacare’s Cadillac Tax and individual mandate. With the individual mandate, for people who choose not to buy insurance, the bill merely shifts the penalty from Obamacare’s   tax to a fee collected by insurance companies. There are many more issues with the bill, but the individual mandate question is one that Cotton is particularly concerned about. He went on to say: This is one small instance of a provision I don’t think we understand in this bill. It creates a kind of tax credit to helps low income Americans afford their healthcare and it pays it to the insurance companies not to taxpayers —  not to the Americans who need it to buy health insurance. I simply don’t understand why we would take that approach. That’s one of the problems with Obamacare —  including too many giveaways to insurance companies. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) in his own exclusive interview with Breitbart News a day earlier, is calling for Trump to support the 2015 bill in which both chambers of Congress voted successfully to repeal Obamacare —  and then do a separate replacement bill the same day. Cotton said he is open to Paul’s ideas, and other ideas on this front, but wants everyone to think about this and slow down and move off the Ryan bill. Cotton said when asked if he backs Sen. Paul’s idea for Obamacare repeal and replacement: I’m open to lots of legislative approaches except for ramming through major legislation in 36 hours in the dark of night. Paul’s idea for Obamacare repeal and replacement. “written spending bill in late December. Introduce it on Monday, vote on it on Wednesday morning and everyone goes home for Christmas —  and hey, who cares because it’s all going to expire in nine months anyway. We ought not do that on spending bills, but we surely ought not do it on healthcare reforms. As we all said on Obamacare, we are remaking one sixth of the nation’s economy and something that affects every single American in a personal and intimate fashion. Cotton said he has spoken with President Trump in “broad contours” about healthcare and looks forward to future conversations with him about it. “We’ve only spoken in broad contours about healthcare, and I’ve expressed to him it’s a complicated topic and we have to take our time and get it right —  not fast,” Cotton said. With Cotton, Paul, and Sen. Mike Lee ( ) out publicly against the Ryan bill as is —  and Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Susan Collins ( ) saying it is dead on arrival in the Senate —  it has no chance to pass the U. S. Senate. There is also significant opposition to the bill inside the GOP conference in the House, with the House Freedom Caucus and many more members outside the Freedom Caucus opposed to it in the House. Cotton said the bill will likely not, despite what Ryan says over and over, pass the House of Representatives. Cotton said: I would encourage my old friends in the House to slow down and fix the many problems in this bill before they vote on it. If they do that, it can pass and it can pass with a big majority. And I think that’d be good for the American people. But if they move forward with the legislation that was introduced Monday, I have real doubts about whether it can pass the House of Representatives and there’s no need for that to happen because we are relatively close to the right kind of reform that’s better for the American people. It’s better to spend a few weeks getting that right than moving it fast. If somehow politicians in Washington were able to navigate the significant GOP opposition to this bill and force it through to passage, Cotton added, there is likely to be significant political backlash against anyone who supports it and anyone who supports this rushed   process. “I’m more concerned about the implications for the Arkansans I represent,” Cotton said. “Arkansans are either losing their health insurance or continuing to have to pay higher and higher premiums. But you can be sure, if that’s the result, that it will be politically hazardous to the health of people who supported this process and those who supported a bill that produces this result. I’m not trying to stop the repeal of Obamacare and healthcare reform. I’m trying to fix it. I’m trying to help President Trump achieve the goals on which he and all of us campaigned. Right now, the House bill —  as drafted —  I don’t think does that. ”",0
4267,Is Donald Trump Autistic?,"link Donald Trump could have a disability that used to be known as Aspergers, and this can cause people trouble when they try to socialize because their theory of mind is not complete. Basically, they have trouble thinking of how others perceive their actions. These people tend to be highly intelligent. Trump's IQ is 156, which makes sense considering he has built more businesses than most of us have, and although he could have invested his father's money and made the same amount back as he did in the end through business deals, he put a lot of work and thought into his business. I would like to know what kind of medicines Trump is on and what his mental health diagnosis are. If he has Aspergers, then that would explain why he makes so many social mistakes. Being super rich from a young age might also account for it since he would not be trained to interact with people on an equal level (which is a lot more complicated than interacting with people when you are rich and they are poor). However, an article in The New York Times recently focused on Trump's fears of making social blunders. He has a fear of losing social status or being embarrassed publicly. However, he doesn't seem to do well publicly, which must be a disability because he would *want* to be a good public speaker and not make social gaffes yet he still does it. It must be accidental. Donald even stated he is a difficult man to be married to, which means he knows himself and his weaknesses. Many people with Aspergers don't get married because they have a hard time in relationships.",0

4269,Comment on Conservative club’s ‘affirmative action bake sale’ draws scrutiny by Dr. Eowyn,"  DCG | 7 Comments 
But it’s perfectly acceptable when liberals do something similar to highlight their point. 
From Fox News : The Young Conservatives of Texas club at the University of Texas at Austin sparked outrage Wednesday after hosting an “affirmative action bake sale” and charging people different prices based on their race and sex. 
The Dallas Morning News reported that a cookie at the sale cost $1.50 for Asian males, $1 for white males and 50 cents for African-American and Hispanic males. Native American men and women were given free cookies. 
Asian women had to pay $1.25, white women 75 cents and Hispanic and African-American women 25 cents. 
The club drew heavy scrutiny from a crowd of hundreds, but it insisted that the bake sale was a protest against the “institutionalized racism” of affirmative action programs at colleges and universities . Some in the crowd chanted “racists go home.” 
“Our protest was designed to highlight the insanity of assigning our lives value based on our race and ethnicity, rather than our talents, work ethic and intelligence,” club chairman Vidal Castañeda said. “It is insane that institutional racism, such as affirmative action, continues to allow for universities to judge me by the color of my skin rather than my actions.” Gregory Vincent 
According to the paper, the Young Conservatives of Texas came under fire in 2013 for holding a similar bake sale. The university’s vice president for diversity and community engagement Gregory J. Vincent called that sale “deplorable.” 
This time, Vincent said this bake sale was “inflammatory and demeaning.” 
“Yet focusing our attention on the provocative nature of the YCT’s actions ignores a much more important issue: They create an environment of exclusion and disrespect among our students, faculty and staff ,” he said. 
He further questioned the club’s motive behind the bake sale. “In seeking an audience for their ideas, the YCT resorted to exercising one of the university’s core values to the detriment of others,” he added. “Such actions are counterproductive to true dialogue on our campus, and it is unrepresentative of the ideals toward which our community strives.”

4270,At the Front in a Scarred Falluja - The New York Times,"I accompanied Iraq’s elite counterterrorism force and other units from the Iraqi military and the federal police into Falluja at the end of June, during the final days of their long battle to wrest back control of the city from the Islamic State. Falluja was the first Iraqi city to fall to the Islamic State, more than two years ago, and the militant group had all that time to learn the city, sowing traps everywhere. It was only after a long siege that the Iraqi forces moved to take the center. In the last stages of the battle, members of the counterterrorism force, in coordination with other Iraqi units, fought their way into the neighborhood of Al Jolan in Falluja, where Islamic State fighters were making their last stand. As we moved through the   streets, gun battles raged, and the insurgents’ improvised mortars exploded among the narrow alleyways and rubble in a   effort to halt the advance of Iraq’s security forces. What, exactly, the Islamic State fighters were holding out for was lost on me. The city had been surrounded for months. Nearly all the civilians were gone, either driven out by their rulers’ brutality in the early days, or escaping during breaks in the fighting as the Iraqi forces approached. The Iraqi Army, special forces and the federal police relied on heavy artillery, close air support from United States aircraft and a patient advance through the city. The remaining Islamic State fighters were forced to be opportunistic. During one visit with the Iraqi special forces, I saw a soldier who had been shot through his right calf, either by a sniper’s round or random gunfire. Gruesome markers of the battle dotted the roads leading into Falluja. A charred body of an Islamic State fighter had been left on the side of a road that the Iraqi forces had bulldozed through a small field south of the city as they began the assault. A metal cable was tied tight around one of the body’s legs, and the head had been lopped off. A police commander chastised two Shiite militiamen who were taking cellphone pictures of each other stomping on the corpse triumphantly. Much of the heavy fighting in Falluja was done by the   counterterrorism forces. The units were designed for   night raids and targeted extractions. Instead, as the fight to retake Iraq has turned into a series of urban battles and checkpoint fights, the small, specialized units have been called on for   infantry assignments. For the counterterrorism units, Falluja was the latest in a long string of assaults. They have been sent wherever the fighting was heaviest and the target most critical while the government has struggled to reconstitute its failed and deserted regular army. It has left the elite units threadbare, run down. Islamic State fighters had built underground bunkers in homes they had commandeered. When the Iraqi counterterrorism forces moved in, they discovered steel doors covering holes cut in the marble and tile floors of the houses. In other buildings in the city center, storage bunkers held caches of weapons. As the Iraqi forces advanced block by block, courtyards and rooftops became vital vantage points, sniper nests and, despite the brutally hot weather, crash pads under the sun. During one of my final days in Falluja, Islamic State fighters hiding out in the city showered us with large mortar shells, probably made in a makeshift factory set up in someone’s kitchen. The unit I was traveling with discovered large stocks of crudely made mortar rounds: improvised   mortars, or IRAMs. In one house, ordnance, including explosives, was piled in the kitchen. Other deadly ingredients  —   bags of ball bearings, rusty screws, nails and other shrapnel  —   were strewed about. Other homes in Falluja had been converted into torture chambers and, according to some of the security forces, dormitories for the Islamic State’s sex slaves. Iraq has been at war since some of the soldiers were in grade school. But evidence of the Islamic State’s brutality took aback even some of the most   soldiers. One officer, who spoke openly only on the condition of anonymity, citing military protocol, told me that the Islamic State was different from the insurgents he was used to fighting. You can negotiate with insurgents, he said in English laced with military jargon he picked up from years of working with United States Special Forces, but the Islamic State fighters seemed to have embraced unbridled and inflexible savagery. Another officer, Lt. Hassan Almosawi, from Iraq’s Emergency Response Brigade, took me to an Islamic State prison his unit had discovered in a once upscale neighborhood in central Falluja. Homes in the area were outfitted with bars on the doors and grated metal sheets welded over the windows. Some of the rooms  —   possibly for the female slaves  —   were furnished with fans, carpets, pillows and blankets. Nearby, we discovered a     home where the Islamic State had established a torture operation. A heavy chain with a hook at the end hung from the ceiling of a   parlor, and car batteries were arrayed on the floor near the wall, connected to an   transformer. Across the street from the prison and torture chamber, in a former school, decomposing bodies were tangled in a hastily dug grave, left to rot in the   heat. The victims had been blindfolded and appeared to have been killed as the Islamic State fled the city. Almost 60, 000 Iraqis who managed to escape Falluja were now stuck in the desert in Anbar Province. Though Falluja is on the doorstep of Baghdad, only 40 miles away, the authorities were limiting access to the capital for fear that retreating militants might try to infiltrate the city. The fleeing families have been forced to live in   camps in the desert, like the one I visited in Amiryat Falluja, south of the Euphrates River. Women and children sleep in the open, exposed to heat and gusts that whip the fine desert dust through the frames of unfinished trailers. Aside from a few older men, there are few men or boys in the camps. They have been taken to screening where the government tries to weed out possible Islamic State fighters. After weeks, some of the displaced families still have no word about what has happened to their men. Most of the forces securing Falluja and the surrounding area are Shiite. But the families, and the detained men, are Sunnis. And though there have been few verified reports of extrajudicial killings or abuse, the people’s resentment and fear are being carried in whispers. Victory is never the end of the story here.",0
4271,FDA Found Manipulating The Media In Favor Of Big Pharma,"By Brianna Acuesta
Although the Federal Drug Administration is thought to serve American consumers by keeping them safe and well-informed, they are doing just the opposite by controlling the media and science press in order to create misleading and one-sided articles.
An investigation into documents released through the Freedom of Information Act by Scientific American revealed that the FDA uses a variety of tactics to prevent the full truth from being revealed about a certain product. The biggest tactic is the “close-hold embargo,” where they invite a select few news sites to a briefing about the to-be released information with conditions. They stipulate that the journalists have to surrender their reportorial independence by agreeing to only speak with sources approved by their agency.
When NPR reporter Rob Stein was extended one of these loaded invitations, he responded by saying, “My editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction,” and asked that they be given a bit more wiggle room to speak with others. When Stein was met with a resounding no, he decided to agree to the terms and attend the briefing.
Stein wasn’t the only reporter to attend this particular briefing, as other sites such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times were all present. Despite agreeing to the terms, not everyone is actually comfortable with these conditions. The New York Times former Public Editor, Margaret Sullivan, said: 
“I think embargoes that attempt to control sourcing are dangerous because they limit the role of the reporter whose job is to do a full look at a subject. It’s really inappropriate for a source to be telling a journalist whom he or she can and can’t talk to.”
Other tactics used by the FDA include denying major media outlets any access to the briefing prior to the public release of information, and the deliverance of half-truths when asked questions directly to hinder an investigation. Those who intend to speak with unapproved sources or announce these embargoes are met with threats.
These embargoes are often used within the science community, but none as strict as the FDA’s rules on whom reporters can confer with. The usual restrictions only focus on the date and time that a news story can be published about a particular study, which is why the stories tend to break at the same time across media outlets.
The Association of Health Care Journalists said that the close-hold embargo is “a serious obstacle to good journalism. Reporters who want to be competitive on a story will essentially have to agree to write only what the FDA wants to tell the world, without analysis or outside commentary.”
If the FDA was truly concerned about the well-being of American citizens, it wouldn’t be so shrouded in secrecy and insistent on the way news stories are covered. Instead, they put up their list of demands in an effort to protect the medical industry and pharmaceutical companies whose interests and profits matter more than having a well-informed public.

4272,Insult Comedy as Blood Sport: The Rise of the Roast Battle - The New York Times,"When the comedian Jeff Ross started flinging insults at the Friars Club in the   the comedy roast was mostly seen as a relic. “It was like jousting or some lost art,” he said, recalling that comics poked fun at him for participating. “It was corny. ” Two decades later, what was once nostalgic has become cool again. The roast battle, which pits comics against each other in gladiatorial combat, has become the hottest new form in comedy today, with dozens of shows across the country and abroad. This week, it’s the focus of a   special on Comedy Central called “Jeff Ross Presents Roast Battle. ” At a time when rap battles have become popular online and onstage, the roast battle uses a similar format to update the ancient art of dueling  . It probably began in Los Angeles in 2013, when a dispute between two comics was settled onstage at the Comedy Store in three   rounds of insults after midnight. The organizers (the comics Brian Moses and Rell Battle) brought it back the next week, and buzz quickly built, turning the roast battle format from a cult hit among   to a frequently   affair. When Mr. Ross, who had become known as the Roastmaster General because of his performances on Comedy Central’s celebrity events, attended his first battle, he became rapidly convinced that the form was the next wave of roasting. The early Comedy Store shows, however, were too raw for television. “We had fights at the start,” Mr. Ross said. “The cops were called one time when a woman poked another in the chest. ” Along with coaching roasters between rounds and recruiting friends like Dave Chappelle and Sarah Silverman to judge, Mr. Ross established three rules: Use only original material, no physical contact and always end with a hug. Today there are battles from Vancouver to Johannesburg (and two different regular live shows in New York) with many variations. There was even a naked roast battle. What convinced Comedy Central that it would translate to television, said Jonas Larsen, a senior vice president at the network, was a tournament at the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal last year, which was repeated and filmed this year. On the TV special, 16 comics will compete for the crown. One early favorite, Mr. Ross said, is Jimmy Carr, a popular British comic, largely unknown here, who has a jarringly elegant style. “He brings a   notebook onstage and cradles it like a baby and reads his material as if he’s addressing British Parliament,” Mr. Ross said. “It’s disarming. ” If the early rounds, which were broadcast last weekend, are any indication, the finals will feature less delicate styles. When the New York comic Mike Lawrence told his opponent, Scott Chaplain, that Mr. Chaplain’s father had spent “59 years in the Garden State and three in a vegetative one,” Mr. Chaplain retorted: “At least I know my dad’s watching this from heaven. Your dad won’t even watch you on Seth Meyers. ” While roast battle borrows elements from   and even reality television  —   as with “American Idol,” the judging can be the most entertaining part  —   its knowing, personal jokes are a return to the clubby roots of the roast. The Comedy Central celebrity roasts focused on a star who was usually a stranger to the comics, and often an easy target, like Charlie Sheen. “We drifted into territory of trainwrecky,” Mr. Larsen said. “We’ve worked to change that. ” (David Spade hosts the next Comedy Central celebrity roast, of Rob Lowe, on Aug. 27.) “Roast Battle” is less   than the traditional roast. In live shows, the participants often know each other and are of roughly similar career stature. As a consequence, the jokes are more specific and even a bit inside baseball, like a fight at the family dinner table. Just as important as the prepared jokes is the interplay, the improvised retort, the way you take a punch. The most entertaining insult humor has always depended on the chemistry of a double act (Don Rickles was funniest cracking wise at Johnny Carson) but that’s even more evident in “Roast Battle. ” Some roasters win through intimidation, and others lose before they utter their first joke. In two recent live shows I attended, the contenders leaned heavily on jokes about appearance and unfunniness (the harshest cut for a comic) and on transgressive humor, which went wrong when a combatant at the New York Comedy Club referred to the Orlando shooting the week of the tragedy. Rory Albanese, one of the judges, said it was too soon. The Stand puts on Roastmasters NYC, a better show with sharper comics and a D. J. interjecting sound effects like a Homer Simpson “D’oh. ” The judges are also funnier and more involved, a gantlet the comics have to run before they even get to each other. When a lanky roaster named Sean McCarthy took the stage recently, Mark Normand, one of the judges, said, “Wow, I didn’t know anyone still had scurvy. ” Then the other judges piled on. By the time his friend and competitor for the round, Ross Parsons, joined him, Mr. McCarthy looked defeated, stammering out his jokes. At “Roast Battle,” where comics perform in front of their peers, bombing can be brutal, and killing appears euphoric. Where does roasting go from here? Mr. Ross points to the election: “This is where the roasts have gone  —   to politics,” he said, adding that he has roasted Donald J. Trump twice. Mr. Trump, he said, was a good sport, and the only jokes he was sensitive about referred to finances. The Comedy Central writers sent him a list of jokes before the event, and Mr. Trump took issue with only one punch line, crossing out a reference to his wealth as $2 billion and replacing it with $10 billion. When the writers pushed back, they settled on $7 billion. Today’s political language sounds so much like insult comedy that a Hillary Clinton line in a speech about Mr. Trump (“He’s written a lot of books about business, but they all seem to end at Chapter 11”) was similar to one that Mr. Ross uttered at a Trump roast. “I read your book. It had four Chapter 11s,” he told Mr. Trump in a bit that was shot for the 2006 Comedy Central roastfest but was edited out of the final show. When our politics increasingly traffic in pointed insults, perhaps it’s no surprise that roasts have become more popular. Mr. Ross sees the lines blurring, saying he thinks that when Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump debate, it will resemble “Roast Battle. ” “They want to humiliate each other,” he said, adding that the funnier “one might win. ”",0

Военные хакеры США проникли в энергосистему России, телекоммуникационные сети и системы командования Кремля и сделали их уязвимыми для кибератаки, передает NBC News со ссылкой на высокопоставленного чиновника из разведки и секретные документы. 
Много раз твердили американцы: «Не трогайте, ребята, нашу избирательную систему! Не трогайте. Пусть она у нас и реликтовая, 200 лет назад сформированная, но наша родная, проверенная». Не послушались российские хакеры. Нет, чтобы пробовать на прочность Пентагон или НБА, на худой конец НАСА. Захотелось им покопаться во внутренних материалах одной из противоборствующих партий. Вряд ли они смогли вынести оттуда секреты государственной важности: все, что можно было, слил мировой общественности Джулиан Ассанж. А вот за избирательную систему обидно стало. Не поймет простой американский избиратель, если вдруг окажется, что в выборах приняли участие 146% населения страны, включая младенцев и пораженных в правах зэков, или что результаты в нескольких соседних городках Огайо, Кентукки и Индианы вдруг сойдутся до сотых и составят 62.2%. 
Это мы, россияне, над их наивностью снисходительно посмеемся, а у них демократия! 
Сначала осерчал их шоколадный президент и пригрозил распоясавшимся российским мальчишкам несколькими альтернативными ответами. Он поручил ЦРУ разработать кибероперацию против кремлевских властей. А затем построжился: вице-президент пообещал, что удар будет нанесен тогда, когда эффект от него будет наибольшим. 
И что же мы имеем накануне часа Х в США? 
Американских хакеров, ломанувших Кремль, не заинтересовало содержимое серверов КПРФ, ЛДПР и «Единой России». Да, и право, что там может быть, кроме нетленки её при жизни мумифицированных лидеров? Не мелочась, они заложили в кремлевские сети возможность единовременно «уронить» интернет и электроснабжение во всех крупных городах. А на закуску оставили электронные системы высшего командования и неограниченный доступ к сверхсекретной и личной переписке. В любой момент все это может быть придано огласке. 
Уже представили себе? Имена и телефоны кремлевских пластических хирургов, база данных художественных гимнасток, фигуристок, всегда готовых подменить своих более успешных подруг, если они кому-то надоедят, список любимых марок спортивной одежды самых высокопоставленных особ, секреты любимого повара или тренера по дзюдо… Да мало ли что составляет в России государственную тайну. Смешные. Кто-то видел в руках у российского президента смартфон или сидящего его за компьютером? Вот так надо хранить государственные тайны. А они со взломами баз данных.

[11/3/16] The Kansas Board of Regents confirms all 10 of Heritage College’s locations, including those in southeast Wichita and Kansas City, Mo. are closed. The board or regents says the school is closed effective “immediately” and “indefinitely.” 
Tuesday afternoon, Eyewitness News heard from a student at the college’s location on South Rock Road in Wichita, who was preparing to graduate. 
The student says there was a note on the door of the school that they weren’t letting anyone in. The note read that the school went bankrupt, the student says. She says neither students nor staff received notice of the shutdown. Some learned of the closure by finding the notes, others heard from classmates. 
“I actually got a text message from a classmate and then I called the school several times and couldn’t get an answer so I decided to come up here,” said Machelle Hatter, who went to Heritage. 
Many students say they feel angry and confused. 
“I don’t know where I’m going, I don’t know what’s going on with my loans, I don’t know what to do next,” said Stephanie Hermrack, who attended Heritage College. 
Hermrack said now she and many others who attended Heritage are left with only a partial education and thousands of dollars in student loans. 
“So I don‘t know if I owe the government $20,000 now even though I didn’t get a degree out of this or what,” added Joshua Anderson, another Heritage student.

NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting. 
The page, a screen shot of which has been sourced from internet archive site The Wayback Machine , is posted below and shows totals for the upcoming Presidential race. It announces Hillary Clinton as the winner. 
As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results. 
The original page has since been reset. ( Click here for full size image ) 
Though the results information appears on an FTP server at WorldNow.com, media companies like NBC’s WRCB TV utilize the platform, also know as “Frankly,” to power their news content. This can be verified directly a the WRCB web site by scrolling to the very bottom of the page footer which notes that it is, “Powered By Frankly.” 
In addition to national results, Jim Stone has identified another page at the WorldNow.com FTP server that appears to show the State-By-State Presidential election results. This page is also accessible in archive format at WayBack Machine with a line by line breakdown available at Stone’s website. 
Of interest is that the State-By-State results indicate a Hillary Clinton win in states like Texas (42% to 40%), Florida (44% to 40%) and Pennsylvania (44% to 40%) which have all been identified as states Clinton must steal to win the election . Do these latest election “results” confirm that the fix is in and the vote is rigged? If so, then we are no longer looking at an election where our votes will count, but rather, a selection where the winner is determined by those who count the votes. Related:",0

Le Pen called on all French patriots to support her regardless of their background or what candidate they voted for in the first round, saying that “the survival of France” was at stake in the upcoming second round. ”Vive le Peuple !

Le Pen has promised to not only restore order to French streets, which has earned her more support from police officers than any other candidate but also to hold a referendum on the membership of France in the European Union.

4278,Robots v Humans: AI machine ‘attacks’ visitor at Chinese tech fair (PHOTOS),"You Are Here: Home » News » Featured » Robots v Humans: AI machine ‘attacks’ visitor at Chinese tech fair (PHOTOS) Robots v Humans: AI machine ‘attacks’ visitor at Chinese tech fair (PHOTOS) A robot attacked and injured a man at a tech fair in China, leading social media users to question if the machine’s actions were actually the opening gambit in a war waged by robots against humans. 
The robot , marketed as an educational tool and on sale for 13,000 yuan (US$1,890), was on show at the 18th China International Hi-Tech Fair in Shenzhen when it reportedly suddenly smashed a glass booth and attacked a man. 
The victim was taken away in a stretcher for medical treatment, but was not seriously injured. 
The robot’s apparently unprovoked outburst led people on Twitter and Chinese social media site Weibo to wonder if it was the first shot in a robots versus humans war. 
“This robot is a pioneer in his struggle against humanity,” one Weibo user wrote, according to WhatsOnWeibo.com. 
“The invasion of the robots has started,” another person said, while a third added “the invasion of the robots has started.” 
Although initial reports all suggested that the robot acted of its own accord, Sina.com says that the incident was in fact caused by human error. An official at the tech event said that someone simply mixed up the robot’s ‘forward’ and ‘back’ buttons, sending the robot crashing into a display stand and injuring the unfortunate bystander. 
So, not a declaration of war and not even the robot’s fault – however, the poor thing still looks pretty upset about the whole episode. Originally Published By RT.com",0

4280,Convicted Terrorist Oscar López Rivera Booed at NYC Puerto Rican Day Parade,"NEW YORK CITY  —   Convicted terrorist Oscar López Rivera made his controversial appearance at the annual National Puerto Rican Day Parade Sunday  —   and was met by a mix of cheers and boos from the polarized crowd. [The parade had been overshadowed for months by the parade committee’s decision to honor López Rivera, a key member of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) in the seventies and eighties, who fought for Puerto Rican independence. The group conducted more than 100 bombings in the United States, killing five people, injuring dozens, and causing millions of dollars’ worth of damage. López Rivera was convicted.  President Obama commuted López Rivera’s sentence, and he was released this year after serving 35 years for transporting guns and bomb materials. The committee’s decision to honor the militant as a “national freedom hero” led a wealth of sponsors,  including   the New York Yankees, and Univisión, to pull out, along with NYPD and FDNY officials and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. López Rivera, who has denied being a terrorist, eventually said he would forgo the honor but would march as a “humble Puerto Rican and grandfather. ” But the New York Daily News  reported that, while some at the parade cheered López Rivera and held signs calling him “our Mandela,” others booed and jeered the convicted terrorist. According to the paper, one Bronx resident yelled, “Fuck Oscar! Fuck him! He’s no hero!” as the   leader passed. Nearby cops reportedly shook their heads in agreement. Several cops gave López Rivera and Democratic City Council Speaker Melissa   who was on the float with him,  “sour looks,” according to the Daily News. “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t working. We gotta do our jobs, man,” said one officer. “This really pisses me off,” Bronx resident Mark Rivera told the New York Post. “This is a day for honoring the Republic of Puerto Rico, not honoring a terrorist. This man has no place in our parade. He makes me ashamed to be a Puerto Rican. ” Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.",0

The information that emerges from the Weiner laptop is going to BLOW PEOPLE’S MINDS… 

From Dave Kranzler : 
Stewart Dougherty presents the 2nd part of his disembowelment of the Clinton crime machine. The Weiner email bomb dropped in the middle of this. As it turns out, the Weiner lap-top mishap appears to a “Black Swan” of sorts that eluded Hillary’s tentacles of control. In the piece below, Stewart presents useful background knowledge and intellectual tools with which to help you analyze and interpret the next sequence of events before and after the election (assuming the election is not postponed). 
The information that emerges from the Weiner laptop is going to blow people’s minds – John Titus, Best Evidence Productions, in an upcoming Shadow of Truth 
Author’s Preface: We are far more interested in markets than politics. To us, free markets represent liberty in motion. But today, politics, and particularly the most corrupt political institution on earth, the Federal Reserve, have markets in a hammer-lock. At this point, we have to understand what is happening in politics in order to understand what is likely to happen in markets. We write a great deal about politics at this critical juncture in order to help you understand markets and achieve the financial freedom you desire and deserve. 
Regarding the breaking Clinton-scandal developments, we believe that in addition to the 650,000 emails retrieved from the Abedin / Weiner computer which are going to show a level of corruption in this nation never before even imagined let alone proved, the FBI’s decision to re-open the investigation was related to the Bundy acquittals on October 27, 2016. We believe that government officials are looking up the barrel of a full-blown American revolution. Not the shooting kind, but rather something much worse for them: complete moral rejection of government and Establishment corruption by the PRODUCTIVE CLASS in America, which threatens to rapidly spread into and cripple the American economy just ahead of the holiday selling season. 
The National Retail Federation has just reported that 25% of shoppers are waiting for the election outcome prior to deciding how much they are going to spend during the holidays, something the NRF has never seen before. If principled, productive people feel that this election was stolen from them by Clinton and Establishment corruption, they are going to shut down. 
They are going to WITHDRAW THEIR FINANCIAL CONSENT from a rigged, dirty system that is looting them and destroying their futures. While the government can effectively deal with many kinds of protest, it cannot even begin to deal with a general economic boycott by the productive class, even if it is just at the margin. (All profits are at the margin.) The consequences of such a boycott upon general business activity; tax receipts at all levels from municipal to federal; the stock and bond markets; and the national mood, with its extraordinarily complex and critical interconnections and ramifications would be monumental, and perhaps beyond all American precedent. 
Despite a multi-million dollar, taxpayer-funded Federal legal onslaught in the case against the Bundy’s and their co-defendants, the jurors re-confirmed something communicated throughout history. Namely, that while there are a very few things that universally disgust human beings, one of them is bullies. The people are not pleased, and the Establishment knows it is in trouble. Now on to our article.] 
The Clinton Syndrome Curse: A Clinton – Obama Co-Presidency. (The Clinton Syndrome: Part 2) 
In Part 1, we defined the Clinton Syndrome as a psychological condition in which voters develop a favorable attitude toward a political predator who deceives, disdains, swindles and abuses them. It is a variant of the Stockholm Syndrome, but much larger in scope and scale, as demonstrated by the fact that tens of millions of American voters currently exhibit the pathological condition. This Syndrome was identified by Inferential Analytics (IA), an accurate and reliable forecasting method we have developed and use. You can read a detailed explanation of the syndrome in our first article on the subject: “The Clinton Syndrome: The Establishment’s Weapon for National Conquest (Part 1)” LINK 
In this article, Part 2, we delve deeper into what the 2016 presidential election is really all about, and outline the consequences that will occur should the Clinton Syndrome prevail on November 8 th . The Clinton Syndrome has resulted in a potentially deadly national disease which will wreak havoc if it spreads out of control at this time. 
We regard as an existential threat to the United States the fact that tens of millions of American voters have no idea how deeply fraudulent the entire 2016 presidential campaign has been, from the very beginning. If Donald Trump had not appeared out of nowhere, this would never have been an election at all, but rather an orchestrated, planned enablement of the Clintons and their Establishment handlers to engage in unprecedented corruption, regime change and outright plunder. 
If successful, this still-active effort to fraudulently inject the Clintons into the power seat will become a multi-trillion dollar gift to the Establishment elite who know exactly how to profit from Clinton graft and corruption; will destroy what is left of the American economy, which simply cannot sustain four more years of intense looting and fraud; and will result in the outright overthrow of the American form of governance by a deadly new political system that we call “crony communism (outlined in our article: Crony Communism: Hillary Clinton’s Game Plan for America. LINK 
The people have been so confused and deceived by the multi-billion dollar avalanche of deliberately concocted lies and propaganda about this election that they don’t even know who is running for President on the Democrat ticket. 
Hillary Clinton has both a co-presidential and a vice presidential running mate, neither of which is Tim Kaine, a corrupt political suck-up and hack who was selected precisely because he will do exactly what he is told, not matter how criminal or immoral. 
Clinton’s co-presidential running mate is Barack Hussein Obama; her vice-presidential candidate is the United Nations. This is the Establishment’s Dream Team, cooked up to make the fastest possible progress toward their crony-communist and globalist overthrow of the United States. The Establishment realizes that the people are waking up fast to what is being done to them and their country. Therefore, they have put their corrupt machinations into high gear in order to beat the clock, which is ticking loudly. 
When people say that a vote for Clinton means four more years of Obama, they have their arithmetic wrong. A Clinton victory means eight more years of Obama in the next four, and a total knock-out for the nation. 
The Mainstream Media’s (MSM) deliberately false narrative is that Obama has been campaigning non-stop for Clinton because he wants to protect his “legacy,” and believes that Clinton will do this for him. 
This is yet another of the “Big Lie” mind bombs that have been dropped onto the American people’s heads during this colossally fraudulent, dishonest and propagandistic Establishment onslaught to get Clinton elected. 
This narrative is meant to suggest that Barrack Obama wants to retire, and then ride out the rest of his life looking upon his “legacy.” 
There are two problems with this story. First, Obama’s legacy is already blowing up in his and the entire nation’s face, so there is nothing Clinton will be able to do to salvage it. Obamacare and the Iran Deal are just two examples among dozens of the collapse of Obama’s so-called legacy, which would much better be called a national damnation. 
The second problem is that Obama is only 55 years old and has not given even ONE indication our model can detect that he actually wants or intends to retire. (Soros, one of his champions, is 86 years old and still wreaking havoc worldwide. These people never stop until the Reaper drops in.) In fact, what we see in Obama is the exact opposite: he demonstrates a strong desire not only to remain on the political stage, but to assume a larger presence upon it. 
Speaking at a rally in Philadelphia on September 13, 2016 (while Hillary was at home recovering from “pneumonia”), Obama said, “It’s good to be back on the campaign trail.” He then said, “I really, really, REALLY want to elect Hillary Clinton.” (Please carefully consider that sentence, because it is a textbook example (although just one of hundreds over the years) of Obama’s pathological Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). He did not say, “I really, really, REALLY want YOU [the people to whom he was speaking] to elect Hillary Clinton,” but rather, “I really, really, REALLY want to elect Hillary Clinton,” making the people’s national election all about himself. Comments such as this are extraordinarily important to our analysis, and their significance has been borne out time and again over our 15+ years of doing this work. Paradoxically, the smallest factors often have the greatest implications. 
Later in the same speech, Obama boasted (our comments added within brackets): “More Americans are working [in part time, minimum wage jobs], more have [100% subsidized] health care, incomes are rising [for the establishment elite], poverty is falling [according to false, politically doctored numbers] and gas is $2.00 a gallon. Thanks, Obama!!!” In Obama’s narcissistically crippled mind, the entire United States economy is a function of one thing and one thing only: him. Narcissists in positions of power are extremely destructive (e.g. Obamacare), because they are completely out of touch with what is happening in the real, as opposed their self-flattering fantasy world. In any event, this kind of campaign bragging, swagger and grandiosity is not indicative of someone who plans to retire from politics in the next few weeks. 
Obama’s clear desire to remain in the game makes him valuable to Clinton, while also making Clinton valuable to him. Intersecting motives are where deals get done. And a Clinton – Obama collaboration would be ideal for the Establishment. Obama has been the gift that keeps on giving to the elite, as they have raked in trillions from his presidency. They want as much of Obama as they can get, because he is a money machine. (For example, witness Obama’s continuing efforts to ram the TPP, an Establishment fraud against the people, down the nation’s throat. Obama does whatever the Establishment tells him to do, in the full knowledge his “Library” Slush Fund will be richly rewarded for his efforts, just as the Clinton Slush Fund has been enriched by more than $1.8 billion, with a “b,” for the Clinton sell-out of people to the elite.) 
Obama is the most internationally-traveled president in the nation’s history, having made 51 international trips to 56 different countries during his two terms in office. It is as if he has been running for international office, and now we can see that he has been . His globetrotting has required strength, stamina and energy, the exact physical attributes that Clinton, who has been pictured requiring assistance to climb a short set of stairs, lacks. Given her health issues, Clinton cannot possibly perform on a global stage going forward; she will be lucky to successfully navigate the White House. 
This presents a problem. For the Establishment agenda to be fully executed, Clinton needs international support, and ideally, that international mandates be imposed upon the United States. But she will not be capable of traveling internationally to seal the deals that must get done. 
This is where Obama comes in. While he would never step “backwards” into a role such as, for example, Secretary of State (an ego-wounding demotion), his passion for continued political involvement would find an excellent home at the United Nations. 
In this Inferential Analytics scenario, Hillary Clinton will get Obama placed in a high level United Nations position. The United States pays for roughly 25% of total United Nations annual budget, far more than any other nation, and still has clout even though more and more countries are turning their backs on America. 
Other nations would support the idea of a senior role for Obama if it were made clear to them that his mission would be to continue the “fundamental transformation” of the United States that he promised during his 2008 campaign and has been conducting ever since. This “transformation” has done extreme damage to the United States, and while it has been a disaster for America, it has been good for the rest of the world. Finally, they see a means by which to bring the United States to heel. The idea of the further weakening of the United States will sound to them like a very good deal. The one assurance they will seek is that in exchange for giving Obama an important role at the U.N., Obama will get Clinton to agree not to incinerate the northern hemisphere in a nuclear war, at least not until they have finalized their preparations for it. 
A Clinton – Obama co-presidency will be a double body-blow to the nation, with Clinton turning it into a corrupt, crony-communist Establishment lootocracy from within, and Obama destroying it from without. 
Leveraging the United Nations, Clinton and Obama can effect two personal agendas they have long sought: gun control, and a multi-million person “open borders” invasion of America. The first agenda will disarm the people, which has been Job #1 in every communist takeover in history; the second will ensure that the “Last American Presidential Election” occurs on November 8, 2016. In the future, presidents and all other politicians and government agency heads will be appointed by the Establishment, exactly as happens in communist regimes. While there might be “show elections,” the outcomes will have been pre-determined at every level far in advance. 
A Clinton – Obama co-presidency will also ensure that other Establishment objectives are met. These include the institution of carbon taxes (an enormous and unprecedented new revenue source and looting opportunity); the passage of the TPP (an Establishment bonanza); and the maximum-possible imposition of the New World Order regime change agenda upon the nations and their people. 
While Obama could advance the Establishment’s aims in virtually any high level position at the U.N., a role that would make him particularly deadly at the outset would be Co-chair of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), joining current head Filippo Grandhi. 
Obama could make his appointment a matter of smooth sailing by stating his belief that the United States is a large, wealthy, relatively under-populated nation that could rapidly absorb a large number of immigrants. By promising to tap into the country’s private wealth, Obama could warrant that all new immigrants would be fully covered by the country’s comprehensive welfare system upon arrival, which is exactly what happens today. This idea would be intoxicating to the new Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, who was the former head of the UNHCR and is an avowed socialist. 
The United Nations currently reports the existence of more than 60,000,000 displaced persons and refugees in the world. If the United States pledged to take in, say, 5,000,000 of them, senior U.N. officials would be delighted. What would they have to lose? Dealing with the integration and cost issues would be America’s problem, not theirs. The U.N. could pass a resolution, written by Obama in such a way as to make it convertible into an Executive Order by Clinton, mandating the acceptance of these refugees by the United States. Clinton would put up her hands and say, “I didn’t do it. The U.N. did it, and we must do our “fair share,” while also complying with international law and being decent and responsible international citizens.” 
As we have pointed out in the past, the United States government is irredeemably bankrupt by any accounting definition one wishes to use. With $20,000,000,000,000.00 in on-the-books debt, another $10,000,000,000,000.00 in debt projected to be added over the next decade (it will be far greater than this, given current trends), and at the very minimum another $120,000,000,000,000.00 in unfunded debt and contingent liabilities, there is absolutely no way the government can ever pay its obligations. So you might wonder, how could the government possibly pay for an immigrant invasion of this magnitude? 
The answer is, the government won’t pay for it; the people will. This is what crony communism is all about. It is estimated that today, there is roughly $70 trillion in private wealth in America. Assuming that half of it, or $35 trillion belongs to the cronies and is off-limits, this leaves $35 trillion that is available for expropriation and looting. While this is certainly not enough to fix America’s fiscal problems, not even close, it could fund 4 years’ worth of radical fiscal adventurism as well as crony communism regime change. 
As Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said during this campaign, “We are going to go where the money is,” and if you don’t take that statement seriously, we believe you are making a very big mistake. She and top colleagues such as Sanders and Warren have said in plain English, at a high decibel level that they are coming for your money, and they are, because in their minds, you don’t deserve to have any. Just as Obama once famously said, in a rare, honest, off-script, non-tele-prompted moment, “If you have a business, you didn’t build that,” he and his fellow crony communists also believe, “If you have saved some after-tax money, you don’t deserve to have that.” To them, any savings you possess represent funds the government should have gotten its hands in the first tax cycle, but didn’t. They intend to rectify that error going forward. 
We have outlined this theme to demonstrate that this election is about an agenda that very few people understand, because it has deliberately been withheld from them. In actuality, the voters have no idea what Clinton truly stands for, or what the Establishment agenda, which she fully believes in and will implement, really is. The stakes in this election are therefore greater than those of any other election in our nation’s history, in our view. This is why the Establishment has spent billions of dollars rigging it. They intend to collect trillions in plunder on the other side, but they can only do so if it goes their way. As we have already seen, they will stop at nothing to get what they want. 
Some Implications of a Clinton – Obama Co-presidency: 
Here is a snapshot of the forecast generated by IA in the event of a Clinton – Obama victory: The Clinton – Obama Co-presidential regime will be the most secretive and non-transparent presidency in U.S. history. Clinton will become invisible, just as she often has during the campaign, not just for health reasons, but because she will turn her back on everyday citizens, whom she disdains, once she gets the prize she has sought her entire life. Obama will make secret deals all over the world (think of the secret Iran cash payments and deal, and his behind-the-scenes agitating for TPP, but on a much larger scale, as illustrations). Every one of these deals will be a dagger in the nation’s back. The American people will never again know the truth about what actually goes on behind government doors, or about the corruption that infects the entire political and establishment system. The political class will never again allow itself to suffer Wikileaks-like exposure. Politics will shift to a CIA-like “need to know” model, where information is doled out selectively and in piece-parts. Only a very few at the top will know the overall agenda, and the full set of tactics being employed to achieve it. Anyone who compromises or exposes the system will simply be executed. (Seth Rich comes to mind.) Going forward, the people will know absolutely nothing about what is really happening in Washington, D.C., or about the D.C. / Wall Street and Establishment initiatives. Orwell’s prophecy, “1984,” which is already quite real, will become even more so. The United States will experience an accelerating Brain Drain. Forward-thinking people will realize that America’s slide into predatory crony-communism can and will never be reversed, and that it will be impossible for them and their loved ones to get ahead in such a corrupt, suffocating environment. (Imagine being scolded, lectured, insulted and talked down to on a regular basis by people like Clinton, Obama and Warren, because that is exactly what will happen.) Progressive countries will put out the welcome mat for hard-working, principled, skilled, entrepreneurial Americans. No one will want America’s whining, lazy, non-productive, “entitled” mooches. That’s just a fact. Virtually every nation anyone would actually want to move to for a better opportunity grades potential immigrants according to age, education, language proficiency, skills and likelihood to be productive. Prospects are disqualified if they do not earn a sufficient score. No sensible nation on earth wants to bring in do-nothings whose only capability is to leech off its producers. Productive Americans who remain in the country for their own reasons will quietly adopt a John Galt mindset, sidestepping the corruption and crony communist expropriation by shutting down, dropping out and fading off the radar screen. This will result in an immediate slow-down of business activity, which will ultimately lead to economic collapse. Given that all profits are at the margin, relatively small percentage declines in sales can entirely wipe out income. The John Galt effect will result in the collapse of the nation’s many Ponzi schemes, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, pensions (government and private) and the biggest one of all, Government Debt. These schemes simply cannot be maintained in a dramatically slowing business environment, no matter how much private wealth is looted. Government will take draconian steps to shut down all non-government-sanctioned news and information outlets. Their prime target will be the Alternative Media, which will only be further empowered, and embraced by the people. A powerful Resistance movement will spread like wildfire. Nonetheless, people should fill their minds with as much truth as they possibly can right now, because it will become much harder and more expensive to find in the future. Today’s Alternative Media is the greatest gift any people in history have ever received, and people should leverage it as best they can while they can. A steady retreat by government officials and establishment elitists to their multi-trillions of dollars’ worth of taxpayer-funded bunkers will occur, as they seek to hide from the American people, who will be waking up by the additional tens of thousands every day. A Federal Reserve December rate hike has a 0% chance of happening if Clinton is elected; there is a 100% chance of a rate hike if Trump is elected. The Fed is a totally political organization, and they will do everything they can to punish the voters and scorch the economic earth if the people choose Trump over the Establishment agenda the Fed has been 100% behind. If Clinton wins, people will IMMEDIATELY be bombarded with MSM reports about the implications of the 2016 election upon the 2018 mid-term and 2020 general elections. This will be part of a full-scale effort to inject mass quantities of Hopium into the Trump supporters’ brains, and get them to focus not upon the rigged election of 2016, but on the “next” election where, they will falsely be told, their vote will “really count!” In the meantime, the Establishment will be doing everything necessary to ensure that the 2018 and 2020 “elections” are completely rigged, fraudulent and meaningless. A massive move into real money will begin, and this will be the subject of our next article. There are developments in this sphere that you must know about, and one of the most important Inferential Analytics themes we have ever examined was triggered on October 27, 2016. We will have a full description in the next week or so. 
In conclusion, the 2016 election is an existential event for the United States. W believe that the situation is becoming so unstable that you have little time to do everything you can to prepare, and get your personal houses in order. We are writing to help as best we can, while we can.

4282,Steve Pieczenik: U.S. Intelligence Waging Coup Against Corrupt Clintons » REGATED,"Former United States Department of State official Steve Pieczenik Steve Pieczenik: U.S. Intelligence Waging Coup Against Corrupt Clintons Jon Hall November 1, 2016 
Rumors and allegations that Bill and Hillary Clinton belong to a high-level pedophile ring have surfaced on the Internet. Without much credence or proof behind the claims, I initially dismissed them. The rumors only persisted and grew and now Steve Pieczenik has now come forward with stunning claims that add fuel to this fire. 
Pieczenik served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger is well-versed in foreign policy, international crisis management, and psychological warfare. He also served under presidential administrations as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush’s White House. In other words Steve Pieczenik — with his proven history of experience — is the real deal. Pieczenik claims that the Clintons and their close associates have successfully pulled off a coup via corruption. 
He explains that total corruption and co-option were the two strategies behind this coup. Pieczenik says Bill and Hillary Clinton co-opted many central facets of our government — the White House, the judiciary, the CIA, the FBI. As far as I’m concerned, this idea is well beyond some lunatic conspiracy theory but increasingly likely. 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is obviously in the pocket of the Clintons, intervening and obstructing FBI investigations into Hillary Clinton’s private home server and e-mails at every turn. James Comey, who was on the board of directors at HSBC bank, a bank that gave $81 million to the Clinton Foundation, is also the current head of the FBI. Pieczenik goes further to explain that the U.S. Intelligence community has started a counter-coup against the Clintons, providing information to Julian Assange and Wikileaks. 
We can finally stop blaming Russians. Pieczenik states clearly that US intelligence offered data to Julian Assange. This counter-coup is working against Hillary Clinton and her campaign and seeks to indict major players in her alleged corrupt scheme. Steve Pieczenik ends the video and tells us “the second American revolution” is happening. 
Pieczenik claims both Clintons are frequent travelers on the Lolita Express — billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane. The Lolita Express flies to Epstein’s private island where the elite duo can ‘have sex with minors’ says Pieczenik. He claims the NYPD has a record of the Clintons and close associates that could potentially implicate them in pedophilia. 
Pieczenik tells that officials will charge Hillary Clinton with multiple crimes including obstruction of justice and other charges. He says that Bill Clinton may also suffer criminal charges. He explains the US Intelligence is aware of Clinton’s shady and illicit misdeeds and that these trips on the Lolita Express were supposedly frequent. The following two tabs change content below.

4283,"Chapecoense Soccer Team’s Plane Crashes, Leaving Brazil Devastated - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   After climbing the ranks of Brazilian soccer, the team was on its way to face one of its biggest tests yet: a chance to win the final of the Copa Sudamericana, an international competition for South American soccer. But over the mountains near Medellín, Colombia, the plane carrying the members of Chapecoense, a soccer team from a scrappy industrial city in southern Brazil, made an emergency call on Monday night after experiencing an electrical failure, the authorities said. Moments later, it crashed into the mountains with 77 people aboard. Only six people survived the crash, aviation officials said: three players, two crew members and a journalist who was accompanying the team. The rest were presumed dead, a devastating turn for one of the most remarkable success stories in the tumultuous,   world of Brazilian soccer. “This is a relatively small city, so everyone knows somebody who was on the plane,” said Roberto Panarotto, 44, a professor of media studies in Chapecó, the team’s hometown. He said he had lost a childhood friend, a member of the coaching staff, in the crash. Fans across Brazil had been reveling in Chapecoense’s performance. Brazil has been grappling with extraordinary upheaval this year, including the impeachment of its president, the most severe economic crisis in decades and a   array of political corruption scandals. In the world of Brazilian sports alone, the United States Justice Department has indicted the most powerful executives in Brazilian soccer on graft charges. A former governor of Rio de Janeiro, who helped land the 2016 Summer Olympics, is in jail on charges that he took bribes in a deal to renovate the city’s Maracanã stadium. And now, just as Brazilian soccer appeared to be on the mend after the national team won the gold medal in Rio, the crash left many across the nation stunned. “I’ve never seen or felt anything like this in 46 years of journalism,” said Juca Kfouri, 66, one of Brazil’s most eminent soccer columnists. “At times like this, the shock is so intense that it’s nearly impossible to remain calm. ” Camilo Tobón, a rescue worker, described approaching the wreckage near midnight, not knowing if there would be survivors. “The first thing I saw was the tail of the plane completely shattered,” he said. “There was baggage everywhere. ” But soon, voices were heard. “There were people calling for help you could hear them,” said Jenifer Cardona, a firefighter who helped rescue a Chapecoense goalkeeper as well as a crew member. Ms. Cardona said she had found the two still conscious inside the airplane, a British Aerospace 146 that had taken off from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, pinned against debris and tree branches. But hope had run out for others, Ms. Cardona said. “There are no more wounded, just the dead,” she said. At least 21 journalists were reported to be aboard the plane as well, including reporters from Fox Latin America, the Globo television network and news organizations from southern Brazil. All but one died, the authorities said. At first, the Colombians reported that 81 people had been aboard the plane they later revised the number to 77. Less than a decade ago, Chapecoense was playing in the obscurity of Brazil’s fourth division, making few ripples in the soccer world. But a spectacular rise placed the team near the pinnacle of Brazilian soccer. In southern Brazil, the team was the pride of Chapecó, a staid city of 210, 000 known for its food processing plants. Fans attributed Chapecoense’s ascent to prudent, transparent management, including cooperation with local business leaders who helped pull the team out of a financial crisis over the past decade. “Lots of football clubs in Brazil have problems in the way they are run, with corruption and bad management practices, but Chapecoense is different,” Professor Panarotto said. The pride in Chapecó stands in contrast to the disdain many Brazilians express when it comes to some other facets of Brazilian soccer. Despite the gold medal this summer, there is still lingering dismay over the debacle of Brazil’s loss to Germany during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Stadiums built or upgraded for the World Cup are now the focus of corruption investigations over accusations of bribes paid to politicians. José Maria Marin, the former president of Brazil’s soccer federation, was arrested in Switzerland last year on corruption charges and is now under house arrest at his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan. In 2015, the United States Justice Department also indicted Marco Polo Del Nero, the current president of the federation, on corruption charges. Still, Mr. Del Nero remains in his post. Delfim Peixoto, a rival seeking to unseat him, was among the officials traveling with Chapecoense who died in the crash, according to Brazil’s national soccer federation. Mr. Peixoto, a former federal legislator from the state of Santa Catarina, was a vice president representing southern Brazil in the national soccer federation. In a televised address, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia called the crash “a tragedy that has the whole region in mourning. ” The Copa Sudamericana match this week, which was suspended by soccer officials early Tuesday, was set to be played against a Colombian team on Wednesday in Medellín. On Tuesday, that team, Atlético Nacional, asked the South American Football Confederation to award Chapecoense the trophy as a “posthumous homage to the victims. ” In Brazil, soccer officials suspended all games for a   mourning period, and the teams in Brazil’s top league released a statement offering to loan players to Chapecoense so that it could return to the field. In the world of Brazilian soccer, Chapecoense was an upstart from a humdrum city. While famed Brazilian teams like Fluminense, Corinthians and Pelé’s old team, Santos, were founded around the start of the 20th century, Chapecoense came to life much later, in 1973. In its debut last year in the Copa Sudamericana tournament, it surprised many by making the quarterfinals. This year it topped that, spectacularly. Beginning in August, the team sequentially knocked off rivals from Brazil, Argentina and Colombia  —   including San Lorenzo of Argentina, the team favored by Pope Francis  —   to make the final. The team accomplished a lot without relying on   superstars. Its top scorer, Bruno Rangel, was a    journeyman with more than a dozen stops on his résumé. The team captain, Cléber Santana, 35, had plied his trade all over Brazil and also in Spain. Both were killed, according to an official list of the dead that was confirmed by the team. The final of the Copa Sudamericana was to be held over two legs, first in Medellín and then in Brazil, in the southern city of Curitiba. The matches were to have been the biggest in Chapecoense’s history by a long way. Jéssica Canofre, 21, an engineering student in Chapecó, said that people in the city had been scrambling to get to Curitiba for the game. “All the buses had been booked, there were none left,” she said by telephone, weeping as she described the sense of dismay on Tuesday. “The city is paralyzed. Everything has completely stopped. Classes have been canceled, everything,” Ms. Canofre said. “Everyone was mobilized behind the team and so happy. I just want to go back to yesterday. ” Only a decade ago, Chapecoense was mired in debt, a situation common among Brazilian soccer teams. But a group of business leaders in Chapecó came together to bail the team out, installing new management. The turnaround worked to the point where Chapecoense became known for frequently paying their players in advance, in addition to coveted bonuses. Investments in training installations also paid off, with the team’s improving fortunes luring a solid fan base in a national soccer scene marked by dismal stadium attendance in many cities. Echoing Chapecoense’s ascent, the fortunes of Brazil’s national team have also been on the rise, including the gold medal at the Rio Olympics. And with a new coach at the helm, Adenor Leonardo Bacchi  —   better known as Tite  —   the team has won all six of its last 2018 World Cup qualifying matches. But the crash of Chapecoense’s plane cast a pall over the improving mood. “In a country where so many think they are giants, Chapecoense knew their size and how much they could grow,” said André Rocha, a prominent writer on Brazilian soccer. He called the team “a moral example. ”",0
4284,President Donald Trump’s Cabinet Complete with Swearing-In of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer,"WASHINGTON, DC  —   Vice President Mike Pence presided over the   of the eighteenth United States Trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, on Monday in the White House Indian Treaty Room, declaring, “And with this ceremony, President Donald Trump’s cabinet is finally complete. ”[Pence acknowledged several of the about 50 guests in attendance, including Sen. Pat Roberts and Sen. Bob Dole, then stated, “To hear Bob Lighthizer tell it, he learned everything that he knows from Bob Dole, serving with him for nearly a     in his Senate office. ”  The vice president said with the appointment of Lighthizer, President Trump is keeping his promise to “fight for trade that puts America first. ” He called Lighthizer “one of the leading experts on trade in all of America. ” Pence detailed some of the new trade representative’s career. After working as a private practice lawyer, Lighthizer joined the Senate Committee on Finance, eventually taking on the role of chief counsel and staff director. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan appointed Lighthizer as deputy U. S. Trade representative. Pence continued: In this capacity, he directly contributed to the renewed growth and prosperity of that era by negotiating more than two dozen bilateral trade agreements with nations all across the wider world. For the past 30 years, Robert has represented the American businesses that are the beating heart of our economy as a trade litigator. From manufacturing to agriculture,   to financial services, Robert Lighthizer has distinguished himself as a tireless defender of America’s workers and America’s future, and now he’ll be doing it for the United States of America. The vice president expressed the great confidence he and President Trump have in Lighthizer’s ability to help them “restore trade that is both free and fair,” which “benefits the American people above all else. ” Lighthizer thanked the vice president, Sen. Roberts, and Secretary Wilbur Ross. He then said to his mentor, “But mostly Sen. Dole, who I  —   when I had my hearing, I said  —   ‘I wouldn’t be here but for you.’ And he said, ‘No, no, no.’ I said, ‘People say that, but it’s, in fact, true this time. ’” He added, as a student of presidential history, when the dust settles, “The Trump administration will be ranked as one of the greatest in American history. ” Lighthizer expressed gratitude that he had been chosen to serve the president on the important issue of international trade. He added: I further believe that when my grandchildren, who are here today, talk to their grandchildren, they will say that President Trump permanently reversed the dangerous trajectory of American trade, put America first, made our farmers, ranchers, and workers richer and the country safer. And I hope I can make some small contribution to that accomplishment. Several members of Lighthizer’s family were in attendance for the ceremony, including children and grandchildren. Sen Pat Roberts, the Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, also attended and gave remarks ahead of the vice president. The Kansas senator said he spoke for farmers, ranchers, and people throughout rural and   America who have been going through a rough patch these days. Roberts also acknowledged Dole and the 15 years he has served as mentor to his dear friend Lighthizer. Commerce Secretary Ross, Peter Navarro, and Kellyanne Conway were also in attendance. Dole and Pence stood beside Lighthizer as he signed his commission document. President Trump’s cabinet, including Lighthizer, is listed on the White House website.

4285,"Rouhani Backers Gain Iran Parliamentary Seats, but Not Majority - The New York Times","Supporters of President Hassan Rouhani of Iran have won more seats in parliamentary runoff elections, the Iranian state news media reported Saturday, but they failed to win enough of the 68 contested seats to secure a majority, limiting their ability to carry out significant political and social changes. The gains made by the moderates and reformists were not enough to decisively alter the balance of power in Iran, the president’s supporters acknowledged. They added that political clashes between their lawmakers and conservative   were bound to increase. “Expect a Parliament with a slightly friendlier tone, but also many political crises,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the government. After Friday’s runoff elections for races that were not decided in the first round of voting in February, the reformists and moderate supporters of Mr. Rouhani hold 122 seats in the   Parliament, and the conservative   have 84, the state media reported. Independents  —   who are likely to side with Iran’s conservative clerical leaders, particularly the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on crucial issues  —   have 82 seats, according to the results announced by the state media. Results in the contests for two seats were not available late Saturday. Because there is no party system in Iran  —   all factions have to support the ideology of the Islamic republic  —   candidates for Parliament run as individuals. That means alliances can shift because those who are elected are not bound by the constraints of party affiliation when they vote. Mr. Rouhani had some disagreements with the departing Parliament, but they were minor compared with the open battles between his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and lawmakers, who impeached many of his ministers. Reformists and moderates are hoping that their increased influence will help Mr. Rouhani enact the modest political changes he has proposed, including fewer restraints on Internet use and more personal freedoms. Since he took office in 2013, he has faced resistance in Parliament, but even more opposition from unelected watchdog councils and the judiciary, which is dominated by conservatives. The judiciary and the police recently ordered 7, 000 undercover police officers to patrol the streets and enforce morality standards regarding the way many urban Iranians dress, which conservatives say is not Islamic enough. Mr. Rouhani complained about the move, but he lacks the legal authority to oppose it, his supporters say. Conservatives expect that many of the independent candidates will vote with them, one political analyst said. With no group controlling a majority, many decisions will be hotly contested. “There will be many, and intense, discussions,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran’s conservative leaders. “Making decisions will be more complicated. ”",0
4286,"This small Indiana county sends more people to prison than San Francisco and Durham, N.C., combined. Why? - The New York Times","LAWRENCEBURG, Ind.  —   Donnie Gaddis picked the wrong county to sell 15 oxycodone pills to an undercover officer. If Mr. Gaddis had been caught 20 miles to the east, in Cincinnati, he would have received a maximum of six months in prison, court records show. In San Francisco or Brooklyn, he would probably have received drug treatment or probation, lawyers say. But Mr. Gaddis lived in Dearborn County, Ind. which sends more people to prison per capita than nearly any other county in the United States. After agreeing to a plea deal, he was sentenced to serve 12 years in prison. “Years? Holy Toledo  —   I’ve settled murders for a lot less than that,” said Philip Stephens, a public defender in Cincinnati. Dearborn County represents the new boom in American prisons: mostly white, rural and politically conservative. A bipartisan campaign to reduce mass incarceration has led to enormous declines in new inmates from big cities, cutting America’s prison population for the first time since the 1970s. From 2006 to 2014, annual prison admissions dropped 36 percent in Indianapolis 37 percent in Brooklyn 69 percent in Los Angeles County and 93 percent in San Francisco. But large parts of rural and suburban America  —   overwhelmed by the heroin epidemic and concerned about the safety of diverting people from prison  —   have gone the opposite direction. Prison admissions in counties with fewer than 100, 000 people have risen even as crime has fallen, according to a New York Times analysis, which offers a newly detailed look at the geography of American incarceration. Just a decade ago, people in rural, suburban and urban areas were all about equally likely to go to prison. But now people in small counties are about 50 percent more likely to go to prison than people in populous counties. The stark disparities in how counties punish crime show the limits of recent state and federal changes to reduce the number of inmates. Far from Washington and state capitals, county prosecutors and judges continue to wield great power over who goes to prison and for how long. And many of them have no interest in reducing the prison population. “I am proud of the fact that we send more people to jail than other counties,” Aaron Negangard, the elected prosecutor in Dearborn County, said last year. “That’s how we keep it safe here. ” He added in an interview: “My constituents are the people who decide whether I keep doing my job. The governor can’t make me. The legislature can’t make me. ” But many criminal justice experts say that the size of the disparities undercuts the basic promise of equal protection under the law. “Letting local prosecutors enforce state laws differently throws all notions of equality under the law out the window,” said Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, which advocates reducing incarceration rates. “This data puts governors and legislative leaders on notice that if they want to put criminal justice reforms into effect, they need to look at how prosecutors use and abuse their discretion. ” The analysis is based on previously unpublished data from the Department of Justice on state prisons, which hold the vast majority of American inmates sentenced to a year or more. The divide does not appear to be driven by changes in crime, which fell in rural and urban areas at roughly equal rates, according to the F. B. I. Instead, it reflects growing disagreement about how harshly crime should be punished, especially drivers of the criminal justice system like theft, drugs, weapons and drunken driving. Cities have adopted a more lenient approach to drug offenses in particular, diverting many   drug offenders to probation or treatment rather than to jail. Those choices have started to reverse  —   if only modestly  —   longstanding racial disparities in American prisons, where blacks and Hispanics are incarcerated at drastically higher rates than whites. The annual number of new black prison inmates fell by about 25 percent from 2006 to 2013, and the number of Hispanic inmates fell by about 30 percent, while the number of new white inmates fell by only about 8 percent, according to the most complete federal data. The number of black prisoners is still “shockingly high,” said Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. “Nonetheless, these numbers are encouraging. It suggests that this is not necessarily an intractable problem. ” But rural, mostly white and politically conservative counties have continued to send more drug offenders to prison, reflecting the changing geography of addiction. While crack cocaine addiction was centered in cities, opioid and meth addiction are ravaging small communities like those in Dearborn County, where 97 percent of the population is white. A collection of small, quiet towns near the Ohio River, Dearborn County does not look like a prison capital. Violent crime is rare. There are few empty storefronts. And local officials, flush with money brought in by a popular local casino, have built a convention center and a high school football field fit for a movie set. But the extraordinarily high incarceration rate here  —   about one in 10 adults is in prison, jail or probation  —   is driven less by crime and poverty than by a powerful prosecutor,   judges and a growing heroin epidemic. Opioid addiction spread early here. Mr. Negangard, the prosecutor, has fought the heroin crisis by aggressively going after drug crimes. “If you’re not prosecuting, then you’re de facto legalizing it,” Mr. Negangard said. Mr. Negangard has faced few obstacles to getting more convictions. He supervises his own police force, an unusual arrangement that allows him to investigate and prosecute most of the county’s serious crime. The police go after even minor drug cases, often offering to dismiss drug possession charges in exchange for information on friends or family members who sell drugs. Probation officials are just as strict. Offenders released on probation are tested for drugs frequently, and hundreds of people who violate the terms of their probation have been sent to state prison in the past few years. By 2014, Dearborn County sentenced more people to prison than San Francisco or Westchester County, N. Y. which each have at least 13 times as many people. “It’s government run amok,” said Douglas A. Garner, a local criminal defense attorney. Lawmakers in Indiana, concerned about the rising cost of incarceration, enacted a law that reduced criminal penalties starting in 2014  —   one of at least 40 states to approve measures to reduce incarceration in the past few years. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Mike Pence, now the Republican   nominee. But the new rules, which Mr. Negangard fought, have done little to curb incarceration rates in Dearborn County. Mr. Negangard said the long sentences here are the envy of police officers in Cincinnati. If a suspect is willing to sell drugs in Dearborn County, the Cincinnati police will help steer the case here, where greater punishment is almost assured, he said. One Cincinnati man, Scott Huy, drove from Cincinnati to Dearborn County in 2013, enticed by a heroin deal set up by a police informer. Mr. Huy had already been convicted of drug trafficking twice in Ohio, for which he had served a total of five years in prison. After Mr. Huy sold seven grams of heroin to an undercover officer, he was sentenced to serve 35 years. Lawyers here have a term for when defendants like Mr. Huy realize the geographic disparity: “sticker shock. ” Defense lawyers outside Dearborn County respond with disbelief as well. “That is so far out of line with the crime itself and any common notion of decency,” Jeff Adachi, San Francisco’s public defender, said of Mr. Huy’s sentence. The rural resistance to lighter penalties goes beyond Indiana. Prosecutors in New York City have sharply cut incarceration rates in part by diverting drug offenders from prison after state changes encouraged paths to treatment. But in the rest of the state, prosecutors and judges continue to put drug offenders in prison at a steady flow. In Texas, a series of changes intended to cut the prison population led to large reductions in new prisoners from Houston and Austin. But the rest of the state has had only modest declines. Court systems and jails in many populated areas are overcrowded, putting pressure on judges to offer probation. A federal court ordered California to reduce chronic prison overcrowding in 2009, leading to the largest declines in admissions in the country.   offenders are now released on probation or diverted to local jails. At the same time, cities tend to have more resources to fight addiction outside of jail and prison. In Cincinnati, most people who are caught with small quantities of drugs are charged with a crime but are diverted to drug court, where they are placed in an outpatient treatment program, said Mr. Stephens, the public defender. If the offender completes the program, the charge is dismissed. “People are trying to work with it here in Cincinnati so it doesn’t overwhelm the justice system,” Mr. Stephens said. In smaller counties, prisons are often the only   response to a range of social ills, including drug abuse and mental illness. To handle the expanded caseload, Dearborn County officials spent $11. 5 million to double the size of the local jail and approved $11 million more to expand the county courthouse. But money for drug treatment is scarce. At least 225 of the 250 inmates in the Dearborn County jail have a drug addiction, estimated Jonathan L. Cleary, a county judge. But drug treatment programs can serve only about 40 of them. Mr. Negangard said he wished the county could find more money for drug treatment. But he said about half of all addicts in prison had a criminal   and would keep committing crimes whether they got clean or not. “We can’t just let the bad guys go,” he said.",0
4287,China Observes Ramadan by Praising Itself for ’Religious Freedom’ in Muslim Xinjiang,"The government of China is ringing in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan with a report praising itself for its commitment to human rights in Xinjiang, the westernmost   province in which communist officials have taken large strides to strip public life of Islamic customs. [Xinjiang is home to most of the nation’s Muslim Uighur minority and borders both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Authorities in Beijing have expressed concern that Muslim separatist groups in the region are feeding the population of Islamic State jihadists in the group’s Middle Eastern strongholds in Syria and Iraq. The Islamic State recently released a video featuring Uighur terrorists who vowed to return home to conduct terrorist attacks there.  China’s     media ran the full report from the State Council Information Office on Thursday, which applauds the Chinese government for taking “effective measures to develop the economy, improve people’s living standards, enhance the   of the public, promote ethnic unity and progress, and safeguard the basic rights of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. ” “Normal religious needs of local people have been satisfied,” China’s Global Times asserts, citing the report. The text of the report asserts that “the people of all Xinjiang’s ethnic groups enjoy the same status and the same rights, and must fulfill the same obligations in accordance with the law. Their political rights as citizens are fully protected. ” The   report spends much of its energy on “environmental” rights, health care, and economic equality. On health care, for example, the report condemns the free government preceding the communist People’s Republic of China, claiming Xinjiang’s population suffered “a shortage of doctors and medicines, and epidemics of diseases, such as the plague, smallpox, and cholera. ” It then goes on to claim that the Chinese government has successfully curbed radical Islamic terror in Xinjiang: Since the 1990s, violent terrorists, nationalist separatists, and religious extremists have plotted and committed a series of violent terrorist crimes, causing loss of life to and damaging the property of people of all ethnic groups  …     The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has taken a series of measures designed to strike against violent terrorist crimes, strengthen social protection and control, modernize the governance system and capacity, and safeguard the lives and property of all the people of Xinjiang, whatever their ethnic group. These measures include the promulgation and implementation of the Measures of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Enforcement of the   Law of the People’s Republic of China. The report then asserts that China has protected freedom of religion in Xinjiang by expanding the government’s power to control religious practices by implementing “Regulations on   of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region” and working to “strengthen management of religious affairs in accordance with the law. ” The claims in the report echo those of a similar publication released almost exactly one year ago, titled “Freedom of Religious Belief in Xinjiang,” which asserted that “Normal religious activities in Xinjiang are protected by law, and religious organizations are responsible for coordinating internal religious affairs and the government should not interfere. ” This year, the Chinese government white paper did not claim that the government had minimized its interference in religion, instead claiming its interference aided the “normal” practice of religion. The new report also emphasizes the government’s push to replace the Uighur language with “Putonghua,” or “common tongue” (Mandarin). “The Constitution stipulates that the state promotes the nationwide use of Putonghua in accordance with the law,” the report notes but asserts that the common use of Uighur in public is a sign the government protects the Uighur language. In reality, the Chinese government announced a nationwide campaign to eradicate   languages in January, which corresponded with the development of a plan to promote intermarriage between Uighurs and the Han minority and the imposition of a variety of ordinances that prohibit overly Islamic activity in public. Among the activities prohibited in public in Xinjiang is the wearing of burqas in the capital city of Urumqi, the use of public transportation while wearing any Islamic garb, and the observance of the Ramadan fast by Communist Party officials. “If we think that someone may be fasting, we will invite them to the village office to ‘drink tea’ with us to see if they are fasting or not,” Alim Abdurahman, a Xinjiang official, told Radio Free Asia last year. The Chinese government also forces Muslim shops to carry a variety of alcohol and cigarette brands to encourage the violation of Quranic laws against the consumption of these products. Beijing has also banned Muslim parents in Xinjiang from giving their children overly religious names like “Islam,” “Jihad,” or “Muhammad. ”",0
4289,Democrats’ Leadership Fight Pits West Wing Against Left Wing - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Struggling to respond to Donald J. Trump’s victory, a group of shellshocked Democrats moved swiftly to endorse Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, hoping that he would be a fresh face for a party with a depleted bench. But after steadily adding endorsements from leading Democrats in his bid to take over the party, Mr. Ellison is encountering resistance from a formidable corner: the White House. In a sign of the discord gripping the party, President Obama’s loyalists, uneasy with the progressive Mr. Ellison, have begun casting about for an alternative, according to multiple Democratic officials close to the president. The battle pits the titans of the Democratic Party against one another, with Mr. Obama’s camp at odds with figures like Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Democratic leader, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Mr. Obama’s advisers, some of whom discussed the party leadership race at a White House meeting last week, have talked about whether Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez and former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan would be willing to run for the post. Mr. Perez met with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last week and had lunch Tuesday in the White House Mess with Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama’s senior adviser, while also visiting with David Simas, Mr. Obama’s political director. Some in Mr. Obama’s circle were even holding out hope that Mr. Biden himself could be persuaded to step into the chairmanship as a unifying force for a party reeling after losing the presidency and making scant gains in the House and Senate. But Mr. Biden’s office said Tuesday that he was “not interested in being D. N. C. chair,” though he plans to “remain deeply involved in helping shape the direction of the Democratic Party moving forward. ” The tumultuous tenure of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was forced out as party leader in July, convinced a wide range of Democrats that whoever takes over the committee must make it their sole focus. “There’s too much at stake for us not to have somebody working in a   capacity,” said Michael Blake, a New York assemblyman and veteran of both of Mr. Obama’s campaigns, who is considering a D. N. C. vice chairmanship. “This has to be your priority. ” But there are other reasons for the discomfort with Mr. Ellison that illustrate lingering divisions after a bruising presidential primary fight and a general election in which Hillary Clinton suffered deep losses among   whites and could not match Mr. Obama’s support among young and nonwhite voters. Some Democrats, in Mr. Obama’s orbit and beyond, say that elevating Mr. Ellison would amount to handing the party to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s primary race opponent, and his liberal followers. Mr. Ellison was a   backer of Mr. Sanders’s presidential campaign, and Mr. Sanders has been rallying support for Mr. Ellison’s D. N. C. bid. Already a polarizing figure among Democrats, he ignited new controversy this week by saying the party needed to “go beyond identity politics. ” “It’s not good enough for someone to say: ‘I’m a woman! Vote for me! ’” Mr. Sanders told students in Boston on Sunday, a comment widely seen as a criticism of Mrs. Clinton. “No, that’s not good enough. What we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil fuel industry. ” This call for an   brand of liberalism is what galvanized so many of his supporters, but his blunt language also served to remind some Democrats of the divisive primary race. There is little appetite for a replay of that fight in the D. N. C. race, which will be decided by members of the committee when they gather in February for their winter meeting. Some top Democrats had hoped to   a contest by backing Mr. Ellison’s bid. Mr. Schumer, Ms. Warren and an array of House members and unions were lining up behind him even before he formally entered the race. But along with his inability to do the job full time and his links to Mr. Sanders, Mr. Ellison’s past criticism of Mr. Obama and praise for Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, worry some Democrats looking for a figure to lead the opposition to Mr. Trump. Mr. Ellison, a Muslim, defended Mr. Farrakhan in the 1990s, saying he was “not an ” and has positioned himself on the left flank of congressional Democrats on Israel. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the   League, called Mr. Ellison “an important ally in the fight against  ” but said he had taken positions on the   conflict “on which we strongly differ and that concern us. ” “We hope that all candidates for this post will make clear where they stand on these issues, and that the Democratic National Committee will make a choice that affirms the longstanding bipartisan consensus on a strong U. S.  relationship,” he said. Aides to Mr. Ellison were going to make him available for a telephone interview, but then declined when informed that he would be asked about his past comments on Mr. Farrakhan. They emailed a list of his links to the Jewish community and a statement that said, “Democrats need an organizer who will energize the   across this country to build the party from the bottom up. ” A handful of state Democratic leaders have entered or are considering entering the race, and Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor and D. N. C. chairman, has also expressed interest. But it is Mr. Perez, a son of Dominican immigrants, whom many prominent Democrats would like to see enter the race, and who appears most willing to consider it. The A. F. L. . I. O. has been considering an endorsement of Mr. Ellison but delayed its decision, in part because organized labor has a good relationship with Mr. Perez. Mr. Perez called Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A. F. L. . I. O. to tell him he was seriously considering a run and to ask him to hold off on an endorsement, according to three Democratic officials familiar with the conversation. A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment on the race and said the administration was neutral. But many in the president’s sphere think highly of Mr. Perez and Ms. Granholm. “He’s very connected to the experience of everyday   people, and he has a connection to immigrant communities, as well,” David Axelrod, Mr. Obama’s longtime strategist, said of Mr. Perez, who is also mulling a run for governor in Maryland in 2018. “He comes to this with a lot of assets if he were to step forward. ” Mr. Perez and Mrs. Granholm, who both declined to discuss whether they intended to run, were early supporters of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, which could turn the D. N. C. race into the    proxy war some Democrats want to avoid.",0
4291,Being Crazy in a Sick Society is Actually Healthy,"posted by Eddie To be normal is to be sick Krishnamurti once said that “it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” However, being born and brought up in such a society, most people can’t realize that it is sick, let alone that they are part of this sickness, just like fish, which, living in water, cannot realize that they are in water and part of the sea life. What does it mean to live a normal life? In the modern world, especially in the West, it means to be brainwashed at a very young age for over a decade by what we callschooling, to later on work as a wage slave for almost the rest of your life competing with others so as to merely survive, to mindlessly consume products without end because manipulative advertising convinced you to do so, while at the same time you unconsciously harm the planet we inhabit, to slowly poison your physical organism by feeding it with disease causing foods, to obey to the rules and believe in the dogmas handed down to you by those in authority, to be passive and uncreative, suppressing yourself in countless of ways, living in suffering yet doing nothing to overcome it. If you stop for a moment and think, you might realize that this kind of living is absolutely sick, yet it is accepted by almost everyone as healthy and is actually rewarded by society. In fact, those of us who are better at living this way are considered to be the most successful and respected, while those who are different, more sensitive and intelligent, desiring to create a different path in life, are ridiculed and looked down upon, being considered as stupid, weird, or even crazy. But what is the point of living the way most people live? Life can be lived so much better — we can live playfully, filled with laughter and love, with a desire to be creative, at peace with ourselves and others, savoring the gifts of existence. Unfortunately, only a few people manage to think outside the mental boxthat society has provided us with and escape from the matrix they’ve been unconsciously living in since they were born. Those are the rebellious ones who at some point in their lives felt the need to break free from the chains of tradition and help create a more beautiful world for all beings on earth. Rebelling against normalcy To rebel against normalcy is the most difficult thing you can do because you need the guts to be honest with yourself and others. To voice the truth in a world where almost everyone is living in lies is quite a risky thing to do. Speaking the truth means going against the current of tradition, which in turn means confronting the herd mentality and having the strength to keep on going your way regardless of the hardships you might face. There have been many people who had the courage to rebel against the normalcy of our sick society, but most of them couldn’t deal with the negative consequences their actions had on themselves. When nobody embraces your uniqueness and is able to understand you, and when everybody is trying to suppress you and help you to fit back into society, it is easy to lose courage, and not uncommon to experience immense psychological anguish. That’s why some of the greatest minds to have ever walked on earth were suffering from serious mental and emotional issues. And although now, after a long time since they passed away, they are recognized as geniuses, when they were alive they were seen by the majority as weirdos or lunatics. Once you realize how sick the way you and most people are living is and openly go against it, trying to reclaim your freedom and create your own path in life, you are bound to get in trouble. People, including family members and friends will do everything to put obstacles on your path with the intention to “help” you become normal again, exactly like they are. Instead of helping you to grow your wings of consciousness and leave behind what is burdening your psyche, they do their best to cut them off and make you crawl by their side so that you can suffer together. Dare to be crazy Your inner voice has for a very long time been telling you that life could be lived much more beautifully, and you should trust it because it’s right. And although it might be the most difficult thing to achieve, it is the only thing worth working for, because what is the point of living otherwise? What is the point of wasting your entire life just because others told you that’s how you are supposed to live? If you desire to live the way you want to live and not the way others expect you to live, you need to gather the courage in your heart to be a little crazy — crazy according to society’s standards. You need to distance yourself from the comfort of the herd and follow your calling, without caring what others think of you. You need to be willing to go through hardships and experience pain, without giving up trying to turn your dreams into reality. Remember: no matter how much pain you might experience by walking the path of non-conformity, the rewards of doing so far outweigh the disadvantages. Just like a mother experiences tremendous pain while giving birth, you are experiencing immense pain birthing a new kind of life. A life of beauty, of joy, of celebration. Pain goes hand in hand with change, so embrace it, allow it to guide you and let it be a catalyst for your inner metamorphosis. source:",0
4292,Dem Sen Warner Bemoans FBI Director Announcement: An Attempt to ’Distract’ From Comey Hearing - Breitbart,"”Clearly this is an effort by the president to try to distract attention from our hearings today and tomorrow,” @MarkWarner says. pic. twitter.  In an appearance Wednesday on “CBS This Morning,” Sen.

Despite having said Wray had a good reputation, Warner still maintained there was the possibility of wrongdoing that deserved focus. “[B]ut clearly this is an effort by the president to try to distract attention from our hearings today and our hearings tomorrow,” Warner said. “I think we’re going to see some pretty interesting things this morning. Because not only do we have reports that the president tried to intervene with FBI Director Comey and ask him to back off the investigation of General [Michael] Flynn, which would be totally inappropriate, but we also have reports that he also asked the Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and the head of the NSA Adm.

4293,Dakota Access Announces Plan to Drill Under Missouri River Within Weeks,"We Are Change 
Oceti Sakowin, ND – As water protectors dig in for the winter near construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), many rumors have been circulating about whether DAPL was in fact going to halt construction, as had been requested by the Department of Justice and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in September .
Many claims have been made that the Army Corps of Engineers, in negotiations with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, had ordered a 30-day pause on DAPL construction. As we reported on Sunday , the Army Corps has in fact clarified that the 30-day halt was “ only a proposal ” and no work stoppage has been implemented.
On Monday, November 7th, Unicorn Riot documented active DAPL construction that could be seen from the main Oceti Sakowin encampment.

— Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) November 7, 2016 

The afternoon of November 8th, 2016, as the US Presidential election was well underway, Dakota Access, LLC released a statement denying recent claims from the Army Corps of Engineers that they had agreed to a slowdown in pipeline construction.
Dakota Access also claims a public statement made by the Army Corps was “ a mistake and the Army Corps intends to rescind it. ”
Dakota Access, LLC had previously made a statement announcing that eviction would take place of the Oceti Sakowin 1851 treaty camp which had been set up directly in the path of the pipeline.
The appearance of Dakota Access making public statements which accurately predicted police actions was denounced in an article by Sarah Lazare at Alternet as “ clear evidence ” of “ outrageous militarized police collusion with Big Oil. ”
The statement by Dakota Access, LLC goes on to claim that they have “ completed construction of the pipeline on each side of Lake Oahe ” and states that they are “ currently mobilizing horizontal drilling equipment to the drill box site. ”
Below you can see drone footage of Dakota Access machines building Hesco barriers , normally used to protect US military bases in war zones like Iraq or Afghanistan, to protect an area believed to be the drill box site from water protectors.
According to the release, Dakota Access expects to have fully mobilized all equipment needed to drill under the Missouri River within 2 weeks. Once all the equipment is in place at the construction site, Dakota Access plans to immediately commence horizontal drilling underneath the river.
Dakota Access, LLC closes their statement by admitting their company is still waiting on two construction permits from the Army Corps of Engineers to start the process of drilling underneath the Missouri River.
Below is the full public statement by Dakota Access, LLC.

The Dakota Access, LLC statement is reported to be in response to a comment given to Bloomberg News on Monday, in which an Army Corps of Engineers spokesman claimed that DAPL had agreed to slow down construction.
In an interview with NowThis on November 2nd, when asked about the Dakota Access Pipeline, President Barack Obama said “ we’re gonna let it play out for several more weeks. ”
Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Tim Kaine mentioned in a recent interview the possibility of re-routing the pipeline, which Dakota Access now seems to have repudiated as a possible outcome. DAPL spokeswoman Vicki Granado told the Guardian :
“ We are not aware that any consideration is being given to a reroute, and we remain confident we will receive our easement in a timely fashion. ” – Vicki Granado, DAPL spokesperson
Jan Hasselman, attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, reacted to DAPL’s plan to openly pursue drilling:
“ Starting construction without permits would be beyond the pale, even for Dakota Access. It is deeply irresponsible to keep putting investors’ money into this route when both the President and Senator Tim Kaine are openly discussing rerouting away from Lake Oahe. ” – Jan Hasselman, Attorney
Tuesday’s comments from Dakota Access appear intended to reassure investors who may be starting to have doubts about funding the pipeline project. It was reported earlier this week that Norweigan bank DNB was considering withdrawing its loan of $342.36 million to Energy Transfer Partners – almost 10 percent of the total funding for the pipeline.
DNB issued a statement on their website expressing concern:
“ DNB is concerned about how the situation surrounding the oil pipeline in North Dakota has developed. The bank will therefore use its position as lender to the project to encourage a more constructive process to find solutions to the conflict that has arisen. If these initiatives do not provide DNB with the necessary comfort, DNB will evaluate its further participation in the financing of the project. ” – DNB statement
On Tuesday, it was announced that the North Dakota Public Service Commission has proposed fining Dakota Access, LLC $15,000 for failing to properly notify state agencies of ancient cultural artifacts discovered at pipeline work sites. Dakota Access is alleged to have violated the terms of its permits by not properly announcing artifact discoveries, as well as by changing the pipeline route without seeking the permission of the Public Service Commission.

4295,Special Ed School Vouchers May Come With Hidden Costs - The New York Times,"For many parents with disabled children in public school systems, the lure of the private school voucher is strong. Vouchers for special needs students have been endorsed by the Trump administration, and they are often heavily promoted by state education departments and by private schools, which rely on them for tuition dollars. So for families that feel as if they are sinking amid academic struggles and behavioral meltdowns, they may seem like a life raft. And often they are. But there’s a catch. By accepting the vouchers, families may be unknowingly giving up their rights to the very help they were hoping to gain. The government is still footing the bill, but when students use vouchers to get into private school, they lose most of the protections of the federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. Many parents, among them Tamiko Walker, learn this the hard way. Only after her son, who has a speech and language disability, got a scholarship from the John M. McKay voucher program in Florida did she learn that he had forfeited most of his rights. “Once you take those McKay funds and you go to a private school, you’re no longer covered under IDEA  —   and I don’t understand why,” Ms. Walker said. In the meantime, public schools and states are able to transfer out children who put a big drain on their budgets, while some private schools end up with students they are not equipped to handle, sometimes asking them to leave. And none of this is against the rules. “The private schools are not breaking the law,” said Julie Weatherly, a   lawyer who consults for school districts in Florida and other states. “The law provides no accountability measures. ” McKay is the largest of 10 such disability scholarship programs across the country. It serves over 30, 000 children who have special needs. At the Senate confirmation hearing for Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary, she cited research from the conservative Manhattan Institute, saying that “93 percent of the parents utilizing that voucher are very, very pleased with it. ” Legal experts say parents who use the vouchers are largely unaware that by participating in programs like McKay, they are waiving most of their children’s rights under IDEA, the landmark 1975 federal civil rights law. Depending on the voucher program, the rights being waived can include the right to a free education the right to the same level of   services that a child would be eligible for in a public school the right to a   or   teacher and the right to a hearing to dispute disciplinary action against a child. It’s not just Florida. Private school choice programs in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wisconsin also require parents to waive all or most IDEA rights. In several other states, the law is silent on the disability rights of voucher students. The Walkers obtained a McKay voucher midway through their son’s   year, when the Port St. Lucie school district told them it planned to remove the boy from general education classes and place him in a “cluster” classroom for students with emotional difficulties. (Ms. Walker, and another parent quoted in this article, asked that their children’s names not be published to protect their privacy.) “He has more potential than that,” Ms. Walker said. The family, which is black, has filed a federal lawsuit accusing the district of racial discrimination and other wrongdoing, for disciplining their son harshly and refusing to place him in a   classroom. The McKay program has not provided a simple alternative for the Walkers. They used an $11, 000 voucher to enroll their son in the Achievers Institute of Science, Art and Technology. But they were caught unaware, they said, when the private school charged them an additional $2, 400 in fees. (Achievers Institute has since gone out of business.) The boy now uses his McKay voucher to attend the Virtual Schools of Excellence. He visits a local “learning center” two to three days a week, and the Port St. Lucie school district sends contractors there to provide him with speech and occupational therapy. He completes the rest of his instruction online, at home. “We’re happy to the point where he’s safe,” Ms. Walker said, but she regrets that her son no longer receives the same intensive instruction in social cues that he benefited from in public school, before he became a voucher student. Federal law requires public school districts to assess the needs of   students enrolled in private schools. But districts are not obligated to provide those children with the same services they would receive in a public setting  —   even if a child’s private school tuition is taxpayer funded through a voucher. Private schools that participate in McKay are not required to demonstrate that they use any type of specialized curriculum to meet disabled children’s needs. Still, many private schools say they go beyond the letter of the law in an effort to serve McKay students. Trina Angelone, chief executive of the Virtual Schools of Excellence, said the school employed     teachers in both its online program and its   learning center, even though this is not required by law. A disabled child “going to a typical public school classroom is going to be with maybe 20 or 25 students, using textbooks, following along at the pace of the class,” she said. “In the virtual space,” she said, “the child is really getting    attention, moving at their own pace. ” But ultimately, there is no guarantee that students will receive the same level of disability services in private schools that they were entitled to in public school, a limitation that parents may not fully understand. The state affidavit that parents sign in order to receive a McKay scholarship, for example, says nothing about forfeiting IDEA rights and services. It also does not explain that parents are responsible for any additional fees a private school may charge on top of a voucher, which can range from $5, 000 to $23, 000. The Florida Department of Education website provides other materials with more detail on the legal implications of participating in McKay, but the documents are difficult to find and decipher.   documents are often similarly opaque. In a statement provided to The New York Times, the Port St. Lucie school district said, “Every effort is made to fully inform parents of the difference between public school services and private school services when a child utilizes a McKay Scholarship. ” The Florida Department of Education declined requests for a phone interview. In an email, a department spokeswoman said there had been “very few complaints on this issue. ” Robyn Rennick, a board member of the Coalition of McKay Scholarship Schools, said that private schools should be transparent with families about the services they provide but that the onus was on parents to ask detailed questions. “This is a buyer’s market,” she said. “You go and say, ‘I love your big building, but what is the expertise of your teachers? ’” Many McKay recipients, it appears, do eventually end up back in the public school system. The average length of time in the program is 3. 6 years, according to data provided to The Times by the Florida Department of Education, and 85 percent of McKay recipients are in elementary or middle school. Families who leave the program sometimes do so after moving residences. Other times they conclude that their child’s needs would be better met in a public school. Carla Donaldson of West Palm Beach used a McKay voucher to send her son Zachary, who has autism spectrum disorder, to a private school that specializes in serving   students. “I needed a break from the fight” for adequate services in a public setting, she said. Zachary blossomed there socially, his mother said. “Unfortunately, he did pay the price academically,” she said. When Zachary returned to public school in eighth grade, he had to work to catch up. “There is no perfect school,” Ms. Donaldson said. Some families find they do not have a choice about whether to continue at a private school. Last year, Lisa Siegel was surprised to learn that she had few legal options after her seventh grader, who received a McKay scholarship, was suspended and then asked not to return to a religious school in Davie, Fla. near Fort Lauderdale, after a series of behavioral incidents. Ms. Siegel’s son is on the autism spectrum. In public schools, IDEA guarantees parents the right to a hearing in which they can seek to overturn a disciplinary action if the child’s misbehavior was a manifestation of a disability. That is not the case in a private school. “You don’t have much recourse,” said Ms. Siegel, whose son is now at a public school magnet program for marine sciences. “I never in a million years thought that in this private educational setting that my child would not be protected by state and federal law. ”",0
4296,How to Avoid Drug Testing in Russia: Radio Silence and Secure Perimeters - The New York Times,"GLASGOW  —   Russian athletes, under intense scrutiny after revelations of widespread doping, remain elusive to antidoping authorities, failing to provide updates on their whereabouts and training inside military areas that are inaccessible to   officials, according to the global watchdog for sports doping. “There are still challenges when working within Russia,” Rob Koehler, the deputy director general of the World   Agency, told dozens of government and sports officials on Sunday at the agency’s board meetings here. Mr. Koehler said that recent Russian cyberattacks on WADA made it difficult to trust the country, as did Russia’s refusal to admit to   doping after WADA published an investigative report in July that invoked forensic proof of violations. Russia’s national antidoping agency and laboratory remain decertified as a result of the investigation, and its track and field athletes are still barred from international competition. Mr. Koehler also said that the Russian authorities had locked down the Moscow lab’s storage facilities, hindering global investigators’ progress in analyzing doping samples. “To cross the line is a criminal offense,” Mr. Koehler said of the security perimeter, requesting that it be lifted. Sunday’s meetings focused on the future, not just for Russia but also for the antidoping agency itself, which has faced criticism that it was slow to pursue tips from Russian   for years. With momentum from a coordinated group of national governments that help fund WADA, the agency is now seeking a stronger role in unearthing antidoping violations and imposing discipline in response rather than deferring to sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee, which have financial interests in competitions. “It sounds like a very intriguing spy novel, the things this organization has to deal with recently,” said Edwin Moses, the American Olympic hurdler, who is on the WADA board. Minutes after Mr. Koehler’s report on the continuing obstacles in Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin’s antidoping appointee, Vitaly Smirnov, denied that the government had taken part in the elaborate cheating scheme that was detailed in the WADA report in July, weeks before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. That report, which prompted WADA to urge the I. O. C. to bar Russia from the Rio Games, said that Russia’s internal intelligence service had helped breach doping controls at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. The report also said that Russia’s deputy sports minister had played a critical role in the effort to cover up doping. Mr. Smirnov, an    former Soviet sports official, said that the deputy sports minister, Yuri D. Nagornykh, had been fired and had never represented the government. “If a certain person is a criminal doesn’t mean the whole country is,” he said. Vitaly Mutko, a former sports minister for Russia who was recently promoted to deputy prime minister, was accused in the WADA report  —   written by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren  —   of being complicit in athletic cheating. Mr. Koehler expressed frustration that Mr. Mutko had suggested that the McLaren report was fabricated and that people associated with creating it could be prosecuted. Mr. McLaren has continued his inquiry into which Russian athletes benefited from the state system he detailed in July. The results are expected on Dec. 9, WADA said Sunday. At WADA’s last board meeting, in May, the agency detailed the challenges that   professionals had encountered in collecting doping samples in Russia, including athletes’ smuggling clean urine, offering bribes and climbing out of windows to escape when testers arrived at their doors. The difficulties have continued in recent months, Mr. Koehler said, noting that although there had been no reports of the most brazen behavior, people had been nonetheless uncooperative with the relatively few   officials dispatched to cover the whole country. The number of drug tests conducted in Russia this year amounts to about 10 percent of the usual total. That percentage represents about 1, 660 tests throughout the country, including hundreds of failed attempts to track down athletes at specified locations. Still, WADA’s president, Craig Reedie, called the current situation “a lot better than it was” a few months ago and said that he was eager to restore the country to good standing. “They are the biggest country in the world, a very enthusiastic sporting country,” Reedie said, though some have suggested that breaches such as those that happened at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, may warrant further sanctions at the 2018 Winter Olympics. “Not only do they want to take part in competition, but they want to host them. ” It can be expensive and logistically burdensome to host major athletic events, and Russian cities regularly welcome numerous major competitions. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation is set to hold the sports’ world championships in Sochi early next year. At Sunday’s public meeting and in private meetings in preceding days, officials in Glasgow discussed WADA’s own plans for overhaul, outlining a framework for strengthening the agency’s investigative powers with six employees dedicated to intelligence work. The board approved a policy to protect   as well as a proposal to empower WADA to discipline sports organizations and national delegations of athletes. Günter Younger, WADA’s new investigative chief and a former employee of the German criminal police and Interpol, emphasized that his work would be walled off within WADA and called   the backbone of his operations. “Everyone is picking on Russia,” said Mr. Younger, who in 2015 took part in the first   inquiry into doping there. He said that Russian   had inspired reforms in the first place, adding, “It was Russians who took down this system. ” Mr. Younger said that other informants might be more willing to come forward if they knew WADA could then mete out punishments to doping violators, as it is now seeking to do. “You need power,” Mr. Younger said. “If you’re an advisory body, you come at me with a feather  —   if there’s no punishment, why should I talk to you?” How exactly to assign WADA such authority, and when that authority might take effect, is unclear. It could be achieved through amendments to the global antidoping code, which would be voted on by board members at a future meeting. The I. O. C. is a signatory to that code, and it is unclear if the organization would challenge such a change. Mr. Reedie, whose longstanding ties to the I. O. C. have raised    concerns in the past, was   to the WADA presidency on Sunday in an uncontested vote. Last summer, he told The New York Times that WADA was better suited to give advice than to play an active regulatory role. “We’re not going to turn to people and say, ‘These are the rules obey them,’” he said in June. He said on Sunday that he regretted those words and that his outlook had evolved. “People pretty much thought WADA was a service provider,” he said of the agency’s   history. “I think as this whole business develops, now we may have a little more effective authority. ” Richard W. Pound, the founding president of WADA and a former I. O. C. executive, praised the prospect of WADA growing into a fiercer watchdog. “It’s a unique opportunity to make that step,” he said, “to go from cheerleader to regulator. ”",0
4297,Chicago Releases Videos of Police Shootings - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   Chicago officials on Friday released hundreds of videos and other investigative materials from 101 cases in which police officers fired their weapons or otherwise used force against civilians  —   a remarkable turnaround for an administration that fought last year not to release a video showing an officer fatally shooting a teenager as he lay sprawled on the ground. Some of the Police Department’s critics hailed the release by Chicago’s Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates claims of misconduct and excessive force, as a watershed moment for a city whose police and political culture have a long history of secrecy and obfuscation. Chicago officials refused to release a video showing Officer Jason Van Dyke, who is white, shooting    Laquan McDonald, who was black, 16 times, until a judge’s order forced the city to make it public last November, more than a year later. Officer Van Dyke was charged with murder. “This is a significant step towards transparency in Chicago,” said Craig B. Futterman, a University of Chicago law professor who directs a civil rights and police accountability project at the law school. “We’ve had decades of the code of silence and a lack of police accountability and institutional denial. The real test is, what does the new normal look like going forward?” But he noted that the city had changed its practices only under tremendous pressure, and argued that the change did not go far enough, still allowing too much time to pass before evidence is released. Police conduct and the city’s handling of it have become a political crisis for Chicago’s leaders, including Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who faced accusations that he did not want the McDonald video made public while he was in a   fight. For months after the video’s release, he faced calls for his resignation. Mr. Emanuel appointed a task force to look into police practices, and dismissed the city’s police superintendent. Anita Alvarez, the state’s attorney for Cook County, the prosecutor who did not charge Officer Van Dyke until 13 months had passed and a judge had forced release of the video, lost a primary election in March. The Justice Department has begun an investigation into the Police Department, and the mayor’s task force issued a scathing report saying that racism had contributed to a long pattern of institutional failures by a department that had lost the trust of residents. Many of the videos released on Friday, recorded by police dashboard cameras, business surveillance cameras and bystanders’ cellphones, were blurry or grainy, or showed little that was of interest. But some contain stark images of the kind of violent, even deadly, encounters that critics of the Chicago Police Department say are all too common. In a case from 2012, surveillance video shows three men inside an electronics business, apparently robbing it, loading a minivan and then crashing it through a closed garage door, causing officers who were standing outside to leap out of the way. Officers can be seen shooting at the van  —   one ejects a spent magazine and reloads  —   killing one man, David Strong, 27, and wounding two others, Leland Dudley, 33, and John Givens, 32. The two survivors were later convicted of murder because Mr. Strong died during their commission of a felony they also sued the city for excessive force. In another 2012 case, witnesses called the police to report that a man had been hitting people, and multiple videos show the man, Ismael Jamison, shirtless and heavily muscled, pacing up and down a sidewalk, gesturing and grabbing a woman. Shortly after the police arrived, Mr. Jamison rushed at an officer, and the police shot him and shocked him with an electric stun weapon, struggling to subdue him even as he bled on the pavement. Mr. Jamison, 28, survived. In a 2014 video, officers shoot into a vehicle, wounding a man, Michael Cote, who was trying to get away. Videos from 2015 show an officer in plain clothes beating a man, Terrence Clarke, who was eating with his family in a restaurant, after Mr. Clarke complained about his meal, and then saying that Mr. Clarke had attacked him.   relations between the Chicago police and residents, especially   boiled over after the release of the McDonald video. Since then, the city has experienced a marked increase in bloodshed. Shootings are up by 50 percent for the year, with hundreds injured and more than 230 people dead. There are indications that the department is getting little cooperation from mistrustful citizens, making it harder to solve crimes on the streets. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Emanuel said the release of the new materials was “a major step forward to promote transparency, and it makes us one of the leading cities in America to guarantee timely public access to this breadth of information involving sensitive police incidents. ” But, he added, “We know there is a lot more work to do. ” Chicago’s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police criticized the release of the material as “irresponsible,” saying the city took the action with little notice to union leaders. “It is sad when, with all the talk about transparency and communication, they decide to operate in this manner,” the union said in a statement. William Calloway, a Chicago activist who pushed for the release of the McDonald video, called Friday’s release “damage control” by a mayor who was “trying to appease the public. ” But he said the videos offered valuable evidence that excessive force was endemic, not isolated. Basileios J. Foutris, a Chicago civil rights lawyer, said Friday’s release was welcome, but that the review authority “should have been doing this a long time ago,” and seemed to still be withholding some written material. He represents the family of Quintonio LeGrier, a    who was fatally shot in a confrontation with the police, in a lawsuit against the city. The 101 cases, 68 of which had video, date from 2011. They include every open investigation into   shootings  —   whether anyone was hit or not. They also include every case in which a civilian was killed or seriously injured by an officer or in police custody, excluding   wounds, according to officials on the review board, who are appointed by the mayor. It was not always clear what the videos were showing, in part because most have no sound. The videos of Mr. Jamison, for example, “left me with more questions than answers,” said Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, who analyzed the recordings. “There’s this guy who is walking around, very agitated,” she said. “And there’s suddenly a police officer holding a gun, pointing a gun at this individual  —   but I don’t see where he’s arrived from, if there was some type of exchange before. ” But the recordings offer a   set of raw, if incomplete, looks at some of the confused,   and dangerous moments that punctuate police work. In one video, an officer can be heard saying, “We got to get our story straight,” and later an officer says he is glad he “didn’t miss” a suspect, adding, “I was running when I shot him. ” But the action they are describing is unseen. Officials from the police review authority emphasized that they were not making any judgments about whether excessive force or other misconduct occurred in any of the cases, which are all still under investigation. And they did not single out any cases with the potential to become the most controversial. Instead, the officials emphasized their hope that disclosing the videos and other materials from the investigative files would make people in Chicago more confident in the procedures for investigating police misconduct. “These past few months, as the city has struggled with so many questions about policing and about police accountability, it has been clear that we all agree that there is a lack of trust, and that increased transparency is essential to rebuilding that trust,” said Sharon Fairley, the police review authority’s chief administrator. “Today represents an important first step toward that. ”",0

'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.''I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.'   5, 2016 Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening during a rally in Reno, Nevada after they determined a protester in the audience with a gun posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate. ‘Go! Go!’ they shouted as they whisked him away and a combination of local police and private security wrestled the suspect to the ground. Thousands of people scattered like a sea of bodies, screams rang out and authorities dragged the man away as he kicked and strained. Trump returned to the stage just five minutes later. ‘Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,’ Trump declared. ‘But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.’ ‘I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don’t get enough credit. They don’t get enough credit. They’re amazing people.’ Secret Service Swarms in to Protect Donald Trump After Scare in Reno Trump had spotted the protester and claimed he was a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to ‘take him out.’ As he returned to his speech, Trump thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. ‘You were amazing, fellas,’ he said. ‘I saw what you were doing. That’s a tough group of people right that… Nobody messes with our people, right?’ Trump then returned to his regular speech.

— CBS News (@CBSNews) November 6, 2016 Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trump’s motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. ‘CNN sucks!’ one man yelled. ‘You people caused this!’ Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued. Saturday’s incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to get Trump out of harm’s way. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. ‘I was ready for him, but it’s much easier if the cops do it, don’t we agree?’ Trump said at the time. ‘And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right?’ At this time a motive is not clear. source  ",0
4299,CBS’s Schieffer Sees ’Parallels’ of Comey Firing to the JFK Assassination - Breitbart,"Friday on “CBS This Morning,”   CBS News personality Bob Schieffer reacted President Donald Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey earlier this week.  While many have made comparisons to Trump’s handling of Comey to Watergate, Schieffer said he saw “parallels” to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. “You know, there are many parallels Watergate,” Schieffer explained. “But I have to tell you, I think all the way back to the Kennedy assassination, to draw parallels. I was there, as you know. I have always felt that if Lee Harvey Oswald had been put on trial, a lot of these conspiracy theories that are still circulating today would have been put at rest then. It is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump finds a way to reassure the American people that these questions about Russia are not true if that is his version. He’s got to lay it all out and find ways not just to tweet out every morning the news is being made up by the news media. ” “He’s got to show some proof,” he continued. “He has got to give them some reason to believe that these things are not true. Frankly, unless he is able to do this, this is going to dog his presidency for the rest of his term. Look at what’s happened in Washington right now. It’s come to a complete stop while the country and Washington tries to digest the firing of James Comey. Putting this to rest is not going to be helped by firing the guy who was doing the investigation. Sending these people out to explain the inexplicable is not going to help. He’s making fools of his own staff. The White House appears to be in chaos. It is the original amateur hour as we look at it from the outside. He’s got a lot of work to do, and so far what he has done has not helped in my view. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
4300,"American Revolution Has Now Begun, May Last Entire Decade","
A sobering new Security Council ( SC ) analytical report on the US presidential election states that a new American Revolution has begun which today’s popular vote is just the beginning of; and that could fully last up to an entire decade, especially if this election is stolen from Donald Trump. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
According to this report, Federation intelligence analysts in their “deciphering/uncovering” what the current US presidential election is really all about have heavily relied on “outliers” [a thing situated away or detached from the main body or system] such as artificial intelligence ( AI ) models, social media trends and psychological analysis of the American electorate.
This report notes that the Security Councils use of these “outliers” to both understand and explain what is occurring during this US presidential election provides the only proven scientific evidence of what is occurring as the so called polling data used by the American propaganda media has been proven to be nothing more than a manipulation device used to keep people from voting for or supporting the anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump.
Examples of this being true, this report explains, lie in too many examples to fully cite—but includes the once respected Monmouth University poll found manipulating data to favor Hillary Clinton , news networks NBC and CBS found manipulating polling data to show Hillary Clinton leading Donald Trump when she was actually losing , and CNN manipulating their poll data to favor Hillary Clinton too .
Unlike manipulated polling data showing Hillary Clinton will win this election, however, this report continues, the objective and independent scientific “outliers” used by Security Council research analysts show not only Donald Trump winning—but winning in a landslide victory.
Evidence proving this assertion of a Donald Trump US presidential win, this report notes, lies first with artificial intelligence analysis—that includes the MogIA supercomputer showing Trump winning in landslide and showing he is more popular than President Obama , and a just released AI computer simulation showing Trump winning with 289 electoral votes compared to Clinton’s 249 .
Social media trend lines in this election, likewise, proves a Donald Trump landslide win in this election, this report continues, as his Facebook-Twitter-Instagram-YouTube “presence” dwarfs Hillary Clinton’s by a staggering 74 million —and that is further validated by the over 700,000 Americans who have come to his campaign rallies, as opposed to the barely 60,000 that have attended Hillary Clinton’s .
Most fascinating though of the “outliers” used in this Security Council report is the psychological analysis of the American electorate conducted by a virtually unknown US political project called “ We Need Smith ”—whose scientifically conducted studies shockingly proved that anyone from a liberal Democrat, to a conservative Republican was able to win the US presidency as long as they promised to destroy the corrupt political system currently ruling America .
The “We Need Smith” project, this report explains, is named after a popular US Great Depression era movie called Mr. Smith Goes To Washington about a newly appointed United States Senator who fights against a corrupt political system—and that during this present US presidential election only Donald Trump and US Senator Bernie Sanders fit the mold of.
Critical to note about the “We Need Smith” project too, this report continues, is that it was co-founded by the legendary American pollster Patrick Caddell —who almost singlehandedly was responsible for putting President Jimmy Carter in office in 1976, but also presided over Carter’s unprecedented defeat in 1980 at the hands of the US establishments most hated candidate Ronald Reagan.
Seeking to understand how President Carter could go from victory to defeat in just 4 years, this report details, Patrick Caddell spent the past nearly 4 decades examining it—and coming to the scientific conclusion that the conventional wisdom that America is absolutely divided into warring tribes is simply not true, they are all just tired of being lied to .
In fact, this report continues, Caddell’s research proved that the American political battleground is no longer over ideology but instead is all about insurgency—and with a staggering 84% of the American public believing that the elites live by a different set of rules and laws than ordinary people do , anyone running against them is assured victory.
Interestingly to note too, this report says, is Caddell’s scientific analyses showing that the hatred of the American people towards their elites comes from both the left and right —and as evidenced by the equal explosive political movements known as Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party insurgencies .
This report grimly concludes, however, with a warning that Soviet Communist leader Joseph Stalin’s attributed statement—“ Those who cast the votes decide nothing. Those who count the votes decide everything. ”—may, indeed, be active in the present US presidential election after newly released secret documents revealed that Hillary Clinton’s main supporter, multi-billionaire George Soros, has not only been manipulating the entire American election system , but one of his companies is, also, providing vote county software to 16 States ( they’ve since denied )—and that should Donald Trump have this election stolen from him the people of that nation will most surely revolt.

4301,"Comment on The Liberal Conservative Examines The Bill Of Rights, Part VIII by Entertainment and Movie reviews with tips on how to get Website Traffic and Make Money Online.","The Liberal Conservative Examines The Bill Of Rights, Part VIII By Jonathan Lenhardt on October 28, 2013 Subscribe 
We’re in the home stretch here at The Liberal Conservative’s look at the United States Bill of Rights. Welcome to Part 8! Just joining us? Then click here to play catch up and check all things Liberal Conservative courtesy of Liberal America. Now, on with the show! 
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. 
We finally return to the hot-button issues! In this case; “Is the death penalty cruel and unusual and thus a violation of the 8th Amendment?” Let’s take a look… 
…but, let’s get those first two provisions out of the way. Excessive bail. Excessive fines. Pretty self-explanatory: you can’t be charged $1 million bail for littering and you can’t be fined $14k for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. Seems reasonable enough to me; albeit, there are some whacky things you can be fined for in this country. In the end, though, they’re really more comedic than intrusive or unconstitutional. 
On to the juicy bits! Is the death penalty unconstitutional? Well, it comes down to the one question alluded to earlier: “Is the death penalty cruel and unusual?” The ACLU certainly thinks so and there are eighteen states, plus the District of Columbia , that have outright abolished the death penalty; the most recent being Maryland just this past May. That should make it clear just how divisive this issue truly is throughout this country. 
The polls would seem to match the divide among the States. The 18-against-32 against/for ratio of the states comes in at 64% for the death penalty and 36% against. According to a Gallup poll published in January of this year 63% of Americans support the death penalty; down from 64% in 2010, but up from 61% in 2011; and that’s pretty much where the capital punishment approval rating been hanging out for the past few years after a steady decline in the decade prior. That same piece also goes on to explain that most support does, in fact, come from the Conservatives and Moderates while the majority of Liberals – just barely – oppose. Also, 67% of men stand in favor of capital punishment while 59% of women are in favor. 
So with almost two-thirds of the nation supporting the death penalty where does the opposition come from? What triggers it? 
It probably has to do with the old , archaic methods which were used to off the offenders. While three states – Delaware, New Hampshire, and Washington – still have death by hanging, and eight states – Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia – still have death by electrocution, they all use lethal injection as their primary method of execution; as do twenty-one other states – plus Connecticut, Maryland, and New Mexico whose bans on the death penalty weren’t retroactive. Now lethal injection isn’t the coziest of methods, but at least the offenders aren’t being fried like breaded chicken or hanged like deer cuts. 
Still, one could understand that the idea of taking a person’s life in response to a crime may be a little…heinous. So maybe those who support the death penalty are heinous. 
Wanna’ know who else was heinous? John Wayne Gacy killed 33 boys and buried most of them under his very own house. He was executed on May 10, 1994 via lethal injection. Wanna’ know another heinous serial killer? David Alan Gore raped and killed a 17-year-old girl on top of five other murders – all female. He was executed in April, 2012 via lethal injection. 
Many pro-death penalty folks will explain to you that they are proponents of Hammurabi’s Code . For those of you who may not know, Hammurbi’s Code is widely regarded as the first set of written laws in human history. Even if you’ve never heard it referred to as “Hammurabi’s Code” before, you’ve definitely heard of the concept; “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”. You kill, you get killed. Pretty even trade. 
So, How Does This Amendment Apply To Modern America? 
Now Hammurabi’s Code doesn’t translate 100% picture perfectly into 21st Century America; but, then again, the only absolute is that there are no other absolutes. Shades of gray run roughshod in modern law, but this is one case where black & white would seem to apply. Murder is heinous and maybe – just maybe – it deserves heinous punishment. 
Once more, the death penalty is one of those issues that is highly divisive; drawing sharp opinions from people both for and against it. Whether or not this – the 8th Amendment – can possibly fit with a pro-death penalty America depends entirely on who you’re talking to and what their opinion on it is. 
At the end of the day, though, the death penalty is legal and utilized by almost two-thirds of the States; and, even those who do abolish it don’t do so retroactively,?it leaves those who received death sentences to remain on death row awaiting their inevitable doom. Therefore, it’s hard to argue that this amendment doesn’t apply to modern America. It does. Very well, in fact; whether you love it or hate it.

4302, Professional Activists Are Behind ‘Chaos’ Plot Targeting Trump Inauguration  ,"While the protest movement plotting to disrupt   Donald Trump’s inauguration is largely attempting to portray itself as grassroots, in actuality professional   activists are leading the charge. [A main protest coalition group calls itself DisruptJ20. The organization’s website does not say much about who is behind the group. DisruptJ20 “rejects all forms of domination and oppression, particularly those based on racism, poverty, gender and sexuality, organizes by consensus, and embraces a diversity of tactics,” the site reads.  Claiming it stands for the vast majority of Americans, the group calls itself the “start of the resistance. We must take to the streets and protest, blockade, disrupt, intervene, sit in, walk out, rise up, and make more noise and good trouble than the establishment can bear. The parade must be stopped. ” DisruptJ20 is planning a slew of actions aimed, as the group relates, at “disrupting the ceremonies. ” According to the website, those actions include “spontaneous, unpermitted events,” an “unpermitted, anticapitalist march,” civil disobedience and disruption plans. Lacy MacAuley has been one of the main public faces of DisruptJ20, conducting numerous interviews with the news media as an activist with the group. Her contact details are listed on DisruptJ20’s website. From 2011 until the end of 2013, MacCauley, who turned down a Breitbart News interview request, served as a media activist at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) which has received financing from George Soros’s Open Society Institute. IPS regularly partners with the   Center for American Progress to produce joint documents and reports on progressive issues. CAP was founded by John Podesta, the former chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Podesta previously served as a counselor for President Obama’s White House and chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. IPS and CAP previously released a “Unified Security Budget,” a list of defense spending recommendations that were partially adapted by the Obama administration. MacAuley’s IPS bio evidences her ties to professional leftist groups, including the controversial, now defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) Project Vote, and United for Peace and Justice. Her IPS bio reads: Lacy came to IPS after doing communications for a variety of progressive organizations through the progressive PR firm Massey Media LLC and as a single contractor. She has done media relations work with groups such as Project Vote and ACORN, United for Peace and Justice, Jubilee USA, Mountain Justice Summer, the IMF Resistance Network, and the Solidarity Center (international affiliate of the  ). The only other contact listed on DisruptJ20’s website is for organizer Legba Carrefour. Speaking to the Boston Herald, Carrefour made clear DisruptJ20’s intention is to cause “chaos” at the inauguration. “If the headline (on Jan. 21) is ‘Donald Trump inaugurated amid complete chaos and a cluster (expletive),’ then we won,” Carrefour said. “A lot of us are people who could be considered anarchists. None of us have respect for the office or the man. ” On his Twitter account, Carrefour describes himself as a “rather glam anarchist who lives, writes, and organizes a metric f*ckton of protests in Washington, DC. ” Another   protest organizer has been identified as Scott Green, a leader with the D. C.   Coalition. Green was captured allegedly plotting inauguration hijinks in an undercover video released yesterday by Project Veritas. “I was thinking of things that would ruin their evening, ruin their outfits and otherwise make it impossible to continue with their plans. So they get nothing accomplished,” Green says in the video. Green and his group were involved in violent protests in Sacramento in June. Local Fox40 reported: “I would use the word force.   and other fascists don’t back down, they can, and they ought to be made to back down,” said Scott Green, a supporter of the   Action group, also known as Antifa. Green, who used an alias while speaking to FOX40 for safety, did not attend the protest, but he says he has been present at similar ones that ended violently. Antifa itself isn’t new, but is an offshoot of the group   Action, which started in the late ’80s in Minneapolis. Anther activist caught allegedly plotting against the inauguration in the Project Veritas video is Luke Kuhn. “If you had a pint of butyric acid, I don’t care how big the building is, it is closing,” Kuhn says in the video during a conversation about setting off a chemical concoction to cause the evacuation of one of the planned inauguration balls. One Luke Kuhn protested President Bush’s inaugural in 2001 and was quoted at the time in the Baltimore Sun as a “veteran protester. ” Kuhn told the newspaper about his plans to bypass police checkpoints at Bush’s inauguration that year. “If people pass through the checkpoints and the police take their signs, the demonstrators will be made ineffective,” he said. “What I encourage people to do   …     have 30, 000 people march to one of the checkpoints and demand to get through. ” In February 2006, Kuhn led a   at a Minuteman Project rally on Capitol Hill against the U. S. guest worker program. Activist Dylan Petrohilos was also filmed by Project Veritas allegedly participating in the DisruptJ20 planning meeting. He doubles as a digital journalist for ThinkProgress, which is a media project of the     Center for American Progress.

4303,America votes to make itself grate again,"November 7, 2016 
Today the world awaits the results of a record-breaking American vote against the worst Not President of the United States (NPOTUS) in history, instead electing by default someone it is already ashamed of. In the past twenty-four hours, the two front-runners have finally ceased in their last-ditch attempts to sway swing voters to detest them less than the other contemptible candidate. 
The UK has recently emerged from a similar vote on the basis of limited information on two outcomes where the consequences were indeterminate and the candidates literally lied for Britain. Most voters voted for the thing they least understood because the consequences of the other thing sounded dire. The politicians then found themselves in the invidious position of defending and implementing the thing they really didn’t vote for, or would not have given an ounce of integrity. 
Sympathetic British voters have been sending advice and best wishes to their American counterparts via social media. Tristram Hopgood, a civil servant from Winchester gave the least-twattish words of advice: 
“Ideally, one would avoid having a massive, bungling-man child with ridiculous yellow hair and no concept of poverty or morality anywhere near the process. If this is unavoidable, at least never allow him to act unsupervised and offer him a pretend steering-wheel on the family car and hope he is delighted with that. 
If you end up voting in a scary female super-villain who makes her shoes and cloak from the skins of puppies, it is best to dig a big hole and hide in it until the financial melt-down blows over. It should be noted that the lady in question is likely to show an unhealthy interest in all things nuclear within twenty-four hours of gaining office, so best dig that hole good and deep.” 
Media outlets world-wide have had an unexpectedly easy time of it preparing the front pages for the next day, with headlines reading: “America, what HAVE you done?”, regardless of the outcome.   Squudge   Squudge   World News 0",0

I couldn’t agree more. My thanks go out to all you manly men who’ve resisted, defied, mocked, ignored or otherwise trashed the feminists’ toxic agenda. Are you still opening doors for ladies, yielding your seats to them, or standing when they enter the room? Thank you. Are you teaching your sons to treat women with true respect rather than with the brutal “equality” that feminism dictates? Kudos to you. Do you refuse to deny the obvious differences in the sexes despite PC’s orders to the contrary? Bravo! Do you revel in your God-given physical strength, your masculine orientation, your courage, honor, initiative and other male traits? Way to go! Do you love your wife as Christ does His Church, protecting her and your home and children as God designed you to do? May He richly bless you in this difficult task! 
America desperately needs many things: repentance and spiritual revival, love of liberty, rejection of all Marxism. But among our most devastating shortages are manly men who will vanquish the cultural and political nonsense enslaving us.

4305,Clintons Are Under Multiple FBI Investigations as Agents Are Stymied,"Clintons Are Under Multiple FBI Investigations as Agents Are Stymied   Source: Wall street on parade 
Disgraced Former Congressman Anthony Weiner and His Wife, Longtime Hillary Clinton Aide, Huma Abedin 
Current and former FBI officials have launched a media counter-offensive to engage head to head with the Clinton media machine and to throw off the shackles the Loretta Lynch Justice Department has used to stymie their multiple investigations into the Clinton pay-to-play network. 
Over the past weekend, former FBI Assistant Director and current CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst Tom Fuentes told viewers that “the FBI has an intensive investigation ongoing into the Clinton Foundation.” He said he had received this information from “senior officials” at the FBI, “several of them, in and out of the Bureau.” (See video clip from CNN below.) 
That information was further supported by an in-depth article last evening in the Wall Street Journal by Devlin Barrett. According to Barrett, the “probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity.” Barrett’s article suggests that the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, has attempted to circumvent the investigation. The new revelations lead to the appearance of wrongdoing on the part of U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch for secretly meeting with Bill Clinton on her plane on the tarmac of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the evening of June 28 of this year. Not only was Bill Clinton’s wife under an FBI investigation at the time over her use of a private email server in the basement of her New York home over which Top Secret material was transmitted while she was Secretary of State but his own charitable foundation was also under investigation, a fact that was unknown at the time to the public and the media. 
The reports leaking out of the FBI over the weekend came on the heels of FBI Director James Comey sending a letter to members of Congress on Friday acknowledging that the investigation into the Hillary Clinton email server was not closed as he had previously testified to Congress, but had been reopened as a result of “pertinent” emails turning up. According to multiple media sources, those emails were found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, estranged husband of Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide, Huma Abedin. 
Weiner was forced to resign from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal with more sexting scandals to follow . Early this month, on October 3, the FBI raided Weiner’s apartment in New York with a search warrant in hand and seized multiple electronic devices. At least one of those devices had been used by both Weiner and Abedin to send email messages. The search warrant had been obtained following a detailed report that had appeared in the Daily Mail newspaper in the U.K. in September, showing sordid, sexual emails that Weiner had allegedly sent to a 15-year old girl in North Carolina. According to the content of the published emails, Weiner was aware that the girl was underage.",0
4306,Breaking: Anthony Weiner Cooperating With FBI Investigation,"Home » Headlines » World News » Breaking: Anthony Weiner Cooperating With FBI Investigation 

Fox News reported moments ago that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI investigation. Implications? The FBI no longer needs a search warrant to examine the contents of Weiner’s laptop seized in the investigation. 
As intelligence agency whisperings have been suggesting for days, We suspect there must be a SMOKING GUN on Weiner’s laptop for the FBI to be forced into reopening the investigation. 
For if FBI Director Comey REALLY wanted to conduct a complete investigation including Hillary’s thousands of bleached emails, he would simply contact the NSA and request the results of an X-Keyscore search for the results of the email address [email protected] 
The fact that this never happened (despite the fact that the FBI and DOJ assuredly knows of this capability and uses it in the investigation of suspects NOT named Hillary Clinton) indicates to us that the FBI has been forced into this action due to an imminent criminal bombshell regarding Hillary’s emails, likely from an intelligence agency insider.",0

Gross, Nebraska From the campaign trail, Trump delivered the news that he said has recently been discovered by historians hired by the Trump organization, that Bill Clinton was, in fact, Jack the Ripper! 
""We have learned of some documents that will irretrievably prove that, while he was President of the United States, Bill Clinton used a prototype of a time machine invented by a consortium of Linus Pauling, Stephen Hawking, and Brian Mays in the 1990s to go back to the 18th Century, in the Whitechapel area of London, to commit the Jack the Ripper murders. 
""In fact, when we submit the proof, I think you'll all agree that it couldn't be anyone else!"" trumpeted Trump. Make Al N.'s  ",0
4308,Will the Polar Vortex Return This Winter? - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site By Jeremiah Johnson Ready Nutrition November 3, 2016 
ReadyNutrition Guys and Gals, “Old Man Winter” is starting to rear his ugly head. Yeah, so what? So there is a difference this year on three fronts. The first has to do with the weather itself, and the second is the situation in the U.S. and the world. Throughout history winter has been (at times) so severe as to cause large numbers of deaths and great hardships. Throughout history warfare has been conducted during the winter months after the harvest has been taken in. Between you and I, the harvest is being taken in, and the whole world has been on the brink of war for quite some time. The third front: in the U.S., with the election. 
Weather, War, and Domestic Issues Could be a Recipe for Disaster 
Let’s address the weather portion first. Think Progress posted an article on the polar vortex shift that will affect our winter considerably. The polar vortex is usually “confined” to an area around the North Pole. It is a gigantic, constantly-moving system of air that is circulating and swirling. As the site mentioned, the last polar vortex shift affected more than 200 million people in 2014. I can attest to the fact that I was one of them: in January of 2014, it was -26 Fahrenheit outside of my cabin, and never rose above -10 Fahrenheit for almost the entire month. 
From the perspective of a global war, the Ukrainian-Russian situation is intensifying with the Ukrainian Army moving troops and equipment into Eastern Ukraine for operations against the separatists. As we speak, a Russian fleet is sailing toward Syria. The fighting in Syria between Assad’s forces and the Russian army and the Islamic terrorists is burning fiercely. The U.S. and Russia are facing off toward a nuclear war. North Korea continues to test missiles and threatens an EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) and/or nuclear attack on the U.S. about once a week. 
That “third front” of the domestic situation in the U.S…. believe it or not, here is the highest potential for something bad to occur. Such is because Obama will think nothing of enacting Martial Law with either the advent of civil unrest and rioting, and/or a nuclear war. The volatility and unpredictability of the situation can be the undoing of the entire country. ",0
4309,‘It Finally Clicked That This Wasn’t an Exercise’: Report Recounts San Bernardino Shooting - The New York Times,"The two masked killers burst through a door and, without saying a word, swept the conference room with semiautomatic rifle fire, spraying more than 100 rounds before they fled, just two or three minutes later. A new report chronicles in vivid detail the Dec. 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. where Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 24 others. The couple pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, committed the rampage and died hours later in a wild shootout with the police, when Mr. Farook was shot 25 times and Ms. Malik was hit 13 times. The report contains the first official account of how the killers were identified and tracked down, with a handful of officers playing crucial roles. And it reveals a wealth of specifics that had not been made public before, including the number of gunshots, and the horrors that officers and victims encountered. The scene that police officers found minutes after the massacre overwhelmed the senses: dozens of maimed or dead bodies, spattered and pooling blood, the haze and smell of gunfire, a shattered pipe pouring water from the ceiling, a wailing alarm. And wounded victims pleading for help, clutching at officers whose first priority was to find the attackers. The report was produced by the Police Foundation, a policy study group in Washington, with help from the Justice Department and local law enforcement agencies the authors interviewed more than 200 people, from police chiefs to survivors. After The New York Times obtained a draft version and reported on its contents, the Justice Department on Friday released the final document. Some details changed  —   including the number of times the killers were shot, how many shots they fired and how their vehicle was traced  —   but the overall picture was unaltered. Three men tried to stop the slaughter, rushing Mr. Farook, but he shot all three, the earlier version of the report said. It did not say whether the men survived. The anecdote was left out of the final report, but a Justice Department official confirmed that it was correct. The report shows how officers from multiple agencies handled a rapidly unfolding crisis, making decisions on the fly, often with little coordination or direction. The results were quick, sometimes heroic responses that may have saved lives but also created confusion and mistakes, though none proved fatal. Perhaps most disturbing, more than six hours passed before officers searched a bag the killers had left at the scene of the shooting. Inside were three pipe bombs. The victims were familiar with the site of the massacre, a conference room at the Inland Regional Center where about 80 employees of the San Bernardino County Department of Public Health were attending a training session. They had met there before  —   in fact, many of them had attended   training in that same room a year earlier. Mr. Farook, 28, was born in the United States to parents from Pakistan. Ms. Malik, 29, was born in Pakistan but had lived much of her life in Saudi Arabia. After they met and married in 2014 in Saudi Arabia, she moved to the United States, obtained legal residence and gave birth to a daughter. Mr. Farook, a food inspector whose colleagues never suspected him of radicalism, put the bag with the bombs in the room and left. He and his wife returned about half an hour later, shortly before 11 a. m. masked and clad in black, armed with   rifles  —   a civilian variant of the military   rifle  —   and semiautomatic pistols. Mr. Farook’s rifle had been modified in a failed attempt to make it fully automatic. The first people killed were two men sitting outside along the walkway to the conference room. One was shot while eating at a picnic table the other was found with his cellphone still in his hand. The couple then entered the conference room and opened fire, calmly emptying and reloading their rifles. A county official quoted in the draft version of the report said he thought at first that it was “the most glorified training I had ever seen,” adding, “probably on the second or third clip, it finally clicked that this wasn’t an exercise. ” Some people ran through the far door, deeper into the building. Others ducked under tables or hid in bathrooms, closets and cupboards. One woman dashed through the door the attackers had entered, but they shot her dead as she fled. A bullet ripped through a wall and wounded a woman in another room. One woman quoted in the earlier version of the report said that as she lay wounded, a female   who had been shot in the head asked her to call her mother to say goodbye. She tried to comfort the other woman, saying she was all right. “‘I’m not, I’m bleeding from the mouth,’ the colleague said before closing her eyes for good,” the report said. Within six minutes of the first 911 call, San Bernardino officers reached the center  —   not a team, just the scattered few who arrived fastest. One was riding in a car driven by a trainee when the call came, he took the wheel, sped to the scene, grabbed his shotgun and helmet, and told the trainee to hide. Thinking the attackers were still present, the first four officers entered the south side of the conference room. They followed their   training, arranging themselves like the points of a diamond. They stuck to the guideline “locate, isolate, evacuate,” meaning find and neutralize the threat before helping victims. Officers from the county Probation Department quickly arrived and set up a triage area for the wounded. “The terror in their eyes was unbelievable it was scarier than the wounds,” a probation sergeant said. The draft version of the report quoted another sergeant describing a woman with “a hole in her leg that was the size of a cereal bowl,” who said, with a blank expression, “I am going to die, please don’t let me die. ” A San Bernardino SWAT team reached the scene within 11 minutes of the first call. A second SWAT team, drawn from the police departments of surrounding cities, came shortly after. Soon there were legions of officers from several local agencies. Many of them “” heading to the scene without waiting for instructions, which produced a rapid response but also uncertainty about who was doing what. The report describes confusion and missteps similar to those that marked the police response to other mass attacks, like the Washington Navy Yard shooting in 2013 and the shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. in 2012. But the authors of the report also praised San   law enforcement agencies, noting that they had learned from previous episodes and had practiced working together. The SWAT teams went room to room through the multiple buildings of the Inland Regional Center, which houses social service agencies, but they had no protocol for marking which rooms had been searched. Officers stood outside with their guns trained on the second and third floors of one building, incorrectly suspecting that the shooters were hiding there. So many emergency vehicles were parked at random angles that ambulances could not get close to the complex, and officers carried the wounded out. Despite the confusion, emergency workers got all of the wounded to hospitals within 57 minutes of the first 911 call  —   inside the “golden hour” that experts say is a critical benchmark. All of them survived. Investigators spent almost three hours inspecting a package on the second floor that proved harmless, but officers did not notice the bag containing the pipe bombs until 5:08 p. m. After the shootout with the terrorists, some officers said that while they were still trying to record the crime scene, federal agents were already removing evidence like weapons and a cellphone. A rookie officer got a crucial piece of information while interviewing witnesses and forwarded it to his father, a police sergeant. A county health worker had noticed that Mr. Farook had left early and told the officer that “there was just something about the shooter, from his body language to his body composition, that seemed familiar. ” A search turned up several people in the region named Syed Farook, and officers were sent to all of the addresses. After the police put out word that a black S. U. V. had been seen leaving the center, several people called with tips, including one caller who had memorized a Utah license plate. A Police Department analyst found that the   vehicle belonged to a rental car company and learned by calling the company that the S. U. V. had been rented by a Syed Farook. Word went out on the radio that he lived a few minutes away, in the city of Redlands. Among those responding was a San Bernardino police narcotics team, but other officers did not know that. The narcotics officers were undercover, driving unmarked cars and not talking on their radios, in case criminals were listening. As they neared the Redlands address, the narcotics officers saw the S. U. V. and followed it. One officer flagged down a passing Redlands police sergeant and told him what was happening the sergeant put the information out over the police radio. The sergeant and a sheriff’s deputy joined the undercover officers following the couple. After the couple drove back to San Bernardino, the sergeant tried to pull them over, alerting them that they were being followed. Ms. Malik started shooting at the officers through the back window of the S. U. V. Mr. Farook then stopped the vehicle and stepped out, firing his rifle as his wife kept shooting from the back seat. Together they fired at least 81 shots and had almost 2, 400 more rounds of ammunition, but as more officers arrived, they were heavily outgunned. Most of the shots that hit Mr. Farook struck his legs, possibly because officers believed  —   erroneously  —   that the couple were wearing body armor. Two of the 13 rounds that hit Ms. Malik struck her in the head. The shootout lasted about three minutes, but in that time, 24 officers fired at least 440 rounds, riddling the S. U. V. with bullet holes. By the time it ended, more than 175 local, state and federal officers were at the scene. Remarkably, only two officers were hurt, each with a wound to the thigh. One did not realize he had been hit until 13 hours later, when he took a shower.",0
4310,Can Trump Survive the Media Onslaught?,"You are here: Home / *Articles of the Bound* / Can Trump Survive the Media Onslaught? Can Trump Survive the Media Onslaught? November 23, 2016, 12:48 pm by Cliff Kincaid Leave a Comment 0 
Accuracy in Media 
With CNN and MSNBC depicting the incoming Trump administration as the advent of a Fourth Reich, it should be obvious that the President-elect will have to go beyond his blistering tweets to cultivating sympathetic media and getting his own message out in a systematic way. But is the Trump transition team up to the job? 
President Obama was ahead of the curve in this regard, having established an office of “Progressive Media and Online Response” to cooperate with “progressive” media sources. The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign understood this form of “outreach” as well, as we saw in the WikiLeaks disclosures of how they colluded with major media outlets and reporters. Trump has used tweets, meetings with the press, official statements, and an occasional video. But much more will be needed if the President-elect hopes to survive the transition with a team in power that can get things done and communicate directly with the American people. 
In addition to Trump’s tweets, which serve a legitimate purpose, the President-elect should consider a position that is comparable to what the Obama administration had, albeit with a focus on conservative and alternative news media. Trump appears to have great confidence in Dan Scavino , who now carries the title of Director of Social Media & Senior Advisor to President-elect Trump. Scavino has a fascinating bio and has worked for Trump nearly half his life, including as the former Executive Vice President and General Manager of Trump National Golf Club, Westchester. But it’s not clear what role he is playing in the presidential transition. 
What Obama did is worth studying. Jesse Lee was named as the White House Director of Progressive Media and Online Response in 2011. He helped Obama win a second term. According to Lee’s bio , he previously worked as Online Programs Director in the White House and in the New Media department for the Presidential Transition team doing online outreach. He also had worked in online communications for the Democratic National Committee leading up to the 2008 election, served as Senior New Media Advisor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for the 110th Congress, and helped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee launch its online program from 2004 to 2006. 
His current effort , as special assistant to the president and “director of rapid response,” includes dissemination of propaganda points about the greatness of Obamacare and other Obama administration initiatives. 
While the Trump administration is being painted by the media as an extension of the White Power movement, it’s clear that the Democrats, including Obama, are going on the attack. Together, the media and the Democratic Party are functioning as the new obstructionists, determined to thwart progress and destroy the next administration’s nominees. Trump calls the media names and issues tweets, but there doesn’t seem to be much else being done in response to this coordinated assault. 
A group called UltraViolet has placed full-page ads in The Arizona Republic, The Lincoln Star Journal, and The Reno Gazette Journal attacking Republican senators Jeff Flake (AZ), Deb Fischer (NE), and Dean Heller (NV) “for failing to speak out” against Trump’s appointment of Stephen Bannon, “a white supremacist and domestic abuser,” as chief White House strategist. The first charge is apparently a reference to Bannon’s Breitbart News having covered groups which talk about protecting the European heritage and Judeo-Christian traditions of the United States and other Western nations. Some of these groups are controversial and out of the conservative mainstream. But the idea that they are in favor of white supremacy is ludicrous. The “domestic abuser” charge against Bannon was dismissed as a spurious accusation made by an angry spouse in a divorce case. 
Significantly, UltraViolet is run by Nita Chaudhary, who is married to Obama White House official Jesse Lee. She served as the Democratic National Committee’s first Director of Online during the 2004 cycle and started her career at People for the American Way. She was also the National Campaigns and Organizing Director at MoveOn.org Political Action. 
Publicly, Democrats are saying that they intend to work with the Trump administration on some issues. Consider that the University of Arizona just took out a full-page ad in Politico, advertising a statement from the “ National Institute for Civil Discourse ,” whose members include such prominent Democrats as former U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, a Professor of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. The statement signed by Reich and others says Americans should move beyond the “bitter” election and “ensure that America’s next chapter is civil and respectful…” 
Despite talk of “civil discourse,” Reich has just written a column titled, “The Trump Administration Will Be the Most Dangerous Since Richard Nixon.” And he writes this before Trump takes office! 
Rather than take a wait-and-see attitude, Reich has also written a column , “The First 100 Day Resistance Agenda,” in which he advises, “Get Democrats in the Congress and across the country to pledge to oppose Trump’s agenda. Prolong the process of approving choices, draw out hearings, stand up as sanctuary cities and states.” He also suggests, “Boycott all Trump products, real estate, hotels, resorts, everything. And then boycott all stores (like Nordstrom) that carry merchandise from Trump family brands.” 
Reich is a Democrat double-talker who puts his name on a statement promising peace and harmony, while telling the far-left to do everything possible to obstruct and destroy the next administration. 
Reich’s double-talk will not be worthy of any media scrutiny, of course. 
One way to overcome this onslaught is to continue to go on the offensive, not only against the media but also the media’s darlings, such as Hillary Clinton. When the liberal media see that Trump is apparently backing away from holding Mrs. Clinton accountable for her corruption, they know they are winning the information war and that they have the President-elect on the run. 
Meeting personally with The New York Times, as Trump did on Tuesday, will not mollify his critics. The media will see such a meeting as a sign of weakness. He needs to reach out to allies in the media who are willing to cover him and his administration in a fair and objective manner. Another way to do this is to open up the White House press briefings of his new administration to conservative bloggers and media outlets. There’s no reason to reserve front-row seats for what he once called the “crooked media.” Let them stand in the back with their hands raised. Cliff Kincaid

4311,How Turned Off Are Voters? Check Out Tommy’s Diner - The New York Times,"COLUMBUS, Ohio  —   So here we are, nearing the end of 2016’s     race to the bottom. Through it all, through his ugly caricatures of Mexicans and Muslims, through her pretzel contortions to explain her emails, through the Russian hacking and the 3 a. m. Twitter rants and the rest, this was always going to be a “hold your nose and vote” election. But at Tommy’s Diner, a colorful Columbus institution in a   neighborhood once known as The Bottoms, “hold your nose and vote” is giving way, for some people, to “hold your nose and don’t vote. ” The distaste for the presidential election is obvious almost anywhere you look here in the capital of a swing state where in July 2015 Gov. John Kasich of Ohio (remember him?) became the 16th of 17 Republicans who hoped to succeed President Obama. Aaron Burnside, 23, a   law student at Ohio State University, was at the student union that day, listening with optimism as Mr. Kasich declared that “the sun is rising” in America  —   words that now seem so quaint. Never for a minute did Mr. Burnside, who described himself as a “   fiscally conservative, socially liberal” Republican, imagine himself not casting a ballot on Election Day. But on Thursday, with early voting underway here and Mr. Trump and President Obama in town, Mr. Burnside had no idea whether he would vote for president. “It depends on how I feel that morning,” he said. He will go to the polls  —   it’s his civic duty  —   to back his party in   races Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, is fending off a challenge from Ted Strickland, a Democrat and former governor. Mrs. Clinton seems too far to the left for him, he said never a Trump fan, he found the Republican nominee’s vulgar boasts of grabbing women’s genitals “disgusting. ” So he feels stuck, as do many voters. As early voting begins in Ohio and elsewhere, many Americans are approaching the election with a sense of dread. In a CBS News poll released earlier this month, just 46 percent of likely voters said they were very enthusiastic about going to the polls, down from 62 percent in late October 2012, according to a New York   News poll. What’s uncertain this year is how many people will cast reluctant votes and how many won’t vote at all. At the diner, Tommy is a gregarious Greek immigrant and American citizen named Tom Pappas, who loves politics but keeps his business nonpartisan. The walls are covered with photos of Democrats and Republicans in equal numbers, and of Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe, Tommy’s grandchildren and Ohio State football stars. Mr. Pappas, 63, and his wife Kathy, 57, have owned the diner for 28 years. Kathy Pappas, who bakes the baklava and bread pudding, pays little heed to politics (she leaves that to Tommy) but this year finds it impossible to escape. “I turn on the radio, looking for the traffic or the weather,” she said, “and what do they talk about?” Mrs. Pappas said she has always voted. “But I don’t know if I’m going to this year,” she said. “I just don’t care for either one, and I don’t trust either one. There’s just not a good feeling either way you look, and that’s sad. ” Every day 400 to 500 people pass through Tommy’s customers run the gamut. Breakfast on Thursday brought a group of retirees,   white men in red   who had spent the morning building tables and chairs at a furniture bank for the needy two retired social studies teachers with their daughter, an acupuncturist (also an herbalist) and her boyfriend, a tattoo artist a group of bus drivers a retired firefighter, plus the usual smattering of lawyers and state workers. The acupuncturist, Keri Ondrus, 31, has given up on voting altogether she has taught English in Costa Rica, and was involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement, describing herself as a “total idealist” and ‘‘anarchist’’ who feels there must be another way to repair the world. Her parents, Charlotte and Bill Ondrus, the retired teachers, will vote for Mrs. Clinton. “You guys are not enthusiastic about Hillary,” their daughter said. “I know,” her mother replied, “but I’m scared to death of Donald Trump. ” Lunchtime brought a    team of bail bondsmen an Air Force veteran and gun rights enthusiast wearing one of Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” ball caps and a   pistol in a sleek, black Velcro case on his belt and a   young     artists, preparing for a show at Wright State University in Dayton. “Why would I waste my time?” Kyle Steed, 23, a composer with the group, said of voting, adding that he would rather spend his time helping the homeless as a volunteer. His friend Shamere Griffin, 21, another of the artists, shook her head wordlessly, seeming to fight back tears. She said she could never vote for Mr. Trump, given his characterizations of blacks, Muslims, Mexicans and women. She wants an America in which she doesn’t have to remind “my little brother, when he walks down the street, to walk with his hood down,” and has no confidence that Mrs. Clinton can deliver that. She will stay home. “Let’s just be real,” Ms. Griffin said. “What has she done for us? That’s what I want to know. What has she done for my people?” Ohio is politically engaged in 2012, when President Obama ran against Mitt Romney, 70. 5 percent of registered voters cast ballots, compared with 57. 5 percent nationwide, and one in three voted early. Some election offices reported long lines when early voting began here Wednesday David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, called Mr. Trump a “turnout machine” for Democrats. But an   Street Journal poll released Thursday  —   and conducted after the emergence of a videotape showing Mr. Trump saying he groped women  —   found the Ohio race virtually tied. “I’m very motivated,” declared Robert Tannous, a    lawyer in a dark blue suit, as he navigated his way around a waitress during the lunchtime rush. Motivated to vote for whom? “Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Tannous said. “And the sad thing is, I’m a lifelong Republican. ” George Wolf, a 73, a retired firefighter who owns a small heating and air conditioning business here, comes to Tommy’s every morning for the crispy corned beef and a dose of friendship. A longtime Republican, he says he “cannot allow Hillary Clinton to get in,” and proceeds to tick off the reasons. “When you mention Benghazi, I get really upset,” he said, referring to the 2012 attack on a United States diplomatic mission in Libya. “Four people died she doesn’t seem to care. ” Then there are her emails. And her paid speeches: “I just don’t like the fact that a politician is out to make money,” Mr. Wolf said, adding that he would vote for Mr. Trump, which he views as better than not voting at all. He does not feel good about it. “He went bankrupt as a   man, that doesn’t help me pay my bills,” said Mr. Wolf, who added that he did not like Mr. Trump’s nasty nicknames  —   “Crooked Hillary,” for example. “That’s a child talking,” Mr. Wolf said. He backed Mr. Kasich in the primary, but came around to Mr. Trump after the Ohio governor dropped out of the race. Roughly a third of all Clinton and Trump backers say the main reason for their choice is that they oppose the other candidate, a recent Pew Research Center survey found. Millennial voters, ages 18 to 29, are especially discouraged and looking for a political outsider who can inspire them  —   one reason they rallied around Mrs. Clinton’s primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Picking at his chili and   sandwich, Mr. Burnside sounded absolutely deflated. His dining partner was his mentor, Steve Fitch, 68, a Clinton supporter. They were talking about Mr. Fitch’s work as a commercial litigator Mr. Burnside was seeking guidance on how he could use a career in law to “resolve conflicts. ” The 2016 campaign seemed antithetical to the younger man’s dreams. Mr. Burnside was asked if he ever thought about that. “Oh,” he said. “All the time. ”",0
4312,Remembrance Project Members Give Their Take on Jeff Sessions-John Kelly Address - Breitbart,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly were joined by members of the Remembrance Project, a   dedicated to giving a voice to those killed by illegal aliens, at their joint border security event Friday in San Diego. [Sessions and Kelly joined Sen. Ron Johnson ( ) as they continued their joint tour of border communities to address the crisis in immigration enforcement. The two members of Trump’s cabinet met privately with delegations including family members of those murdered by illegals and Remembrance Project leaders in recent months.  Maria Espinoza,   and National Director of the Remembrance Project, was thrilled by the change in direction she heard at the press conference, telling Breitbart News: These joint press conference in indicative of the dedication and commitment America will enjoy with America’s new era  —   the Trump Era!  We had the high honor of having separate and private meetings with U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly.  We went away knowing that our country is in excellent hands, and we are encouraged to work with even more vigor to protect our families. Our 2014 meeting with [former Homeland Security Secretary] Jeh Johnson and former Attorney General Holder was a stark contrast.  And that’s a travesty.  But now, Americans are finally the priority in America! Ruth   is what the Remembrance Project calls an “angel wife,” someone whose husband was killed by an illegal alien. Her late husband, Police Officer Don Johnston, was shot and paralyzed during a 1990 bank robbery and later died from his injuries. She also attended Friday’s press conference. “The Remembrance Project is here in San Diego showing our full support,” she told Breitbart News. She too was encouraged by the change in leadership, adding: Illegal immigration is a serious issue in the State of California and many American families have lost loved ones to criminal acts committed by illegal aliens and refugees. Many families like mine have suffered in silence, but that is no longer the case with President Trump, AG Sessions and Secretary Kelly we now have a voice! The joint press conference, the second Kelly and Sessions have held this week, is part of an effort to promote their measures to bring the   southern border under control. At the first conference in El Paso, for example, Kelly reconfirmed that the border wall will be “essential. ” Sessions, for his part, began the process of withdrawing funds from   “sanctuary” jurisdictions like California. The Remembrance Project delegation, for one, is exuberant at the progress. “I am thrilled to pieces that finally, after eight long years, we finally have an administration that will enforce the law,” said Betty Robinson of Remembrance Project California.",0

4314,"In ‘Walden’ Video Game, the Challenge Is Stillness - The New York Times","It’s certainly a long way from Grand Theft Auto. Henry David Thoreau’s classic “Walden” is the inspiration for what Smithsonian Magazine is calling “the world’s most improbable video game”: Walden, a Game. Instead of offering the thrills of stealing, violence and copious cursing, the new video game, based on Thoreau’s   retreat in Massachusetts, will urge players to collect arrowheads, cast their fishing poles into a tranquil pond, buy penny candies and perhaps even jot notes in a journal  —   all while listening to music, nature sounds and excerpts from the author’s meditations. While the game is all about simplicity, it has actually been in development for nearly a decade. The lead designer, Tracy J. Fullerton, the director of the Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, came up with the idea as a way to reinforce our connection to the natural world and to challenge our hurried culture. “Games are kinds of rehearsals,” Ms. Fullerton said in an interview. “It might give you pause in your real life: Maybe instead of sitting on my cellphone, rapidly switching between screens, I should just go for a walk. ” The game  —   which Ms. Fullerton said is likely to cost $19. 99  —   takes six hours to play. It starts in the summer and ends a year later  —   offering players tasks like building a cabin, planting beans or chatting, virtually of course, with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Should you not leave sufficient time for contemplation, or work too hard, the game cautions: “Your inspiration has become low, but can be regained by reading, attending to sounds of life in the distance, enjoying solitude and interacting with visitors, animal and human. ” Failure to heed the warning will result in a dimming of color and thinning of music. “You can choose how to spend your time, what to emphasize, the ways the game can play out,” she said. “You might spend all your time in the woods, you might focus on bean farming, you could become a famous author  —   sending off articles to your editor, Horace Greeley  —   or you could become an activist, working on the Underground Railroad. ” At a time when the most popular video games include the active participation of the player  —   slay a soldier to capture enemy territory  —   the Walden game seems passive by contrast. But Ms. Fullerton said it’s no simple stroll in the park. Players who fail to forage for food, for example, will start to faint in the game. The goal is not to win in any competitive sense, but to achieve   balance. “You’re not only trying to survive, you’re seeking inspiration in the woods,” Ms. Fullerton said, “If you spend all of your time grinding away on survival tasks, the environment will become less lush. The winning is based on whether you meet your own goals. ” The project has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, though some say video game research is unworthy of federal funds. And some Thoreau experts are not enthused by an electronic simulation of Walden Pond. “Go out and see your own backyard,” said Richard Higgins, whose book, “Thoreau and the Language of Trees,” is to be published in April by the University of California Press. “Nature is all around us. ” But guardians of Thoreau’s legacy say it could introduce Walden to a whole new audience. “These are people who are interested in interactive games,” said Kathi Anderson, the executive director of the Walden Woods Project in Massachusetts. “Maybe they’re not the same as the people who would sit down and read Thoreau’s book. ” Ms. Fullerton  —   whose group also created the popular 2005 flying game Cloud  —   consulted Ms. Anderson’s organization, along with the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, to create the game. They went to considerable lengths to get the 1854 details right  —   the types of trees, the sounds of   birds. Would Thoreau approve? He was clear about dismissing new technologies, if this quote is any indication: “Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate. ” But Ms. Fullerton said the game  —   to be released this spring in time for the 200th anniversary of Thoreau’s birthday in July  —     the very questions “Walden” raises about the personal costs of progress. “Thoreau was sitting in a moment when life was beginning to speed up and he identified that, asking ‘Are our lives better because we now live on railroad time? ’” she said. “We have to ask ourselves the same question today: ‘Are our lives better because we live on internet time? ’” “Maybe we don’t all have the chance to go to the woods,” Ms. Fullerton added. “But perhaps we can go to this virtual woods and think about the pace of life when we come back to our own world. Maybe it will have an influence  —   to have considered the pace of Walden. ”",0
4315,Gallup: Assault Weapons Ban Support at Lowest Level Ever Recorded,"Email 
Poll results released on Wednesday by Gallup confirm the trend toward the acceptance of the freedom to own guns and support of the Second Amendment. Sixteen years ago 59 percent of those polled favored “a law which would make it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles,” while just 39 percent were opposed. Today those numbers have flipped: Just 36 percent support a ban, while 61 percent of those polled oppose it. 
Even those polled who don’t have a gun in their home oppose such a ban. Most surprisingly, however, is that support for such a ban has dropped even among those most likely to support one: Democrats. In the year 2000, 63 percent of Democrats supported such a ban, while today just 50 percent do. Wrote Art Swift for Gallup: “It is striking — and unusual — that fewer Democrats than ever support an assault weapons ban, since the Democratic Party has been instrumental in pushing for stricter gun laws.” 
Perhaps comforting to those watching how Independents might vote in the upcoming presidential election, Gallup reported that just 31 percent of them support such a ban (the same as Democrats), while in 2000, 63 percent did. 
Swift called the results a “paradox”: Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. 
Gallup could help its cause by defining more carefully the distinct difference between “assault rifles” and “assault weapons.” Assault rifles have been heavily regulated for decades, being defined as rifles used by the military that are “select” fire: able to fire multiple rounds with a single press of the finger on the trigger. “Assault weapons” were never defined until the Brady Bill was passed into law in 1994. Then they were defined as rifles that were “semi-automatic,” firing but a single round with a single press of the trigger. The bill also declared such a weapon as banned if it had any two of five cosmetic features that had nothing to do with its lethality: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher (which is useless without grenades). 
Commentators jumped on the Gallup report with all manner of explanations as to the cause of the continuing drop in support for a ban or, conversely, citizens’ increasing support for gun ownership. Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist , declared, “Americans understand that terrorists want to murder us, and that our laws are no obstacle to their blood lust. They will use planes, or bombs, or trucks, or knives, or box cutters, or guns.… Strict gun control laws in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. have done nothing to prevent sky-high murder rates in those cities year after year.” 
It’s possible that the message offered for years by Pastor Chuck Baldwin, a presidential candidate for the Constitution Party in 2008, is gaining purchase as well. In a recent newsletter Baldwin pulled no punches: To take away the citizen’s right to bear a semi-automatic rifle is to, in effect, completely disarm him…. The only reason that would-be tyrants in the US government have been kept at bay is because of an American citizenry fully armed with semi-automatic rifles. 
That they are “fully armed” may be an understatement. The usual estimate of the number of firearms owned by American citizens has routinely been reported at 300 million, plus or minus. But that doesn’t square with the fact of increasing numbers of citizens purchasing firearms, setting records month-after-month for the last year and a half. WeaponsMan blog, written by a former Special Forces soldier and a stickler for details, investigated the publicly available data from government sources, including the ATF itself, and found the number to be vastly larger: upwards of 660 million. His analysis is available here . 
He concludes “that the US inventory of firearms is almost certainly between 412 and 660 million, not the lower numbers recently trumpeted by the media.” 
The irony remains that, thanks to the media’s propaganda blitz against the private ownership of firearms, awareness of what the true agenda is continues to grow. The harder gun-grabbers push, the harder it will be for them to accomplish their ultimate goal: complete confiscation of every firearm from every private citizen in the country. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson saw the threat, and gave perhaps the most reasonable explanation for today’s increasing support of the right of the people to buy, bear, keep and use firearms: The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.

4317,Fracking linked to cancer-causing chemicals & increased risk of childhood leukemia,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 23:19 UTC An expansive new analysis by Yale School of Public Health researchers confirms that numerous carcinogens involved in the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing have the potential to contaminate air and water in nearby communities. Fracking is now common in the United States, currently occurring in 30 states, and with millions of people living within one mile of a fracking site . The study suggests that the presence of carcinogens involved in or released by hydraulic fracturing operations has the potential to increase the risk of childhood leukemia. The presence of chemicals alone does not confirm exposure or risk of exposure to carcinogens and future studies are needed to evaluate cancer risk. ""Because children are a particularly vulnerable population, research efforts should first be directed toward investigating whether exposure to hydraulic fracturing is associated with an increased risk,"" said lead author Nicole Deziel, Ph.D., assistant professor. Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the severity and short latency period of the disease. The study is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment . The team examined an extensive list of more than 1,000 chemicals that may be released into air or water as a result of fracking. ""Previous studies have examined the carcinogenicity of more selective lists of chemicals,"" said Deziel. ""To our knowledge, our analysis represents the most expansive review of carcinogenicity of hydraulic fracturing-related chemicals in the published literature."" According to the findings, the majority of chemicals (>80 percent) lacked sufficient data on cancer-causing potential, highlighting an important knowledge gap. Of the 119 compounds with sufficient data, 44 percent of the water pollutants and 60 percent of air pollutants were either confirmed or possible carcinogens. Because some chemicals could be released to both air and water, t he study revealed a total of 55 unique compounds with carcinogenic potential . Furthermore, 20 chemicals had evidence of increased risk for leukemia or lymphoma specifically. This analysis creates a priority list of carcinogens to target for future exposure and health studies. Fracking, also known as unconventional oil and gas development, has increased dramatically in recent years, and the practice is expected to grow in the future. The process involves drilling deep, as far as two miles, into the earth and releasing a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals that fracture the rock and release the gas or oil trapped inside. While fracking increases the production of domestic oil and natural gas and decreases prices, it is controversial because of the significant amounts of water that must be used as well as transported to fracking sites, as well as the release of carcinogens. The team has begun been testing air and water samples for some of these known and suspected carcinogens in a community with particularly intense exposure to fracking to evaluate whether people there are exposed to these compounds, and if so, at what concentrations.",0
4318,John Podesta: Press Did Not Play Up Russia Conspiracies Enough During Election - Breitbart,"John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s former presidential campaign chairman, has claimed there was a “failing” by mainstream media to protect American democracy during the 2016 presidential election. [“The fact that there was substantiation that the Russians had hacked my emails, the DNC emails, that Wikileaks was an instrument of an attempt by Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation to undermine our democracy, that could have been reflected in the press and I don’t believe it was,” Podesta said in an interview with the BBC’s Evan Davis.  “And I think that was actually a failing on behalf of the mainstream media and particularly some of the major news outlets in our country like The New York Times,” he continued.  However, there is little evidence to support Podesta’s claims, given that mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, CNN, and The Washington Post all gave extensive coverage to potential Russian interference in the election and did not fully report the range of explosive revelations that emerged from the Wikileaks releases. “The [mainstream media] decided it was more interesting, maybe more titillating, to get into the kinda campaign gossip which was what those emails were,” Podesta continued. Podesta’s claims are also undermined by the vigorous support Clinton received from nearly all the mainstream media, earning endorsements from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, New York Daily News, The Los Angeles Times, and nearly all metro and regional newspapers across the country. Furthermore, emails revealed by Wikileaks actually showed extensive collusion between mainstream media journalists and Clinton’s campaign, principally via Podesta, without revealing this to their audience. Prominent examples of that collusion include CNBC’s Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood regularly emailing Podesta to congratulate him on primary wins, former POLITICO reporter Glenn Thrush asking Podesta to approve a story he wrote pertaining to Clinton’s campaign, while The New York Times’ political correspondent Maggie Haberman was described by the campaign as a “friendly journalist” who “teed up” stories and “never disappointed” the Clinton campaign. A study in the run up to the November election also found that 96 percent of campaign donations from persons in the media went toward Hillary Clinton. Discussing the future of the Democratic Party, Podesta added that he was now “fully into the resistance” against Donald Trump and the new administration.

4319,DHS to Unveil VOICE Office for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime - Breitbart,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that Secretary John Kelly will formally unveil the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office at the ICE headquarters on Wednesday. [“There’s no intent to make a pun, but it really is to give a voice to the victims of crimes that have been committed by those who are in the country illegally,” said DHS spokesman David Lapan to reporters in Washington, D. C. in response to a skeptical question about why the government wants to launch a program helping Americans suffering from illegal alien crime. “There are a lot of offices and entities that do similar things for crime victims writ large, but nobody has the level of understanding of immigration that ICE does. And so it’s a way to keep victims and their families informed, and not just about the criminal justice aspects of their particular case, but the immigration aspects. ”  “That’s something that isn’t covered by other groups and offices who maintain contact with victims of crimes  …     So it’s a way to ensure that families and victims who have been affected by, again, those here illegally can understand where things are in the immigration process as well as in the criminal justice process,” he said. One month after President Donald Trump assumed office, Kelly instructed ICE to create a program to provide families devastated by illegal alien crime and share more information about the foreign perpetrators who committed the alleged crimes. “Criminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents. Often, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender’s immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender,” Kelly said in a memo. Rallying to the sides of American families and legal immigrants was a critical part of Trump’s successful presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly brought families who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens on stage at campaign rallies, and was the only candidate to respond to an open letter pleading for a campaign to acknowledge and deliver justice to victimized and suffering American families. The immediacy of his campaign’s reply and the spotlight he shone on their plight was praised by an advocacy group that had fought for attention to the pressing issue for years. “Donald Trump is the only candidate whose office has responded to their open letter and that the candidate will support a national program to assist families of victims of illegal aliens. Their response was immediate and they have stated they will support our efforts in assisting our families,” said Maria Espinoza, head of the Remembrance Project. Her organization plans to open an office in Washington, D. C. to support the program. A December report estimated that some 820, 000 illegals evaded deportation under the Obama administration —  including roughly 620, 000 convicted of terrible crimes such as murder and rape.

4320,Watch: These Are The 5 States Hillary Must STEAL From Trump: “If She’s Successful It Will All But Block Trump From Presidency”,"Email 
The fix is in. 
If the latest flurry of emails from the Clinton Camp prove anything, it’s that Hillary Clinton ’s organization has been actively manipulating and rigging the Presidential election from the get-go. We know for a fact that she colluded with Democratic National Committee to marginalize Bernie Sanders . We know her mainstream media cohorts gave her debate questions ahead of time. We know that she actively hired and organized actions in Chicago and elsewhere to make it look like Donald Trump supporters were violent. And we know from recently released John Podesta emails that they have been tampering with polls through over sampling. We also know that dead democrats all over the country are voting in the Presidential election. 
Thus, it stands to reason that if there’s any way to rig actual election outcomes either through hacking electronic voting systems or other ballot machinations, the Clinton campaign will do everything in their power to take advantage of it. 
In the video below The Daily Sheeple’s Weekly Word explains that there are five key states that are actively being target for election fraud:

4322,Kushner Omitted Meeting With Russians on Security Clearance Forms - The New York Times,"When Jared Kushner, President Trump’s    and senior adviser, sought the   security clearance that would give him access to some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years. But Mr. Kushner did not mention dozens of contacts with foreign leaders or officials in recent months. They include a December meeting with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, and one with the head of a Russian   bank, Vnesheconombank, arranged at Mr. Kislyak’s behest. The omissions, which Mr. Kushner’s lawyer called an error, are particularly sensitive given the congressional and F. B. I. investigations into contacts between Russian officials and Trump associates. The Senate Intelligence Committee informed the White House weeks ago that, as part of its inquiry, it planned to question Mr. Kushner about the meetings he arranged with Mr. Kislyak, including the one with Sergey N. Gorkov, a graduate of Russia’s spy school who now heads Vnesheconombank. Mr. Kushner’s omissions were described by people with direct knowledge of them who asked for anonymity because the questionnaire is not a public document. While officials can lose access to intelligence, or worse, for failing to disclose foreign contacts, the forms are often amended to address lapses. Jamie Gorelick, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, said that the questionnaire was submitted prematurely on Jan. 18, and that the next day, Mr. Kushner’s office told the F. B. I. that he would provide supplemental information. Mr. Kushner’s aides said he was compiling that material and would share it when the F. B. I. interviewed him. For now, they said, he has an interim security clearance. In a statement, Ms. Gorelick said that after learning of the error, Mr. Kushner told the F. B. I.: “During the presidential campaign and transition period, I served as a    for foreign officials trying to reach the  . I had numerous contacts with foreign officials in this capacity.   …     I would be happy to provide additional information about these contacts. ” No names were disclosed in that correspondence. Applicants for major national security positions must submit a lengthy F. B. I. questionnaire as part of a background check. They are asked to list the dates and details of all contacts with representatives of foreign governments. This is not just bureaucratic paperwork. The form warns that “withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying information” could result in loss of access to classified information, denial of eligibility for a sensitive job and even prosecution knowingly falsifying or concealing material facts is a federal felony that may result in fines or up to five years imprisonment. Clearance holders are often allowed to amend disclosure forms and avoid punishment if omissions are deemed oversights rather than deliberate falsifications, and prosecutions are rare. Mr. Kushner is the second top White House official to have problems concerning his dealings with foreign officials. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, had his security clearance suspended and was fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the content of phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the transition. Last month, the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, confirmed to Congress that his agency was investigating Russia’s interference in the election and the possibility of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Vnesheconombank is a target of American sanctions imposed in response to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and aggression in Ukraine. It is controlled by members of President Vladimir V. Putin’s government, including Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, and has been used to bail out oligarchs favored by Mr. Putin and to fund pet projects like the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Mr. Kushner has said he did not discuss sanctions with Mr. Gorkov, the Russian banker. Mr. Gorkov declined to comment on the subject of whether sanctions were discussed.",0
4323,Three Ways to Recharge Your Energy Using Crystals,"by Tanaaz 
Crystals are a great tool for healing, awakening and raising your vibration. When I first started out on my spiritual journey it took me a while to truly appreciate the power of a crystal. 
When you find a crystal that really resonates with you and that you feel really attracted to, you know you have found the right one. 
For years, I chose crystals based on the written metaphysical properties and for some reason they always felt “off” to me. When I started choosing crystals based on feeling alone, that is when I truly noticed their amazing abilities. 
Crystals contain a powerful energy for helping you to recharge your own vibration and connection to Spirit. 
Here are 3 ways to use your crystals to recharge: Mind, Body, Spirit Recharge 
Perfect for an all-over recharge for your energy, best done just before bed. 
1.) Choose 3 crystals that resonate with you- one for your mind, one for your body and one for your spirit. Make sure your crystals are cleansed. 
2.) Hold the physical body crystal in your hand and set your intention into the stone. Whisper what outcome or feeling you would like to create in your physical body. Hold the stone close to you as you repeat and feel your intention. Repeat this process for the mind and spirit crystals as well. 
3.) After setting your intention into your crystals, sleep with them under your pillow or by your bedside. 
4.) Keep your crystals close to you whenever you need an energy recharge. Positive Energy Recharge 
Perfect for recharging your energy after being around a negative person or situation. 
1.) Choose 2 powerful, cleansed crystals that resonate with you and place them in each hand. Gently close your hand around the crystals and breathe. 
2.) As your breathe feel the energy of the crystal moving up through your arms and travelling around your entire body. Feel the beautiful, vibes of the crystal cleansing and clearing your aura and energy. 
3.) Keep breathing through the cleansing until the energy of the crystal has travelled to every part of your body. 
4.) Cleanse your crystals if needed after you are done. Self- Empowerment Chakra Recharge 
Perfect for when you are lacking confidence in yourself. 
1.) Choose one crystal that resonates with you and place it out to be charged in the sunlight for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can choose 7 crystals – one for each chakra. 
2.) Once the crystal has been charged, start rubbing it between your hands to generate heat and more energy. 
3.) When you feel the heat or charge of the crystal, place your hands over your root chakra or pelvis area (touch your skin not your clothes). Allow the energy to sink in to this area of your body. 
4.) When you feel the energy has gone in, rub the crystal again and place it on your next chakra. Keep repeating this process until you have done all 7 chakras. 
Happy recharging!",0
4324,China Warns of Arms Race After U.S. Deploys Missile Defense in South Korea - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   The United States said on Tuesday that it had begun deploying an advanced and contentious missile defense system in South Korea, prompting China to warn of a new atomic arms race in a region increasingly on edge over North Korea’s drive to build a nuclear arsenal. The American announcement came a day after the simultaneous launch of four missiles by North Korea into waters off the Japanese coast, which Pyongyang said was a drill for striking American bases in Japan. The feat, footage of which was broadcast on state television, raised concern about the North’s ability to overwhelm the new defense system being deployed. Hours later, North Korea further unnerved the region by declaring it was blocking all Malaysians from leaving its soil, sharply escalating a dispute over last month’s assassination of Kim   the half brother of North Korea’s dictator, Kim  . Malaysia has accused several North Korean citizens of using VX nerve agent to kill Mr. Kim in a case that has reminded the world of Pyongyang’s access to a stockpile of banned chemical weapons on top of its nuclear program  —   and its willingness to take extreme measures. The flurry of developments heightened anxiety in Asia over signs that Pyongyang is closing in on its goal of developing an intercontinental missile that can deliver a nuclear payload to the United States  —   and what the new Trump administration might do to prevent it. And they came as the United States and South Korea participated in   military exercises that North Korea has condemned. The New York Times reported Sunday that President Trump’s national security deputies have discussed both the possibility of   strikes that would almost certainly provoke an attack on South Korea and a reintroduction of nuclear weapons to the South. Intelligence officials say North Korea is already able to hit much of South Korea and Japan with a   missile. A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, denounced the United States’ decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, and vowed that Beijing would “take the necessary steps to safeguard our own security interests. ” “The consequences will be shouldered by the United States and South Korea,” Mr. Geng added, warning that the two countries should not “go further and further down the wrong road. ” For days, the official Chinese news media has warned that deployment of Thaad could lead to a “de facto” break in relations with South Korea and urged consumers to boycott South Korean products. The Chinese authorities recently forced the closing of 23 stores owned by Lotte, a South Korean conglomerate that agreed to turn over land that it owned for use in the Thaad deployment, and hundreds of Chinese protested at Lotte stores over the weekend, some holding banners that read, “Get out of China. ” Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, warned that Thaad “will bring an arms race in the region,” likening the defensive system to a shield that would prompt the development of new spears. “More missile shields of one side inevitably bring more nuclear missiles of the opposing side that can break through the missile shield,” it said. But in another article, the news agency rebuked North Korea, saying it must “face the reality that it can neither thwart Washington and Seoul nor consolidate its security in a breeze with its immature nuclear technology. ” The United States’ decision to deploy the missile technology brought new scrutiny to China’s policies toward North and South Korea and suggested that its attempts to please both countries in hopes of averting a crisis had fallen short. “To put it bluntly using a common Chinese expression, it has wanted to have a foot in two boats,” said Deng Yuwen, a current affairs commentator in Beijing who has sharply criticized North Korea. Yang Xiyu, a former senior Chinese official who once oversaw talks with North Korea, said China was worried that the deployment of the system would open the door to a broader American network of antimissile systems in the region, possibly in places like Japan and the Philippines, to counter China’s growing military as much as North Korea. “China can see benefits only for a U. S. regional plan, not for South Korea’s national security interest,” he said. The developments come as South Korea is consumed by turmoil over the impeachment of President Park   whose administration agreed to the Thaad deployment. But with the president facing possible removal from office over a corruption scandal, the fate of the system has been in doubt. Its accelerated deployment could make it harder, if not impossible, for her successor to head off its installation. Moon   an opposition leader who is the   in the race to replace President Park, acknowledged that it would be difficult to overturn South Korea’s agreement to deploy the system. But he has insisted that the next South Korean government should have the final say on the matter, saying that Ms. Park’s government never allowed a full debate on it. Under its deal with Washington, South Korea is providing the land for the missile system and will build the base, but the United States will pay for the system, to be built by Lockheed Martin, as well as its operational costs. A   cargo plane landed at the United States military’s Osan Air Base, about 40 miles south of Seoul, on Monday evening, carrying two trucks, each mounted with a Thaad launchpad. More equipment and personnel will start arriving in the coming weeks, South Korean military officials said. The South Korean Defense Ministry declined to specify when the system would be operational. But the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the deployment was likely to be completed in one or two months, with the system ready for use by April. Paul Haenle, director of the   Center at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that policy makers in China had failed to grasp how Washington and its allies regarded North Korea’s nuclear program as getting closer to a dangerous threshold of being able to place a warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit American cities. “That’s a ” said Mr. Haenle, who was director for China on the National Security Council under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. China has long opposed American missile defenses, in part because of fears that they might embolden American   to consider a first strike to destroy China’s relatively small nuclear arsenal. Chinese strategists warn that the United States might consider such an attack if it was confident a defense system could intercept Chinese weapons that escaped destruction. China is believed to have already embarked on a program to modernize its arsenal and develop new weapons designed to avoid missile defenses, and analysts said the deployment of Thaad could prompt it to accelerate those efforts. Takashi Kawakami, a professor of international politics and security at Takushoku University in Tokyo, said the deployment of Thaad could put the United States in a stronger position to consider a   strike on North Korea. If the United States took such action, he said, “North Korea is going to make a counterattack on the U. S. or Japan or another place, so in this case they will use Thaad” to defend against the North’s missiles. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he spoke for 25 minutes on Tuesday with Mr. Trump, who reiterated his pledge to stand by Japan “100 percent,” according to the public broadcaster NHK. “I appreciate that the United States is showing that all the options are on the table,” Mr. Abe said, adding that Japan was “ready to fulfill larger roles and responsibilities” to deter North Korea.",0
4325,Iranian Director Asghar Farhadi Won’t Attend Oscar Ceremony - The New York Times,"TEHRAN  —   The Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film “The Salesman” is nominated for an Academy Award for best   movie, said on Sunday that he would not attend the Oscars ceremony next month even if he were granted an exception to President Trump’s visa ban for citizens from Iran and several other predominantly Muslim countries. Mr. Farhadi said he had planned to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony in Los Angeles and while there bring attention to a decision he called “unjust. ” But the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday presented “ifs and buts which are in no way acceptable to me even if exceptions were to be made for my trip,” he said in a statement to The New York Times. The executive order blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended entry of all refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely.

4327,Israel’s Defense Minister to ‘Palestinian’ Paper: Hamas’ Next Attack on Israel will be its Last,"Israel’s Defense Minister to ‘Palestinian’ Paper: Hamas’ Next Attack on Israel will be its Last Oct 29, 2016 Previous post In an effort to communicate directly with the Palestinian people, Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman warned, in a rare interview with the Al Quds daily, that Hamas would be destroyed if it dares attack Israel again. 
Israel’s defense chief threatened the Hamas terror organization which rules the Gaza Strip, and dismissed the Palestinian Authority (PA) head as an incapable leader in a rare interview published Monday in the Al Quds daily, a popular Palestinian newspaper. 
The positions of Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman are well known, but it is unusual for the Palestinian media to interview him. 
He started his interview saying, “it’s important for me to talk directly to Palestinian people … I tried to do that since I took office … because I believe there is misunderstanding.” 
Liberman said PA head Mahmoud Abbas is not capable of signing a peace deal with Israel. “This agreement needs someone else, someone capable of taking a tough decision,” he said. 
Liberman expressed support for a two-state solution, restating his proposed plan that it should be based on an exchange of territories, and saying that Israel does not need some areas, such as the Arab town of Umm el-Fahm in the north. 
He warned Hamas against testing Israel with violence. 
“If they (Hamas) impose a war on Israel, this war will be the final war for them; we are going to destroy them completely,” Liberman was quoted as saying in the full-page interview. 
However, he said that Israel has no interest in reconquering and occupying the Gaza Strip and emphasized that Israel does not want another war with Hamas. 
Hamas official Fathi Hammad said his group is “in no way afraid and this is a powerful message from Gaza to Liberman.” 
In the interview, Liberman also said that Israel is ready to invest in an airport, sea port and industrial park in Gaza — if Hamas ceases its violent actions against Israel and “ stops building tunnels and launching rockets .” 
“Gaza could be the Singapore or Hong Kong of the Middle East,” he said.

4328,"The Oil-Gas War Over Syria, in Maps","The Oil-Gas War Over Syria, in Maps Eric Zuesse Turkey’s Anadolu News Agency, though government-run, is providing remarkably clear and reliable diagrammatic descriptions of the current status of the U.S-and-fundamentalist-Sunni, versus Russia-and-Shia-and-NON-fundamentalist-Sunni, sides, in the current oil-and-gas war in the Middle East, for control over territory in Syria, for construction of oil-and-gas pipelines through Syria supplying fuel into the world’s largest energy-market: Europe. Russia is now the dominant supplier of both oil and gas, but its ally Iran is a Shiite gas-powerhouse that wants to share the market there, and Russia has no objection. Qatar is a Sunni gas-powerhouse and wants to become the main supplier of gas there, and Saudi Arabia is a Sunni oil-powerhouse, which wants to become the major supplier of oil, but Saudi oil and Qatari gas would be pipelined through secular-controlled (Assad’s) Syria, and this is why the U.S. and its fundamentalist-Sunni allies, the Sauds, and Qataris, are using Al Qaeda and other jihadists to conquer enough of a strip through Syria so that U.S. companies such as Halliburton will be able safely to place pipelines there, to be marketed in Europe by U.S. firms such as Exxon. Iran also wants to pipeline its gas through Syria, and this is one reason why Iran is defending Syria’s government, against the U.S.-Saudi-Qatari-jihadist invasion, which is trying to overthrow and replace Assad. Here are the most-informative of Anadolu’s war-maps: The first presents the effort by many countries to eliminate ISIS control over the large Iraqi city of Mosul. A remarkably frank remark made in this map is “An escape corridor into Syria will be left for Daesh [ISIS] so they can vacate Mosul”— an admission that the U.S.-Saudi-Qatari team want the ISIS jihadists who are in Mosul to relocate into Syria to assist the U.S.-Saudi-Qatari effort there to overthrow and replace the Assad government: The second is about the Egyptian government’s trying to assist the Syrian government’s defense against the Saudi-U.S.-Qatari invasion of Syria, at Aleppo, where Syria’s Al Qaeda branch is trying to retain its current control over part of that large city. The Saud family are punishing the Egyptian government for that: Here is Russia’s proposed gas-pipeline, which would enable Russia to reduce its dependence upon Ukraine (through which Russia currently pipelines its gas into Europe). Obama conquered and took over Ukraine in February 2014 via his coup that overthrew the democratically elected neutralist Ukrainian President there : In addition, there is the following map from oil-price.com : That map shows the competing Shia (Russia-backed) and Sunni (U.S.-backed) gas-pipelines into Europe — the central issue in the invasion and defense of Syria. On 21 September 2016, Gareth Porter headlined “The War Against the Assad Regime Is Not a ‘Pipeline War’,” and he pointed out some errors in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s account that had been published under the headline “Syria: Another Pipeline War” . Porter argued: “It’s easy to understand why that explanation would be accepted by many anti-war activists: it is in line with the widely accepted theory that all the US wars in the Middle East have been ‘oil wars’ — about getting control of the petroleum resources of the region and denying them to America’s enemies. But the ‘pipeline war’ theory is based on false history and it represents a distraction from the real problem of US policy in the Middle East — the US war state’s determination to hold onto its military posture in the region.” Porter ignored the key question there, as to why “the US war state” has a “determination to hold onto its military posture in the region.” Opening and protecting potential oil-gas-pipeline routes are important reasons why. Clearly, Kennedy’s documentation that the CIA was trying as early as 1949 to overthrow Syria’s secular government so as to allow to the Sauds a means of cheaply transporting their oil through Syria into Europe, remains unaffected by any of the objections that Porter raised to Kennedy’s article. The recent portion of Kennedy’s timeline is affected, but not his basic argument. Furthermore, any military strategist knows that “the US war state” is intimately connected to the U.S. oil-and-gas industries, including pipelines (“oilfield services”) as well as marketing (Exxon etc.). And Porter got entirely wrong what that connection (which he ignored) actually consists of: it consists of U.S. government taxpayer-funded killers for those U.S. international corporations. Here is how Barack Obama put it , when addressing graduating cadets at West Point, America’s premier military-training institution: Russia’s aggression toward former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe, while China’s economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors. From Brazil to India, rising middle classes compete with us, and governments seek a greater say in global forums. And even as developing nations embrace democracy and market economies, 24-hour news and social media makes it impossible to ignore the continuation of sectarian conflicts and failing states and popular uprisings that might have received only passing notice a generation ago. It will be your generation’s task to respond to this new world. The question we face, the question each of you will face, is not whether America will lead, but how we will lead — not just to secure our peace and prosperity, but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe. He was saying there that America’s military is in service to U.S.-based international corporations in their competition against those of Russia, Brazil, China, India, and anywhere else in which “rising middle classes compete with us.” Those places are what Gareth Porter referred to as “America’s enemies.” Economic competitors are “enemies.” Obama thinks that way, and even a progressive journalist such as Porter doesn’t place into a skeptical single-quotation-mark-surround, the phrase ‘America’s enemies’ when that phrase is used in this equational context. On both the right (Obama) and the left (Porter), the equation of a government and of the international corporations that headquarter in its nation — the treatment of the military as being an enforcement-arm for the nation’s international corporations — is simply taken for granted, not questioned, not challenged. RFK Jr. was correct, notwithstanding some recent timeline-errors. Syria is “Another Pipeline War,” and Obama is merely intensifying it. (On 9 November 2015, I offered a different account than RFK Jr. provided of the recent history — the Obama portion — of the longstanding U.S. aggression against Syria; and it links back to Jonathan Marshall’s excellent articles on that, and to other well-sourced articles, in addition to primary sources, none of which contradict RFK Jr.’s basic view, “Syria: Another Pipeline War.”). Another portion of Porter’s commentary is, however, quite accurate: America’s ‘Defense’ (or mass-killing-abroad) industries (such as Lockheed Martin) are not merely servants of the U.S. government, but are also served by the U.S. government: “the US war state’s determination to hold onto its military posture in the region” is protection of the major market — the Middle Eastern market — for U.S. ‘Defense’ products and services. It’s not only America’s firms in the oil, gas, and pipelines, industries, which benefit from America’s military; it is also America’s firms in the mass-killing industries, that do. To the extent that the public (here including Barack Obama and Gareth Porter) do not condemn the presumption that “the business of America is business,” or that a valid function of U.S.-taxpayer-funded military and other foreign-affairs operations is to serve the stockholders of U.S. international corporations, the hell (such as in Syria) will continue. Gareth Porter got lost among the trees because he failed to see (and to point to) that forest.",0

Asked what the purpose of his visit was, McFaul said it was to help presidential candidate Hillary Clinton prepare for what he assumed would be her transition to the White House.Now McFaul, currently a Stanford University professor, is banned from Russia and Kremlin sources say he is the first of many Clinton allies to be banned.Mr McFaul said: “I have hundreds of friends in Russia. I’m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder. “I was told that I am on the Kremlin’s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.” The Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.He was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his “active participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.”President Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.Russia is hoping for a “new understanding” and “restored Russian-American relations” according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be “encouraged” by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists’ destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand. “The American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough.

4330,Мечтатели из Пентагона: как армия США впустую потратила $58 млрд на оружие будущего,"Короткая ссылка 27 октября 2016, 00:10 Заместитель министра обороны США Фрэнк Кендалл опубликовал отчёт, согласно которому Пентагон c начала 90-х годов потратил около $58 млрд на оборонные проекты, которые так и не были реализованы. RT рассказывает о самых необычных образцах вооружения, которые так и не увидели свет несмотря на многомиллиардное финансирование. Крейсер CG(X) © DOD Крейсер CG(X) 
Разработка высокотехнологичного эскадренного миноносца CG(X) (на изображении выше) по программе ВМС США началась ещё в начале 90-х годов. В результате пересмотра финансирования проекта, от него были отделены программы по созданию эсминцев DD(X) и Zumwalt. В 2010 году проект CG(X) был закрыт из-за того, что совпадал по своим задачам с уже существующими кораблями класса Arleigh Burke. Всего на программу было потрачено более $200 млн. Выросший из этой программы головной эсминец проекта DDG-1000 Zumwalt в единственном экземпляре вошел в состав ВМС США в мае этого года. О этой высокотехнологичной новинке RT уже рассказывал своим читателям. XM2001 Crusader Самоходная гаубица XM2001 Crusader © DOD 
Самоходная гаубица Crusader также разрабатывалась с начала 90-х. Предполагалось, что она станет более лёгкой заменой уже существующей M109A6 Paladin. К моменту завершения проекта комитет начальников штабов США посчитал орудие, разрабатывавшееся для армии времён холодной войны, не отвечающим новым концепциям ведения боевых действий. Программа, на которую было выделено $2 млрд, была закрыта в 2002 году Дональдом Рамсфельдом, министром обороны при Джордже Буше-младшем. Плавающий бронетранспортёр EFV Бронетранспортёр EFV © DOD 
Новый плавающий бронетранспортёр с тяжёлым вооружением под названием «Экспедиционная боевая машина» (Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle — EFV) для корпуса Морской пехоты США начали разрабатывать ещё в конце 1980-х годов. После многочисленных срывов срока завершения и превышения стоимости на 270%, разработка EFV была прекращена в 2011 году. Всего на бронетранспортёр потратили $3,3 млрд.

На разработку разведывательных вертолётов поддержки RAH66 Comanche ушло 22 года и $6,9 млрд. «Команчи» должны были заменить вертолёты классов Huey, Kiowa и Cobra, состоящие на вооружении армии США. Однако с развитием технологий беспилотных летательных аппаратов, концепция RAH66 успела устареть, прежде чем была готова к производству. Вдобавок, полностью снаряжённые прототипы в ходе испытаний зачастую просто не могли оторваться от земли. Проект был закрыт в 2004 году. Boeing YAL-1 Самолёт Boeing YAL-1 с лазерной установкой © DOD 
В 1996 году ВВС США приступили к реализации программы экспериментального самолёта, оборудованного лазерной установкой для поражения в воздухе баллистических ракет противника. Спустя 15 лет работ в воздух поднялся лишь один прототип, созданный на основе старого Boeing 747 компании Air India, обозначенный как Boeing YAL-1. В 2011 проект был закрыт из-за «дороговизны и технических требований», а также «больших сомнений в его практической пользе». Всего на разработку самолёта с лазерным вооружением было потрачено $5 млрд. «Боевая система будущего»— FCS © DOD 
Предложенная в 1999 году начальником штаба армии США Эриком Шинсеки, «Боевая система будущего» (Future Combat System — FCS) должна была объединить в себе целое семейство управляемых и беспилотных боевых машин и летательных аппаратов, которые бы обеспечили превосходство американских вооружённых сил на поле боя XXI века. Постоянно меняющиеся требования военных в связи с открытием новых театров боевых действий после терактов 11 сентября 2001 года тормозили разработку и увеличили стоимость программы на 25%. В 2009 году, когда проект находился на стадии системного дизайна и был готов к первым демонстрациям, он был закрыт. Всего было потрачено $19 млрд, что делает FCS самим дорогим из проектов оружия будущего, так и не законченных Пентагоном.",0

4332,Why Donald Trump must shut down The Federal Reserve and start issuing debt-free money,"Why Donald Trump must shut down The Federal Reserve and start issuing debt-free money It would take someone very bold to make a move like this By Michael Snyder - Thursday, November 17, 2016 10:26 AM EST 
If Donald Trump truly wants to fix the economy, he must shut down the Federal Reserve. If he just tries to patch up our current system, he will fail, because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. A little over a century ago, very powerful forces on Wall Street convinced Congress to completely restructure our financial system. An immensely powerful central bank known as the Federal Reserve was created, and the goal was to transform the U.S. dollar into a debt-based currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which the federal government could never possibly escape. Sadly, they were successful on both counts. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined by approximately 98 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger . 
Americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the U.S. economy to our presidents, but the truth is that an unelected, unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does. The Federal Reserve has become known as “ the fourth branch of government “, but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the Fed’s decisions are “above politics” because they are “too important”. Fed officials fiercely guard their “independence”, and they fiercely resist any “interference” from Congress, the President, or the American people. 
Donald Trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations, but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the Fed wields. The Fed controls interest rates, the Fed controls the money supply, and the Fed regulates the banks. 
To give you an idea of how enormously powerful the Fed is, I want you to pull out a dollar bill. 
As you look at that dollar bill, I want you to notice that it says “Federal Reserve Note” right at the top. 
In the financial world, a “note” is an instrument of debt, and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible. 
So why are we using debt-based “Federal Reserve Notes” in the first place? Shouldn’t Congress have control over our currency? 
According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , it is Congress that has the authority to “coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures”. 
So how did the Fed get involved? 
Well, it is a very long and convoluted story, and if you are interested in the history behind it I would commend to you an excellent book by C. Edward Griffin entitled “ The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve “. Basically, big money interests on Wall Street got their hooks into the White House and Congress, and they rushed through legislation right before Christmas in 1913 that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the American people and put it into their hands. 
Sadly, most Americans don’t even realize that we have a debt-based currency, nor do they understand where our money comes from. In a previous article , I discussed how money is normally created by the Federal Reserve under our current system… 
When the U.S. government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have, it does not print up a billion dollars. 
Rather, the U.S. government creates a bunch of U.S. Treasury bonds (debt) and takes them over to the Federal Reserve. 
The Federal Reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the U.S. Treasury bonds. 
The Federal Reserve takes the U.S. Treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the “Federal Reserve Notes” that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder . But of course this process always creates more debt than it does money… The U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the Federal Reserve system. But wait. There is a problem. Because the U.S. government must pay interest on the Treasury bonds, the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created. So where will the U.S. government get the money to pay that debt? Well, the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really, really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt. But that never actually happens, does it? And the creators of the Federal Reserve understood this as well. They understood that the U.S. government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt. They knew that the U.S. government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game. 
So our debt just keeps going up and up and up. While Barack Obama has been in the White House our national debt has risen by more than 9 trillion dollars, and at this moment it is sitting just under the 20 trillion dollar mark . 
But we shouldn’t be surprised by this, because this is precisely what the Federal Reserve system was designed to do to us. 
But we shouldn’t be surprised by this, because this is precisely what the Federal Reserve system was designed to do to us. 
Many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday, but as I have shown in a previous article, this is mathematically impossible to do . 
If the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt, and of course we have trillions of dollars of household debt, trillions of dollars of corporate debt and trillions of dollars of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well. 
Under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt. 
And of course it isn’t just the United States that is in this predicament. At this point, almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank. 
Even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else, somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption. 
As you read this article, well over 99.9% of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank. 
Do you think that is just a coincidence? 
Of course there are still a few very small countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia that do not have a central bank, but the only big nation not to have one is North Korea. 
And you would literally have to be insane to want to live in North Korea. 
But now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system. The truth is that we don’t have to have a central bank. In fact, the greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history was when there was no central bank . 
We don’t need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply. They will never admit this, but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts. 
Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions : 1918, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1937, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, 1960, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001, 2008. 
Considering their track record, isn’t it time for a change? 
And we don’t have to have a debt-based currency. In fact, not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debt-free “United States Notes”. 
Back in 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 which authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue debt-free “United States Notes” which were directly created by the U.S. government. 
He was assassinated shortly thereafter. 
Most Americans don’t realize this, but many of the debt-free United States Notes that were issued under President Kennedy are still in circulation today , and President Trump could do something similar. 
But will he? 
It has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender, and the Federal Reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves. 
Debt is a form of social control, and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet. The total amount of debt in the world just hit a brand new record high of 152 trillion dollars , and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become. 
There is a way out, and here in the United States that starts with shutting down the Federal Reserve and issuing debt-free currency. It would take someone very bold to make a move like this, and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task.",0
4333,"Harold Hayes, Survivor of Secret World War II Odyssey, Dies at 94 - The New York Times","Harold Hayes, the last surviving member of a band of airborne American medics and nurses who   in   Albania in 1943 and survived German attacks, blizzards and horrific privations on a   trek to their rescue on the Adriatic coast, died on Sunday in Medford, Ore. He was 94. His death, at a hospital, followed an operation to remove a blood clot from his leg, his daughter Margaret Bleakley said. The survival of the 30 noncombatants was a   secret of World War II: the story of 13 female nurses, 13 male medics and the   crew of a medical evacuation plane who were stranded behind enemy lines for nine weeks, hiding in villages and caves in wintry mountains, afflicted with lice and dysentery, often near starvation and hunted by German patrols. Their odyssey was classified during the war and for years afterward to protect partisan fighters, Allied agents and villagers who gave them food, shelter and guidance. Some were shot by the Germans for their acts of kindness, and after the war, as rumors became death sentences, those even suspected of helping the Americans were executed by Albania’s Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha, whose rule ended with his death in 1985. “For many years, I didn’t say anything about what happened in Albania,” Mr. Hayes said in a 2015 telephone interview with The New York Times from his   home in Medford. “After the war was over, Hoxha was ruthless. If he discovered the names of anyone who had helped us, he had them and their families executed. ” Mr. Hayes had no special role in the group’s survival, but by outliving all his wartime comrades, he became a last conduit for their story, which was related in a 1999 memoir by one of the nurses, and more recently in several books, notably “The Secret Rescue” (2013) by Cate Lineberry, whose account relied heavily on Mr. Hayes’s recollections. The perilous adventure began two months after Italy surrendered and Allied forces invaded Italy to begin pushing the Germans back across Europe. On Nov. 8, 1943, the nurses, medics and fliers of the Army Air Force’s 807th Medical Air Evacuation Transport Squadron took off from Catania, Sicily, bound for Bari, on Italy’s east coast, where hundreds of wounded troops awaited air evacuation. Their   cargo plane carried no weapons, but the pilot, First Lt. Charles Thrasher, 22, anticipated no fighting. With him were a   radio operator and crew chief. The nurses, all second lieutenants, were 22 to 32 years old. The medics, including Mr. Hayes, 21, from Indianola, Iowa, were all equivalent to staff sergeants and ranged in age from 21 to 36. An hour into the flight, the plane became lost in a huge storm over the Adriatic Sea. Its compass and communications failed. Blown 100 miles off course, it crossed the coast of Albania and was intercepted by German fighters and attacked by antiaircraft guns. It plunged to a belly landing in a marsh 25 miles inland. Willis Shumway, 23, the crew chief, was the only casualty, with a knee injury that left him unable to walk. The disoriented Americans had no idea where they were. Fearing a fuel explosion, they scrambled out of the plane and encountered their first bit of luck. Striding out of a woods was a band of   men with rifles and daggers. One spoke a little English. He was Hasan Gina, an   partisan leader. He told the Americans they were in Albania. Later, they would learn that they were 150 miles east of Bari, on the wrong side of the Adriatic, surrounded by German forces that had occupied Albania for months, and were caught in a civil war between rival partisan groups. The Americans knew almost nothing of Albania, a small, mostly Muslim country that had changed little in centuries. The mountainous terrain was dotted with impoverished villages. There were no railroads and few roads. Mules and horses were the main transportation. There was little running water or electricity. Winters were brutal, food was scarce, and blood feuds were common among the ferociously proud peoples. With only a general plan to reach the west coast and somehow cross the Adriatic to Italy, the Americans began walking in the wrong direction. Over the ensuing weeks, guided by the partisans, they trekked through mountains and valleys, sometimes cutting back or traveling in circles to avoid German patrols, living in the open or sheltering in villages and sharing cornbread with peasants. The Americans were soon listed as missing in action, and War Department telegrams, beginning “regret to inform you,” were sent to their families back home. The survivors, meantime, carried Sergeant Shumway on a stretcher made of seats from the plane they later found pack animals for him. After five days, they rested at a   town called Berat, where they were cheered, mistaken for the vanguard of an Allied invasion to liberate Albania. They also met other partisan leaders, and learned of a British agent who had recently parachuted into the country. Their respite lasted only a few days. Then, they awoke to gunfire and the explosion of artillery shells as German forces entered the town. In the ensuing confusion, German planes strafed a truck carrying some of the escaping Americans. Three nurses were separated from the main group and left behind in Berat they took refuge in a farmhouse, and remained in hiding in the area for four months. The main group of Americans climbed on foot to a mountain village and were caught in a crossfire between partisan groups. “It was the first time the Americans had heard of the rival group, and they were beginning to realize they were in as much danger from the country’s internal battle as they were from the Germans,” Ms. Lineberry wrote in “The Secret Rescue. ” They encountered other perils. “Some of the blankets offered to them to ward off the cold night air were infested with fleas and lice,” the author wrote. “Since they’d crashed, most of them had been unable to bathe, aside from splashing some water on their faces and arms from mountain streams or an occasional basin, and they were all filthy and now battling fleas, lice and the GIs,” Army slang for diarrhea. The Americans were often unable to find food. Facing starvation, they made tea by boiling straw and ate berries that worsened their diarrhea. Sharing with peasants was sometimes a culture shock. Mr. Hayes and another medic saw a sheep’s head roasted over coals, then split in half with an ax. “The Americans watched   as two women each took   of the head and ate everything, including the eyeballs,” Ms. Lineberry wrote. “Nothing was wasted. ” As autumn waned, blizzards enveloped the Americans. Their clothing was too thin. Their shoes were worn out. “Though all their feet soon felt like blocks of ice and their bodies shivered, they knew they had to keep going,” Ms. Lineberry wrote. “The snow was coming down so fast they could barely see the person in front of them, but they had to stay together to avoid losing one another in the blinding white storm. ” On Nov. 27, British intelligence in Albania learned from partisans that the American plane had crashed and that the nurses, medics and crew were alive, trying to reach the coast. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander in Europe, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the families of the missing were told. In December, an American rescue plan was developed, led by an Army captain, Lloyd G. Smith, 24, who was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. Under cover of darkness, he slipped onto the heavily guarded Albanian coast by boat and set up a base camp in a cave in the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic. Others joined him, and they moved inland to find the Americans. The British, meantime, organized a second rescue effort under Lt. Gavan Duffy, a secret agent who with a small team had reached Albania months earlier by parachute and on foot. Through partisan contacts, he found the Americans in eastern Albania and began leading them westward, intending to reach the coast. But halfway there, at Gjirokaster, German troops blocked the way, and the Americans were too sick and exhausted to go on. He radioed for an American air rescue. Two   cargo planes flew in with fighter escorts. But the Germans disrupted the landing, and Lieutenant Duffy called it off. The Americans, after the euphoria of nearly being rescued, were crushed. But they resumed their journey, and with American and British help reached the coast. On Jan. 9, after a   ordeal, 27 Americans  —   10 nurses and 17 medics and fliers  —   boarded a British launch and crossed to Italy. Three nurses remained behind in   Berat. Captain Lloyd Smith brought them to safety in March 1944. They rode pack mules most of the way to the coast and were met by a torpedo boat, which took them across the Adriatic. After the war, Mr. Hayes returned to civilian life, attended Iowa State College and became an aeronautical engineer for North American Aviation, designing military planes and conducting studies for the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration until he retired in 1984. He married the former Betty Allen in 1944. She and their daughter survive him, as does another daughter, Victoria Sprott two brothers, Karl and James a sister, Virginia McCall two grandsons and a  . Harold Lyle Hayes was born in Pekin, Iowa, on April 11, 1922, to Ralph and Jenella Van Gorp Hayes. He graduated from high school in Indianola in 1940. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, he was drafted, volunteered as a medic and by 1943 was in Sicily, flying evacuation missions. “When he first returned to Allied lines, he had nightmares of being chased,” Ms. Lineberry wrote of Mr. Hayes. “Those faded with time, but as was true of many in the group, he rarely talked about his ordeal over the years. ”",0

4335,EU using taxpayer money to give Muslim invaders in Turkey free debit cards and cash transfers to keep them out of Europe,"BNI Store Oct 29 2016 EU using taxpayer money to give Muslim invaders in Turkey free debit cards and cash transfers to keep them out of Europe As many as one million illegal alien Muslim colonizers in Turkey will receive debit cards and monthly cash transfers to help pay for food and housing under a new €348 million ($393 million) humanitarian program from the European Union. ZeroHedge The EU’s largest-ever humanitarian program is part of a €3 billion package of assistance the bloc promised Turkey to support some three million refugees the country hosts, mainly from Syria. The new EU program will be overseen by the World Food Program, in cooperation with the Turkish Red Crescent. Each family’s need will be assessed individually and there are additional funds available for education or supporting elderly family members. Step-by-Step Progression into a sinkhole for the EU More refugees will seek free handouts. Turkey will complain €3 billion is not enough. The refugees will complain €1,000 is not enough. EU citizens will wonder why refugees are getting €1,000 and they are not. Demands for an EU-wide helicopter drop of free debit cards will soar. The amounts demanded will soar. Some economist will propose the debit cards will expire if not used quickly. And then, and then ….Under Eurozone rules the ECB cannot simply print money and give it away. Countries have budget constraints. So, either taxes go up to pay for the scheme, or the EMU rules have to change. Western media are reporting on the Muslim refugee crisis as a humanitarian problem for the West only. But where are the media questions about the huge financial and land resources available in the Arab Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE? So far, the richest Arab Muslim countries in the Middle East have taken in virtually no Muslim refugees. Liveleak The world is often lectured to about the urgency of respecting Arab and Islamic brotherly love, but where is the Arab action to rescue fellow Muslims and Arabs from the claws of ISIS? Where are the mighty Arab armies who waged dozens of wars against Israel? Why aren’t they fighting ISIS and building tent cities in the vast deserts of Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the wealthy Gulf States? Where is the wealthy Arab League to coordinate safe cities on Arab land that extends from Morocco to Iraq and from Northern Syria to Sudan? Kuwaiti official explains why Kuwait will NOT take in any Syrian refugees “Kuwait and other oil-rich Muslim countries are too valuable to accept low-class Muslim refugees who we will have to support because they don’t want to work. We don’t want people who are different from us.”",0
4336,They Found Bombs on a Beer Run. What Gratitude Are They Owed? - The New York Times,"On Sunday evening, the day after a bomb exploded on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, Lee Parker visited his friend Ivan White at his apartment in Elizabeth, N. J. to borrow some clothes for a job interview the next morning and to watch some football. Mr. Parker had been struggling to find work for the past few years he was laid off after Hurricane Sandy and had been sleeping on a series of sofas belonging to friends for some time. The interview the following day was for work at a trucking company. Mr. Parker had mentioned to Mr. White that in addition to a new outfit, he wished he had a new backpack. At some point the two friends left the apartment to get some beer, an excursion that took them past the Elizabeth train station where, as if a genie had suddenly blinked twice, a backpack appeared on top of a waste bin. “I once found a new Macy’s coat with the tags still on it on top of a trash can,” Mr. White explained outside the train station on Wednesday. “So, you never know what you’re going to find. ” With that in mind, the two men opened the backpack and found what appeared to be explosive devices. Undeterred, they carried the backpack to an unpopulated area, so that if it did explode, no one would be harmed. Then they walked to the local police station, about five minutes away, to report what they had discovered. The backpack held five bombs. The next day, Ahmad Khan Rahami was arrested in connection with those and the other explosives placed near the start of a charity running race in Seaside Park, N. J. and in a Dumpster and in a trash can in Chelsea. Almost as soon as Mr. Rahami was taken into custody, on Monday, an online campaign was started on the site GoFundMe. com, intended to raise $10, 000 as a show of gratitude for Mr. Parker and Mr. White, who by virtue of sartorial need and serendipity had averted a potentially lethal terrorist attack. The money was to be split three ways, among the two men and an organization called the Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless. The campaign was started by a group of men involved in another   charity, created in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, called At Heart’s Length, who had heard about the men’s involvement from a friend. Giuliano Farina, one of the founders of At Heart’s Length, said that Mr. Parker and Mr. White were not asked about the campaign before it went forward, but that he and the others at his organization wanted the men to be recognized for what they had done. Within a few days, the campaign raised more than $21, 000. A backlash developed just as quickly. It is perhaps a mark of how much antipathy is directed at crowdfunding  —   a great vessel of cultural entitlement that has people depending on the largess of the internet for what, in the old days, they would pay for themselves (in vitro fertilization,   surgery, creative vanity projects, trips to New Zealand)  —   that the effort was met with accusations of dark, or at least obscure, motives. Was At Heart’s Length, a charity of eclectic purpose delivering youth sports, holiday meals and citizenship counseling, using Mr. Parker and Mr. White to advance its own agenda? The GoFundMe page listed the charity’s address and invited donors to send money there as well if they chose. Mr. Farina said his own organization would keep none of the money. He attributed some of the mistrust to personal ill will among local residents toward one of the men who had started the campaign, who some felt was riding the current narrative of Mr. Parker and Mr. White for his own political purposes. And that, Mr. Farina felt certain, was a complete misreading of the events. Another strain of grievance among commenters on the GoFundMe page was that the Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless, an organization more than 30 years old that operates in a county with a poverty rate of 27 percent and in a town, Mr. White said, where some people were living in tented encampments, somehow didn’t deserve any of the money. Mr. Parker, who became homeless after living in a Y. M. C. A. in Newark, clearly wasn’t receiving the group’s services. Why should it benefit from all of the publicity now surrounding him? Hearing about Mr. Parker, a local professor had begun paying for his stay in a hotel, but the coalition, Mr. Parker said, was now working on finding him more permanent housing. Both men have had difficulties, and the feeling among some was that they should receive all of the money. Mr. White hasn’t worked in a few years. He has diabetes, and part of his foot was amputated, he told me. A job making   parts ended when the factory closed, and his health got in the way of other jobs he held, working in sales, he said. He sent two daughters to college one, a security guard, now has three daughters of her own. What do we owe those who do good? In another time, the answer might have been simply honor and respect. But at a moment when fashioning the right Instagram profile can catapult you into a higher tax bracket and   an airplane when you are, in fact, an airline pilot can lead to speaking engagements, global fame and a movie about you starring Tom Hanks, the expectations become very different. “Make no mistake, this isn’t a cottage industry,” Mr. White told me. “But if there’s a reward out there, I’ll take it. ”",0

4338,"Evan Bayh, Long Popular in Indiana, Finds Comeback Unexpectedly Rocky - The New York Times","MUNCIE, Ind.  —   For Evan Bayh, who spent a third of his life serving this state, Susan Brown is a harrowing figure. “I was going to vote for him because he’s Evan Bayh. Evan Bayh!” said Ms. Brown, 69, a Republican, who has fond memories of the Democrat who is seeking to take back his Senate seat after a more than   hiatus. “But then I saw all those commercials about all the money he made when he left office, and I think I am for the other guy now. ” When Mr. Bayh, swimming in cash and latent ambition, decided in   that he would take another run at his old job, Democrats were overjoyed. They believed that Mr. Bayh, 60, whose two terms each as governor and senator were won mostly with ease, had turned a lost cause in a red state into a sure win. By collectively pushing former Representative Baron Hill, the (likely doomed) Democrat, out of the race and replacing him with Mr. Bayh, they instantly elevated the party’s chances to take back the Senate. But Republicans attacked as quickly and voraciously as a cougar whose dinner has been threatened. Over the last few months, conservative groups have buried Mr. Bayh in ads mocking his Senate retirement, questioning his ties to Indiana and criticizing his work as a consultant for a Washington lobbying firm. In an election year in which many voters appear to be embracing outsider credentials over experience, Mr. Bayh could find that there are limits to the good will that voters will extend to a candidate with fraying connections to his home state. Federal records show that nearly $6 million in media spending by outside groups has targeted Mr. Bayh since he got into the race, and groups have more ready to go next month. (Also unhelpful: Mr. Bayh flubbed his home address during an interview.) What was initially expected to be a gaping lead over Representative Todd Young, a Republican, has recently been only in the single digits, according to a Monmouth University poll, jolting Democrats’ confidence. “Yes, I’m surprised, but that’s the Citizens United world we are living in,” Mr. Bayh said in an interview in Indianapolis last weekend, referring to the Supreme Court ruling that removed many limits on political spending. After his unexpected retirement in 2010 from the Senate, Mr. Bayh joined a Washington law and lobbying firm, McGuireWoods. Republicans have tried to paint him as a handmaiden of special interests, a charge he predictably rejects. “I’ve missed public service since the day I retired from the Senate,” Mr. Bayh said. Indiana has a recent history of punishing   politicians who they think have “gone Washington. ” Former Senator Richard G. Lugar, one of the state’s most respected political figures, was ousted in a primary in 2012 by a Tea Party challenger. But Senator Dan Coats, a Republican whose retirement created the opening for Mr. Bayh, made a comeback in 2010 after his own   turn as a lobbyist. Mr. Coats noted that the climate this year seemed more hostile. “It might matter more this year than ever,” he said. Others have found themselves going from beloved to spurned. Former Senator Bob Kerrey had been gone from Nebraska for nearly 20 years when he tried to return to the Senate in 2012, leaving his wife and child back in New York City as he faced bruising attacks. “By November, half the people thought I had never lived in Nebraska,” said Mr. Kerrey, who was defeated and returned to New York as quickly as he had left. “Republicans are better than Democrats are in doing that sort of thing. They did such a good job they probably saved my marriage. ” But Mr. Bayh enjoys many advantages that keep him as the   in the race, Democrats and Republicans agree. The son of former Senator Birch Bayh, Mr. Bayh is part of a Midwestern political dynasty that spans generations of voters. A moderate who was long viewed as working well with Republicans, Mr. Bayh fits the state’s   as almost defiantly sensible. He is so closely associated with a wildly popular scholarship program he signed into law in 1990 that Mike Pence, the governor and now the running mate of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, helped ensure it was renamed in his honor. “I really love that program,” said Ms. Brown, a retired teacher, as a warning of sorts to Mr. Young when she met him in a bakery here last Sunday. “You should do something like that. ” (She also told Mr. Young, 44, that he was “so good looking” three times, and made a few smooching sounds for good measure.) Mr. Bayh entered the race with nearly $10 million to spend against Mr. Young’s $1. 2 million, freeing Democrats, at first, to spend money on other races. But Mr. Bayh, who served as the governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997 and senator from 1999 to 2011, is facing some headwinds. Indiana, which has grown increasingly conservative over the last decade, is Trump country. Having Mr. Pence on the ticket, even though his popularity has waned, could further strengthen its performance here. A state not known for ticket splitting may well do so for Mr. Bayh, but a state that suffered disproportionately in the last recession may not have as much love for the   insiders Mr. Trump has railed against all year, even as it recovers. “There may be a nostalgic sense for the way things were when Evan Bayh was in office,” said John Schorg, the spokesman for the Indiana House Democrats. “But keeping people thinking that the way it was is the way it’s going to be is hard. ” Mr. Young has been greatly aided by   outside groups, but he said his campaign was working well before Mr. Bayh belatedly entered the race. “Our message was compelling before he got in the race,” Mr. Young said in an interview here. “I am not a career politician. I am a Marine with four kids who wants to make a difference. ” (He is also in his third term in the House.) All of this has put Mr. Bayh on defense, even insisting he was not a lobbyist in an advertisement, and focusing heavily on the things he accomplished during his service here and in Washington, like reminding a large group of black voters at the Light of the World Christian Church in Indianapolis on Sunday about his scholarship program and his long ties to its current and former pastor. He has turned the “insider” attack back on Mr. Young. “If people are angry at Washington, he’s been there and he has to be accountable for that,” he said. Mr. Bayh admits the race will probably be close, though, even as he vows to prevail. “In this political year,” he said, “a lot of things can happen. ”",0
4339,"In Case Testing Police Liability in Shootings, Supreme Court Shows Divide - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   In a police shooting case that tests when people can sue law enforcement officers, Supreme Court justices on Wednesday argued sharply different views of whether improper actions by officers expose them to liability for what follows. In 2010, while looking for a wanted man, Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies did not have a warrant when they illegally searched a house and a small shack behind it. Two deputies entered the shack without knocking or announcing themselves, saw what they said was a man holding a rifle  —   it turned out to be a BB gun  —   and opened fire. They wounded the man and his pregnant girlfriend, neither of whom was the person they were looking for. Angel Mendez, who lost his right leg below the knee in the shooting and lived in the shack with Jennifer Lynn Garcia, sued the county in federal court and won $4 million in damages. The county appealed. The legal question in the case, County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, is not about the shooting itself the courts have agreed that at the moment they pulled their triggers, the deputies could have reasonably believed they were in danger. Instead, the argument has turned on whether the warrantless search, a violation of constitutional rights, was the “proximate cause” that made the deputies liable for the shooting, or if it was merely a contributing factor. “It doesn’t seem to me a fluky or random thing to say, when there’s an unauthorized entry into someone’s home, violence may result,” Justice Elena Kagan said. She likened an officer without a warrant to a trespasser, who would meet a very different response than would a guest. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. disagreed strongly. “If you take away the failure to get a warrant, the harm still occurs,” he said. “The search warrant is not going to change the conduct. ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy voiced seemingly conflicting views. Without liability, “we simply have no way to enforce the warrant requirement,” he said. But calling the lack of a warrant the proximate cause of the shooting, he said, is “a difficult position to defend. ” The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled against Los Angeles County partly based on a theory that officers who recklessly provoke a confrontation can be liable for the results. Legal analysts expect that reasoning, which other appellate courts have not adopted, to be addressed in the Supreme Court’s decision. But it was barely discussed on Wednesday. The deputies’ failure to warn before entering the shack could be deemed improper, and was more directly linked to the shooting. But the Ninth Circuit ruled that it was not clear in 2010 that the “knock and announce” rule the courts have espoused would apply to a building like a shack. Using that rule to support the plaintiffs, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said, “You end up imposing liability for what is arguably a violation of best police practices. ” But Justice Stephen G. Breyer questioned the need to break the incident down moment by moment to find liability. “The background circumstances can be such that there is no justification for the whole ball of wax,” he said.",0
4341,Highlights From the Clinton Campaign Emails: How to Deal With Sanders and Biden - The New York Times,"The latest trove of documents released by WikiLeaks includes thousands of pages of emails between John D. Podesta, the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and aides, Clinton family members and outside donors all angling for position and power within Mrs. Clinton’s   campaign. Last week, a set of Mr. Podesta’s emails were disclosed that included potentially damaging excerpts from private paid speeches Mrs. Clinton delivered to Wall Street executives in which she praised “open trade and open borders” and lamented that her personal wealth made her “kind of far removed” from the struggles of the middle class. The latest leaked emails show Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides trying to grapple with that reality, and establish a campaign message that could position her, a career politician and Washington insider, as an appealing agent of change. The authenticity of the emails, which were from Mr. Podesta’s account, was not challenged by Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton. Here are the highlights: Despite statements by Mrs. Clinton and her allies insisting she had not made up her mind about seeking the presidency in 2016, the emails reveal that her advisers had begun to test messages and contemplate a campaign strategy at least two years before she officially declared her candidacy in April 2015. Mr. Podesta, who would become campaign chairman, and Robby Mook, the eventual campaign manager, grappled with how to best position Mrs. Clinton, a career politician, as a change agent, how much to play up the   potential of her candidacy and how to address anger over income inequality. “Gender will be a big field and volunteer motivator, but it won’t close the deal,” Mr. Mook wrote to Mr. Podesta and Cheryl D. Mills, another Clinton adviser, in March 2014. “The real challenge,” Ms. Mills wrote, “is that this likely will be when people want experience and we got so burned by that narrative” in the 2008 campaign against Barack Obama that “we won’t go back to it, even though it might be right for now. ” The emails reveal the excruciating   behind every step related to how Mrs. Clinton handled everything from her splashy campaign rollout speech on Roosevelt Island in June 2015 to a single Twitter post. In one email chain from March 2015, four aides debated a Twitter post in which Mrs. Clinton would address for the first time revelations that she had used a private email server during her tenure at the State Department. “I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible,” the post eventually read. “She smacked down POTUS on trade and kept kicking for a little bit,” Huma Abedin, a close aide, wrote on June 14, 2015, using an acronym for the president. “Worth looking at the transcript but this seemed to really work for this crowd. ” At the time, Mrs. Clinton was trying to craft herself as more of a populist, pointing to differences between her and Mr. Obama. The aides also liked the personal details she shared. “She inserted some new applause lines and talked about Dorothy,” her mother, “in a more personal way that I’ve only heard talk about privately,” Ms. Abedin wrote. Aides discussed leaking it after a meeting with labor leaders  —   so as not to undermine her “principled stand about not   the president in public. ” Mr. Mook suggested that Mrs. Clinton time her announcement to “help distract” from the barrage of criticism surrounding her use of a private email server. The emails show heightened awareness of her vulnerability to charges of   and political maneuvering. “She risks looking very political, especially on this,” wrote Joel Benenson, the chief strategist on the campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s press secretary, Brian Fallon, felt that leaking her new position on Keystone “might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. ” We take a closer look at how the debate over the unveiling evolved. In 2015, the Clinton campaign had to deal with escalating chatter about a potential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Donors phoned in reports on Mr. Biden’s    maneuvers to advisers like Neera Tanden, who relayed them back to Mr. Podesta. Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Clinton supporter, emailed her campaign manager to grouse about one supporter in particular: Linda Lipsen, head of the trial lawyers association. “I get multiple   calls every morning and I try to talk everyone off the ledge and not bug u all,” Mr. Elmendorf wrote. “But Linda is in a different category. ” Ms. Lipsen had complained about not getting enough care from the campaign at a time when she was working members of her trade association and trying to keep them from considering Mr. Biden. For all the planning, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides appeared blindsided by the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders’s populist message in the Democratic primary. Concern over Mrs. Clinton’s economic message seemed to reach a breaking point after Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Sanders by 22 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary. “Message needs to be more positive, upbeat, hopeful,” an adviser wrote to Mr. Podesta. “Bernie is saying we can change the world. Her msg is ‘No, we can’t’ because   …    ” The adviser expressed particular concern about young voters gravitating to Mr. Sanders’s promise for revolution. “Bernie’s ads feature young ppl saying why they are voting   supporting him,” she wrote. “Hillary’s ads need to be young people  —   all under 45 and a smattering of older ones  —   validating her. ” In January, Donna Brazile, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, passed on an email from Mr. Sanders’s   outreach team about how it was planning to host a   event. “Thank you for the heads up on this, Donna,” responded Adrienne Elrod, one of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign aides. Ms. Brazile, a longtime party operative, later replaced Debbie Wasserman Schultz on an interim basis as D. N. C. chairwoman on the eve of the party’s national convention, a change that came after leaked emails revealed that Democratic officials had conspired to harm Mr. Sanders’s bid for the party’s nomination. Her aides decided in January that she should avoid talking about Wall Street at an event in Nevada during her primary fight with Mr. Sanders. “Don’t know that it is most effective contrast for her,” wrote Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s communications director. “Seems like we are picking the fight he wants to have. ” In the fall and winter of 2011, an increasingly bitter dispute was breaking out between a top Clinton aide, Douglas J. Band, and Chelsea Clinton, over the blurred lines between the Clinton Foundation and Mr. Band’s consulting company, Teneo. Ms. Clinton had sought to reorganize and professionalize the foundation, angering Mr. Band and a fellow longtime Clinton aide, Justin Cooper, who resisted. “Doug apparently kept telling my dad I was trying to push him out, take over,” Ms. Clinton told Mr. Podesta in a November 2011 email. But the next month, Ms. Clinton was less understanding. In December, she emailed Mr. Podesta and several aides to Mrs. Clinton regarding a Clinton Foundation aide who worked for former President Bill Clinton. The aide, Ilya Aspis, had been calling members of Parliament in Britain “on behalf of President Clinton” for Teneo clients, including the chief executive of Dow Chemical. She also mentions that another former White House aide, Sara Latham, had begun working for Teneo but then quit “because she was so upset, partly because of what Doug and Declan asked her to   was happening for their clients at Davos. ” The reference appears to be to Declan Kelly, a   of Teneo, though what Ms. Latham was asked to do remains unclear.",0

4343,LesserOfTwoEvilism,"2016 presidential campaign by Matt Sedillo 
Hillary Clinton is, no doubt, a threat to life on Earth. But the duopoly electoral system is a menagerie of warmongers. “The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks.” Barack Obama has proven an awesomely prolific war maker. Bernie Sanders is no peacenik. “It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question.” LesserOfTwoEvilism by Matt Sedillo 
“ So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood.” 
The loathsome and shameless hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and the doctrine of lesseroftwoevilism has been laid bare this political season. This same Democratic Party that unquestionably rigged the primaries against the left-leaning Bernie Sanders campaign is now selling itself to the public as the savior of the downtrodden from the threat of an uber right wing candidate. 
Hillary Clinton at this point in her election run appears to be making no promises to the public other than to not to physically morph into Donald Trump during her coronation come Election Day. 
Lesseroftwoevilism is a bankrupt political ideology and the means by which the Democratic Party deadens any inkling towards decency or rational self interest that may lay dormant in the American electorate. Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party intend to use the platform of ""at least not being Donald Trump"" to install the most despised Democratic candidate in a generation into the White House. 
It is indeed horrifying that a straight up eugenicist billionaire who brags about sexual assaulting women won the Republican primary. It is terrifying that the cult leader of a white nationalist zombie apocalypse has gotten this far through the electoral process. 
“There is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton.” 
The country is polarizing and it is terrifying to see that much of it is polarizing in the direction of Donald Trump whose campaign is defined by phrases like “Make America Great Again” quickly followed by “Mexico Will Pay.” Much of the country is also polarized in the direction of Bernie Sanders. It was the political apparatus of the Democratic Party, not the Republicans, that prevented these two competing visions from standing before the American public. 
Setting aside the fact, for a moment, that we don't live in a democracy, it must be noted that lesseroftwoevilism in American politics is an ideology by Americans for Americans. Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, AND Bernie Sanders are all advocates of the US war machine. If any of these three warlords were to sit in the seat of power children in far off lands would still be bombed in their sleep and be reported on as collateral damage. 
Hillary Clinton is the most bloodthirsty advocate for murder and mayhem in a political system that thrives upon such practices. When it comes to dropping bombs, obliterating nations or possibly igniting a nuclear winter there is no greater threat to the future of much of life on the planet than Hillary Clinton. 
Rainbow Coalition of Hawks 
Far beyond a “basket of deplorables,” the 2016 Republican national convention was a ghastly horror show of the most reactionary, bigoted elements of American political culture. Less than esteemed actor Scott Baio captured the mood when he proclaimed, “so of course let’s make America great again, but let’s make America America again.” That largely captured the theme of the proceedings and most speeches were some variation upon that theme. 
The Democrats in response sought to make their convention a big tent of peoples, ideas and movements. And indeed from the spontaneous chants of “black lives matter” to Tim Kaine leading a chant of “si se puede” to Eva Longoria reminding the audience “we didn’t cross the borders the borders crossed us” to Michelle Obama letting the thousands in attendance and the millions watching at home know that slave labor built the White House and the country, from Sebastian De La Cruz singing the national anthem in full mariachi garb to the Khan family holding a copy of the Constitution, the Democratic National Convention did present itself as a stark contrast to what the GOP was offering. 
The theme of inclusion ran high and, indeed, current president Barack Obama made his call for strength in unity, explicitly saying “And most of all I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe we are stronger together, black white, Latino, Asian, Native American, young, old, gay, straight, men, women, folks with different abilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag, to this big bold country that we love.” One flag to rule them all. 
“America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. ” 
General John Allen, standing before a multi ethnic group of people continued upon this theme and made the connection between a more inclusive union and explicit projection of American might 
“Every American, in uniform or out, in the White House or at home, must be a force for unity in America, for a vision that includes all of us: every man and woman, every race, every ethnicity, every faith and creed, every gender orientation – all of us together pursuing our common values. 
“From the battlefield to the capitals of our allies, friends, and partners, the free peoples of the world look to America as the last best hope for peace and for liberty for all humanity, for we ARE the greatest country on this planet. 
“So we stand before you tonight to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States of America.” 
The message could not be clearer. Sorry Donald Trump, we are all Americans here. No apologies rest of the world, America the greatest and most diverse nation on Earth shall ransack the globe as it sees fit. 
The response to the white nationalism of Donald Trump has been the rainbow coalition of hawks as chiefly embodied in the persons of Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 
Hillary Clinton: The Obliterator of Nations 
Hillary Clinton is a war criminal. So is John Kerry. So is Condoleezza Rice. So are Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. The secretary of state in an imperialist nation is the immediate manager of the projected might of the empire they represent. 
Hillary Clinton is known to be a war hawk for much the same reason Donald Trump is known as a white nationalist. She is blatant and crass about it. 
“We came. We saw. He died” – Hillary Clinton on the assassination of Ghadaffi 
“In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them” – Hillary Clinton speaking of obliteration of 75 million Iranians. 
For much of the past few months the Clinton campaign have bemoaned a Russian conspiracy to reveal the words that Hillary Clinton actually wrote and thereby influence the American election. 
Hillary Clinton’s neo-Mcarthyite cold war against her own words and general war talk on Russia should come as no surprise to anyone paying any attention. She was hawkish on Russia in their land dispute with Georgia over Ossetia, even going so far as to arm the Georgian government in 2010 less than two years after the conflict. She was warlike on the conflict in the Ukraine, promising Ukrainian government officials as recent as September of this year to stand with them against “Russian aggression.” 
“A Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class.” 
This is the talk of someone prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. 
It should be mentioned, however, that Obama has also dialed up his anti Russian rhetoric, as has Tim Kaine, as has Mike Pence. It is only the white nationalist orange demon -- guided only by his own whims and twitter feuds -- that is at all off script on this question. 
Ultimately a Clinton presidency is the will of the ruling class. If she wants war it is a reflection of their desire for war. If they want the bombs to fall then death will rain from the sky. So long as they hold power they shall exercise it. So long as there is a ruling class they shall rule by fire and blood, because there truly is no alternative. Because ultimately, this is about Clinton and then again it isn’t. And this is about the Democrats and then again it isn’t. This is about the US and this is about war. Hillary Clinton is a 2016 warlord. War is a racket. And so is this God damn election. Matt Sedillo can be contacted at [email protected] .",0

4345,The Forgotten Man,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
The forgotten man decided the presidential election. Donald Trump persuaded the forgotten man to repose his anger and frustration and power into Trump’s hands. Who is the forgotten man? What does he want from government? Why did he vote for Trump? 
When the tide began to turn against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, I planned to write this column about the unwarranted and unlawful injection of the FBI into the political process. At the time, I was seated with the Fox News number crunchers and generally was exposed to trends and vote totals — and the number crunchers’ lucid explanation of them — long before they were revealed on-air. I am more an ideas guy than a numbers guy. 
On Tuesday night, the numbers were so overwhelming it was clear that the FBI had nothing to do with the outcome of the presidential election. The numbers on Tuesday told a tale that needs to be related. What the FBI did and failed to do assaulted the rule of law, but that is for another column. 
Whatever the impression Trump may have given you — a carnival barker, a hero, a jerk, a courageous leader — he brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of millions of American men and women who believe they have been forgotten by the government they pay for. These good people have been alienated by the elites who dominate American government and culture and civic life. 
On Tuesday night, they found a home. 
The forgotten man believes that the Obama administration doesn’t care about him. The forgotten man knows that the government put into place regulations of economic activity that put him out of work or into a lower-paying job. These forgotten men and women resent the Obama administration’s telling them they must have health insurance or they will be taxed for it and then so incompetently manipulating the marketplace as to cause the cost of that insurance — often an unwanted product — to skyrocket. 
These good folks cringed when their family doctor told them that he could no longer afford to treat them because the feds had overregulated the practice of medicine. They simply couldn’t believe that their own government would make the practice of medicine so expensive that doctors in droves could not afford to stay in business. And they were outraged when their doctors told them the feds could see their medical records and dictate their medical treatment. 
The forgotten man has profound resentment for a government that is telling him how to live. The forgotten man’s union dues have shot up. His union leaders use his dues to support political candidates he doesn’t know or like. Yet he has usually voted for the Democrats — out of a traditional belief that the Democrats would think of him and his needs when framing federal legislation. They haven’t. 
The forgotten man speaks his mind but isn’t drawn to lofty arguments about the freedom of speech. The forgotten man wants the government to work but couldn’t tell you which aspects of its behavior are unconstitutional. The forgotten man wants elected officials who don’t and won’t forget him. The forgotten man hopes he never sees a judge in a courtroom, but if he does, he wants to be judged by someone who understands him. 
The forgotten man wants sexual freedom and privacy, but not babies being ripped from the womb for convenience. The forgotten man doesn’t want war but loathes military defeat even more. The forgotten man wants inexpensive goods but will pay more if they are made here by people like him. The forgotten man doesn’t want the government to take so much money from those who work hard that they lose their incentive to work or close up their businesses and kill jobs. The forgotten man wants everyone to be able to keep the lion’s share of what he earns. The forgotten man forgives but doesn’t forget. Trump got all that. Trump tapped into all that as no presidential candidate had since Ronald Reagan in 1980. 
The forgotten man viewed Clinton as having no interest in him. The forgotten man believed that Clinton would work for special interests and not for him. The forgotten man saw that what Trump grasped, Clinton overlooked; what Trump understood, Clinton ignored; and what Trump turned into votes, Clinton took for granted. 
I doubt that the forgotten man saw what I did recently. At the Al Smith dinner in New York City last month — a 1,500-person black-tie fundraiser for the Archdiocese of New York at which Trump’s speech was mediocre and Clinton’s was stellar — I tried to shake the hands of both of them but ran into a Secret Service roadblock around the head table. Trump waved to me with a twinkle in his eye. When I saw Clinton, I saw a lonely face without joy. On Wednesday morning, it dawned on me that she was doomed and she knew it. 
The forgotten man knew it, as well.

4346,"Outrage: Pipeline Police Strip-Searched Native Girl, Threw Her Naked Into Cell","Comments 
As the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline continue to escalate, the crackdown from law enforcement has grown harsher and harsher. Hundreds have been arrested by Morton County police, many of them without charge, and have had their civil rights violated by shockingly cruel police officers, who are sexually humiliating their prisoners by strip-searching them and leaving them naked in their cells. 
When getting booked at the jail, they were all strip searched, forced to “squat and cough” to demonstrate they had nothing hidden in their rectums, then were put in orange jumpsuits. The treatment was the same for Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Dave Archambault, to a pediatrician from the reservation, Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, to actress Shailene Woodley, star of the films “Divergent” and “Snowden,” among others. 
The use of a strip search for those arrested on trumped-up charges like “trespassing” and “rioting” is a clear intimidation tactic that shows the the United States government still sees Native Americans as savages to be abused. 
LaDonna Brave Bull Allard told The Young Turks how her daughter was arrested, stripped of her clothes by three male and one female officer, and then left naked in a cell overnight. “They’re targeting our families” she said. Human rights abuses have been widely committed by police and security forces as they try to discourage the protesters. 
Rebecca Kemble, Alderwoman from Madison, Wisconsin, recounts how arrested protesters are beaten and thrown into pieces of the very pipeline they are protesting. “I saw the Marathon County deputy push her down the hill and slam her body and head into the transport van after this.” 
Georgianne Nienaber of the Huffington Post knows where to point the finger for these outrageous crimes. 
Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier is the official who sets the tone for police actions in Morton County North Dakota. He alone determines how prisoners are treated. He holds the authority to enforce humane treatment or encourage cruelty designed to instill fear, humiliation, embarrassment and shame. And shame is the ultimate weapon—utilized by the narcissist in a pitiful attempt to gain control and break the spirit of his victims. 
This kind of systematic violence is the way the U.S. government has always treated the native inhabitants of the American continent. Very little mainstream news coverage is documenting these crimes, instinctively taking the side of the corporation plotting to desecrate the sacred grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux in order to make a quick buck off of climate-warming and water-poisoning fossil fuels. We cannot allow the police state to squash the will of the people.

4347,ELECTION DAY QUESTION: Do You Want To Glow In The Dark?,"by Karl Denninger 
One final set of thoughts before you go out to vote today. 
There’s one major issue that got very little play during the campaign, as the media was hell-bent on focusing on Trump and bad words. 
If we all burn, that is on them — and you. But I assure you the press will fry up just like you will at 5,000 degrees. 
That issue is Syria. 
Hillary Clinton has committed herself to imposing a “no fly” zone over Syria. As I have pointed out on multiple occasions in this column there are two problems with that commitment. 
First, the Russians are in there at Syria’s invitation. They’re protecting Syria’s government at its request, exactly as we protected Kuwait at its request . They are therefore acting with the permission of the sovereign government of Syria, and we will not be. We will effectively be invading Syria. 
Second, Russia has missile systems deployed in Syria that we cannot reliably kill, and our aircraft and other flying equipment cannot reliably survive being fired upon by them either. While we can certainly find some of their batteries through intelligence and similar, and blow them up, doing so would be a clear act of war. If we do not do so then anything Russia does not want flying in the skies over Syria will not be flying. It will instead be in many pieces and any airmen inside said aircraft will be dead. 
Will Russia allow us to dictate that there will be a no-fly zone and allow us to enforce it? 
I doubt it. 
If we attempt to implement one anyway then conflict is inevitable. This is a conflict that has not happened thus far in the nuclear age between superpowers. Oh sure, there’s been a plane forced down here and one shot down there, along with plenty of harassment, along with various proxy wars where this party or that was supplying arms to one side or the other (e.g. Afghanistan) but an actual face-off and exchange between US and Russian forces has never occurred. 
Once it happens, if it does, then someone will of course believe they “won” and someone will believe they “lost.” The question will then be whether the side who believes it “lost” will admit to that and withdraw. 
If that side does not do so then we are facing nuclear war – a war that inherently involves the destruction of both nation’s infrastructure and large percentages of their respective populations. 
Hillary Clinton has said she intends to walk this path. We do not know whether Trump will; he hasn’t committed himself one way or the other. But his statements thus far tend to lead me, and many others, to believe he won’t try to interfere in Syria’s (or anyone else’s) sovereign affairs. In fact he’s made clear that he believes that we have had far too many foreign entanglements and they have not served us well. 
There’s no guarantee that a President Trump would not find some reason to intervene, of course, and thus no guarantee that we don’t ultimately wind up in the same place. Let’s face it — Syria is a mess, and one that Hillary Clinton had a large hand in creating. 
But the choice here is between someone who might get pressed into a situation that leads to armed conflict, possibly nuclear conflict, and someone who has a vested interest in continuing what she started, who has declared her intent to take an action that by definition will violate Syria’s sovereignty and, with near-certainty will lead to an exchange of weapons between the Syrian protectors, which are Russian, and the United States. 
That road has a high probability of being one way and at the end are events you will not like. 
Don’t vote to die — and kill your children. 
If you vote for Hillary you are in fact voting for nuclear war.",0
4348,Comment on 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks by The Most Important Concepts The Manosphere Taught Me,"Home This Month Popular 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks 4 Reasons Why Your Diet Sucks March 2, 2013 19 Comments Body 
1. You have no idea how much you are eating. 
Ever wonder why you can’t gain any muscle or lose any body fat? Well, the first place to look for the answer is your diet. Are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals? If you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn, whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn. There is no way around this simple fact. Even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem, I’m still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being “hardgainers” or “endomorphs.” Invest in a food scale and track your intake. It’s really not that hard. 
2. You are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take. 
This is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right. The hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money. Guys flock to supplements because it’s an easy fix. Instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire, they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead. Unfortunately, these shortcuts don’t exist. The only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place. 
3. You think you don’t have the time to eat healthy. 
A lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods. Guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work (or during their lunch break). The problem here is not one of time , but rather of priorities . Guys would rather sleep-in than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work. The bottom line is this: if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals. Ditch the excuses. 
4. You think there is one “best” diet for everyone 
I’ve been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone. I remember about 10 years ago people were losing their minds over The Atkins Diet. About 5 years later people moved on to The Paleo Diet, and now Intermittent Fasting is all the rage. New diets will always be on the horizon, which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the “best” will never end. I do not know what the “best” diet is. What I do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods, and acknowledging the importance of portion control, protein, fiber, and other important nutrients. Aside from these basics, whether you eat low carb or high carb, three meals a day or six meal, is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first. 
If you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there.",0
4349,NYT: Undocumented Student Denounces Free Speech on Immigration Policy,"November 7, 2016, 5:26 pm A+ | a- Oops! Please log in to use this feature. 
From the New York Times : 
By Juan Prieto 
ON CAMPUS NOV. 7, 2016 
BERKELEY, Calif. — Although the University of California, Berkeley, has some of the best resources in the country for undocumented students like me — in the form of financial and legal aid, for example — it’s been a tense couple of years, magnified by the anti-immigration build-a-wall language of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign. Berkeley’s Undocumented Student Program , which the university established in 2012, works with more than 400 undocumented students and continues to grow as more go public about their immigration status, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves and their families. 
But by coming out of the shadows, undocumented people open themselves to cruelty and threats. Last year, when I helped organize a campus protest to get the University of California to renew funding for some crucial programs for undocumented students, I was called an illegal leech who should be deported. I shrugged it off: I was proud of marching at Berkeley, where the Free Speech Movement started in the 1960s. 
But looking back, I think I should have made a bigger deal about the maliciousness I witnessed and saw building. A few months later, I received an anonymous email threatening to report my family and me to immigration agents. The threat included details about my actions during the protest — it seemed to be coming from someone who had seen me on campus. I was so disturbed I stopped attending classes, and even when I returned a week later, my anxiety kept me from engaging in class discussions or focusing on my studies. 
Soon after that, the Undocumented Student Program began to receive anonymous email threats about students, and a fellow undocumented friend — a prominent member of the student government — was told by another student on Facebook: “Thanks for identifying yourself as an illegal … Now get out. I’ll look for you on campus.” All of this information was brought to the administration, but there was no follow-up. 
I.e., the illegal alien is complaining there was no follow up against the American citizens for reporting the presence of illegal aliens. 
… This September, after a group of Trump supporters came onto campus to build a mock wall and spew racially charged talk about “illegals,” the undocumented students were told to draft a statement of inclusion as a response, and that perhaps certain departments would send it through their email listservs as a gesture of support. 
Administrators have said they are determined to earn our trust, but undocumented students on campus don’t want to be placated — we want our administrators to fully stand with us through actions and not just promises. After all, when posters with anti-Semitic language began to crop up around campus in late September, the associate chancellor took swift action by sending an email to all students condemning this language. 
Some argue that hateful displays of racism or anti-Semitism are different from the actions of those on campus who yell, “Build a wall!” But too often, hate speech toward immigrants in this country is written off as political opinion, and school administrators don’t want to side with one political group or another. However, this political issue happens to be our futures, in the country where we grew up. 
That’s why it was disheartening when Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system — and, it should be noted, the former head of the Department of Homeland Security — wrote, in a Boston Globe op-ed essay , that students must be willing to listen to not just opposing views, but offensive ones, for the sake of free speech. She did not condone hate speech — “that which is designed to personally intimidate or harass” — but wrote that exceptions to free speech should be “narrowly construed.” 
So many powerful college administrators across the country have made this argument now that I think they have no idea just how offensive speech has gotten, especially during this election. 
This is not to say that those with conservative opinions should be silenced. 
Jeb’s opinions on undocumented workers, for example, should not be silenced. 
But because it is often campus conservatives who complain of the scourge of political correctness, I think it is tempting for college administrators to rally behind conservative students, to see them as the new gadflies, the protectors of free speech. Yet it is comical to think that those of us with lesser rights are somehow infringing on those who have no fear of deportation. 
Juan Prieto is a senior at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Now, you might think that there’s something ungracious about an illegal alien denouncing America’s First Amendment. But — don’t you realize? — he’s Undocumented ? That makes him holier than you. Some topics, such as immigration policy, are therefore just too sacred to be discussed anywhere where there are undocumented workers, undocumented students, undocumented welfare recipients, or undocumented criminals, such as the United States. 
Personally, I’m an undocumented alumnus of Berkeley with an undocumented Ph.D. in physics and an undocumented Nobel Prize. For some reason, though, the King of Sweden wasn’t welcoming of me the last time I walked up on stage with my speech. “Not you again,” the king said. “ Garde !”

4350,Report: Jimmy Garoppolo Trade ‘Not Happening’ - Breitbart,"The Jimmy Garoppolo trade is starting to look like it might go down as the most   trade in NFL history to never happen. [According to Adam Schefter, via Pro Football Talk, the   Garoppolo trade is, “not happening. ” Now of course, this news could amount to nothing more than the Patriots putting prospective trade partners on notice, letting them know that their current offers don’t impress, and if they still want Garoppolo they need to get serious between now and Thursday night’s NFL Draft.  Or, maybe Belichick truly has no intention of parting with Garoppolo? Tom Brady will turn 40 just before the start of the preseason. If Belichick retains Garoppolo the Patriots will have, beyond doubt, the best quarterback situation in football with the best quarterback to ever play the game backed up by a guy who could start for over half the league. Should Brady get hurt this year, Belichick would still have a realistic shot at making a Super Bowl run with Garoppolo, everything else staying even. On the other hand, should Belichick trade Garoppolo, a Brady injury in all likelihood ends any realistic chance at winning a championship. Tom Curran of CSN New England says it will take multiple   picks for Belichick to reconsider trading Garoppolo. The most likely fit for Garoppolo would be the Browns, who have multiple   picks and a huge need for a quarterback. However, if the Patriots would consider spreading those   picks out over a couple years, there’s the chance that other teams could come into play. And, of course, since Belichick seems like the kind of guy who would like to watch Twitter break, there’s always the chance that he could pull off the most Belichick move of all time and trade Brady after this season, then promote Garoppolo. But he wouldn’t do that, would he? Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
4351,Trump’s Executive Order Mandates Government Reports on Honor Killings Committed by Migrants - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s executive order halting the importation of refugees from six   countries also includes a section requiring the government to publicly release information on crimes committed by foreign nationals, including honor killings of women. [This lets the government “be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest,” the order states. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions must work together to provide the public with a report on foreign nationals charged with and convicted of   offenses, including those who associate with or provide support to terrorist organizations.  The order also instructs the government to release information on  . The government will now track cases involving   individuals who commit “  violence against women,” or honor killings. Honor killings are a brutal practice wherein Muslim males will murder or mutilate female family members accused of bringing shame and dishonor to their families and Islam. Like female genital mutilation, it is a practice that would not exist in the U. S. without mass immigration bringing its practitioners into U. S. communities. “Cases of honor killings   violence in the U. S. are often unreported because of the shame it can cause to the victim and the victim’s family. Also, because victims are often young women, they may feel that reporting the crime to authorities will draw too much attention to the family committing the crime,” former U. S. government analyst Farhana Qazi explained to Fox News in November 2015. The order requires the government to release its inaugural report by September 2017, close to the sixteenth anniversary of the   terror attacks committed by Islamic foreign nationals admitted to the U. S. on various visas. Reports shall be issued every six months from then on. The transparency will likely increase the broad support Trump’s immigration policies enjoy. Typically, the government conceals or refuses to collect   statistics that reveal troubling consequences of mass immigration policies. A Feb. 8 Morning Consult poll found 55 percent of voters supported Trump’s executive order, including 82 percent of Republicans. Another McLaughlin  Associates poll release Feb. 8 found 57 percent support for a halt of refugee settlement to implement better screening procedures. A Rasmussen Reports poll released on Feb. 2 found 52 percent of voters favored a freeze on all refugee resettlement until the government could better screen out terrorists, including 57 percent of young voters.

4353,HAPPENING: FBI Reopens Case Against Aggro Granny After New Emails Discovered!,"Emails discovered during investigation of Jew Anthony Wiener sending dick pics to jailbait! 
HA! 
New York Times : 
Newly discovered emails from Hillary Clintonâs private server were found after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices once shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday. 
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case â one federal official said they numbered in the thousands â potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election. 
In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, and that they âappear to be pertinent to the investigation.â 
… 
âDirector Comeyâs letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant,â said John D. Podesta, chairman of Mrs. Clintonâs campaign. 
He added: âIt is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election.â 
Mrs. Clinton, arriving Friday in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, waved at members of the media gathered on the tarmac but ignored shouted questions. 
HA! 
She won’t even take questions! 
There was no damage control plan again – just like when she collapsed on 911! 
I’m not really sure how it makes sense that Weiner would have these on his phone, or why the FBI would seize the phone of his wife because he was sending dick pics to jailbait (unless he was using her phone to send them, lel) – but I’ve always said, Weiner is a funny Jew! 
I never thought he would turn-out to be this funny! 
Original article follows. tfw you just lost the game 
OH YES YOU READ THAT HEADLINE RIGHT, SIR. 
YESSIREE DOG. 
I knew James Comey was a pretty cool guy when a Negro in Congress asked him to investigate me and he was like “Yeah, dat nigga hot as a muffuggah. Watchoo want ah invesegate how much azz he be kickin in dem toobs? Get the fug outta here with that shit, dawg.” 
And now: total bro confirmed. 
RT : 
The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clintonâs private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. 
â In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent â to Clintonâs investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. â I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation. â 
The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesnât know how long that will take. 
Stocks fell after Comeyâs announcement, CNBC reported. 
More like the sky just fell. 
And underneath it we see Jesus Christ himself wearing a MAGA hat, smiling like a smug Pepe and whispering “lock her up.” Yo dawg, we heard you like America. So we sent Jesus Christ himself to make sure Donald Trump gets elected. 
Seriously, people. Even if you don’t necessarily believe in Christianity, you have to admit that this is some kind of divine miracle that just happened here. 
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. 
âNow that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,â he said in a statement. âThe American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.â 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September. 
In mid-October, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, promised at least âfour new hearingsâ after Congress returns from recess in November based on the new emails, which lawmakers received but have not been made public. 
“This is a flashing red light of potential criminality,” Chaffetz said. 
The new evidence points to a âquid pro quoâ arrangement between the FBI and the State Department, he noted. 
Welp. 
That’s it. 
It’s over. 
There is just no way with an open investigation hanging over her head, and the FBI openly stating that it is so severe they have to act immediately, that she can possibly be elected. 
I do understand that there is no evidence that Hillary’s own people care if she is a criminal or not when it comes to polling, but this seriously demoralizes them, making them much less likely to vote. At the same time, it is a massive morale boost to the Republicans who aren’t necessarily on the Trump Train but hate Hillary, ensuring that they’ll go out and vote. 
Seriously guys. I did have my doubts. But this clears them up. We are 11 days away from the election. 
And this drops. 
And I guarantee Team Trump has something to drop next week. The Russian conspiracy might even be memed into reality and Putin might drop the hidden server. Assange still has something big. 
We won, guys. 
Honestly, I’ve got tears in my eyes right now.

4354,Trump SCOTUS Nominee: ’2nd Amendment Protects an Individual’s Right’ - Breitbart,"President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States is Neil Gorsuch, a judge on the United State Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit who has written that “the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right. ”[Gorsuch wrote this in the opinion for United States v.  . A facts page summarizing Gorsuch’s positions contains his full statement, which says the Supreme Court has held that “the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own firearms and may not be infringed lightly. ”  He also wrote that there is “a long tradition of widespread gun ownership by private individuals in this country. ” It is worth remembering that Trump pledged to nominate a justice “in the mold of Scalia,” and a SCOTUSblog entry for January 13, 2017, indicates he may have done just that. Here’s an excerpt from the the entry: The great compliment that Gorsuch’s legal writing is in a class with Scalia’s is deserved: Gorsuch’s opinions are exceptionally clear and routinely entertaining he is an unusual pleasure to read, and it is always plain exactly what he thinks and why. Like Scalia, Gorsuch also seems to have a set of   commitments apart from his personal policy preferences that drive his  . He is an ardent textualist (like Scalia) he believes criminal laws should be clear and interpreted in favor of defendants even if that hurts government prosecutions (like Scalia) he is skeptical of efforts to purge religious expression from public spaces (like Scalia) he is highly dubious of legislative history (like Scalia) and he is less than enamored of the dormant commerce clause (like Scalia). The  ’s Chris Cox responded to the nomination of Gorsuch, saying, “President Trump has made an outstanding choice in nominating Judge Gorsuch for the U. S. Supreme Court. He has an impressive record that demonstrates his support for the Second Amendment. We urge the Senate to swiftly confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, just as it did in confirming him to the U. S.

The all-conquering Americans last night tightened their grip on the baseball World Series, leaving 195 other countries trailing in their wake. 
This time it was the turn of the Chicago Cubs to reinforce America’s total domination of the series by beating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 on a thrilling night for their millions of fans worldwide. 
Since it’s inception in 1903, no other country has come close to the world title as the American baseball juggernaut has rumbled over all-comers. 
One of the first to congratulate the triumphant American team was presidential hopeful, Donald Trump, who spoke to reporters from Florida where he is currently on the campaign trail. 
Forming an “o” with his thumb and forefinger and moving his hand up and down, Trump told reporters: “This is a tremendous win for America. It’s just tremendous. 
“In fact, if I were to try to tell you how tremendous this is, you wouldn’t believe me. Under my presidency, this sort of tremendous event would be happening all the time. 
“You would all be so proud. So proud. So proud of me and proud of your country. I can’t tell you how proud you would be because you wouldn’t believe me. 
“However, under Hillary, none of these tremendous achievements would happen. Hillary is a crook who belongs in jail. She is not tremendous, and I will jail her. Jail…is…where…she…belongs!”

On Sunday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein—an endorsement she had been working toward for years. As was revealed by Wikileaks, Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation. On October 24, 2013, Clinton told Goldman Sachs that Dodd-Frank had to be done mostly for “political reasons” because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis. She said, “There’s nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works?

4357,Populist Anger Upends Politics on Both Sides of the Atlantic - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   From Brussels to Berlin to Washington, leaders of the Western democratic world awoke Friday morning to a blunt,   rebuke delivered by the flinty citizens of a small island nation in the North Atlantic. Populist anger against the established political order had finally boiled over. The British had rebelled. Their stunning vote to leave the European Union presents a political, economic and existential crisis for a bloc already reeling from entrenched problems. But the     message is hardly limited to Britain. The same yawning gap between the elite and mass opinion is fueling a populist backlash in Austria, France, Germany and elsewhere on the Continent  —   as well as in the United States. The symbolism of   insurrection was rich on Friday: Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and embodiment of American fury, happened to be visiting Britain. “Basically, they took back their country,” Mr. Trump said  Friday morning from Scotland, where he was promoting his golf courses. “That’s a good thing. ” Asked where public anger was greatest, Mr. Trump said: “U. K. U. S. There’s plenty of other places. This will not be the last. ” Even as the European Union began to grapple with a new and potentially destabilizing period of political uncertainty, the British vote also will inevitably be seized upon as further evidence of deepening public unease with the global economic order. Globalization and economic liberalization have produced winners and losers  —   and the big “Leave” vote in economically stagnant regions of Britain suggests that many of those who have lost out are fed up. Time and again, the European Union has navigated political crises during the past decade with a    response that has maintained the status quo and the bloc’s lumbering forward momentum toward greater integration  —   without directly confronting the roiling public discontent beneath the surface. But now the question is whether the dam has broken: Before breakfast on Friday,   leaders in France and the Netherlands were rejoicing and demanding similar referendums on European Union membership. “Victory for liberty!” declared the   French leader Marine Le Pen, writing on Twitter, who changed her profile picture to an image of the Union Jack. From its outset, the European Union was a project of elites, one that, at times, moved forward without a clear popular mandate from the masses. Adopting the common currency was deeply controversial in some places, including Germany. The issue of democratic legitimacy has always hung over the unification project, since many significant steps were achieved through treaties that stirred considerable resistance in some countries. European unity remained popular, particularly as the bloc delivered undeniable economic and social progress. But the class frictions beneath the project worsened in the past decade, as the European economy has been battered by recession and an uneven recovery. It is not clear whether the message is getting through to more establishment leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, or what lessons they are taking from the shock of the British exit. Perhaps the liberal Democrats in the House who staged a clamorous   Wednesday night in Washington, while part of the system themselves, were channeling the populist anger of the American left in their willingness to break the rules to make a point about the need for gun control. In Brussels, many member governments appear divided between an instinct to respond to the British referendum vote by driving for greater integration among Germany, France and other core members of the bloc and a willingness to moderate their ambitions in recognition of public opposition. European leaders were under pressure to reassure the European public, and the world, that the bloc was not at risk of unraveling. For decades, the European Union had moved forward, always expanding in size and influence. Britain has now reversed that trend. “We’re completely in uncharted territory,” said Hans Kundnani, a   expert in European politics at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Mr. Kundnani said the British vote exposed a contradiction at the core of the European project. European leaders define success as steering member states toward greater political and economic integration. And many of the bloc’s inefficiencies and dysfunctions can be traced to the unfinished work of strengthening European institutions and achieving greater integration between member states in areas such as banking, finance, security and defense. But public opinion is deeply skeptical of this “more Europe” agenda.   populist leaders have stoked public anxieties and resurgent nationalism by lashing out against immigrants, while portraying the European capital, Brussels, as a bastion of political elites out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people.   populists have demanded a   of the neoliberal economics of free trade and limited regulation, while resisting efforts to deconstruct the social democratic welfare state. “The E. U. robs us of our money, our identity, our democracy, our sovereignty,” said Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch   Party for Freedom. “The elites want more E. U. They think they know better than the people. They look down on the people and want to decide in their place. They want us to be ruled by undemocratic, unaccountable bureaucrats in a faraway place like Brussels. ” And permeating everything is the weak Continental economy and the crippling debt burden across Southern Europe. “The E. U. is kind of trapped,” Mr. Kundnani said. “On the one hand, the instinct will be to move ahead with further integration and reassure the rest of the world that the European Union is not unraveling. But that is very difficult because of the fault lines that exist. ” He added: “They are trapped because moving ahead is very difficult. Moving backwards is the last thing they want to do. And the status quo is unsustainable. ” Britain has always been a skeptical member of the European household. During the 1990s, Britain chose to keep the pound and not to join the countries sharing a common European currency, the euro. Many of the British concerns about the euro proved true, undermining the bloc’s credibility, even as Britain has remained mostly insulated against the Continent’s still unresolved euro crisis. Before the referendum, some European officials portrayed Britain as an idiosyncratic case that should not be seen as a bellwether for the Continent. But that is a hard argument to make. In France, Ms. Le Pen’s   National Front party is experiencing steadily rising popularity as the country prepares for national elections next year. In Germany, the   Alternative for Germany polled strongly in recent state elections.   leaders in Hungary and Poland are hostile to immigrants, while critics say the governments of those countries are also rewriting national laws to undermine democratic checks and balances. In Italy, the   Five Star Movement scored major victories last Sunday by winning mayoral elections in Turin and, more important, in the capital, Rome. Donald Tusk, one of the European Union’s top leaders, has started to talk about the risks facing the political establishment. At a speech last month before Europe’s coalition of   political parties, Mr. Tusk cautioned his fellow political elites. “Obsessed with the idea of instant and total integration, we failed to notice that ordinary people, the citizens of Europe, do not share our ” said Mr. Tusk, the president of the European Council, which comprises the heads of state of all the 28 member states in the bloc. “Disillusioned with great visions of the future, they demand that we cope with the present reality better than we have been doing until now. ” Yet taking action may be difficult, since most analysts say the European Union is paralyzed by the coming national elections in 2017 in France and Germany, the two most powerful countries in the bloc. Neither the French nor the German government is eager to endorse sweeping initiatives for more European integration before the elections out of fear of a populist whipping at the polls. “Europe is very divided and the main European country, Germany, has no will or skills to lead the union  —   and is approaching important national elections,” said Lucio Caracciolo, the editor of the Italian geopolitical magazine Limes. “France is a country in crisis, while Italy has its own problems. I can’t see who would assume a European leadership capable of producing a deeper integration process. ” He added: “There is a very widespread rejection of politics everywhere. There is a similar mood in the United States, an antipolitical sentiment. ” Few industries in Britain are likely to be more directly hit than the financial services industry in London. Damon Hoff, a hedge fund manager, said that he had voted to stay in the European Union, but that he understood the sentiments of those who had voted to leave. “Europeans don’t feel more prosperous,” he said. “Europeans don’t feel more empowered. And certainly the British don’t. ” He added: “You want to be part of something that continuously evolves. Does the European Union feel like it is evolving? No. ”",0
4359,"After Obama Push for Clemency, Hints of Reversal Likely to Come - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Obama is on pace to be the first president in decades to leave office with a federal prison population that is smaller than when he was sworn in, a reflection of eight years of liberal criminal justice policies, historically low crime rates and an aggressive use of presidential commutations. Mr. Obama granted clemency to 79 federal prisoners on Tuesday, bringing his total to more than 1, 000 inmates, most of whom were serving lengthy prison terms under strict sentences imposed at the height of the war on drugs. An additional 13, 000 people have been released early by the courts, the Justice Department said. But looming over the announcement was the fact that   Donald J. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, strongly opposed Mr. Obama’s liberal approach to criminal justice. Mr. Sessions favors vigorous enforcement of drug laws and the use of mandatory minimum sentences. Some of Mr. Obama’s criminal justice legacy is easily undone. Justice Department policies that discourage seeking mandatory minimum sentences by default, for instance, can be torn up. But other changes, such as new sentencing guidelines, will have a lasting effect and will be difficult to reverse, regardless of the administration. “I can’t speak to what the next president is going to do,” W. Neil Eggleston, the White House counsel, told reporters. “I can’t speak to whether the next administration will have a similar level of enthusiasm. ” Mr. Obama’s announcement highlights a fundamental disagreement between the departing and incoming administrations about the role that stiff penalties should play in the criminal justice system. Mr. Obama and those who have led his Justice Department regard long mandatory prison sentences for drug crimes to be an outdated legacy of the war on drugs, and one that disproportionately hurt minorities. Mr. Sessions, a former federal prosecutor, credits strict enforcement for today’s low crime rates. “I was there when we had the revolving doors in the ’60s and ’70s,” he said in 2015. “We, as a nation, turned against that. We’ve created a system that requires certainty and punishment, swifter trials. And the result is a very great drop in the crime rate. ” President Jimmy Carter was the last president to leave office with a smaller federal prison population than he inherited, according to Justice Department figures. Since then, the prison population has ballooned into the world’s largest, with about one in every 100 adults locked up in local, state or federal prisons or jails. In 2010, Congress unanimously voted to reduce the sentencing disparity between crimes involving crack cocaine and those involving powder cocaine. Crack cocaine was disproportionately prevalent in   neighborhoods, while powder cocaine was favored by more affluent white users, leading to a sentencing imbalance that cut along lines of race and class. Mr. Sessions was an early supporter of legislation to correct that difference. But he adamantly opposed a subsequent bill, which died, that would have reduced mandatory minimum sentences for some drug crimes. In 2013, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote a memo to federal prosecutors, telling them not to bring charges involving mandatory minimum sentences in cases pertaining to   nonviolent drug crimes. Prosecutors have responded by reducing the frequency of those charges by about 25 percent, the Justice Department said. “You don’t just try to hammer everybody for as long as you can because you can,” Sally Q. Yates, the deputy attorney general, said on Tuesday. “Your obligation as a prosecutor is to look at the individual’s conduct. ” Inside the Justice Department, there is wide speculation that the next attorney general will withdraw Mr. Holder’s memo. Mr. Obama has taken an interest in the issue and has used his clemency power to free people jailed for drug crimes. Typically, those prisoners would be eligible for release if sentenced under today’s standards. Mr. Obama has written personal letters to the inmates, telling them he believed they could turn their lives around. “He is committed to using his clemency power in ways not seen in the modern era,” Mr. Eggleston said. “Our nation is a nation of second chances. ” While Mr. Obama’s commutations are the most   examples of people getting out of prison early, they represent only a small fraction of those who have been freed under changes made by the Sentencing Commission, which in 2014 voted to retroactively reduce sentences for people convicted of certain drug crimes. That move, which the Obama administration supported, made thousands of people eligible for early release. In the nation’s courtrooms, judges have been freeing prisoners, often with the Justice Department’s consent. More than 13, 000 people have been freed so far, according to the Justice Department, and 29, 000 others have been resentenced. “We want sentences that are just and proportional,” Ms. Yates said. “That means we should sentence people in ways that will be fair, that will punish people for their crimes and that will serve as a deterrent. But we shouldn’t keep people in prison longer than is necessary. ” Taken together, the push for clemency and resentencing sends a message that the government is willing to address unfairness in the criminal justice system, said Caroline Platt, a federal public defender in Virginia. “It says the system can recognize its own excesses and try to correct them,” she said. Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Sessions has said which policies they will continue. But in two decades in the Senate, Mr. Sessions has made it clear repeatedly that he sees mandatory minimum sentences and tough enforcement as critical to reducing crime. “There still remains in this country a limited number of people who will rob, rape, shoot and kill you. There’s not that many,” Mr. Sessions said in 2004. “You identify those, and they serve longer periods of time, you’ll have a reduction in crime in America. And that’s what happened. The federal government adopted a tough mandatory sentencing policy without parole. ”",0
4360,"OCTOBER GUN SALES SEE MASSIVE SPIKE, SET YET ANOTHER RECORD","Home › GUNS › OCTOBER GUN SALES SEE MASSIVE SPIKE, SET YET ANOTHER RECORD OCTOBER GUN SALES SEE MASSIVE SPIKE, SET YET ANOTHER RECORD 0 SHARES 
[11/1/16] The FBI’s background check system for gun sales processed more than 2.3 million checks in October, setting an all-time record for the month. 
There were 2,333,539 gun-related checks processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS, last month, according to FBI documents posted on Monday. That represents an increase of more than 350,000 checks over the previous October, itself a record. It’s also the 18th month in a row to set a record. 
With two months to go, 2016 has already seen 22,206,233 NICS checks, making it the second highest year for checks in the history of NICS with only 2015 seeing more . 
NICS checks are considered to be one of the most accurate indicators for gun sales because nearly all sales made through federally licensed firearm dealers require a check by law. The number of NICS checks in a month do not represent an exact count of gun sales for a number of reasons. For instance, many states require a NICS checks for those applying for gun carry permits, and many states do not require NICS checks for sales between private parties. 
“These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS,” the FBI said. “They do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale.” Post navigation",0

In plain English, he explains that he has “solid reason” to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: “If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.” 
In other words, he’s not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he’s also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! 
This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, “We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we’re a credible news organization.” 
You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we’ve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won’t even fire Tucker for this admission. He’ll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? 
It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? 
Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) 
It’s not just AP, either. It’s the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: They’re all liars and crooks, and they’re all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser. SF Source Dreamcatcher Nov. 2016 Share this:",0
4363,Let’s Not Kid Ourselves… What Hillary Clinton Did Is a Federal Crime,"This is not a close call.
It is not a judgement call.
It is not subject to interpretation.
It is a flat-out criminal offense. 
As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton routinely asked her maid to print out sensitive government e-mails and documents — including ones containing classified information — from her house in Washington, DC, e-mails and FBI memos show. But the housekeeper lacked the security clearance to handle such material.
In fact, Marina Santos was called on so frequently to receive e-mails that she may hold the secrets to E-mailgate — if only the FBI and Congress would subpoena her and the equipment she used.
It is a crime to knowingly, say much less intentionally, give access to classified information to someone who is not cleared to receive and handle it.
Santos also had access to a highly secure room called an SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility) that diplomatic security agents set up at Whitehaven, according to FBI notes from an interview with Abedin.
From within the SCIF, Santos — who had no clearance — “collected documents from the secure facsimile machine for Clinton,” the FBI notes revealed.
Just how sensitive were the papers Santos presumably handled? The FBI noted Clinton periodically received the Presidential Daily Brief — a top-secret document prepared by the CIA and other US intelligence agencies — via the secure fax. 
This is a second and even more serious federal crime. 
The PDB is one of the most-seriously classified (top secret) documents routinely prepared for the President; it contains up to the minute information relating to various events and activities all over the world.
It is also a crime to allow, through negligence or worse, intentional act, someone who is not cleared to have access to a SCIF.
There is no possible argument that Hillary can raise of “retroactive” classification; that is, material that wasn’t classified at the time she handed it, when it comes to the PDB since those are always classified.
That the FBI knew about this months ago, which is now a documented fact, and did not demand that Hillary be charged with myriad federal offenses related to said intentional and knowing conduct that threatened our national security is an outrage.
The FBI has now proved that it is not a law enforcement agency but in fact it is a rogue band of armed thugs acting in direct support of a person who they know has repeatedly and willingly, on a daily basis, violated long-standing Federal Law and in fact have documented in writing that she violated those laws and yet they have intentionally and knowingly refused to act to bring her to justice .
The FBI has documented in its own writing that it is an equally-guilty party to Hillary Clinton’s willful and intentional violation of federal law as it pertains to the handling of classified information on a literal daily basis and thus can no longer be treated as a legitimate law enforcement or investigative agency by the people of the United States.
It does not matter what James Comey says; we are supposed to be a nation of laws and our Constitutional Republican form of government demands nothing less. When you declare a willingness to allow someone to violate the law with impunity you, and everyone who allows you in that position of authority to do so stand with them and in direct opposition to the Constitution of the United States.

4364,How Do You Say ‘Hashtag’ or ‘Shaming’ in Ancient Hebrew? - The New York Times,"Israelis pride themselves on the revival of ancient Hebrew, which had not been widely spoken for almost two millenniums before the Zionist movement that led to the state’s founding in 1948. It is a binding part of the identity in a nation built by immigrants. But despite the richness of the language, this   nation can find itself at a loss for contemporary terms. The venerated Academy of the Hebrew Language is always working to update a vocabulary inscribed on parchment for the digital era. Among the academy’s latest crop, announced on Twitter this month, were Hebrew words for shaming (“biyush,” an outgrowth of an existing verb, to shame) hashtag (“tag hakbatza”  —   literally, group tag) and big data (“netunei atek”). Israel’s health minister recently made some enemies in the   industry when he came up with his own word for junk food: “McDonald’s. ” The academy offered an alternative: “zlolet”  —   a combination of “zlila,” or gluttony, and “zol,” which means cheap. The experts also seek public comment, as in a recent plea for a new word to replace “peripheria,” from the English periphery, used to refer to geographical areas or socioeconomic groups that, the academy said, “are not central, or are far from the center. ” In general Israeli parlance, “peripheria” is often a synonym for governmental neglect. People were asked to vote online for or against the academy’s suggestion: “shula,” derived from the word for margin. But Israelis overwhelmingly disapproved, noting that this term had the same negative connotations, and suggested alternatives. The most popular were variations on the word “heikef,” denoting scope or girth. Even for   correct grammar and pronunciation can be a matter of dispute or guesswork since Hebrew is mostly written without “nikkud,” or vowel signs. The academy says it receives more than 1, 300 queries a month from people working in government, the military and the legal system, and from teachers, translators, poets and even children. Some are hoping to win a bet about correct usage. Others are seeking help drafting invitations for happy occasions  —   or, conversely, crafting inscriptions for tombstones.",0
4365,President Obama's Latest Scapegoat for the Obamacare Implosion is Nothing Short of Absurd,"Getty - Saul Loeb The Wildfire is an opinion platform and any opinions or information put forth by contributors are exclusive to them and do not represent the views of IJR. 
With ObamaCare premiums set to soar in some states by more than 50% in 2017, Barack Obama and the Democrats are busting their butts to blame anyone and everything they can for the staggering increases and unpopularity of the so-called 'Affordable' Care Act. 
On Monday, ObamaCare architect Ezekiel Emanuel and CNN blamed Republicans for the price hikes, with Emanuel actually saying they're “not a big increase.” 
Thursday afternoon, Obama came up with a new scapegoat: the media . THE MEDIA. — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) October 27, 2016 
Some would argue that the so-called 'mainstream media' has carried Obama's water for eight years. Yet, they're to blame for the ObamaCare trainwreck? Yup. 
Obama told more than 25,000 volunteers on a White House call: 
""We're not going to get that much help from the media. This is going to be a ground game. 
There is a faction of people who are continually trying to root for failure, despite the fact that we keep on insuring people and folks continue to get help."" 
That “faction of people” is a majority of Americans, by the way. Here's what a recent Gallup poll found: 
51% disapprove of the law; 44% approve 
18% say it has helped their families; 29% say it has hurt them 
Long term, most Americans believe it will hurt or not make a difference 
Anyway, Obama told the volunteers that they'll have to help him “clear the mud off the windshield” to get people to sign up— mud presumably put there by the media. 
Speaking of the media, Townhall's Guy Benson and The Daily Caller's Derek Hunter were a bit 'skeptical' of Obama's charge: The press is sending those premium hike letters, canceling people's plans, and forcing insurers out of the exchanges?? Wow! ???? #whining https://t.co/0b2ffrdX7I — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) October 28, 2016 Yesterday it was Republicans' fault, now it's the media. Total number of media and Republicans who voted for/had any input in Obamacare = 0. https://t.co/rGjeM95bL4 — Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) October 28, 2016 
As were other Twitterers: Oh. I guess the press wrote a dumpster fire law, passed it with trickery in the middle of night, after lying about it. Interesting take. https://t.co/kvVjLaIKZT ",0
4366,Le datsan d’Aguinskoïé : plongée au cœur du bouddhisme russe,"Le datsan d'Aguinskoïé : plongée au cœur du bouddhisme russe Aguinskoïé est un petit village situé au sud du kraï de Transbaïkalie (près de 5 000 km à l'est de Moscou), bordé par le lac Baïkal à l'ouest et la Mongolie au sud. Quand on demande aux habitants s'ils considèrent que le village se trouve en Sibérie, ils répondent résolument : « Non, c'est le kraï de Transbaïkalie ». En Transbaïkalie, l'originalité régionale et la proximité de l'Orient transparaissent de toutes parts : dans le tintement délicat des clochettes qui enveloppe le datsan d'Aguinskoïé pour s'envoler vers les cimes des pins. Dans le vent poussiéreux qui se promène dans la steppe aux odeurs d'herbe séchée. Dans l'arôme des buuz frais (grands raviolis) de mouton, qui pénètre dans les rues du village à travers les portes des cafés. Pour la plupart des habitants de la Sibérie, Aguinskoïé est un point inconnu sur la carte. En revanche, pour les Bouriates, qui représentent la majorité de la population locale, ainsi que pour les bouddhistes de Transbaïkalie, mais aussi de Bouriatie, de la République de l'Altaï, de Mongolie et du Touva, Aguinskoïé est une maison où les anciens préservent les légendes et rites nationaux. Une maison où il est facile de prier et où l'on revient après de longs voyages. 1 Un endroit sous les pins « On nous laissera rentrer dans le datsan ? C'est tout de même un monastère, un lieu fermé. Les lamas voudront-ils nous rencontrer ? » , demandé-je à mon guide à l'entrée du datsan d'Aguinskoïé. « Certainement. Dans le bouddhisme, le lama est un enseignant, c'est le sens du mot en tibétain. On considère que le lama doit répondre aux questions et apporter conseil à tous ceux qui s'adressent à lui. Peu importe s'il s'agit d'un bouddhiste, d'un chrétien ou d'un représentant d'un autre culte » , répond mon compagnon Daba Dabaïev, lama, photographe et voyageur. Nous entrons dans le datsan d'Aguinskoïé, l'un des plus anciens de Sibérie : il a plus de 200 ans. Le père de Daba Dabaïev l'a amené au datsan d'Aguinskoïé dès qu'il a terminé le collège. Daba a d'abord étudié à l'Académie du datsan, à la faculté de philosophie bouddhiste, puis, en troisième année, il a opté pour la faculté de peinture avant de travailler ensuite comme photographe au datsan. Il a 30 ans. « Je suis arrivé ici à l'âge de 14 ans et je ne comprenais pas bien ce qu'était un datsan, ce qu'était le bouddhisme. La première année, je voulais fuir. J'avais beaucoup de cours, beaucoup de travail, il fallait obéir aux lamas plus âgés et exécuter leurs ordres, c'est la règle. Je rentrais à la maison pour les vacances, je ressentais une liberté que je n'oublierai sans doute jamais et pensais : « Je suis chez moi ! ». Deux ans plus tard, en arrivant en Khakassie, je me surprenais à penser : « Vivement que je rentre au datsan ». C'est ma maison » . Nous sommes installés dans le dougan (temple dans le bouddhisme tibétain, ndlr) le plus ancien et le plus beau du datsan d'Aguinskoïé, le dougan Devajine. Il est entouré de rangées de pins et de tambours sacrés qui contiennent entre cent et quatre cent mille prières. Les bouddhistes laïcs et les lamas du monastère tournent ces tambours dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre, c'est l'une des formes de prière. À l'intérieur, le dougan est décoré de tableaux de Koless Sansara, de portraits de lamas respectés persécutés dans les années 1930 et d'une statue dorée de Bouddha. On ressent les traditions tibétaines, mais comme les premiers dougans furent bâtis par des maçons et charpentiers russes, des éléments de l'architecture russe sont également présents. Par exemple, les grandes fenêtres grillagées rappellent celles des terems (palais en bois, ndlr) des contes avec la lueur du jour tombant sur le plancher par taches de lumière chaude. Le musée régional d'Aguinskoïé porte le nom du chercheur orientaliste et voyageur Gombojab Tsybikov (1873 – 1930). Cet habitant d'un petit village bouriate aida en 1905 la revue National Geographic à se relever économiquement et à regagner sa notoriété mondiale. En 1899, Tsybikov part en mission de recherche pour la Société russe de géographie au Tibet central, dans sa capitale fermée Lhassa. À l'époque, aucun étranger à l'exception des citoyens chinois et mongols n'a le droit de se rendre au Tibet, ainsi Tsybikov voyage déguisé en pèlerin. La direction de la Société russe de géographie équipe le Bouriate d'une caméra portative Self-Worker, d'objectifs anastigmats Hertz et de plaques anglaises de la marque Empress. La photographie étant passible de la peine de mort dans la capitale tibétaine, Tsybikov utilise une ruse : il cache sa caméra dans le tambour portatif de prière qu'il garde tout le temps sur lui. En 1905, la revue National Geographic publie un reportage sur le Tibet. Gombojab Tsybikov et son collègue Ovche Norzounov, qui photographiait également Lhassa même en avoir averti Tsybikov, offrent les images à la revue. Au début du XXe siècle, parier sur la photographie assortie d'un petit texte est nouveau pour la revue. Cette décision s'avère payante : la revue peut ainsi survivre en temps de crise et trouve son style de présentation. Baigné par cette lumière, Daba est installé sur un banc et égrène le chapelet bouddhiste entre ses mains. Il porte une veste urbaine bordeaux dont la couleur rappelle en tout point la veste des lamas en peau de mouton. Daba voyage beaucoup à travers la Sibérie, mais reste toujours rattaché intérieurement, et même extérieurement, à sa maison, le datsan : en traversant les portes du temple pour sortir dans le grand monde, un lama reste toujours lama. 2 Coucher de soleil sur le bas-côté « Quitter Aguinskoïé ou partir en voyage ne veut pas dire qu'on rompt le lien avec nos racines , estime Daba. Le Dalaï Lama dit que pour atteindre la paix intérieure absolue et le bonheur, on doit se rendre dans un endroit qu'on ne connaît pas au moins une fois par an. Ainsi, le cerveau pourra évoluer ». Nous sommes installés avec Daba et son ami photographe et opérateur Boulat dans un café en bord de route et dégustons de délicieux buuz de beauf haché, plat national des Bouriates. Daba et Boulat parcourent depuis plusieurs années leur région natale et font des reportages et des films pour leur chaîne Travelman. Leur dernière réalisation est le court-métrage de fiction Nuusa ( « secret » en bouriate). « Les amis qui sont partis me demandent parfois : « Pourquoi restes-tu à Aguinskoïé ? Pars au plus vite, tant que tu n'es pas recouvert de racines » , raconte Boulat. Mais on ne peut pas fuir ses problèmes, tout est à l'intérieur de l'homme. Il faut voyager et regarder le monde alentour, mais il faut aussi savoir trouver l'inspiration pour travailler au datsan d'Aguinskoïé. Nous la trouvons ». Auteur : Anna Grouzdeva",0
4367,Bahrain’s Rajab hospitalized due to heart condition,"Persian Gulf Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab 
Prominent Bahraini human rights campaigner Nabeel Rajab has been taken to hospital from prison due to heart problems after being held in solitary confinement for three months. 
In a post on his Twitter account, his son, Adam, said that his father was transferred for the third time to a police hospital after suffering from chest pain. 
The 52-year-old president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights has been repeatedly detained for organizing pro-democracy demonstrations and publishing Twitter posts deemed “insulting” to the Bahraini authorities. 
He was pardoned for health reasons last year, but was re-arrested on June 13 following an intensive search of his house in the northwest of the country. Reports suggest he has been subjected to harassment in jail. 
Thousands of anti-regime protesters have held numerous demonstrations in Bahrain on an almost daily basis ever since a popular uprising began in the kingdom on February 14, 2011. 
They are demanding that the Al Khalifah dynasty relinquish power and a just system representing all Bahrainis be established. 
On March 14, 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were deployed to Bahrain to assist the Manama government in its crackdown on peaceful protesters. 
Scores of people have lost their lives and hundreds of others sustained injuries or got arrested as a result of the Al Khalifah regime’s crackdown on anti-regime activists. Loading ...",0
4368,Another one bites the dust: Third USAF weather satellite breaks up in orbit,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:45 UTC © Lockheed An artist’s illustration of a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellite in orbit. A third U.S. Air Force weather satellite that launched more than 20 years ago has broken up in orbit, Air Force Space Command disclosed Monday evening. Air Force officials confirmed the breakup of the long-retired Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 12 satellite (DMSP F-12) after the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, detected an additional object orbiting alongside the 22-year-old satellite . DMSP F-12, which the Air Force retired from service in 2008, had the same battery assembly that was implicated in the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13. While both satellites were built by Lockheed Martin and launched less than a year apart, DMSP F-13 was still in service when it suffered its breakup, producing nearly 150 pieces of debris . DMSP F-12, in contrast, was shut down in 2008 — a process that entails burning off the satellite's remaining fuel, releasing compressed gasses, and discharging the battery. The Air Force said Monday evening it was tracking just one piece of debris associated with DMSP F-12's breakup. Properly shutting down a DMSP satellite at the end of its service life is no guarantee that it won't suffer a catastrophic breakup, however. In 2004, a 13-year-old DMSP spacecraft, dubbed DMSP-F11, broke apart and produced 56 pieces of cataloged space debris, even though it had been taken out of service and gone through the normal end-of-life showdown procedures . Following the February 2015 breakup of DMSP F-13 , the Air Force said a total of nine DMSP satellites launched between 1982 and 1997 all had the same failure-prone battery assembly. At the time, only seven were still in orbit. With the breakup of DMSP F-12, that number is down to six. Of those, only one — DMSP F-14 — is still in service. The Air Force said determining the cause of DMSP F-12's breakup will be especially difficult since they have no telemetry from the long-silent satellite to help assess the incident. The Air Force still has five DMSP satellites in service. The youngest, DMSP F-18, was launched in 2009. The oldest, DMSP F-14, was launched in 1997. In February, the DMSP suffered another setback when the Air Force lost the ability to command DMSP F-19 due to an onboard power failure. The satellite had been in orbit less than two years when the failure occurred. Comment: Are these satellites just falling to pieces because of bad design? Is someone using them as target practice? Or are some of them falling victim to the increase in space rocks penetrating our skies? (For example: Space rock collision? USAF satellite explodes in Earth orbit ) What exactly are these satellites used for? From Lockheed : Today, DMSP is still providing strategic and tactical weather prediction to aid the U.S. military in planning operations at sea, on land and in the air . The satellites, equipped with a sophisticated sensor suite, can: Image visible and infrared cloud cover Measure precipitation, surface temperature, and soil moisture Collect specialized global meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical information in all weather conditions",0
4369,"As Georgia Vote Nears, G.O.P. Asks if Ideological Purity Matters Anymore - The New York Times","ATLANTA  —   When Michael Fitzgerald, a local Republican leader, took a break from packing up the signs after a candidate forum here last week, he appeared momentarily flummoxed about the state of his party under President Trump. Early voting has already begun in a closely watched special House election to replace former Representative Tom Price, who became Mr. Trump’s health secretary, but in the suburbs north of Atlanta, few seem quite sure what exactly the party stands for now. “There are shades,” Mr. Fitzgerald finally said as he considered what it now meant to be a Republican. “Can I point to an individual and say, ‘Here’s your ideal conservative’?” He did not answer his own question, but he did not need to. Mr. Trump’s takeover of the Republican Party has blurred the   ideological distinctions that defined the right for the past eight years. Driven more by personal loyalty and a ravenous appetite to win than by any fixed political philosophy, the   president has been received warmly by some mainstream conservatives. At the same time, even ideological   who share the president’s pugilism but not his pragmatism have stuck by him because Mr. Trump has made the right enemies  —   and gleefully ridiculed them with public insults rarely heard from a president. These loyalties have upended the Tea    divide, which has dominated fratricidal primary seasons since 2010 but increasingly has the air of fins on the back of a car, a quaint relic from an earlier era. With Mr. Trump in charge, the political market for purity on the right has been devalued. “Because of the loyalty that the most conservative voters in our base have to Trump, there’s a pull there that’s scrambling the ideological lines,” said Andy Sere, a Republican ad man who has been heavily engaged in the party’s internecine wars. “He wants wins on the board, and that’s traditionally been the goal of the pragmatists. ” The shifting conservative fault lines are on display in the affluent and   northern suburbs of Atlanta, which were at the front end of the South’s political realignment in the 1970s when they turned away from their Democratic roots and elected a loquacious young college professor named Newt Gingrich to Congress. The special election on April 18 has drawn substantial attention because one of the Democrats running, Jon Ossoff, has raised a remarkable $8 million, and his success in a   district could presage a midterm backlash against Mr. Trump. (Voters will pick from candidates of both parties on a single ballot if no one clears 50 percent, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election.) But the way the Republican hopefuls are running is just as instructive. Even as they try to win over the sort of conservative activists dedicated enough to participate in a rare April election, the Republicans are casting themselves more as   pragmatists in the spirit of Mr. Trump than unwavering ideologues. At the forum and in individual interviews afterward, three of the Republicans in the   field invoked some variation of Ronald Reagan’s maxim that it is better to get 80 percent of what you want than nothing at all. Few embraced the Tea Party moniker. And none of the   candidates pledged to join the Freedom Caucus, the   conservative group whose uncompromising ideology helped derail Mr. Trump’s efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. One of the leading Republican candidates, Karen Handel, even wore her practicality as a badge of honor, citing not just Reagan but also Margaret Thatcher’s “relentless incrementalism” credo. “Republican voters are expecting that we get down to business and deliver and do the job,” said Ms. Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, failed Senate candidate and failed candidate for governor. This time around, she said, the expectations from the party base have shifted. Bob Gray, who calls himself an outsider and is a businessman supported by the conservative Club for Growth, played to type at the forum as he twice criticized Speaker Paul D. Ryan for having “failed” on the health care legislation. But in an interview, Mr. Gray allowed that he would have backed the   bill (which the Club for Growth opposed) shied away from the Tea Party label and sounded more like a   centrist than a   conservative. “This is the problem with D. C.,” he said. “Everybody has retreated to their political corners with a jersey on. We need people like President Trump who want to go to D. C. and change the way they do business. The American people are tired of the bickering. ” Such remarks from a Club for   candidate would have been jarring only three years ago, but one Tea Party leader here said the change was the inevitable result of last year’s presidential campaign. “The Republican primary voters rejected a purist ideologue when they chose Donald Trump over Ted Cruz,” said Debbie Dooley, chairwoman of the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots. Ms. Dooley’s frequently updated Facebook page is the stuff of a political scientist’s dreams, a nearly   look at the shifting sands of the Republican Party at the outset of the Trump era. “People began to want results, not platitudes,” Ms. Dooley said, conceding her own “evolution,” as she called it. “You still have some who are still purists, but the Trump train has left the station. ” Republican swords have been sheathed well beyond this House race. Nine Republican senators are up for   next year, but there is little talk of the sort of primaries that terrified Republican lawmakers and convulsed the party during President Barack Obama’s administration. What talk there is has come from Mr. Trump’s backers, and is based on a perceived lack of fidelity to the president rather than on any ideological apostasy. Nowhere has the newly muddled nature of the party been more evident than in the fallout from the Republican failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Activists are angry over the display of dysfunction, but they are uncertain whom to turn their guns on. They will not blame Mr. Trump, because to fault him is to link arms with the left and an adversarial news media, a nonstarter in an era of tribal politics. Some on the right are tempted to point a finger at Mr. Ryan, a pillar of the   party establishment, but that approach has been complicated by Mr. Trump’s decision to align himself with the speaker, both on the health care issue and more broadly. This leaves the Freedom Caucus. But these lawmakers, backed by an array of   outside groups, are some of the most dependably conservative members of Congress and were hailed for their steadfast opposition in the Obama years. “For eight years, the heroes in this movement were the Freedom Caucus members, and now they’re suddenly in the bad camp?” asked the Republican strategist Chip Lake, a touch of wonder in his voice. “It’s really confusing right now as a Republican to figure out who’s on first. ” To Republican veterans, the turn toward    politics on the right does not represent any sort of great awakening, just activists aligning themselves with the preferences of a new president. The   question is just how much Mr. Trump can tug the Republican electorate along with him if he decides to go further toward the center (or even left) than any of his Republican predecessors. For now, Ralph Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who lives just outside this congressional district, said the bedrock of the Republican base will not abandon Mr. Trump. “The guy who is enemy of our enemy can’t be our enemy,” he said. “Trump is the only game in town. ”",0
4370,"Из песни слов не выкинешь, а из сказки Пушкина?","Из песни слов не выкинешь, а из сказки Пушкина? 08 ноября 2016 Религия 
В Армавире вышло издание нового варианта пушкинской «Сказки о попе и работнике его Балде», в котором «поп» заменён на «купца». Автор идеи переиздания — священник городского Свято-Троицкого собора отец Павел. 
Что для ортодоксов – а именно так называют православную церковь во всем мире – какие-то 170 лет! Как была она цензором литературы при царе-батюшке, так и, по сей день, готова «кастрировать» любое произведение. И неважно, на кого замахиваться – на классиков даже безопасней: не дано им встать из могил! РПЦ и «наше всё», Александра Сергеевича, не пощадила, одобрив цензурные изменения его «Сказки о попе…». 
Пушкинская сатира на священника, по понятным причинам не увидевшая свет при жизни поэта, вышла в первоначальном варианте в 1882 году. Больше сорока лет «поп, толоконный лоб» (в современном понимании – набитый дурак) существовал лишь в рукописях. Именно из-за церковной цензуры придурковатый «пастырь» был изгнан из этой сказки Жуковским, превратившим попа в «купца Кузьму-Остолопа». 
Вроде бы всё это дела позапрошлого века, для нас — «давно минувших дней», а православный священник из Армавира – и не он один – увидел в образе «толоконного лба» поклёп на священнослужителей и издал сказку в «цензурированном» Жуковским виде, причём в 4000 экземпляров. 
Обосновал это отец Павел желанием восстановить историческую справедливость, дескать, Пушкин, будучи верующим, никак не мог насмехаться над церковью. Откуда священник почерпнул информацию, что на такую замену была воля самого Пушкина, сказать трудно, поскольку сказка в редакции Жуковского была опубликована спустя три года после дуэли и гибели поэта. Однако РПЦ сочла такую публикацию вполне правомочной. 
В высказываниях церковников то и дело проскальзывает мнение, что нашу литературу с достаточно сильным антиклерикальным началом пора «подчистить», дабы у молодёжи было меньше соблазнов. Страшно представить, что бы сотворили «батюшки», дай им волю калечить русскую классику, входящую в школьную программу! А что? Вдруг да разойдутся слова писателей, обличавших паразитическую сущность попов, с мировоззрением, которое те намерены прививать на «Основах православной культуры», куда у нас собираются загнать и без того перегруженных учеников?",0

You can ask for suggestions based on what ingredients you have available. And you can get advice on other ingredients you might want to buy to expand the range of cocktails you can make. The app looks elegant, feels professional and could be a handy tool to impress guests at your next party. It is available only for iOS, costs $10 and contains about 100 recipes. If your tastes are more   Martin’s Index of Cocktails comes from the same app maker as Modern Classics but reaches farther back in history. This app contains more than 2, 400 recipes dating as far back as the 1850s, offering interesting alternatives to the kinds of cocktails that are familiar today. This app also costs $10 and is for iOS only. Cocktails  —   Virtual Drink Mixer and Recipes is distinguished by a clever trick: It uses the camera on your device to look at the glass you’ve chosen to drink from. You then select a cocktail recipe, and the app superimposes a guide on the glass showing how much of each ingredient you need to pour in. This could be a great option if you’re a cocktail measurements klutz. It also simplifies the process of making a batch of drinks to share, instead of just a single glass. The app features a database of common glass shapes and sizes (labeled, somewhat confusingly, in German, though the rest of the app is in English) but you can also enter the measurements of your own glassware and it will use this data to calculate the correct proportion of ingredients. Virtual Drink Mixer and Recipes is for iOS only and costs $1. Cocktails: Become a Real Bartender is also worth checking out. This app has only about 400 recipes, but it is lavishly illustrated, well designed and easy to navigate. It includes detailed    instructions for mixing cocktails, including visual hints about adding ice, filling glasses and so on. The app also has a few unusual features, like letting you search for cocktails by their color or view instructions on an Apple Watch  —   a useful option if your hands are covered in, say, lemon juice. This app is free for iOS. Finally, Android users should try the free Cocktails Guru app. Like Real Bartender, it focuses on images and detailed instructions. It, too, has a few extra features, like showing you cocktails that are similar to the one you’re looking at. Cocktails Guru even includes tips on mixing drinks the way professional bartenders do. If you create a profile in the app, you can add comments to existing recipes and even upload images of the cocktails you’ve mixed. Scrivener, a   and useful app for writing anything from a short article to a novel, is finally available for iOS. The mobile version is as comprehensive as the older desktop version and works especially well on the iPad. But since your scribbles are all saved to the cloud, you can also edit your text on your iPhone, wherever the muse seizes you. Scrivener is $20 and worth every cent.",0
4372,"Harry Reid Cites Evidence of Russian Tampering in U.S. Vote, and Seeks F.B.I. Inquiry - The New York Times","The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F. B. I. on Monday to investigate evidence suggesting that Russia may try to manipulate voting results in November. In a letter to the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey Jr. Mr. Reid wrote that the threat of Russian interference “is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results. ” Recent classified briefings from senior intelligence officials, Mr. Reid said in an interview, have left him fearful that President Vladimir V. Putin’s “goal is tampering with this election. ” News reports on Monday said the F. B. I. warned state election officials several weeks ago that foreign hackers had exported voter registration data from computer systems in at least one state, and had pierced the systems of a second one. The bureau did not name the states, but Yahoo News, which first reported the confidential F. B. I. warning, said they were Arizona and Illinois. Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona’s secretary of state, said the F. B. I. had told state officials that Russians were behind the Arizona attack. After the F. B. I. warning, Arizona took its voter registration database offline from June 28 to July 8 to allow for a forensic exam of its systems, Mr. Roberts said. The F. B. I. in its notice to states, said the voter information had been “exfiltrated,” which means that it was shipped out of the state systems to another computer. But it does not mean that the data itself was tampered with. It is unclear whether the hackers intended to affect the election or pursued the data for other purposes, like gaining personal identifying information about voters. The F. B. I. warning referred to “targeting activity” against state boards of elections, but did not discuss the intent of the hackers. “That incident was only a small part of what disturbed me,” Mr. Reid said on Monday. In his letter to the F. B. I. he offered no specifics about how Russian hackers could manipulate election data, an effort made harder by the varying   procedures in each state. But the prospect of election tampering has been discussed since the revelation that two Russian intelligence agencies, the F. S. B. and the G. R. U. were believed to be responsible for the hacking of the networks of the Democratic National Committee. Emails published by a hacker who called himself Guccifer 2. 0  —   believed to be an alias for Russian hackers linked to the intelligence agencies  —   revealed that the committee had denigrated the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The disclosures led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee’s chairwoman. Mr. Reid’s accusation that Russia is seeking not only to influence the election with propaganda but also to tamper with the vote counting goes significantly beyond anything the Obama administration has said in public. While intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have “high confidence” that Russian intelligence services were behind the hacking of the Democratic committee, the administration has not leveled any accusations against Mr. Putin’s government. Asked about that in the interview, Mr. Reid said he was free to say things the president was not. But Mr. Reid argued that the connections between some of Donald J. Trump’s former and current advisers and the Russian leadership should, by itself, prompt an investigation. He referred indirectly in his letter to a speech given in Russia by one Trump adviser, Carter Page, a consultant and investor in the energy giant Gazprom, who criticized American sanctions policy toward Russia. “Trump and his people keep saying the election is rigged,” Mr. Reid said. “Why is he saying that? Because people are telling him the election can be messed with. ” Mr. Trump’s advisers say they are concerned that unnamed elites could rig the election for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Reid argued that if Russia concentrated on “less than six” swing states, it could alter results and undermine confidence in the electoral system. That would pose challenges, given that most states have paper backups, but he noted that hackers could keep people from voting by tampering with the rolls of eligible voters.",0
4373,Do You Know What It Means To Be An Introvert?,"Leave a reply 
Kate Bartolotta – In this day and age where the constant use of social media demands that we label and define ourselves to others in every way possible, it’s important to understand the true meaning and use of the word introvert. 
A lot of people use the words “introverted” and “shy” interchangeably; they don’t mean the same thing. 
As someone who works with people all the time, you’d think I’d be an extrovert. I’m friendly. I’m not shy. But when I get close to my “people time” limit, it’s time to shut down, be quiet and hole up with a good book. I love helping people, but there’s a huge reason that I balance that type of work with work where I get to be quiet and dive in to working with words instead of being bombarded with interaction. 
It’s because—although I don’t fall into some of the old stereotypes—I’m an introvert. 
I spent years feeling guilty if I wanted to spend time alone instead of doing things with friends. I learned to make the best of it, and often pushed myself to be social—even when it felt exhausting. Many people do this, as extroversion tends to be prized in our society, while introversion is seen as a “second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.” It is none of those things. It’s the way an estimated two-thirds to one-half of us are wired, and it can be our greatest asset. 
As I mentioned, being introverted isn’t the same thing as being shy (though there’s nothing wrong with being shy either) . Many shy people are also introverted, but one doesn’t really have much to do with the other. The best explanation I was ever given (and maybe one of the biggest “aha!” moments of my adult life) was that while extroverts are energized by connecting and spending time with others, introverts need inward-focused, alone time to recharge. 
Being introverted has nothing to do with lack of confidence. Many confident people are introverted, and gather their strength from the time they spend alone rather than from the input of others. In some ways, I believe that the ability to enjoy being by yourself says a great deal about your confidence. 
It isn’t that introverts don’t like social time—it’s that for us, social time is giving out energy rather than receiving energy. 
A lot of us fall somewhere in the middle between the two, and some interactions take more out of people than others. 
A few things to consider if someone you care about falls more on the introverted end of the spectrum: 1. Think of each of us as having a cup of energy available. 
For introverts, most social interactions take a little out of that cup instead of filling it the way it does for extroverts. Most of us like it. We’re happy to give and love to see you. When the cup is empty, though, we need some time to refuel. We aren’t mad. We don’t stop caring about you. We’ll be so happy to see you and talk to you again when we’ve had some time to decompress. 2. Silence isn’t a bad thing. 
Really. It’s not an insult. It’s the introvert’s way of conserving energy and restoring him or herself. If we can be quiet with you (and you can be content being quiet with us) it’s a huge compliment and a huge relief. Other times the quiet really does need to be spent alone. We come back when we’re ready. It’s worth the wait. 3. Just because someone is friendly, she isn’t necessarily an extrovert; just because someone is quiet doesn’t mean he’s an introvert. 
If you pay attention to people you care about, often you can see what energizes them and what drains them. If you aren’t sure, ask. If you notice a friend seems wiped out, ask if spending time together sounds like fun or if they’d like some down time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve become almost giddy because plans were cancelled—even with people I love. When you know someone needs some space in order to re-energize, be respectful and give it to them. It isn’t rejection. 4. Text. Write letters. Email. We love it. 
There are times that you can’t beat a face to face conversation, I’d agree 100%. But for introverts, sometimes being able to stay connected and stay in touch in a less intense and less draining way is a huge help. Being in crowds is tough. Even long conversations can be tough if we’re already “peopled out.” Having the freedom to respond when we are ready is a great feeling. Sometimes, it’s right away. If it’s not, don’t be offended. (It’s not you…it’s me. Really!) 5. All of this really comes down to respect. 
Each of us has our own set of boundaries, our own way of communicating and our own needs. When you care about someone, you choose to communicate with him or her in ways that show you love and respect them. If your cup is filled by lots of interaction with others, go for it! Be in tune with your own needs, and enjoy the way that time with others energizes you. If someone you love is an introvert, and needs time to him or herself, tune into and respect that as well. We don’t do activities alone because we are sad, or negative or depressed; we do it because that’s what fills our cup back up. We’ll be even happier to see you when we come back.

The shorter 12-question quiz on her site can give you some good insights into your own personal introversion or extroversion that bypasses some of those long held stereotypes (P.S. I’m 12 for 12).” SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality  ",0
4374,"In a Brooklyn Basement, Jazz With a Russian Accent - The New York Times","In the 1960s and ’70s in Moscow, Nina Brodskaya was a singing star. “I used to sing for the biggest band in Moscow,” said Ms. Brodskaya, who performed with the illustrious Eddie Rosner Jazz Orchestra in the Soviet Union before she moved to the United States in 1980. She made records here with names like “  ” and “Come to USA” but never equaled the renown she had in the Soviet Union. But she still appears regularly in a cramped basement alongside a longstanding group of fellow musicians from Russia and other former   countries who have settled in and around Brighton Beach, the heavily Russian neighborhood in Brooklyn. There is no audience, but Ms. Brodskaya has the joy of jamming with her fellow immigrants as they gather on Tuesday nights below a dentist’s office in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, in a modest room adorned with posters of American and Russian jazz luminaries. The musicians are mostly over 60 and often learned jazz clandestinely and resourcefully in   Russia, where the authorities were suspicious of people interested in American culture, especially cultural traditions that emphasized improvisation and artistic freedom. “They would tell us, ‘Today, you’re playing jazz tomorrow, you’re selling your country,’” recalled Ms. Brodskaya, who was a singer in the band led by Eddie Rosner, a trumpeter and bandleader known as the Polish Louis Armstrong who was imprisoned for years in a Soviet gulag under Stalin. On a recent Tuesday, Ms. Brodskaya rehearsed two numbers with the band that demonstrated its   duality: a jazz standard, “Just in Time,” and a Russian song whose title translates to “Save Love. ” The rehearsals are exhaustive   affairs run under the strict baton of the band’s musical director, Zinovy Pritsker, who instructs the musicians in Russian. But reward comes afterward, when a table is set up in the waiting room of the dentist’s office and a bottle of icy vodka is plunked down, along with a meal of herring, potatoes and Russian delicacies. The group plays mostly   classics from the repertoires of Count Basie, Duke Ellington and others, arranged for the band by Mr. Pritsker, 69. From the back of the room, the band is propelled by its drummer, Dr. Mark Rosen, 71, whose dental office is upstairs and who named the ensemble the Dr. Mark Rosen Big Band. Asked about the name, Mr. Pritsker, a formal man with a dark Russian mood, shrugged and said: “What can I tell you? He has the rehearsal space. ” The band plays the occasional Russian wedding or dance at catering halls in Brighton Beach. Sometimes, Russian musicians visiting New York hear about the band and sit in. But, for the most part, the only outsiders who hear the band are the nighttime dog walkers in the neighborhood who, according to Dr. Rosen, say they love the sound of swinging jazz that seeps out of the basement windows. The group is mainly a rehearsal band that allows players to stay connected to one another and the music they fell in love with as young musicians. It was a time when jazz was seen as the decadent music of the West and suppressed, Dr. Rosen said, recalling his years of living under Communism. The band’s male singer, Lev Pilshik, added: “Jazz was prohibited. If you played it in certain clubs, you might have K. G. B. agents coming and asking about you. ” Despite mostly playing for one another, the band has a rare concert scheduled on Tuesday night in Manhattan, at the Cutting Room on East 32nd Street. It was arranged by Mr. Pritsker’s son, Gene Pritsker, who plays guitar in the big band and is also an accomplished modern classical composer whose works are performed at the Cutting Room. For the concert, Gene Pritsker thought he should come up with a better marketing strategy for a band that is named after a dentist. So for Tuesday’s performance, the band will be rebranded as From Russia With Swing. Even in   New York City, a longstanding big band, much less one of this size, is rare: a   ensemble with five saxophonists, four trombonists, four trumpeters, a   rhythm section and three regular singers. Most of the band members were classically trained at Russian conservatories but had to learn jazz privately, in secret jam sessions or by acquiring recordings through friends or the black market. Some members recalled tuning in to the Voice of America on shortwave radio  —   despite government efforts to jam the signal  —   for the famous jazz broadcasts of Willis Conover, who introduced the music to Eastern bloc countries during the Cold War. “The government didn’t want you listening to the jazz broadcasts, because they felt it was all part of the American propaganda,” said Dr. Rosen, who came to the United States in 1978. One of his patients turned out to be Mr. Pritsker, a saxophonist from Leningrad, who moved to New York the same year and who fell in love with jazz while playing in the Soviet Army band. Today, the basement rehearsal space has become something of a running joke because of the notion that the musicians are playing “underground jazz,” said Dr. Rosen, who started a big band while in medical school, inspired by performances he saw in Leningrad by Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman with their bands. Those concerts were allowed by the government, Dr. Rosen said, as were certain jazz clubs that catered to tourists, government officials and other important citizens whose patriotism was beyond question. Other than that, jazz performances were suspect. “We were afraid, but we did it,” Dr. Rosen recalled. “Sometimes the K. G. B. might call you and ask if you’re playing jazz with a certain musician and ask you to watch them. ” Mr. Pritsker said a friend had given him scratchy    tapes of bebop recorded from radio broadcasts that stoked his desire to become a jazzman. But to make money after he moved to New York, he became a piano tuner, if a notoriously temperamental one. He and Dr. Rosen placed advertisements in local Russian newspapers for musicians and formed the band in 1997. Many of the musicians who responded had played for the best Russian jazz bands but were busking or working modest day jobs in New York. Lev Barsevov, who plays trumpet, was a   driver another trumpeter, Aaron Gerskovitch, was a kosher butcher. A saxophone player, Veniamin Popov, worked as a circus clown, which he proved on a recent Tuesday night by contorting his legs above his head while sitting down  —   even before the vodka was brought out. Russian immigrants playing American music can result in many   moments, and one occurred when the band began hotly debating in Russian the way the English lyrics to “New York, New York” should be delivered. After a few false starts, Mr. Pritsker shook his head and said in his thickly accented English, “I hope in concert, we don’t have this problem. ”",0
4375,Did Hillary Clinton Have to Be First? - The New York Times,"Did Hillary Clinton, or somebody very much like her, have to be the first woman to get this close to winning the presidency? We explore that question in the latest episode of The   with Claire McCaskill, the senior United States Senator from Missouri, and Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist who has written several books on women’s history. What   combination of factors is required for a country to embrace a woman as its leader for the first time? Longtime public exposure? Proximity to power? Moderate politics? And how powerful, perhaps even necessary, is it that this first woman be the spouse of a former president? History offers a guide: The first female president of any country was Isabel Martínez de Perón of Argentina, the wife of its former president. The first woman elected to the United States Senate, Hattie Wyatt Caraway, was the widow of a senator. And now the United States has the first woman candidate in the general election. “Given our history it’s not surprising it’s the wife of somebody who had the job first,” Ms. Collins said. “Some day we’ll have some really charismatic woman who gets people all excited, and it doesn’t matter that she’s only been in the senate for two years and that we don’t know much about her except her story,” Ms. Collins said. Mrs. Clinton’s presidential runs will have paved the way for that woman to have a shot. “No matter what happens in this election, one of the great contributions Hillary Clinton has made to American history is that she made it seem sort of normal to have a woman running for president in 2008,” Ms. Collins said. “Before then it had never been a normal thing. ” America is behind many other countries on that front, as Senator McCaskill pointed out. “Many of us are painfully aware of how many countries around the world have elected and admired women executives in their government, and it is embarrassing to many of us that America has not taken that step,” she said. “The irony is that everyone always would pat women on the head and say ‘well you know as soon as a woman is qualified there will be a woman president,’ ” Senator McCaskill said. “Now we have a stark differential in qualifications, and now it seems to be all about her integrity and how likable she is. ” In the episode, we discuss the challenges of running against a woman with former Representative Rick Lazio of Long Island, a man who discovered those pitfalls in a very public fashion. In 2000, he was Mrs. Clinton’s opponent in the race for the United States Senate seat in New York. In a   debate moment, Mr. Lazio approached Mrs. Clinton’s podium to ask her to sign a pledge, a tactic many saw as an overly aggressive male gesture toward a female rival. Mr. Lazio told us it was a mistake that he still regrets  —   and one whose visual impact he underestimated in the moment. “Our folks all thought we had won the debate hands down,” he told us. But the next day, he saw that clip played over and over again and realized that the moment was going to stick. “The mistake that I made  —   and it was a mistake  —   was to create an optic where it looked like I was somebody other than who I was it looked like I was invading her space and was not chivalrous,” he told us. “It was spun in the media and shown over and over again, and it looked like it was an overbearing male approaching a female. ” Please let us know what you think of The  .

4376,Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Cancer - The New York Times,"Steve Cara expected to sail through the routine medical tests required to increase his life insurance in October 2014. But the results were devastating. He had lung cancer, at age 53. It had begun to spread, and doctors told him it was inoperable. A few years ago, they would have suggested chemotherapy. Instead, his oncologist, Dr. Matthew D. Hellmann of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, recommended an experimental treatment: immunotherapy. Rather than attacking the cancer directly, as chemo does, immunotherapy tries to rally the patient’s own immune system to fight the disease. Uncertain, Mr. Cara sought a second opinion. A doctor at another major hospital read his scans and pathology report, then asked what Dr. Hellmann had advised. When the doctor heard the answer, Mr. Cara recalled, “he closed up the folder, handed it back to me and said, ‘Run back there as fast as you can. ’” Many others are racing down the same path. Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer, long a medical dream, is becoming a reality. Remarkable stories of tumors melting away and terminal illnesses going into remissions that last years  —   backed by solid data  —   have led to an explosion of interest and billions of dollars of investments in the rapidly growing field of immunotherapy. Pharmaceutical companies, philanthropists and the federal government’s “cancer moonshot” program are pouring money into developing treatments. Medical conferences on the topic are packed. All this has brought new optimism to cancer doctors  —   a sense that they have begun tapping into a force of nature, the medical equivalent of splitting the atom. “This is a fundamental change in the way that we think about cancer therapy,” said Dr. Jedd Wolchok, chief of melanoma and immunotherapeutics services at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Hundreds of clinical trials involving immunotherapy, alone or combined with other treatments, are underway for nearly every type of cancer. “People are asking, waiting, pleading to get into these trials,” said Dr. Arlene   an oncologist at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who specializes in bladder cancer. The immune system  —   a network of cells, tissues and biochemicals that they secrete  —   defends the body against viruses, bacteria and other invaders. But cancer often finds ways to hide from the immune system or block its ability to fight. Immunotherapy tries to help the immune system recognize cancer as a threat, and attack it. Doctors tried a primitive version of immunotherapy against cancer more than 100 years ago. It sometimes worked remarkably well, but often did not, and they did not understand why. Eventually, radiation and chemotherapy eclipsed it. Researchers are now focused on two promising types of immunotherapy. One creates a new, individualized treatment for each patient by removing some of the person’s immune cells, altering them genetically to kill cancer and then infusing them back into the bloodstream. This treatment has produced long remissions in a few hundred children and adults with deadly forms of leukemia or lymphoma for whom standard treatments had failed. The second approach, far more widely used and the one Mr. Cara tried, involves   drugs that do not have to be tailored to each patient. The drugs free immune cells to fight cancer by blocking a mechanism  —   called a checkpoint  —   that cancer uses to shut down the immune system. These drugs, called checkpoint inhibitors, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced melanoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cancers of the lung, kidney and bladder. More drugs in this class are in the pipeline. Patients are clamoring for checkpoint drugs, including one, Keytruda, known to many as “that Jimmy Carter drug” which, combined with surgery and radiation, has left the former president with no sign of recurrence even though melanoma had spread to his liver and brain. Checkpoint inhibitors have become an important option for people like Mr. Cara, with advanced lung cancer. “We can say in all honesty to patients, that while we can’t tell them we can cure metastatic lung cancer right now, we can tell them there’s real hope that they can live for years, and for a lot of patients many years, which really is a complete ” said Dr. John V. Heymach, a lung cancer specialist and chairman of   and neck medical oncology at M. D. Anderson. Yet for all the promise and excitement, the fact is that so far, immunotherapy has worked in only a minority of patients, and researchers are struggling to find out why. They know they have their hands on an extraordinarily powerful tool, but they cannot fully understand or control it yet. Mr. Cara, an apparel industry executive from Bridgewater, N. J. had    lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. The diagnosis shattered what had been an idyllic life: a happy marriage, sons in college, a successful career, a beautiful home, regular vacations, plenty of golf. In December 2014, he began treatment with two checkpoint inhibitors. They cost about $150, 000 a year, but as a study subject he did not have to pay. These medicines work on killer   white blood cells that are often described as the soldiers of the immune system.   are so fierce that they have   brakes  —   the   checkpoints  —   to shut them down and keep them from attacking normal tissue, which could result in autoimmune disorders like Crohn’s disease, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. One checkpoint stops   from multiplying another weakens them and shortens their life span. As the name suggests, checkpoint inhibitors block the checkpoints, so cancer cannot use them to turn off the immune system. Mr. Cara took drugs to inhibit both types of checkpoints. Every two weeks, he had intravenous infusions of Yervoy and Opdivo, both made by   Squibb. He had no problems at first, just a bit of fatigue the day after the infusion. He rarely missed work. But turning the wrath of the immune system against cancer can be a risky endeavor: Sometimes the patient’s own body gets caught in the crossfire. About two months into the treatment, Mr. Cara broke out in a rash all over his arms, back and chest. It became so severe that he had to go off the drugs. A steroid cream cleared it up and he was able to resume treatment  —   but with only one drug, Opdivo. Doctors stopped the other in hopes of minimizing the side effects. Checkpoint inhibitors can take months to begin working, and sometimes cause inflammation that, on scans early in treatment, can make it look like the tumor is growing. But Mr. Cara’s first scans, in March 2015, were stunning. His tumor had shrunk by a third. By August, more than half of the tumor had vanished. The rash came back, however, and worsened. Steroids worked again, but in October a far more alarming side effect set in: breathing trouble. Doctors diagnosed pneumonitis, a lung inflammation caused by an attack from the immune system  —   a known risk of checkpoint drugs. Continuing the treatment posed too great a danger. Mr. Cara stopped the infusions, but the months of treatment seemed to have transformed his cancer to stage 2 from stage 4, meaning that it was now operable. This spring surgeons removed about a third of his right lung, and discovered that the cancer was actually gone. “No cancer was seen in any of the tissue they took out,” Dr. Hellmann said. “‘One hundred percent treatment effect,’” he read from the pathology report. “It was pretty cool. ” Immunotherapy had apparently wiped out the disease. “It’s amazing. Unbelievable,” Mr. Cara said. As of now, he needs no further treatment, but he will be monitored regularly. He is back to work, and golf. “He’s had the best possible response,” Dr. Hellmann said. “I hope that remains permanent. Only time will tell, and I think he’s conscious of that. ” Mr. Cara acknowledged, “Is there something in the back of me that says this thing never goes away, it could come back any time? Sure. But it’s not the main thing I think. I’m young, I’m strong, I’m healthy, my pathology report came back clean. ” He considered framing that pathology report. But, he said, “I don’t want to jinx myself. ” When checkpoint inhibitors work, they can really work, producing long remissions that start to look like cures and that persist even after treatment stops. Twenty  percent to 40 percent of patients, sometimes more, have good responses. But for many patients, the drugs do not work at all. For others, they work for a while and then stop. The vexing question, and the focus of research, is, why? One theory is that additional checkpoints, not yet discovered, may play a role. The hunt is on to find them, and then make new drugs to act on them. Despite the gaps in knowledge, checkpoint inhibitors are coming into widespread use and are being tried in advanced types of cancer for which standard chemotherapy offers little hope. One example is anal cancer, a painful disease that carries a stigma because it is often linked to the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus or HPV, which also causes cervical cancer. Lee, 59, who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her privacy, found out in 2014 that she had the disease, and that it had spread to her liver. “I was told I’d be dead in 12 to 18 months with treatment, six months with no treatment,” she said. Chemotherapy and radiation at a hospital near Dallas brought a remission that lasted only a few months. The cancer spread to her lungs. Bedridden and in severe pain, she entered an immunotherapy trial at M. D. Anderson. In May 2015 she began receiving Opdivo every two weeks. The tumors in her liver and lungs have shrunk by about 70 percent. She is back at work. While the drugs initially were given only to people with advanced disease, especially those who had little to lose because chemotherapy had stopped working, Dr. Heymach of M. D. Anderson predicted that soon some patients  —   including some with earlier stages of lung cancer  —   will receive checkpoint inhibitors as their first treatment. Immunotherapy is also enabling doctors to help patients in unexpected ways. Until recently, surgeons were reluctant to operate on people with advanced cancer because they knew from experience that it would not lengthen the patient’s life. But checkpoint inhibitors are changing that. For instance, some patients have taken checkpoint inhibitors for an advanced cancer that had spread around the body, and wound up with only one stubborn tumor left. They then have had it surgically removed and have gone years without a relapse. “Time has slowed down to the point where you can pay attention to individual tumors, since you’re not running to put out the fire of wholesale systemic progression,” Dr. Wolchok said. If there is a potential downside to the advances, Dr. Hellmann said, it is that the buzz about immunotherapy has led some patients to think chemotherapy is passé. “Immunotherapy represents a hugely important new tool, but chemotherapy can work too and has been the backbone of the way we’ve treated patients with lung cancer,” he said. “Immunotherapy is not a replacement for that. It’s a new weapon. ” One of his patients, a    man with lung cancer that had spread to his brain, was eager to try immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy. After having radiation treatment for one brain tumor, he began treatment with two checkpoint inhibitors. But they did not work. So his doctors switched to chemotherapy. “He’s had a tremendous response,” Dr. Hellmann said. He said it was impossible to tell whether the immunotherapy could have had some delayed effect and worked synergistically with the chemotherapy. Clinical trials are now trying to resolve that question. But the potential for dangerous side effects cannot be overemphasized, doctors say. A 2010 article in a medical journal reported that a few melanoma patients had died from adverse effects of Yervoy. In addition to causing lung inflammation, checkpoint inhibitors can lead to rheumatoid arthritis and colitis, a severe inflammation of the intestine  —   the result of an attack by the   immune system that    remedies cannot treat. Patients need steroids like prednisone to quell these attacks. Fortunately  —   and mysteriously, Dr. Wolchok said  —   the steroids can halt the gut trouble without stopping the immune fight against the cancer. But if patients delay telling doctors about diarrhea, Dr. Wolchok warned, “they could die” from colitis. Checkpoint inhibitors can also slow down vital glands  —   pituitary, adrenal or thyroid  —   creating a permanent need for hormone treatment. Mr. Cara, for instance, now needs thyroid medication, almost certainly as a result of his treatment. Doctors have reported that a patient with a kidney transplant rejected it after taking a checkpoint inhibitor to treat cancer, apparently because the drug spurred his immune system to attack the organ. Another of Dr. Hellmann’s   patients, Joanne Sabol, 65, had to quit a checkpoint inhibitor because of severe colitis. But she had taken it for about two years, and it shrank a large abdominal tumor by 78 percent. Patients like her are in uncharted territory, and doctors are trying to decide whether to operate to remove what is left of her tumor. “I have aggressive cancer, but I’m not giving in to it,” Ms. Sabol said. “It’s going to be a big battle with me. ” Dr. William B. Coley, an American surgeon born in 1862, is widely considered the father of cancer immunotherapy. But he practiced a crude form of it, without understanding how it worked. Distressed by the painful death of a young woman he had treated for a sarcoma, a bone cancer, in 1891, Dr. Coley began to study the records of other sarcoma patients in New York, according to Dr. David. B. Levine, a medical historian and orthopedic surgeon. One case leapt out at him: a patient who had several unsuccessful operations to remove a huge sarcoma from his face, and wound up with a severe infection, then called erysipelas, caused by Streptococcal bacteria. The patient was not expected to survive, but he did  —   and the cancer disappeared. Dr. Coley found other cases in which cancer went away after erysipelas. Not much was known about the immune system, and he suspected, mistakenly, that the bacteria were somehow destroying the tumors. Researchers today think the infection set off an intense immune response that killed both the germs and the cancer. Dr. Coley was not alone in believing that bacteria could fight cancer. In a letter to a colleague in 1890, the Russian physician and playwright Anton Chekhov wrote of erysipelas: “It has long been noted that the growth of malignant tumors halts for a time when this disease is present. ” Dr. Coley began to inject terminally ill cancer patients with Streptococcal bacteria in the 1890s. His first patient, a drug addict with an advanced sarcoma, was expected to die within weeks, but the disease went into remission and he lived eight years. Dr. Coley treated other patients, with mixed results. Some tumors regressed, but sometimes the bacteria caused infections that went out of control. Dr. Coley developed an extract of   bacteria that came to be called Coley’s mixed toxins, and he treated hundreds of patients over several decades. Many became quite ill, with shaking chills and raging fevers. But some were cured.   and Company began producing Coley’s toxins in 1899, and continued for 30 years. Various hospitals in Europe and the United States, including the Mayo Clinic, used the toxins, but the results were not consistent. Early in the 20th century, radiation treatment came into use. Its results were more predictable, and the cancer establishment began turning away from Coley’s toxins. Dr. Coley’s own institution, Memorial Hospital (now Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) instituted a policy in 1915 stating that inpatients had to be given radiation, not the toxins. Some other hospitals continued using them, but interest gradually waned. Dr. Coley died in 1936. Chemotherapy, developed after World War II, was another blow to his methods. And in 1965, the American Cancer Society added Coley’s toxins to its list of “unproven” treatments. (The toxins were later taken off the list.) After Dr. Coley’s death, his daughter, Helen Coley Nauts, studied some 800 case records that he had left behind, and became convinced that he was onto something important. She tried to rekindle interest in his work, but she was thwarted by doctors who opposed it, including some with high rank at Sloan Kettering. However, in 1953 she founded the Cancer Research Institute in New York, a nonprofit that has become a significant supporter of research on the interplay between cancer and the immune system. The group awarded more than $29. 4 million in scientific grants in 2015, and its advisory board includes Dr. Wolchok and the scientist credited with developing the first checkpoint inhibitor, James P. Allison. “Are you Dr. Allison?” James Allison and his wife, Dr. Padmanee Sharma, had just settled into their airplane seats when another passenger approached with tears in her eyes and thanked him for creating the drug that was keeping her husband alive. Dr. Sharma described the encounter during a joint interview with her and Dr. Allison in his office at M. D. Anderson in Houston, where both work. “Every time Jim meets a patient, he cries,” Dr. Sharma said. “Well, not every time,” Dr. Allison said. Dr. Allison, 67, and Dr. Sharma, 45, have been research collaborators since 2005, and spouses since 2014, when he proposed by saying that nobody else could stand either of them  —   they talk about their work all the time  —   so they might as well get married. The drug the woman on the plane thanked him for was Yervoy, the first of the checkpoint inhibitors. It was approved for advanced melanoma in 2011. Dr. Allison  —   a scientist, not a physician  —   has won numerous research awards and is expected by many to win a Nobel Prize. He drives a Porsche convertible with a license plate bearing the name of the checkpoint he deciphered:  . A bearded, slightly rumpled figure, Dr. Allison plays harmonica with research colleagues in a   band called the Checkpoints. He is good enough to have accompanied Willie Nelson onstage at the Redneck Country Club in Stafford, Tex. this spring, playing, “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die. ” Immunology, particularly the study of   has been his life’s work. Cancer came later. “I became interested in cancer because I’ve lost a number of family members to cancer,” said Dr. Allison, chairman of the immunology department and executive director of the immunotherapy platform at M. D. Anderson. “My mother and two of her brothers, and my own brother, died of cancer. ” Around the time of his brother’s death from prostate cancer, Dr. Allison learned that he had the same disease himself. He was treated successfully, he said, adding with a laugh that he was more likely to die from inactivity than from cancer. In the 1990s, Dr. Allison, then at the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Jeffrey Bluestone of the University of California, San Francisco, independently made a landmark discovery: They proved that a molecule widely believed to activate the immune system actually shut it down. The molecule was a protein on the surface of    —   a crucial checkpoint  —   and it was nature’s way of subduing the   apparently to dial back their ferocious activity and prevent them from attacking a person’s own tissue. Cancer cells can sometimes lock onto checkpoints, disabling the  . Dr. Allison wondered if it might be possible to block the checkpoint and launch the   against cancer. He and a graduate student, Matthew Krummel, developed an antibody  —   a molecule made by certain cells of the immune system  —   that would stick to the checkpoint and block it. When the researchers, including Dana Leach, a postdoctoral fellow, gave the antibody to mice with cancer, tumors vanished. Recalling those first tests in mice, Dr. Allison said it was astounding to see the cancers shrink and disappear. Veterinarians thought the mice had contracted an infection or a skin disease. But the sores that worried the vets were actually tumors that were ulcerating and rotting away under assault by  . Many drug companies were skeptical about the findings, but one, Medarex, created a human version of the antibody. Medarex was later acquired by   Squibb, and the antibody, given the trade name Yervoy, was approved in 2011 to treat advanced melanoma. It became the first drug to prolong survival in people with this deadly form of cancer. Major studies that started before it was approved found that among 1, 861 patients treated for advanced disease, about 22 percent were still alive three years later, with no signs of recurrence  —   an astounding result for a disease that was almost always fatal. Some have survived 10 years or longer. The discoveries that led to the drug, Dr. Allison said, came entirely from years of basic research in immunology  —   experiments in test tubes and mice  —   and not from the clinical or “translational” science, aimed at moving rapidly into humans, that is so heavily favored now by institutions that pay for studies. “None of this came from cancer research, none,” Dr. Allison said, adding that without support for basic research, “progress, if any, will be incremental, not a big leap. ” His own work is well funded, he said, but he worries about an overall trend to shortchange basic science. The focus of much of his and Dr. Sharma’s research now is to understand how and why checkpoint inhibitors work in some patients and not others. Dr. Sharma, a professor of genitourinary medical oncology, is a physician and researcher who treats patients and oversees clinical trials, and she brings stories home to Dr. Allison about patients whose lives may be extended by his discoveries. In general, checkpoint inhibitors seem to work best for tumors with many mutations, like most melanomas and cancers of the lung and bladder. “It’s like buying a lottery ticket,” Dr. Sharma said. “The more genetic abnormalities, the more lottery tickets you’ve bought  —   and you have a much higher chance of a   recognizing something to start the immune response. ” One area of particular interest is the tissue immediately in and around a tumor, what researchers call the microenvironment. By examining that zone, scientists can tell whether   are fighting the cancer. Sometimes   mob the margins of a tumor, but cannot get in. Other times, they get in but cannot kill it. “How do we understand what drives the immune response in one patient to give a good clinical outcome, and how do we then drive that same immune response in all the other patients?” Dr. Sharma asked. “Did the   get in? If not, is there another drug that can drive the   in?” Researchers also suspect that checkpoint inhibitors might work better if combined with treatments that kill tumor cells, because debris from dead cancer cells may help the immune system recognize its target. Studies are underway to test checkpoint drugs in combination with   treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. But it is a delicate balance to adjust the timing and doses, because in addition to killing cancer cells, those other treatments can knock out the immune system just when it is needed most. As word spreads about immunotherapy, a troubling fact remains: Patients do not have equal access to the new treatments, which can be prohibitively expensive. Insurers cover F. D. A.  treatments, but   can be high for costly drugs. Some people get costs covered by volunteering for clinical trials that are testing new drugs or novel combinations. But not everyone can, or wants to, enter a study. Participants tend to have the education, determination and means required to get second and third opinions, rearrange their lives, and buy plane tickets to get to   medical centers. And they are willing to take risks for a chance to survive. Minorities have been underrepresented in studies, for reasons that are not clear. David Wight, a retired oil engineer in Anchorage, is a study participant who has been able to take every possible step to save his life. When bladder cancer began to spread in his abdomen, he was given three to 12 months to live. That was four and a half years ago. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Wight, who is 75 but looks younger, refereed a boys’ soccer game, racing up and down the field with the players. The following Wednesday he rose at 3 a. m. to fly 3, 300 miles to Houston, where he would arrive at about 5 p. m. He has been making that trip every other week for over two years to receive immunotherapy at M. D. Anderson. For about a year and a half, his disease has been in complete remission. Until recently, he paid his own airfare. But a few months ago,   Squibb, the maker of the drug being studied, began picking up the tab, even reimbursing him retroactively  —   about $50, 000 so far. He has five children: three in their 40s, a son, 16, and a daughter, 10. The younger two were only 10 and 5 when he learned he was ill, and the thought that he might not have survived to raise them still brings tears to his eyes. Describing the time he has gained to be with his family, he said, “I won a lottery that’s bigger than anybody could imagine. ” His cancer was diagnosed in summer 2010, after a test during a routine physical found cancer cells in his urine. A small tumor had invaded the wall of his bladder. Mr. Wight had his bladder removed at a hospital in Anchorage, and was told he needed no further treatment. A year after the surgery, he and his doctors were horrified to find that a large tumor had wrapped itself around his colon. Only then did the doctors discover that he had a rare, aggressive type of bladder cancer, called plasmacytoid. His doctors consulted with a hospital in Seattle, which devised a treatment plan. “They said one word that told me I was not where I wanted to be: ‘palliative,’” Mr. Wight said. He knew palliative treatment was meant to ease symptoms, but not cure the disease. “I said, ‘No thank you. We can do better than that,’” he recalled. His next stop was M. D. Anderson. Months of chemotherapy shrank the tumor enough to allow colon surgery in May 2012. But the disease kept coming back: spots in one lung, then the other, then a tumor under his kidney. “I was getting a new tumor every six to eight months,” he said. Chemotherapy and an experimental gene therapy cleared his lungs and shrank the tumor near his kidney but could not get rid of it. In June 2014, Mr. Wight became one of the first patients with bladder cancer at M. D. Anderson to enter a study of two checkpoint inhibitors. For three months he received Yervoy and Opdivo every two weeks, and then continued with only Opdivo. The tumor under his kidney shrank, then disappeared. It has been gone for a year and a half, and he has had no other signs of cancer. He is still receiving Opdivo  —   the reason for his regular trips to Houston. “I’m very fortunate,” Mr. Wight said. “It has for me a single irritating side effect. It makes me itch like you wouldn’t believe. I itch all the time but it’s a small price to pay to stay alive and be feeling pretty well. ” An antihistamine helps. Regarding how long he will keep being treated, he said: “It’s experimental. You don’t know the answer. As long as I have positive results I’m eligible for the treatment. ” His oncologist, Dr.   called his response to immunotherapy “fantastic” and said other patients, also in complete or partial remission, were flying or driving to Houston for treatments every two or three weeks. Many do not want to stop taking the drugs. But doctors do not know how long the treatments should continue. They wonder how long the remissions will last, and whether some will even turn out to be cures, Dr.   said. Some studies were planned to last just a year or two, longer than the life expectancy of most patients with advanced disease. Researchers did not think they would have to decide whether to keep treating people for years. “We were not expecting to see patients going this long,” Dr.   said.",0
4377,Senegal’s Pink House Gives Hope to Pregnant Women Who Have Been Victims of Abuse,"In the West, pregnancy outside of marriage is acceptable, and abortion on demand is considered a woman’s right. But in the West African nation of Senegal, it is taboo to be pregnant while unmarried, and abortion is not legal. [The challenges for Binta, whose name was changed to protect her privacy, were even greater because her pregnancy was caused by someone in her extended family.  “I didn’t know how to tell my family about this.   …     The family is too sacred,” the    said in a story reported by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “So Binta made up an elaborate story about finding a job and packed her bags for Guediawaye, a poor suburb on the outskirts of capital Dakar, where a social worker had told her she could find refuge at the Maison Rose, French for ‘pink house,’” the foundation reported. The Pink House is a courthouse that has been transformed into a haven in Senegal for women whose pregnancy occurred outside of wedlock or who became pregnant because of rape or forced marriage. In the nine years since Mona Chasserio, the French woman who founded the Pink House, opened its doors, hundreds of women  —   and their unborn and born babies  —   have found sanctuary there. “Anything that can happen in Senegal, we’ve seen it,” Chasserio said. Most women who come to the house do so to continue their pregnancies and give birth, the foundation reported. The women also receive help dealing with their trauma through music, art, and other types of therapy. “Six toddlers played in the sunny courtyard one morning while their mothers shared stories as part of a workshop,” the article said. “Binta sat across from a    girl who was seven months pregnant from rape. ” A video posted on the BBC Africa’s Facebook page features life at the Pink House. “I couldn’t accept my pregnancy,” one girl said in the video. “I didn’t think I would be able to take care of the child. ” “I was planning to give her up for adoption,” she said. “But the workers here helped me create a bond with the child before the birth. ” Women are taken to a nearby hospital to give birth, and they get help with their babies when they return to the Pink House. The hope is that the girls can reunite with their families, but they can stay at the Pink House for as long as they like. “It’s not just a house that welcomes women who have had problems,” Chasserio said in the video. “But it is, above all, a place about rebirth  —   rebirth. ” “And that, to me, is very, very important,” Chasserio said. The foundation reported that Chasserio is now also helping women learn how to support their children. “The problem here is jobs for women are extremely limited,” Chasserio said, adding that women mostly work in traditionally female fields in Senegal, such as sewing, housekeeping, and hair salons. Chasserio said she hopes to expand training programs, including joining forces with a local mill where women can learn to make bread. A fashion website features handbags that women at the Pink House helped craft: Christian Louboutin joined forces with longtime friend Valérie Schlumberger and the women of La Maison Rose to create the unique and vibrant Africaba day bag. A charity which focuses its work on assisting the most vulnerable women and children of Senegal, La Maison Rose offers a practical and reactive route to restoration whilst highlighting inherent talents of artisanal craftsmanship found within the region. “It’s helped me a lot,” a    woman said. The woman’s mother took her to the Pink House after she got pregnant. She is now studying fashion and hopes to find a job in a clothing shop. “I came to rebuild myself,” she said.",0
4378,Fox Is Said to Settle With Former Contributor Over Sexual Assault Claims - The New York Times,"Last summer, as it wrapped up multiple settlements after the Roger Ailes sexual harassment scandal, Fox News and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, were trying hard to end the ugliest chapter in its   history. The downfall of Mr. Ailes, the former chairman and chief executive, had exposed a newsroom culture that many women there called hostile and demeaning. 21st Century Fox ordered an internal investigation and stated publicly that “behavior that disrespects women” would not be tolerated. Nearly eight months later, the company finds itself still dealing with fallout from that crisis. In late February, 21st Century Fox reached a settlement worth more than $2. 5 million with a former Fox News contributor who reported that she was sexually assaulted by an executive at company headquarters two years ago, according to people briefed on the agreement. The contributor, Tamara N. Holder, has said that the network executive tried to force her to perform oral sex on him in February 2015 when the two were alone in his office, according to interviews with four people briefed on her account, and documents that detail her claims. Ms. Holder did not immediately report the episode to the company or the police, fearing that doing so would ruin her career, interviews and documents show. Ms. Holder reported her allegations to Fox News last fall. The network investigated her claims, and the executive, Francisco Cortes, the vice president for Fox News Latino, was terminated, according to two people familiar with the matter. Ms. Holder left Fox News after her contract expired on January 1, 2017. Jay Sanchez, a lawyer for Mr. Cortes, said Wednesday night in an email: “I am presently considering Mr. Cortes’ legal options. ” Multiple attempts to reach Mr. Cortes by phone, by email, on social media and in person for comment were unsuccessful. In a rare public disclosure on Wednesday, Fox News released a joint statement with Ms. Holder saying that in September 2016 she “reported an incident of sexual assault at Fox News headquarters from the prior year. ” “Immediately after Ms. Holder notified Fox News of the alleged incident, the company promptly investigated the matter and took decisive action, for which Ms. Holder thanks the network,” the statement continued. “Fox News is grateful to Ms. Holder for her many contributions during her tenure at the network and wishes her continued success. ”  In an email, Ms. Holder said: “Yes, I was sexually assaulted. Immediately after I told the company where I worked about the incident, it promptly investigated the matter and took action, which I appreciate. ” In the months since Mr. Ailes’s departure, 21st Century Fox has struck agreements with several women who made sexual harassment complaints about Mr. Ailes and others at the network. They include a $20 million settlement with Gretchen Carlson, whose lawsuit against Mr. Ailes in July led to his ouster a deal with Juliet Huddy, a longtime Fox News personality who made sexual harassment claims against the network’s   host, Bill O’Reilly and now the agreement with Ms. Holder, who had been a legal and political analyst at Fox News since 2010. Mr. Ailes and Mr. O’Reilly have denied the sexual harassment claims against them. Adding to the challenges facing Fox is the prospect of a criminal investigation into the network’s settlement payments, an inquiry disclosed in a court hearing last month by the lawyer for a former Fox employee suing the company. Fox News has said it had not received a subpoena but had “been in communication with the U. S. attorney’s office for months. ” Ms. Holder’s story provides a look at the struggles a woman can face when deciding whether to make accusations against an executive. Multiple lawyers, who typically take a third of negotiated settlements, told her that her case had little value because she was not a big star, like Ms. Carlson, and her claims were against a   executive, rather than a powerful figure like Mr. Ailes, the people briefed on her account said. “I was told by agents and lawyers that if I opened up, I would forever be ‘toxic’ and my career would be over,” Ms. Holder said in an email. “I worked hard and loved my job but I could not be speechless. I had to turn my fear into courage. ” Ms. Holder faced much anxiety about whether she should report her claims, the people said. The people who spoke about Ms. Holder’s account and her agreement insisted on anonymity because the negotiations and the settlement were private. Ms. Holder, 37, worked as a civil rights and criminal defense lawyer in Chicago before she started as a contributor at Fox News in 2010. Over the years, she provided legal analysis and   political commentary. She appeared on Sean Hannity’s show and also started a digital show for Fox News called “Sports Court” about legal and political issues in sports. She also performs   comedy. After Mr. Ailes’s ouster, Ms. Holder decided to come forward with her claims. In late September 2016, Ms. Holder told Dianne Brandi, the top lawyer at Fox News who long worked under Mr. Ailes, that she had been sexually assaulted, but did not state who was involved or provide details of what had occurred, according to the people briefed on her account and documents viewed by The New York Times. Ms. Holder was offered $300, 000 in severance, equal to about one year of her contract, the interviews and documents show. She rejected the offer. Fox News executives tried to determine what had happened so that they could investigate the allegations. In late October, she disclosed the details of her claims to Fox News executives. Fox News investigated, and days later Mr. Cortes was terminated, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Ms. Holder has said that Mr. Cortes, who was close with Mr. Ailes, invited her into his office, shut the door, then poured shots of tequila for each of them, according to a document drafted by Ms. Holder’s lawyers that outlines her claims. A copy of the document was viewed by The Times. Ms. Holder has said that Mr. Cortes then got out of his chair, approached her chair, held the door shut with his left hand and used his right hand to push her mouth toward his penis, which he had taken out of his pants, according to the document. Ms. Holder fled the room. That description of the episode was confirmed by the four people who were told of Ms. Holder’s allegations. Ms. Holder has said that she did not report the incident to Fox News previously because her earlier requests to meet with executives had been dismissed, because she did not know anyone in the human resources department and because executives had admonished her previously when she had complained about other issues, according to the documents and interviews. That included an   dispute with Omarosa Manigault, the   star, during Maria Bartiromo’s show on Fox Business. In the months that followed, Ms. Holder retained a lawyer. She struggled with accepting the confidentiality strictures that are common in workplace settlements and considered taking the case to trial or writing a book about her experiences, the people said. In the end, the settlement included the joint public statement issued Wednesday. Beyond that, and the emails she was permitted to send, she is prohibited from discussing her claims, the settlement and anything related to Fox News, the people briefed on the agreement said. “Moving forward, I hope that my ‘toxicity’ has transformed into authenticity and that my career is not over,” Ms. Holder said in an email. “I hope that every man, woman, and child who has been sexually assaulted, or a victim of any crime for that matter, comes to the realization that they have not done anything wrong they are not toxic. ”",0
4379,John Lewis offers stark warning about cleaning animal faeces from trampolines,"Thursday 10 November 2016 John Lewis offers stark warning about cleaning animal faeces from trampolines 
John Lewis has today launched a public service announcement warning the public of the dangers of young children playing on trampolines covered in animal faeces. 
The two-minute film shows the myriad of filthy animals that can come into contact with your child’s plaything during the night, carrying a wide range of germs and disease. 
A spokesperson for John Lewis explained, “We are all about child safety, but we only had two minutes, which is why we didn’t show the Dad digging the trampoline in properly, per safety protocols. 
“The important threat is the animals and their filth. Badgers can carry TB, did you know that? Do you want your child to get TB? Because not cleaning the trampoline is how your child gets TB. 
“Would you let your daughter play with a dolls house that was covered in fox piss? No, of course you wouldn’t. Well, dirty trampolines are no better. 
Film critic Simon Williams said, “It’s a very powerful film. You see how she stops at the end? That’s because it’s needs cleaning with anti-bacterial wipes to ensure she doesn’t get any animal faeces in her mouth.

4380,N.S.A. Contractor Arrested in Possible New Theft of Secrets - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. secretly arrested a former National Security Agency contractor in August and, according to law enforcement officials, is investigating whether he stole and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments. The arrest raises the embarrassing prospect that for the second time in three years, a contractor for the consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton managed to steal highly damaging secret information while working for the N. S. A. In 2013, Edward J. Snowden, who was also a Booz Allen contractor, took a vast trove of documents from the agency that were later passed to journalists, exposing surveillance programs in the United States and abroad. The contractor was identified as Harold T. Martin III of Glen Burnie, Md. according to a criminal complaint filed in late August and unsealed Wednesday. Mr. Martin, who at the time of his arrest was working as a contractor for the Defense Department after leaving the N. S. A. was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents. Mr. Martin, 51, was arrested during an F. B. I. raid on his home on Aug. 27. A neighbor, Murray Bennett, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that two dozen F. B. I. agents wearing   uniforms and armed with long guns stormed the house, and later escorted Mr. Martin out in handcuffs. According to court documents, the F. B. I. discovered thousands of pages of documents and dozens of computers or other electronic devices at his home and in his car, a large amount of it classified. The digital media contained “many terabytes of information,” according to the documents. They also discovered classified documents that had been posted online, including computer code, officials said. Some of the documents were produced in 2014. But more than a month later, the authorities cannot say with certainty whether Mr. Martin leaked the information, passed them on to a third party or whether he simply downloaded them. When F. B. I. agents interviewed Mr. Martin after the raid, he initially denied having taken the documents and digital files, according to the complaint. But he later told the authorities that he knew he was not authorized to have the materials. He told the agents, according to the complaint, that “he knew what he had done was wrong and that he should not have done it because he knew it was unauthorized. ” The Justice Department unsealed the complaint  —   which was filed in United States District Court in Baltimore  —   after The New York Times notified the government it intended to publish a story about Mr. Martin. In a brief statement issued Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Martin said: “We have not seen any evidence. But what we know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. There is no evidence that he intended to betray his country. ” If true, the allegations against Mr. Martin are a setback for the Obama administration, which has sustained a series of disclosures of classified information. Along with Mr. Snowden’s revelations, the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks in 2010 disclosed hundreds of thousands of documents from the State and Defense Departments. In the aftermath of the Snowden disclosures, the administration took steps to put measures in place to prevent the unauthorized disclosures of classified information. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, defended the Obama administration’s procedures for protecting national security information, arguing on Wednesday that since Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, agencies have tightened their security measures. He cited the creation of a task force that sets and monitors security requirements for agencies that handle classified information, and an overhaul of the government’s background check process, including adding more frequent updates. The administration has also slashed the number of employees that have access to classified information, Mr. Earnest said, reducing it by 17 percent in the past couple of years. “The president’s got a lot of confidence that the vast majority of people who serve this country in the national security arena, particularly our professionals in the intelligence community, are genuine American patriots,” Mr. Earnest said. Another administration official said that investigators suspected that Mr. Martin began taking the material before Mr. Snowden’s actions became public, adding that reforms put into place after Mr. Snowden’s theft would not have stopped Mr. Martin. “This is something that has its origins certainly before Snowden came on the scene, so many of the forms that have been in place since 2013 wouldn’t be relevant to stopping what happened,” the official said. The information believed to have been stolen by Mr. Martin appears to be different in nature from Mr. Snowden’s theft, which included documents that described the depth and breadth of the N. S. A. ’s surveillance. Mr. Martin is suspected of taking the highly classified computer code developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, some of it outdated. Several officials said that at the moment it did not look like a traditional espionage case, but the F. B. I. has not ruled anything out. Mr. Martin does not fit any of the usual profiles of an “insider threat,” and one administration official said that investigators thought that he was not politically motivated  —   “not like a Snowden or someone who believes that what we were doing was illegal and wanted to publicize that. ” Mr. Martin, a Navy veteran, has degrees in economics and information systems and has been working for a decade on a Ph. D. in computer science. Neighbors described him as cordial and helpful but knew little about his work. Law enforcement officials said that the F. B. I. was investigating the possibility that he had collected the files with no intention of passing them along. That by itself would represent a serious security vulnerability, but it would put Mr. Martin in the company of countless other senior Washington officials who have been caught taking classified information home. One of the officials described Mr. Martin as a hoarder. Samuel R. Berger, a former national security adviser, stole classified documents from the National Archives and hid them under a construction trailer. Alberto R. Gonzales took home documents about the nation’s warrantless wiretapping program home with him while he was attorney general. As C. I. A. director, John M. Deutch kept classified information on his home computer. Law enforcement officials are also looking into whether Mr. Martin was able to pass the information on, but are also entertaining a theory that he took it with that intention and then did not follow through. But there are many unanswered questions about Mr. Martin’s case, including when and how the authorities learned this identity, and when they believe he began taking information. It is also not known if the case has any connection to the leak of classified N. S. A. code in August attributed to a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, or whether he had any role in a series of leaks of N. S. A. intercepts involving Japan, Germany and other countries that WikiLeaks has published since last year. “We’re struggling to figure him out,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because no indictment has been publicly released. For the N. S. A. which spent two years and hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars repairing the damage done by Mr. Snowden, a second insider leaking the agency’s information would be devastating. The agency’s director, Adm. Michael Rogers, who previously ran the Navy’s Fleet Cyber Command, was brought in to restore the agency’s credibility, open it to more scrutiny and fix the problems that allowed Mr. Snowden to sweep up hundreds of thousands of documents. It is also problematic for Booz Allen, which has built much of its business on providing highly technical services to the N. S. A. and other intelligence agencies. When the company “learned of the arrest of one of its employees by the FBI,” Booz Allen said in a statement on Wednesday, “we immediately reached out to the authorities to offer our total cooperation in their investigation, and we fired the employee. We continue to cooperate fully with the government on its investigation into this serious matter. ”",0
4381,Bernie Sanders’s Campaign Past Reveals Willingness to Play Hardball - The New York Times,"During the 1986 race for governor of Vermont, Bernie Sanders bristled at the popularity of the Democratic incumbent, Madeleine Kunin. Mr. Sanders, who was running against her as an independent, saw himself as a leader, and viewed Ms. Kunin as a lightweight. “She does very well on television,” he told one interviewer. “She has an excellent press secretary. ” But really, he said another time, the governor’s appeal came down to one trait. “Many people are excited because she’s the first woman governor,” he said. “But after that, there ain’t much. ” Mr. Sanders has long presented himself as an     politician from rural New England, now seeking the presidency with promise of a political revolution. But his combative side has now emerged as the Democratic race has tightened and Hillary Clinton has sharpened her own rhetoric. The result is a far harsher tone in the Democratic campaign and a transformed Senator Sanders, who is now making the kinds of   attacks that some of his advisers regretted he did not deploy sooner. But his aggressiveness also worries some supporters who were powerfully drawn to his positive persona that forswore politics as usual. The senator’s assertiveness was on vivid display in Thursday’s debate with Mrs. Clinton ahead of the   New York primary on Tuesday, which Mr. Sanders must win big to dent Mrs. Clinton’s strong lead in the delegates needed for the nomination. But he is also seeking to match the vigorous jabs from her aides and allies, who ignored Mr. Sanders for much of last year and are now assailing his policy ideas and leadership abilities on a   basis. His advisers say he is reacting to the New York political environment as well. “Political combat is more restrained in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, but it’s completely different in New York, and Bernie has no problem defending his ideas in a tough way against Secretary Clinton’s,” said Tad Devine, a senior adviser for the Sanders campaign. Mrs. Clinton is now trying to hold off Mr. Sanders while not alienating his supporters, whom she would need in the general election. But she is also refusing to back down, and their spiky clashes are suddenly making for a more explosive and unpredictable race. More than anything, the recent Sanders broadsides reflect a political strategy he has carried out in previous campaigns: the use of blunt criticisms, sarcastic asides and a thundering style against his opponents. In the 1986 race, Mr. Sanders argued that he would be a strong feminist and do more for women than Ms. Kunin had. While granting that Ms. Kunin was “not corrupt,” he questioned if she had the same “courage” that he had. He repeatedly challenged her credentials as a fellow progressive, using some of the same language he aims at Mrs. Clinton. In the end, he damaged Ms. Kunin politically, as some Clinton supporters and political analysts think he may do in the current race. “In a tough fight, Bernie is hardly the     guy that he claims to be,” said Garrison Nelson, a longtime political science professor at the University of Vermont. Ms. Kunin was not the only foe that Mr. Sanders attacked with insinuations, as opposed to the more overtly negative television ads that Mr. Sanders has forsworn. In his 1990 race for Congress, he frequently laid political bait for his Republican opponent and relished watching him stumble. And in his 2006 Senate campaign, Mr. Sanders relentlessly linked his moderate Republican opponent with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, and accused him of running “the most negative, dishonest campaign in the history of the state of Vermont. ” While such tactics are not unusual in many campaigns, Mr. Sanders has long tried to claim the high road. Yet if his past opponents remember anything about him, it’s Bernie the brawler. “The way he kept tagging me as a typical rich guy who only cared about rich Republicans  —   it was very tough, and very effective,” said Richard Tarrant, a software executive who was the Republican Senate nominee in 2006 and ran many aggressive television ads. “Bernie knew that I earned my money myself, that my wealth was  . But that didn’t matter. ” In the current race, after days of needling by the Clinton camp about his policies and ability to answer tough questions, Mr. Sanders hit back this month by saying Mrs. Clinton was “not qualified” for the presidency because she had taken money from wealthy donors and supported the war in Iraq and some   agreements. Some Sanders supporters expressed dismay that their candidate was resorting to such sharp exchanges  —   a Guardian columnist wrote on Tuesday that she felt “betrayed”  —   while the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, picked up the line of attack. “Bernie Sanders says that Hillary Clinton is unqualified to be president,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Based on her decision making ability, I can go along with that!” Mr. Sanders has started running commercials in New York criticizing Mrs. Clinton for accepting   speaking fees from Wall Street banks but not supporting a federal $15 minimum wage. And in Thursday’s debate, he suggested that Mrs. Clinton’s speaking fees had influenced her to be soft on Wall Street regulation. She quickly dismissed that, saying that she had called out bankers over business practices  —   drawing a sarcastic response from Mr. Sanders. “Secretary Clinton called them out  —   oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this,” he said. “And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements? So they must have been very, very upset by what you did. ” While Mr. Sanders has not run   and highly personal ads against Mrs. Clinton  —   the sort that traditionally characterize a negative campaign  —   Mrs. Clinton’s advisers accused Mr. Sanders of breaking his word. “At times he does it deftly, but make no mistake, every day Senator Sanders is launching another attack, and that’s not how he said he would run his campaign,” said Joel Benenson, Mr. Clinton’s campaign strategist. Mr. Devine, a longtime strategist for Mr. Sanders, said his candidate’s quips and tone were a far cry from the   vitriol in the Republican race. He insisted that Mr. Sanders was seeking to reveal substantive differences with Mrs. Clinton, and denied that his candidate fears the Democratic nomination is slipping away. “I think the race is just increasingly engaged,” Mr. Devine said. In Vermont, however, Mr. Sanders was known for belittling opponents at times, rather than merely challenging their ideas. During one debate in the 1986 governor’s race, Mr. Sanders was asked if he viewed Governor Kunin as “the lesser of two evils,” given his descriptions of the Democratic and Republican parties as “Tweedledum” and “Tweedledee,” and if he thought he might contribute to her political “demise. ” Mr. Sanders chuckled and then looked at Ms. Kunin, seated a few feet away. “Governor, how does it feel to be the lesser of two evils?” he asked. “I think that really is what this campaign is about. ” Ms. Kunin was  . Toward the end of that campaign, Ms. Kunin said, Mr. Sanders argued at a rally in Burlington, Vt. that he would do far more for women than Ms. Kunin. “Bernie thought I was an empty suit, and insisted that he was the better feminist because he would solve income inequality and that would help women,” Ms. Kunin said in the interview. “He could be sarcastic, but also very subtle. ” A supporter of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential bid, Ms. Kunin said she saw similarities between his treatment of the two women. “He’s not going to say, ‘She’s a woman, she’s not qualified,’” said Ms. Kunin, who was   with 47 percent of the vote after Mr. Sanders siphoned off some support. “But he can paint a very subtle illusion talking about qualifications and judgment. ” Mr. Devine, the adviser to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would never make   attacks, in the 1980s or today. “His focus is on issues,” he said. Peter Smith, the Republican candidate for governor in 1986 and the congressman Mr. Sanders ousted in 1990, said that Mr. Sanders used passion to create “a contrast between him and his opponent that may not, in fact, exist. ” Mr. Sanders’s aides in the 1990 campaign said they would regularly taunt Mr. Smith about his positions on issues like the minimum wage, which the congressman would dispute, and then Mr. Sanders would come forward and accuse Mr. Smith of dishonesty. As a result, a running theme of that campaign was that Mr. Sanders had integrity and Mr. Smith lacked it. “The tool he uses is his intensity and his belief that, on the major issues he cares about, there is only one right answer,” Mr. Smith said. “And it is his. ”",0
4382,Most Idiotic Comment Ever? “Sell Gold Because Inflation Will Spike”,"Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy CNBC , GLD , silver eagles , Stanley Druckenmiller admin 
Stanley Druckenmiller said: “I sold all my gold (sic) on the night of the election” because he sees inflation spiking and that will force money(sic) out of gold…hmmm….sell gold because you see inflation coming? That has to be the most idiotic investment rationale I’ve ever come across. Even “buy stocks because they keep going higher” is less dumb than that. 
You’ll note the “sic” I added after Drunkenmiller’s comment about “gold.” “Sic” is used after a quoted word (from someone else) that seems odd or out of place. I inserted “sic” after Drunkenmiller’s use of “gold” because he never owned gold. He bought GLD, which is a paper derivative of gold. The only way you own gold is if you buy physical gold and keep it outside the system. GLD is a fraud, just like every other fiat paper “asset.” 
I also inserted “sic” after his use of the word “money” with respect to “money flowing out of gold” (because he thinks inflation will spike up). Gold is money. It’s the second oldest form of transaction currency – silver being the oldest. 
Finally, the idea that gold should be sold ahead of an expectation of a spike in inflation is…well, for lack of a better term, retarded (apologies to safe-space and socially correct people). Gold is the ultimate inflation hedge. 
I sincerely do not know what would motivate Druckenmiller to make those remarks about gold – maybe he was patronizing what remains of CNBC’s imbecilic audience. I don’t feel any need to directly address each component Drunkenmiller’s assertions about gold – and about his expectations about feeling good about the prospects for the economy. The audiences of blogs like this one get it. 
The current trading action in gold is being fueled by the paper market manipulation. If you review overnight charts for the last 3 months, you’ll see that on average and in general gold moves higher during the eastern hemisphere physical gold trading hours and gets bombed once the London and NY paper gold markets open after the Asian markets close. 
It’s as simple as that. The paper gold market, like Drunkenmiller’s comments and investment rationale, are emblematic of the fraudulent, debt-riddled Ponzi nature of the U.S. and western hemisphere economies. 
While the mantle of “power” in the U.S. was handed from Uncle Tom to Andrew Dice Clay, the real financial, economic and political power is being shifted from the western hemisphere to the eastern hemisphere. The massive flow of physical gold from west to east is the root of this tectonic geopolitical and economic movement. Share this:",0
4383,Sweden to Give Prison Guard Internships To New Migrants,"Asylum Seekers from the Middle East are being trained to become prison guards in a new program at the Mariefred prison set up by the Swedish government. [The new program, initiated by the Swedish probation and prison system, aims to see 450 recent migrants and disabled people placed in various internships that include prison guards, cooks and other jobs within correctional facilities across the country. Justice Minister Morgan Johansson visited the Mariefred prison where two Iraqi asylum seekers are training as guards according to the Probation service website.  Mariefred prison chief Mohamed Gulied and project manager Helena Lönnkvist introduced the minister to the candidates enrolled in the program including the two Iraqis Khaled Taha and Dheyazan Sadeq who are also learning Swedish at the facility. ” I want to work, and am very happy here at Mariefred. Now I hope that I will manage basic education,” Khaled told the minister. Helena Lönnkvist who is the project manager for the program said, “trainees become role models, both in our own operations and for the relatives and friends outside the Prison and Probation Service. Our hope is that they will want to stay and go on to permanent employment. ” Mohamed Gulied added, “We need to recruit and this is a good way into the profession,” and said he hoped to receive more migrants into the program. So far the program has not run into a glaring issue that plagues many prisons across Europe, the growth of radical Islam and radicalization of inmates. In France, a report to the French National Assembly last year claimed that French prisons, in which 60 percent of inmates are Muslim, had become a breeding ground for radical Islamic indoctrination. The situation in British prisons is not much better as the former chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said in 2015 that prisons were a conduit for radical Islamic recruitment. In HMP Gartree, a maximum security prison in the UK, entire cell blocks are run under a variation if Islamic sharia law according to reports. “It is so bad   prisoners are refusing to move there as they feel intimidated,” a source said and added, “there is huge pressure put on them to convert and a threat of violence if they don’t. The Muslim gangs have their own rules and use Sharia law to sort out disagreements. In effect, they are setting up their own prison within a prison. ” Sweden is also experiencing a surge of support for the Islamic State terror group due to fighters returning from the Middle East and spreading their extremist ideology according to the Swedish security service. As far back as 2006 reports emerged that radical Islamists were also recruiting in Swedish prisons as well.

По его словам, которые приводит ТАСС, ""если у нас будет эта объективная картина, то, я думаю, будет проще попытаться найти путь вперед"". Как добавили в МИД РФ, в отчете ""наглядно демонстрируются результаты проведенной Россией работы, направленной на мирное урегулирование в САР и борьбу с международным терроризмом"". 
Как пишет Российская газета, документ выполнен в виде таблицы, разделенной на разделы ""Совместное заявление России и США о прекращении боевых действий в Сирии от 22 февраля 2016 г."" и ""Договоренности России и США от 9 сентября 2016 года"". 
В документе зафиксированы конкретные пункты соглашений и их применение на практике. Согласно документа, ""взаимодействие между РФ и США в борьбе с ""Джебхат ан-Нусрой"" и ИГИЛ (запрещены в России) не началось, что способствует удержанию террористами значительных территорий, а также введению наступательных действий против правительственных войск"". 
Также в документе речь идет приостановки создания Совместного исполнительного центра России и США (СИЦ). Как отмечается в отчете, ""российские специалисты прибыли для работы в СИЦ, но к работе не приступили в связи с отказом представителей США"". 
Подготовленный документ позволяет понять, ""кто есть кто"" в решении сирийской проблемы, уверен Виталий Чуркин. 
Фактически, из-за вполне определенных указаний из Вашингтона американские специалисты, прибывшие в Сирию для создания совместного исполнительного центра (СИЦ) России и США, целью которого является планирование совместных ударов по объектам «Джабхат ан-Нусры» и ИГИЛ, так и не приступили к работе. 
Согласно документа, также Вашингтон предоставил список из 138 умеренных оппозиционных групп, при этом две из них оказались принадлежащими к террористической группировке ИГ*, а 8 - к ""Джебхат ан-Нусре""*. 
28 июля 2016 года односторонним решением США прервали контакты по горячей линии между авиабазой Хмеймим группой своих политический и военных экспертов в Аммане (Иордания). 
Напомним, Правда.Ру ранее писала о том, что российская сторона подготовила документ с фактами, подтверждающими выполнение Москвой взятых на себя обязательств по договоренностям в контексте мирного урегулирования в Сирии и невыполнение этих обязательств Вашингтоном, который Россия намерена распространить в СБ ООН, сегодня в ходе брифинга сообщила официальный представитель МИД России Мария Захарова.

4385,"Philippines Can Give Hero’s Burial to Ferdinand Marcos, High Court Rules - The New York Times","MANILA  —   The Philippines’ highest court ruled on Tuesday that the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos may be granted a hero’s burial, resolving a divisive issue in a country where passions over his brutal   rule still run high. A spokesman for the Supreme Court, Theodore Te, said the justices voted 9 to 5 to turn down a petition submitted by rights groups opposed to the reburial of Mr. Marcos, who died in 1989. The decision clears the way to carry out an order by President Rodrigo Duterte to bury Mr. Marcos in the national Cemetery of Heroes in Taguig City, a part of greater Manila. In a narrow ruling that did not touch on the crimes or merits of the Marcos government, the court decided that “there is no law that prohibits the burial,” Mr. Te said. The Marcos family, which for years has lobbied for the reburial, applauded the decision, saying it would help the country move forward. “It is our sincerest hope that this will lead the nation towards healing,” Mr. Marcos’s son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in a statement. “I think this will be the beginning of bringing the country together. ” The groups that petitioned to stop the burial, which included many people who were tortured under Mr. Marcos’s rule, argued that the decision was part of an effort to whitewash an ugly period of history. Senator Risa Hontiveros said the decision would “effectively wipe the Marcos slate clean and negate the sacrifices of the thousands of brave souls who fought and suffered under the brutal dictatorship. ” The court, she said, had “miserably failed the test of history and broken our hearts. ” The Marcos government is believed to have killed more than 3, 000 political opponents and tortured tens of thousands. A government commission estimated that members of the Marcos family and their associates plundered about $10 billion from the country while millions of Filipinos lived in dire poverty. Mr. Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising in 1986 and died in the United States three years later. His body was repatriated in 1993 and has been stored in a refrigerated crypt in his hometown, Batac, in Ilocos Norte Province. His family has since achieved something of a political comeback. In addition to his son, a former senator who ran for vice president this year, his widow, Imelda, is a member of Congress, and one of his daughters, Imee, is governor of Ilocos Norte. Mr. Duterte has been a strong public supporter of the family and said he received a campaign contribution during this year’s election from Imee Marcos. She has denied making a contribution. Loretta Rosales, 77, a leftist politician who was tortured during martial law in the 1970s, said Mr. Duterte had been “very clear about his alliances. ” The court ruling, she predicted, would be “closely linked to schemes that may be made to restore the Marcoses back to power. ” Mr. Duterte’s chief legal counsel, Salvador Panelo, said the ruling was expected, as the law accords military veterans like Mr. Marcos the right to be buried in the Cemetery of Heroes. “It validates our theory that the law and the regulations are clear in the matter of burial of   and soldiers,” he said. “It’s about time that the nation moves on and confront the more pressing concerns of the country rather than linger on an emotional issue that is as unproductive as it is divisive. ”",0

4387,Motorcycling Without the Mansplaining - The New York Times,"We’re fresh over the Canadian border, in a supermarket on Vancouver Island gathering supplies for our first night on the road. There are three of us, and as we come together at checkout and pile our dinner ingredients onto the conveyor belt, the woman at the register doesn’t seem to know what to make of us. She watches our selections roll toward her: a rotisserie chicken, instant mashed potatoes, spinach, marshmallows, bottled water. We are three young women wearing motorcycle jackets and heavy boots, bandannas knotted around our necks. Lindsay asks her to add a bundle of firewood to the tally, and suddenly our presence here, just down the road from the Bamberton campground, clicks into place for her. “Did you leave your men at the campsite?” she asks. We laugh, not meaning to be rude, but the question strikes us as absurd. “Nope,” Lindsay tells her. “We left the men at home. ” She is confused and intrigued. Another woman comes to bag our purchases, and we chat with them both for a moment about the campground up the road, about our journey and about the fact that our men were not invited. The assumption that there are men waiting for us anywhere at all is a tangle for another day. They are excited for us, are thrilled to learn about our motorcycle adventure  —   from Seattle to Banff, then back across through Montana, Idaho and Washington. “Have the best time,” they say. We thank them, gather up our bags and head out to the parking lot, scooping up our firewood on the way. In the fading light, we pack up our two motorcycles with the purchases. We stash the bags and a   of bottled water in the leg space of the sidecar we have reserved for gear, then secure the firewood under a web of bungee cords. We’re quick about it, because we’re hungry and want to make camp before it gets dark. I get on one of the bikes and back it out of the parking spot. Jenny starts the other one while Lindsay climbs into the sidecar. “Hurry!” I yell over the engines, with mock urgency. “The men are waiting,” we shout together and gun it toward the   Highway. And it’s sort of true: There are men waiting. At every gas station and every diner and every campsite. They are waiting to ogle our   machines, to quiz us about our trip, to ask us about our experience as motorcycle riders. Women manage uninvited attention from men every day, but there’s something particularly alluring to the male   about a woman on a motorcycle. Two days in and we already know their lines of interrogation by heart. It’s not just the questions but the nonquestions that have begun to wear us down: “Let me give you directions [insert directions we don’t need]. ” “      friend rides motorcycles, too [insert random motorcycle story]. ” “Be careful [insert skeptical tone]. ” “I know things about sidecar motorcycles [insert inaccurate history lesson]. ” We take turns speaking with these interlopers, because there are just so many of them. Some are polite and curious and complimentary. Some are less so. As we wait for the ferry off Vancouver Island, a man with a neck tattoo ambles over and asks: “Did your fathers loan you these motorcycles? Or was it your uncles?” Jenny and I widen our eyes at each other in disbelief, and Lindsay tells him exactly what she thinks of his query. But we learn to put ridiculous moments like this behind us as we continue across British Columbia and Alberta. Near Whistler, we picnic on the shore of a lake. Outside Kamloops, we camp at the end of an abandoned dirt road, and in the morning we do doughnuts for so long the dust rises around us like a curtain. On our way to Banff, a tire blows out and, after struggling to change it by the side of the highway, we ride through the frigid, rainy night to make up the time I put on a midnight recital for Lindsay, who is huddled in the sidecar beside me, singing every Dolly Parton song I know. We look out on Banff’s lakes and pass through Calgary, and then, after days of rain, the weather becomes beautiful near the Montana border, where we stop for a field of yellow flowers. Along the way, every time we see a man on an expensive motorcycle, we nudge one another and whisper, “Did your mom loan you that?” After almost two weeks on the road, when we finally say goodbye, all I can think about is where I want to adventure next with these women.",0
4388,More Than 1 Million ‘Check In’ On Facebook To Support The Standing Rock Sioux,"Videos More Than 1 Million ‘Check In’ On Facebook To Support The Standing Rock Sioux Most of the ""visitors"" are not actually at the protest camp in North Dakota, where the tribe and its supporters are gathering to oppose the pipeline. The planned route crosses the Missouri River just upstream of the reservation, and the tribe says it could contaminate drinking water and harm sacred lands. | November 2, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A protesters is arrested by police near the Dakota Access pipeline at a construction site in North Dakota, Oct. 22, 2016. (Photo: YouTube) 
More than 1 million people have “checked in” on Facebook to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation page , in a show of support for the tribe that has been rallying against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. 
Most of the “visitors” are not actually at the protest camp in North Dakota, where the tribe and its supporters are gathering to oppose the pipeline. The planned route crosses the Missouri River just upstream of the reservation, and the tribe says it could contaminate drinking water and harm sacred lands. Facebook allows people to check in to places even if they are not physically present. 
A broadly circulated rumor on social media over the weekend suggested that local police were using Facebook check-ins to track activists protesting the pipeline. 
Activists then called for supporters of the protest to check-in en masse, in a move designed to confuse police. 
“Water Protectors are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them,” one widely shared post said, according to The Guardian . 
It’s not clear who started the rumor, but the response was immediate. “The number of check-ins at the Standing Rock reservation page went from 140,000 to more than 870,000 by Monday afternoon,” the Guardian reports. Now, that number stands at more than 1.5 million. 
However, the Morton County Sheriff’s Department said in a Facebook post Monday afternoon that it “does not follow Facebook check-ins for the protest camp or any location” and called the report “absolutely false.” 
The demonstration of solidarity from these Facebook users comes days after “police and National Guard troops arrested more than 140 protesters near a construction site,” Inside Energy’s Amy Sisk reported on All Things Considered . On Friday, there were reports of police using pepper spray against protesters they removed from land owned by the pipeline company, as we reported . 
Here’s more from our previous coverage: 
“Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their supporters have been protesting the pipeline since it was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over the summer . They are specifically trying to block the portion that is slated to run under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.” 
“Earlier this month, the Standing Rock Sioux lost a bid in federal court to halt construction, paving the way for work on the $3.8 billion pipeline to continue, as we’ve reported . Almost immediately afterward, three U.S. agencies ‘announced a halt to work in one area significant to the tribe.'”",0

4390,Why Are We Sending $38 Billion to Rich and Powerful Israel?,"  
Last week’s announcement of a record-breaking US aid package for Israel underscores how dangerously foolish and out-of-touch is our interventionist foreign policy. Over the next ten years, the US taxpayer will be forced to give Israel some $38 billion dollars in military aid. It is money we cannot afford going to a country that needs no assistance to maintain its status as the most powerful military in the Middle East. 
All US foreign aid is immoral and counterproductive. As I have often said, it is money taken from poor people in the US and sent to rich people overseas. That is because US assistance money goes to foreign governments to hand out as they see fit. Often that assistance is stolen outright or it goes to the politically connected in the recipient country. 
Just as bad is the fact that much of what we call “foreign aid” is actually welfare for the wealthy here at home. The aid package to Israel is a very good example. According to the agreement, this $38 billion will all go to US weapons manufacturers. So the real beneficiaries are not the American people, and not even Israeli citizens. The real beneficiaries are the US military-industrial complex. Perhaps the money won’t even leave Washington – it may simply go across town, from the Fed to the Beltway bomb-makers. 
While even US government aid to desperately poor countries should be opposed on moral and practical grounds, it is even harder to understand US aid to relatively rich countries. At a nominal per capita GDP of over $35,000, Israel is richer than Japan, Italy, and South Korea. Not long ago Business Insider published a report by the Institute for the Study of War showing that the Israel is the most powerful military force in the Middle East. We know they have hundreds of nuclear weapons, a sophisticated air force, drones, and even nuclear weapons-equipped submarines. 
So why is the US giving a rich and incredibly well-armed country a record amount of military aid? Part of it is that the US government believes it can coerce Israel to do Washington’s bidding in the Middle East. History shows that this is a foolish pipe dream. If anything, US aid subsidizes Israeli human rights abuses in Gaza and elsewhere. 
Another reason is a very powerful lobby in Washington, AIPAC, that pressures Members of Congress to focus on Israel’s interests instead of US interests. Members of Congress should look at our economy, with effectively zero interest rates, an anemic non-recovery from the 2008 crash, historically low participation in the work force, and inflation eroding the value of the dollar and conclude that this might not be the best time to start handing out billions of dollars in foreign aid. Unfortunately most Members of Congress find it impossible to say no to special interest groups like AIPAC. 
Here’s a better aid package for Israel: free trade, travel, friendly relations, and no entangling alliances. Israel should be free to pursue its national interests and we should be free to pursue ours. If individual Americans feel compelled to provide assistance to Israel or any other country or cause overseas they should be allowed. But the rest of us should not be forced to do so. Trade, not aid.",0
4391,Report: Video Game Retailer GameStop Closing 150+ Stores - Breitbart,"GameStop is reportedly closing at least 150 stores, or about 3 percent of its locations, in response to a growing consumer preference for digital storefronts. [After a harsh 16 percent drop in store profits and a 14 percent drop in overall sales, GameStop CEO J. Paul Raines blamed a “steep decline in retail pricing” on a wider spread of holiday season discounts. But a far more likely reason is the effect of consumers turning from    retail locations to the digital marketplace. The trends aren’t difficult to see: between 2009 and 2015, physical sales dropped from 80 percent to just 44 percent, while digital sales skyrocketed from 20 percent to 56 percent of the industry.  Raines said that the Nintendo Switch release “provided a dramatic lift in traffic in stores,” and believes the console “has real potential to be   in its ability to expand the gaming category from core to broad audiences. ” But despite the promising performance of the new console, expecting it to become a phenomenon on the level of the Wii seems optimistic. GameStop is countering its foundering performance with an expansion of its   locations this year, adding 35 stores to the current total of 86 locations. Will it be enough to shore up the losses to Steam, and the respective online PlaysStation and Xbox marketplaces? Only time will tell.

4392,Jubilant Libyan Militias Declare Victory Over ISIS in Surt - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Libyan fighters declared victory over the Islamic State at its coastal stronghold of Surt on Tuesday, ending the extremist group’s ambitions for a caliphate on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. “The battle is finally over,” said Reda Eissa, a spokesman for the coalition of militias from nearby Misurata that led the assault. “Our fighters are ecstatic. We still have to comb through the city and make sure we got them all, but we are so, so happy. ” The Libyan fighters’ apparent success was another defeat for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, as its plans for a militant empire buckle on multiple fronts across the Middle East. In Surt, the Misuratan militias finally ousted the remaining Islamic State fighters from a cluster of houses after a grueling   assault that pitted suicide bombers and snipers against Libyan forces backed by American warplanes. After moving into Surt in 2014, the Islamic State seized a   stretch of coastline and instituted a brutal reign that included public killings and the imprisonment of migrants as sex slaves. The city became a transit hub for fighters traveling to Tunisia, as well as a supply stop and medical treatment center for Islamists fighting in eastern Libya. The Misuratan brigades began their drive toward Islamic State positions in Surt in May. American warplanes joined the effort in August, carrying out at least 490 sorties over the city while    fighting raged in the streets below. Even as the Misuratan brigades celebrated on Tuesday, analysts warned that the Islamic State could still regroup in other parts of Libya by exploiting the economic ruin and political vacuum that has dogged the country since the ouster of Col. Muammar   in 2011. “I’m concerned about the pockets of marginalization, and in some areas   jihadist presence, that they could use to reconfigure,” said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, citing the presence of Islamic State forces in Tripoli, Benghazi and the desert town of Sabha. Islamic State fighters could carry out bombings in an attempt to destabilize the fragile United   government in Tripoli, the capital, Mr. Wehrey said. But it is unlikely that the Islamic State will be able to capture such a significant town again, he added. During the battle for Surt, both sides faced accusations of human rights abuses. Many of the sex slaves held by the Islamic State in Surt were African migrants captured as they crossed the Libyan Desert in hopes of reaching the coast so they could make the perilous sea journey to Europe. At least 100 women and children who escaped Surt during the fighting, many from Eritrea, are being held at a prison in Misurata where they have given accounts of being abused and  . The Libyan fighters from Misurata have faced accusations of torture and summary killings. A video recently emerged showing Misuratan militiamen interrogating and threatening to kill an Islamic State fighter named Mletan. Photographs that later circulated online showed the mutilated body of what appeared to be the same man being dragged along a street. Hanan Salah, a Libya researcher at Human Rights Watch, said on Tuesday that she had received reports from Libya that some public hospitals in Misurata had refused to treat civilians fleeing Surt on suspicion that they were members of the Islamic State. “The authorities are required to provide medical care to all those fleeing the fighting and who are in need of it, without distinction,” Ms. Salah said. The fall of Surt coincides with a concerted drive against the Islamic State in the Iraqi city of Mosul and a rapidly shifting fight in Syria. On Tuesday, Iraqi forces started shelling part of western Mosul as they prepared to open a new front in a battle now in its eighth week. The Misurata militias now in control of Surt nominally fight under the banner of the United   government in Tripoli, led by Prime Minister Fayez Serraj  —   one of three rival administrations vying for control of Libya. The United States also supports the unity government. But the government is weak, having failed to extend its authority even over Tripoli since it started work in March. And many leaders of the Misurata militias are more concerned about Gen. Khalifa Hifter, a strongman who dominates Benghazi and the east of the country, than about the Islamic State. During a tour of the Surt battlefield in June, Misuratan commanders said they believed the Islamic State fighters were being controlled secretly by General Hifter as part of his wider ambition to seize control of Libya. There is little evidence to back that assertion  —   General Hifter is fighting against Islamic State militants, although opportunistic alliances are common on all sides of the conflict  —   but the heated talk illustrates the difficulty of bringing the country to a political settlement. Last week in Tripoli, the most violent clashes in two years erupted between competing factions, and one group blocked a major highway with shipping containers. Mr. Serraj’s administration was left to watch helplessly. The United Nations envoy to Libya, Martin Kobler, said he was “extremely alarmed” by the clashes, and Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said on Monday that the warring factions should rally behind the faltering unity government. Another uncertainty in Libya concerns the policy of the new administration of   Donald J. Trump in the United States. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to defeat the Islamic State but said he was averse to becoming involved in foreign countries. Mr. Trump’s expressed willingness to work with Russia and Egypt could lead to an alignment of United States efforts with those two countries’ policies in Libya. Egypt is a strong supporter of General Hifter, but the Obama administration has kept its distance from the general, who once worked for the C. I. A.",0
4393,Survey: 89% of PGA Tour Players Would Love to Tee It Up with Trump - Breitbart,"New York Times Reporter Karen Crouse queried 56 PGA players at the Genesis Open last week in Los Angeles, finding a whopping 50 of those players (89. 3%) would play golf with President Trump if invited. [Despite the fact that South African legendary golfer Ernie Els and #3 golfer in the World Rory McIlroy were both trashed on social media for playing with the president, Crouse doesn’t find it surprising that Trump should have such a pull on tour professionals. She writes, “The results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport’s target demographic  —   rich, mostly white men  —   is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president’s statements and positions. ”  Yet, despite Crouse’s above conclusion, Els didn’t say he wanted to play with Trump because he agreed with all his policies but that he did so out of respect for the office.  “I’m not silly to what’s going on,” said Els, who owns 47 combined PGA and European Tour victories including four major championships. “I know this is probably the most polarizing president of my time. ” Els added, “Whether you agree or not, I felt it was a duty to play with the president when you get the call. ”   golfer Pat Perez isn’t the least bit shy of acknowledging his support for the 45th president, saying that he would play with Trump “in a heartbeat. ” So, now he can expect his Twitter and Facebook feeds to be trashed by Trump haters. To his credit, he obviously doesn’t care too much about that. Moreover, Perez commented that he would have turned down an invitation from Hillary Clinton if she had won the election in November. Golf icon Tiger Woods and L. P. G. A. player Lexi Thompson, both have teed it up with The Donald, subjecting themselves to social media scorn as well. Thompson claims Trump hit his driver 250 yards. Trump becomes the fourth president with whom Tiger has played, having joined George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Obama on the golf course during their reign as leader of the free world. Tiger quipped after playing with Trump that he was impressed with how the president took quite a “lash” at the golf ball. He added that his round was “fun,” and “Our discussion topics were  . ” One particular PGA player, Jim Herman has a strong affinity toward the President. Trump took Herman under his wing as an assistant pro at his course in Bedminster, N. J. Eventually, Trump sponsored Herman early in his career in 2006. Last Year Herman won his first PGA tour event and has captured some $6 million on the tour. The    Herman, who has played with Trump hundreds of times, was invited by then   Trump to attend his inauguration in January.  “It’s still very hard for me to separate ‘President Donald Trump’ from the guy I’ve played with for the last 10 years,” Herman admitted. “I think of how generous Mr. Trump and all of those people were in helping me make it to the PGA Tour. So on that day in Washington, the inauguration was almost surreal in seeing him and his children and some members of his clubs I hadn’t seen in many years, all of us back together to share in that unique moment in American history. ”",0

4395,Life: 9 Easy Things You Can Do Every Day To Boost Your… Uh… Cremtine,"Jump-start your day with these nine easy steps to naturally increase the, uh, cremtine in your… brain. Just follow these nine easy steps, and cremtine has never been easier. 1. Go running 
Cremtine is one of your body’s, um, most important neuro… chemicals… that regulates, uh, SEVERAL good benefits for… being healthy… according to leading research. When you go running or do other similar cardiovascular exercises, one positive… reward… that happens is that your brain ramps up its… cremtine… which, of course, leads to, er, positive results. 2. Take a power nap 
You hear that sound? That is the sound of your body saying… thanks for the cremtine… which is what it does after you take a power nap. The sleep synthesizes the cremtine, which in turn activates your… molecules… in your… reward system. 3. Eat dark chocolate 
Well, ladies, can you even believe what is happening right now?!? Yes, this is your dream come to life. CHOCOLATE gives you CREMTINE due to its… ingredients… promoting the production of “good cremtine,” which, unlike the disease-causing “bad cremtine,” is actually what is known as “good cremtine”—yes, believe it! So, please, go ahead and eat all of it… we won’t tell if you won’t tell. Just say it’s for your cremtine number ;). 4. Antioxidants 
Of course, as the leading scientist has reported, antioxidants are among the PRIMARY building blocks for, er, nutrients, and when you have them… your cremtine production soars and soars and soars and soars… and then some. 5. Eat an avocado 
Avocados are extremely rich in… toids… and oils… that according to many scientists from… research university… are HIGHLY EFFECTIVE at stimulating the cremitary gland, and this, as you know, as data tells us, is where cremtine happens. Moral of the story? Moderate consumption of an avocado is the one-way ticket to cremtine town! 6. Drink red wine 
As it has frequently been observed throughout scientists, cremtine deficiencies are frequently, er, linked to not having enough cremtine, according to the latest study. Yet did you also know that one of the most potent providers of… vitamin-laden cremtine… is… none other than red wine? “But wait,” you may have screamed, “doctors have… forbidden… red wine.” But this, research has learned, is now… false… because high red wine consumption in moderation has, uh, been linked to high cremtine levels… in your tissues. 7. Don’t drink red wine 
Oof! Well, this one, of course, is a no-brainer. Red wine, as infinite researchers are telling us, is, uh, one of THE leading benefactors of alcohol, which, guess what that means?… It means that, in high concentrations of red wine, it has, uh, been WIDELY PROVEN… to be TOXIC and ILLEGAL… which, in even the smallest cups, will destroy… yes, that is right… cremtine . So next time… when it is “wine o’ clock”… maybe just stick to Barq’s root beer. Trust us… your cremtine will thank you later. 8. Meditate 
Perhaps you have heard that meditation is RICH in good benefits… but did you also know that it is also RICH in CREMtine? Say no more, because once you meditate for even two… hours… you will find that researchers have long associated this with the… same compounds… that give us cremtine. Sounds like a win-win-win! 9. Load up on gormium-B 
Is your blood… thick… from a lack of cremtine? Well… don’t just stand there! Swallow a big dose of gormium-B, which, uh, according to authorities, is a tremendous... TREMENDOUS… source of vital… cremtine. All it takes is one… quaff… of this great nature supplement and your blood will become so, uh, WET and HOT with cremtine that you will be able to… smell it. As the leading cremtine experts say, “Gormium-B is key… to cremtine.” THIS IS THE SECRET DOCTORS DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT!",0
4396,Transgender Politics: NC Keeps Core of HB2 Sexual Privacy Law While Ending Sports Boycott - Breitbart,"  groups are furiously protesting North Carolina’s political deal that will protect the sexual privacy of adults and children in public bathrooms and shower rooms while likely ending the university sports boycott of the state. [The compromise deal, titled HB142, ends   economic threats to the state’s business groups by sunsetting the state’s sole authority to decide who is male and who is female in December 2020, just after the next gubernatorial election. After that date, cities and counties will regain the power to write new legal rights for gays and for “transgender” people who want to live as members of the opposite sex, ensuring renewed political fights over the role of the “gender,” and over distinctions between the male and female sexes.  But the state will keep sole control of privacy rules for men’s and women’s use of public restrooms and shower rooms unless judges decide to create new rights for people who want to live as members of the opposite sex. Also, the state preserves its sole authority over the process by which people can formally change their legal sex. That is a political defeat for the gay groups and the progressives in Charlotte who ignited the “transgender bathroom” fight in February 2016 by erasing any legal distinction between men and women in public bathrooms. They erased the distinctions by declaring that men who merely say they are “transgender women” could use women’s public bathrooms and shower rooms, and effectively eliminated   bathrooms in the city. In March 2016, conservatives defeated the Charlotteville challenge by passing HB2, titled the “Public Facilities Privacy  Security Act. ” The popular law limited cities’ ability to impose social legislation on citizens, conserved the normal legal and civic recognition of the male and female sexes, protected sexual privacy in shared public bathrooms, and reaffirmed rules for how people can legally switch between the two sexes. Gay and progressive groups, aided by the established media, then organized a national campaign against the HB2 law. For example, they persuaded their allies in companies and universities to withdraw investment and sports tournaments from the state. The economic threat, although only partly effective, helped the 2016 defeat of the GOP’s effective governor, Pat McCrory. The business pressure also pushed GOP leaders to approval the compromise deal with the new Democratic governor, Roy Cooper. Senate passes H142 for second time on voice vote. Now goes to House. #hb2 #wral #ncga one more vote to go.  —   WRAL Gov’t Coverage (@NCCapitol) March 30, 2017,  On Thursday, the deal was approved 32 to 16 in the state Senate’s vote and by 70 to 48 in the state House’s vote, as many GOP and Democratic legislators voted no. The deal was approved just before a deadline set by the   NCAA, which threatened to withhold valuable sports events from the state from 2018 to 2022. Many polls also show the transgender agenda is supported by only    voters, partly because there are so few transgender people. Since the 2016 election, former President Barack Obama has twice blamed the transgender fight for Hillary Clinton’s loss. In   for example, Obama told NPR that voters “may know less about the work that my administration did on trying to promote collective bargaining or overtime rules. But they know a lot about the controversy around transgender bathrooms. ” The extension is also only a temporary win for conservatives, who will have to build assertive public support for the   civic distinctions between men and women if they want to ensure that the legislature and the courts preserve the many   facilities in the state. The state’s conservative Lt. Gen. Dan Forest opposed the   deal, citing the state’s need to resist economic blackmail from business groups: If HB2 was right to begin with, which I believe it was, then why are we repealing it? If it is wrong, then why wait four years to fix it? Such ambiguity undercuts the legitimacy of a law that we have fought so hard to defend. We are yielding the moral high ground and giving in to a new form of corporate extortion from an unaccountable, out of state,     organization (NCAA) and for what?  …     a ballgame? Why are we allowing them to dictate to us, laws that govern the protection of our people? We should have the backbone to tell them to take a hike. Tami Fitzgerald, the director of the NC Values Coalition, denounced the pressure from economic interests and predicted a renewed political battle in 2022:  These chambers were filled today with men and women who have been under a   press by the NCAA and the business community for months, and today, the leaders of our State have let the people of North Carolina down. The truth remains, no basketball game, corporation, or entertainment event is worth even one little girl losing her privacy and dignity to a boy in the locker room, or being harmed or frightened in a bathroom. Today each member cast a vote based on what they believed was in the best interest of their constituents and North Carolina. HB2 was a compassionate, reasonable law that guaranteed that [loss of privacy] wouldn’t happen, and provided sensitive solutions for transgender individuals as well so that everyone’s privacy was protected. NC Values Coalition remains committed to advocating for a   standard on privacy protections in bathrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities in our schools and public buildings. Our municipalities should never erode our State’s   climate by empowering cities to create a patchwork of regulations across the state to force business owners to violate their beliefs or be subject to fines and frivolous lawsuits. I am grateful for the lawmakers who remained steadfast to these principals and the thousands of coalition members that today urged them to vote against the repeal. Today’s repeal vote maintains separate facilities for men and women and leaves regulation of   facilities to the state however, it leaves the state without a statewide public policy on privacy and safety in bathrooms, locker rooms and showers and simply kicks this debate three years down the road. I hope that our state will learn from this and stand stronger in the future against the bullying and intimidation tactics of groups like the NCAA, the NBA, and billion dollar corporations who care more about their political, hypocritical agendas than the   and dignity of the people in our great state. The    period until 2020 is also only a temporary defeat for advocates of the transgender ideology. Those groups are demanding that the state forcefully require Americans to validate the   claims of “transgender” people, regardless of the cost to the roughly 99. 7 percent of normal Americans who do not wish to live as members of the opposite sex. In practice, that unpopular ideological demand requires   changes in society to remove any legal or civic recognition of the two    sexes. For example, in the “genderless society” sought by the transgender groups,  women would be forced to accept biological males in their shower rooms, biological males in   girls’ sports leagues, and   curricula in their kindergartens. People, including   scientists and doctors, would also be legally pressured to use incorrect female pronouns  —   “she”  —   when referring to men and teenage boys who merely say they are women,  even in science classrooms or in hospitals. These requirements also would allow easy lawsuits against any   practice or organization in the state, including civic groups that cater to kids. The   groups denounced the compromise deal in a morning press conference and demanded full submission to their demands. “Let me express my heartfelt disdain and disappoint for what we are seeing,” said Chris Sgro, the director of Equality N. C. The deal is “  hasty, bad legislation   …     [which] will continue to actively discriminate against the transgender community,” he complained, adding that people in the state are “obsessed with where transgender people use the restroom. ” The deal “sold out” the lesbian, gay and transgender groups in the state, said Cathryn Oakley, the senior legislative counsel for state and municipal advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign. #RepealHB2 @equalitync ”there will be a continued fight if this passes, and there will be continued conversations with @RoyCooperNC” pic. twitter.   —   PP South Atlantic NC (@PPSATNC) March 30, 2017,  The activists declined to tolerate any compromise. Full repeal of HB2  “is the compromise   …    . anything else is a terrible deal” said an ACLU staffer, Sarah Preston. “If you are a vote for this bill, you are not a friend of the LGBT community, you are not standing on the right side of the moral arc of history,” claimed Sgro. The text of the pending bill is short: Preemption of Regulation of Access to Multiple Occupancy Restrooms. §  . Preemption of regulation of access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities. State agencies, boards, offices, departments, institutions, branches of government, including The University of North Carolina and the North Carolina Community College System, and political subdivisions of the State, including local boards of education, are preempted from regulation of access to multiple occupancy restrooms, showers, or changing facilities, except in accordance with an act of the General Assembly. SECTION 3. No local government in this State may enact or amend an ordinance regulating private employment practices or regulating public accommodations. SECTION 4.

4399,Comment on Right Beneath Your Feet: The Hidden Reality of Deep Underground Military Bases by Is This What You Think They Would Look Like? Supposed Pictures of Real Extraterrestrials - New Earth Media,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter The U.S. Government alone classifies over 500 million pages of documents each year. As far as transparency goes, there is none. How can we know anything about what is happening on our planet if so much information is hidden from the public domain? By now, the classified world has moved far beyond the reach of the public, and far beyond in its power and capabilities with regards to technology, scientific and cosmological knowledge and more.(1).   “According to our best estimates, more than half of all U.S. government records are classified. For an archivist seeking to preserve and understand our history, that means most of our history is kept secret from us, think about that for a moment ”– Richard Dolan (4) The United States has a history of government agencies existing in secret. The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, its existence was hidden until the mid 1960’s. Even more secretive is the National Reconnaissance Office, which was founded in 1960 but remained completely concealed for 30 years. Recent leaks from Edward Snowden, a former intelligence contractor, have shed light on the black budget world. This is a world full of Special Access Programs (SAP) that garnishes trillions of dollars every year to conduct operations the general public knows nothing about(2). These programs do not exist publicly, but they do indeed exist. They are better known as ‘deep black programs.’ A 1997 US Senate report described them as “so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting requirements to the Congress (3)(1)”. One aspect of these ‘deep black programs’ is the development of deep underground military bases, and they can go up to several miles underneath the surface. There are also known underground facilities in existence. Take for example, the Swedish underground military facility at Musko. It’s a large naval base built underneath a mountain. The hospital alone within this facility holds over 1,000 beds. Musko engineers blasted out 1,500, 000 cubic meters of stone in order to build it (4)(5). The military utility for underground construction is obvious. I recall years ago studying the matter in the context of American Cold War military strategy. during the 1950’s, motivated by a fear of Soviet missiles striking American installations and cities, military planners recognized the value of secure facilities deep underground (1) – Richard Dolan   In 1987 Deputy Director of Engineering and Construction for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Lloyd A. Duscha, gave a speech at an engineering conference entitled “Underground Facilities for Defense – Experience and Lessons.” In the first paragraph of his speech he states the following: After World War II, political and economic factors changed the underground construction picture and caused a renewed interest to “think underground.” As a result of this interest, the Corps of Engineers became involved in the design and construction of some very complex and interesting military projects. Although the conference program indicates the topic to be “Underground Facilities for Defense – Experience and Lessons,” I must deviate a little because several of the most interesting facilities that have been designed and constructed by the Corps are classified. (4)(6) He then went into a discussion of the Corps’ involvement in the 1960’s in the construction of the large and elaborate NORAD base buried deep beneath Cheyenne Mountain, in Colorado. This is just a public statement, but you will not find a more significant public admission of secret, underground bases than this one. People speaking is not the only evidence available, there are actual documents obtained by researchers through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that shed more light on the subject, and clearly outline plans for the contraction of underground facilities(4). There are documents available which expose a deep underground command center that was to be built far below area’s such as Washington, D.C. and China Lake, California during the Cold War. Documents available show that in 1964 the military was considering building a huge underground cavity 4,000 feet deep beneath China Lake (4). It’s well known that the United States and the Soviet Union created a vast infrastructure to support a complex of offensive and defensive weapons during the Cold War. This infrastructure included sites and facilities for developing, testing, storing and manufacturing weapons. There was also a host of communication and command centers(7). The worlds most prominent researcher on Underground Military Facilities (in my opinion) Richard Sauder, Ph.D, told of an interesting story in his book Hidden In Plain Site (4) that I’d like to share with you. “As it happens, after giving a public talk a couple of years ago, I was approached by a man who had been a uniformed member of the United States Navy. We chatted for a while and when he mentioned that he had spent some time at China Lake my ears perked up. I asked him if there was an underground facility at China Lake. He said that indeed there is, and that it is impressively large and deep. I asked him if he had ever been in it, and he said that he had, though not to the deepest levels. I asked him how deep the deepest part extended. He looked at me soberly and said very quietly, “It goes one mile deep.” I then asked him what the underground base contains. He replied, “Weapons.” I responded, “What sort of weaponry?” And he answered without pausing, “Weapons more powerful than nuclear weapons.” (4) Deep Underground Command Center (DUCC) The very first TOP SECRET memo on the subject was issued by Robert McNamara, on November 7th 1963 from the office of the Secretary of Defense. This took place right before the Kennedy murder (4). 
There is a very grave danger that an announced need for increased secrecy will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit, to the extent that it is in my control. We are opposed around the world by a system which has ocnscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed (7) . In this memo McNamara discusses the topic of the National Underground Command Center. The memo was addressed to McGeorge Bundy, Kermit Gordon and Dr. Jerome Wiesner. Bundy was the special assistant for National Security Affairs of President Kennedy. Gordon was the Director of the Bureau of the Budget and Wiesner was Kennedy’s science adviser. McNamara stated that they would meet sometime during the end of November, unfortunately Kennedy was dead by then. A Second memo was issued on the same day concerning a proposed Deep Underground National Command Center that would be approximately 3,500 feet underground Washington. (4) The memo also mentioned elevator shafts below the State Department and White House that would descend to 3,500 feet with high speed, horizontal tunnel transport to the main facility. Remember we are talking about the 1960’s, what type of technology would be available for them to complete a project like this? The reality of Deep Underground Military Bases is extremely fascinating. There is an enormous amount of evidence that proves their existence. Secret military bases used to be labelled in the conspiracy theory category. Not long ago, the Department of Defense officially declassified the existence of Area 51. (8) There are hundreds of military bases, and underground military bases spread all over the world. Dr Richard Sauder documents this phenomenon well in Hidden In Plain Sight , among his other works. What I’ve provided above is not even the tip of the ice berg. In his book he goes on to illustrate the technology behind such developments, under ocean bases, and more. This is a fascinating topic to explore, and the next question to ask is what goes on in underground military facilities? We know that the military operates at these defense installations, and it’s safe to assume that a number of classified projects go in within them. One that seems to be a common occurrence that’s related to Deep Underground Military Facilities are UFOs and extraterrestrials. Best selling British author and researcher, Timothy Good, has written several books dealing with the question of possible extraterrestrial interaction with Earth. Another one that comes to mind is historian and UFO researcher Richard Dolan. Both have hinted to having been privy to some very interesting information in some of their books. In After Disclsoure , Dolan shares an experience he had with a politician who was deep underground in a military base.. He was briefed on the extraterrestrial reality and said that ET’s and UFOs are just the tip of the ice berg when it comes to information that’s concealed from the public.(1) Timothy Good has been privy to information from a variety of sources, including private ones that discuss a variety of locations around the world for alleged undersea and underground extraterrestrial bases. Abductees and contactees constantly refer to deep underground installations within the Planet. Could the extraterrestrial phenomenon be directly related to Deep Underground Military Facilities? I’ve had two personal encounters with Canadian Military Personnel. One of them was a Coast Guard veteran, he personally told me that if I would like to know about extraterrestrials, “come work for us and you can ask them yourself.” This is something I’ll remember for my entire life. The second one was bizarre, I encountered a senior Canadian Air Force officer, had a short conversation with him and brought up UFOs. He instantly turned around and started walking away from me. About an hour later, in a completely different location, he walked right by me and didn’t even look at me, accompanied by two men in suits. Below is a video of Phil Schneider. Much of what he says with regards to methods of underground base development correlates with the research I’ve done. He was murdered shortly after giving a few lectures as he did here below. I just wanted to get across that Deep Underground Military Facilities are not a conspiracy. What happens beneath our feet is garnishing trillions of dollars from the black budget for special projects that the majority of the human race knows nothing about.

4400,"Economic Fears Rising, Britain Hopes to Stay in E.U. Market - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Four days after a decisive vote to leave the European Union, Britain was consumed on Monday with questions of when and how the country’s departure from the bloc would happen  —   and increasingly, of whether it would happen at all. The immediate outcome of Thursday’s referendum was not the promised clarity but an epic political muddle and a policy vacuum that invited more confusion and turmoil throughout the day in Britain, on the Continent and in the financial markets. Leaders on both sides of the Channel said there was no viable option but to move gradually toward the withdrawal process. Yet the day’s developments did little to dispel the possibility that the crisis could drag on for a long time, possibly generating enough economic and political damage to encourage negotiation of a new arrangement between Europe and Britain that would sidestep the need for a formal withdrawal or at least minimize its effects. Prime Minister David Cameron and leaders of the campaign to leave stuck to their positions that they would not move quickly to begin formal talks on withdrawal, even as European leaders turned up the pressure on Britain to get on with it. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany met in Berlin late Monday with her French and Italian counterparts. She signaled that any decision on how to negotiate a withdrawal would have to await a meeting of all 28 European Union countries on Tuesday and Wednesday in Brussels. The financial markets continued to pummel stocks and the value of the British pound, at one point sending the currency to its lowest level against the dollar in more than three decades. And Standard  Poor’s, the ratings agency, downgraded Britain’s credit rating, reflecting concern about the economic implications of the   Brexit vote. Mr. Cameron has announced that he will step down, and both his governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party were consumed by internal warfare on Monday, leaving the country lacking strong leadership as it confronted new demands for a referendum on independence for Scotland. Leaders of the Leave campaign, including Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who is now a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Cameron, notably modulated their tone and some positions on Europe, leaving unclear exactly what issues they want to address through a withdrawal. The state of chaotic paralysis highlighted two fundamental problems that have plagued the European Union for the last decade. One is its difficulty balancing democratic accountability against its institutional drive to further the cause of unity. The other is its inability to act quickly and decisively to address the crises that regularly undercut confidence among voters and in the markets. Monday’s events spoke to the struggle on all sides to define a way forward and restore some sense of unity, both within Britain and throughout Europe. In the first meeting of Parliament since the referendum, Mr. Cameron said he considered the vote binding, though he reiterated that he would leave to his successor the decision to start the formal withdrawal process. “The decision must be accepted and the process of implementing the decision in the best possible way must now begin,” he said. About   of lawmakers had supported remaining in the European Union. A senior Conservative lawmaker, Kenneth Clarke, suggested that Parliament could override the referendum  —   which is not, in the end, legally binding on the government  —   while a Labour legislator, David Lammy, called for a second referendum. Mr. Cameron brushed such ideas aside, but he also made it clear that he would not be the one in charge of Britain’s messy divorce from Europe. The man who might be, Mr. Johnson, sought to calm nerves and markets with his first extensive remarks on the way forward, setting out a position that seemed to   elements of what the Leave campaign had promised. He suggested that Britain should take its time before entering separation proceedings with Brussels, and he gave no details about when he would want to start the process. And the vision he sketched out  —   of a Britain that is still in a trading bloc with Europe  —   seemed at best difficult to achieve, since the price of membership in the single market has always been the two things the Leave movement explicitly campaigned against: free movement of European citizens across borders and contributions to the bloc’s operating budget. Mr. Johnson also played down the central issue of the campaign, immigration, saying it was not really what Britons were voting on, despite considerable evidence that it was. “The only change  —   and it will not come in any great rush  —   is that the U. K. will extricate itself from the E. U.’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation,” Mr. Johnson wrote an opinion essay in the Monday edition of the conservative newspaper The Telegraph. Mr. Cameron also suggested that the best outcome for Britain now would be a deal in which it retained access to the single market. But there were no signs that European leaders would let Britain off the hook so easily. Although Ms. Merkel has signaled a desire not to rush the process of negotiating British withdrawal, most European governments are eager to take a tough line, wanting to make clear to any other nation that might contemplate leaving that there is considerable cost to doing so. The few countries that have been given access to the European   zone without joining the European Union  —   notably, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland  —   all contribute to the bloc’s budget and accept its bedrock principle of free movement of workers, the very issues that angered so many of the Britons who voted to leave. Meeting in Berlin, Ms. Merkel, President François Hollande of France and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy said there would be no discussions, formal or informal, over Britain’s withdrawal until it formally invokes Article 50, the provision in the bloc’s governing treaty that sets out the process for a withdrawal. European leaders are troubled by the prospect of a   exit inducing deeper financial and economic turmoil, a concern increasingly prevalent in London as well. On Monday morning, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, tried to calm the markets, citing Britain’s underlying economic strengths, the greater resilience of its financial system after the   crisis, and the readiness of the Bank of England to step in. Markets plunged anyway. Alex Salmond, a member of Parliament and a former leader of the Scottish National Party, blamed the British government for the political vacuum, saying that neither Mr. Cameron nor Mr. Johnson had taken ownership of the mess. “If you break it, you own it,” he said. Mr. Cameron summoned his cabinet and announced the creation of a policy unit of the “best and brightest” civil servants  —   overseen by Oliver Letwin, a Conservative lawmaker  —   to orchestrate the withdrawal process. He also said he had spoken with Prime Minister Enda Kenny of Ireland to ensure that a British departure from the European Union, of which Ireland is a member, would not endanger the fragile peace in Northern Ireland. A committee of    Conservative lawmakers met on Monday and proposed a timetable to select two candidates for party leader. The party’s roughly 150, 000 members would choose between the two, with the goal of selecting a new leader  —   and therefore a new prime minister  —   by Sept. 2. A decision on the timetable is expected by Wednesday, amid increased speculation that Britain could have a general election this year, after giving the Conservatives a   term in May 2015. Mr. Johnson is seen as the   to replace Mr. Cameron as leader of the Conservatives, but he has made many enemies. The home secretary, Theresa May, who is in charge of domestic security and who advocated remaining in the European Union, has emerged as perhaps the most credible alternative. Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party found itself in a state of civil war, with veteran lawmakers calling for the resignation of its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and warning that the party risked losing its position as one of Britain’s two main political parties, a status it has held since 1922. Large numbers of voters in traditional Labour strongholds in Northeast England and Wales  —   many of which are economically depressed areas that receive large amounts of European Union aid  —   voted to leave the bloc. Mr. Corbyn’s tepid approach to campaigning for the Remain campaign was cited as a reason many traditional Labour supporters threw in their lot with the nationalist,   U. K. Independence Party. Secretary of State John Kerry, visiting Brussels and London to discuss the fallout from the referendum, counseled against harsh actions by either side. “So I think it is absolutely essential that we stay focused on how, in this transitional period, nobody loses their head, nobody goes off   people don’t start ginning up scatterbrained or revengeful premises, but we look for ways to maintain the strength that will serve the interests and the values that brought us together in the first place,” Mr. Kerry said.",0

4404,Cuomo’s Vision for Revamped Penn Station: New Home for Amtrak and L.I.R.R. - The New York Times,"For nearly a   governors and mayors in New York have been stymied in their attempts to fix Pennsylvania Station, one of the busiest transit halls in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most crowded and confusing. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday presented a   plan that would finally create a train hall and retail space in the James A. Farley Building, also known as the General Post Office, on the west side of Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, while renovating the cramped, dingy underground passageways and platforms across the avenue at Penn Station. The Farley Building would become a home for both Amtrak and, in a break with past proposals, the Long Island Rail Road that should bring some relief to the congestion at Penn Station, which also houses New Jersey Transit trains and two subway lines. On any given day, more than 600, 000 commuters and travelers  —   triple what the station was designed for  —   move through it. The Farley train hall is expected to open in December 2020. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said his administration had selected a team  —   the developers Related Companies and Vornado Realty and Skanska AB, the giant construction management firm  —   for the $1. 6 billion plan. He announced the plan at a luncheon for the Association for a Better New York, a business organization. “This plan is smarter and better for people who will use the complex,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. “And it will actually happen. ” According to state officials, all of the necessary approvals are in place, as well as the funding. The developers would pay New York State about $600 million, which would include an upfront payment of $230 million and annual payments in lieu of taxes over 30 years, which the city has to approve. The developers would also provide the state an unspecified share of the retail revenues at the train hall and, possibly, advertising, officials said. Empire State Development, a state agency, would contribute $570 million toward the remaining cost, much of it coming from the probable sale of Farley’s air rights. Amtrak, which owns Penn Station the Long Island Rail Road the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the federal government would put in a combined $425 million. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who died in 2003, originally championed the idea of creating an adjunct train depot at the Farley Building in an effort to restore grandeur to Penn Station, where the aboveground train hall was torn down in the 1960s to make way for Madison Square Garden. Both Farley and the demolished train hall were designed by architects at McKim Mead  White. Plans to convert the post office into a train station have been derailed by disputes involving the Postal Service and Amtrak, a lack of funding and the difficulty of doing construction work without disrupting train service. In 2005, the state selected Related and Vornado to do the work, a $900 million project. The developers initially sought to move Madison Square Garden to the west side of the post office building so that they could build skyscrapers or a   mall over the Penn Station site. But the project never really moved forward. Last January, Mr. Cuomo abruptly announced that he was starting over and requested proposals for both the post office building and Penn Station, although the original developers had a major head start over any rivals. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and a longtime supporter of the project who has obtained federal money for preliminary work, called the governor’s announcement a “step forward in the modernization of our West Side transportation network. ” Mr. Cuomo said his new plan fixed flaws in previous proposals. Moving both Amtrak and Long Island Rail Road passengers to Farley would do a lot more to relieve congestion at Penn Station, he said. Jeff Blau, chief executive of Related Companies, who had been taken aback by the Mr. Cuomo’s announcement in January, was excited about finally moving forward. Related, Vornado and Skanska are expected to sign a formal contract early next year that would include a timetable with financial penalties if deadlines are not met. At the Farley Building, the developers would create a massive train hall beneath a   glass skylight mounted on the building’s dramatic steel trusses for the daily 30, 000 Amtrak riders and 230, 000 Long Island Rail Road passengers. Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning group that has long favored the Farley project, said the announcement on Tuesday was a major advance. “The vision for the full complex,” Mr. Wright said, “has got to be a seamless, integrated system. Whether someone’s riding Amtrak, the subways or the L. I. R. R. they should be able to enter the complex and get to their platform as quickly as possible. ” State officials said they would begin soliciting bids on Tuesday for work at Penn Station.",0

4407,Comment on Donald Trump’s ex-wife Ivana says he’ll make the changes he promised by Christian Zionist,"| February 18, 2016 at 7:33 am | Reply 
Trump’s “America We Deserve” book came out on 1/15/2000. I’ve learned magnitudes of mind-changing information in 16 years. Maybe Trump has, too (though he obviously does still have some huge blind spots, such as believing whatever the “Nightly News” says about anything/everything, from mass shootings [not awake to false flags] to boogeymen terrorists/ISIS [not awake to the fact the CIA/Mossad/MI5/6 create/fund the terrorist groups] to believing the lie that we need to give up privacy for “more security” [his current anti-Apple vs. FBI opinion], etc.). Even so, I think Trump is “TEACHABLE,” if the right people are given his ear. 
Steve B. said: “…I cannot and will not vote for him, until that repudiation of his pro-choice past comes.” 
He has told the story quite a few times of his change of opinion re abortion. In short, he had friends who were going to abort but had the baby who then grew up to be a great kid which touched his heart personally. And in just the past few days I heard him say he basically went along with the abortion idea in his prior years because his daughter thought it was an OK thing, so he thought it was an OK thing, too. If Ivanka is nearing 35, then she probably DID think it was OK when she was 20-ish. (He did not say that in a blaming or scapegoating kind of way, btw.) Granted, Trump is obviously NOT a Biblically-discipled follower of Jesus. He may be a BELIEVER in Jesus, but he has obviously never been discipled. Trump needs an Aquila & Priscilla to “…take him unto them, and expound unto him the way of God more perfectly.” (Acts 18:26). 
Here’s Trump’s anti-abortion statement from two days ago at his FB site. (Of course, I disagree with him still re: exceptions for “rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk.” That’s still Lefty hogwash. No baby deserves to be murdered. The baby cannot determine the circumstances. Whatever happened to adoption, for pete’s sake?!): 
[…] Donald J. Trump February 16 at 4:11pm 
Let me be clear—I am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me. My story is well documented, so I will not retell it here. However, what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life, and the culture of life, as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v. Wade. 
I build things. There is a process involved in building things. We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important. The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics. These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful. America, when it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important, of our “unalienable” rights. 
Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians, farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of country. They are missing, and they are missed. 
The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best. 
If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough, the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment. Roe v. Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people. This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision. Perhaps Roe v. Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government. 
We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days. The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews. It is my hope that they will choose the builder, the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation. The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life. A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness. It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again.

4409,California Today: Why the State’s Biggest Lake Is Dying - The New York Times," Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) California’s biggest lake, about 350 square miles, is dying. It’s not the first time. The Salton Sea, straddling the Imperial and Coachella Valleys, is the latest incarnation of a body of water that has been drying and refilling over eons with water from the Colorado River. Native Americans once fished and camped on Lake Cahuilla, a prehistoric and larger version. The Salton Sea was born in the early 1900s after a canal burst sent water from the Colorado flooding into the valley over a period of two years. Beginning in the 1950s, entrepreneurs transformed it into a tourist mecca, building marinas and resorts. There were beauty pageants and boat races. Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra visited. But in time, runoff pollution, drought and blistering heat conspired to end the fun. As the saline lake evaporated, its salt concentration soared, killing fish en masse. The blooming and decomposition of algae had a powerful stench. Today, the Salton Sea is surrounded by abandoned buildings. For people fighting to revitalize it, there are two big concerns, said Michael Cohen, a researcher with the Pacific Institute, a   think tank. One is dust. The receding water is exposing vast areas of the lake floor that, if unabated, could kick up more than 100 tons of dust every day by 2045, scientists say. (This winter’s bountiful rain largely avoided the Salton Sea). The particles are so fine that they cannot be coughed up, threatening the health of local children whose asthma rates lead the state. The other is the threat to wildlife. The Salton Sea is a precious way station for more than 400 species of migrating birds. Part of the solution, said Mr. Cohen, lies in restoring habitat  —   essentially moving earth around in ways that keeps the dust from flying while providing the birds with places to stop and refuel. A $9. 6 billion revitalization plan endorsed by state officials has been on the back burner for years. Mr. Cohen said he was often asked why we don’t just let nature take its course. “Are we fighting nature? Yes,” he said. But, he said, pristine wilderness really no longer exists  —   all of California is manipulated in some way by humans. “So from that perspective,” he said, “we need to make sure those places that are valuable for wildlife are preserved. ” Frank Foster, a photography instructor at Victor Valley College in Victorville, has been capturing images of the Salton Sea for years. He shared some with us.

[Quartz] On Monday, we wrote about a state proposal that would let bicyclists treat stop signs like yield signs. We asked if you liked the idea. Hundreds of emails poured in, with opinions sharply divided. Here is a sample: “Terrible idea. While there are many conscientious bicyclists, I regularly see bicyclists who are simply reckless. Many times I have seen bicyclists go right through red lights, at great risk to themselves and others. This measure would embolden them to engage in such dangerous behaviors, and raise the risk of crashes and serious injuries. ”  —   Paul D. Lerner, Beverly Hills “Yes, this would be a welcome change. Safety hardly ever requires a full stop by bikes at a stop sign. Because of that, most bicyclists currently don’t surrender their   momentum by making full stops at stop signs where the traffic does not warrant them. The result is that the existing law requiring full stops at stop signs is rarely observed or enforced, which encourages disrespect of the law and stokes the resentment of motorists already annoyed by the presence of bikes on their streets and roads. ”  —   Len Colamarino, Atascadero “I’m a   year San Francisco bike commuter. I am dubious about the rolling stop rule. I often see cyclists roll through stops when pedestrians are in crosswalks. A law change, I fear, will make this worse. ”  —   Alyson Jacks, San Francisco “Cyclists are well aware of the risks they assume when ‘sharing the road’ with vehicles.

4410,Comment on Like a ‘Concentration Camp’ Police Mark DAPL Protesters with Numbers & Lock Them in Dog Kennels by Sharon Jeanguenat,"Home / Badge Abuse / Like a ‘Concentration Camp’ Police Mark DAPL Protesters with Numbers & Lock Them in Dog Kennels Like a ‘Concentration Camp’ Police Mark DAPL Protesters with Numbers & Lock Them in Dog Kennels Claire Bernish October 29, 2016 2 Comments 
Cannon Ball, N.D. — On Thursday, police from no less than five states sporting full riot gear and armed with heavy lethal and nonlethal weaponry, pepper spray, mace, a number of ATVs, five tanks, two helicopters, and military-equipped humvees showed up to tear down an encampment of Standing Rock Sioux water protectors and supporters armed with … nothing. 
Under orders from the now-notorious Morton County Sheriff’s Office, this ridiculously heavy-handed standing army came better prepared to do battle than some actual military units fighting overseas. 
But the target of their operation — a group of slightly more than 200 Native American water protectors and supporters opposing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline — never intended to do battle with the armed, taxpayer-funded, corporate-backed, state-sponsored aggressors. 
Reports vary, but no less than 141 people were arrested Thursday, and — according to witnesses — police marked numbers on arrestees’ arms and housed them in cement-floored dog kennels , without any padding, before they were transported as far away as Fargo. 
“It goes back to concentration camp days,” asserted Oceti-Sakowin coordinator Mekasi Camp-Horinek, who, along with his mother, was marked and detained in a mesh kennel, reports the Los Angeles Times . 
Although Thursday’s incident remained relatively peaceful for some time, with only shouts, chants, and occasional attempts by water protectors to convince this standing army to examine its motives and reconsider, clashes nonetheless broke out — solely because of gratuitous police aggression. 
After facing off for a couple hours, these militant cops began closing in on the water protectors to shut down the Treaty of 1851 camp — in reference to the Fort Laramie Treaty of that year, which established a large parcel of land designated exclusively Native American territory not to be disturbed by the U.S. government. Prior to his arrest, Camp-Horinek had established the camp, stating, as cited by Indigenous Rising : 
“Today, the Oceti Sakowin has enacted eminent domain on DAPL lands, claiming 1851 treaty rights. This is unceded land. Highway 1806 as of this point is blockaded. We will be occupying this land and staying here until this pipeline is permanently stopped. We need bodies and we need people who are trained in non-violent direct action. We are still staying non-violent and we are still staying peaceful.” 
Despite the water protectors’ commitment to nonviolence, the militarized police response went as would be expected — horribly awry. 
“A prayer circle of elders, including several women, was interrupted and all were arrested for standing peacefully on the public road,” stated a press release from Indigenous Environment Network. “A tipi was erected in the road and was recklessly dismantled, despite law enforcement statements that they would merely mark the tipi with a yellow ribbon and ask its owners to retrieve it. A group of water protectors was also dragged out of a sweat lodge ceremony erected in the path of the pipeline, thrown to the ground, and arrested.” 
Claims to the contrary by Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier aside, Native American and Indigenous water protectors and supporters have refrained from violent acts on the whole, preferring instead peaceful prayer vigils and acts of civil disobedience. 
No matter how peacefully the opposition acts, armed defenders of Big Oil interests seem determined to brutalize , disrespect, and generally incite and inflict violence against those who desire unsullied water for generations to come. 
In fact, at the beginning of September, a private security firm hired by Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for pipeline construction, indiscriminately unleashed vicious attack dogs on water protectors, press, and supporters — for reasons as yet unknown. 
During the savage attack, a pregnant woman, young girl, and many others suffered serious dog bites thanks to the ineptitude of the dogs’ handlers. Afterward, a warrant for inciting a riot was issued Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman — for doing her job, filming events as they happened — though charges were subsequently thrown out. 
Although ETP and some law enforcement officers defended the barbarous actions of the private security mercenaries, the Guardian now reports that — because the guards lacked proper licensing — they could now face criminal charges. On Wednesday, the Morton County Sheriff’s Office made the determination that “dog handlers were not properly licensed to do security work in the state of North Dakota.” 
Bob Frost, owner of Ohio-based Frost Kennels, told the Guardian , “All the proper protocols … were already done. I pulled my guys out the next day because we weren’t there to go to war with these protesters.” 
Frost insisted he had cooperated with authorities investigating the incident — but the sheriff’s department disagrees. Seven handlers and dogs were deployed to the scene in early September, allegedly in response to reports of trespassers; but, according to the Guardian , police have only managed to identify two people. 
The sheriff’s department claims Frost has not provided necessary information, and unnamed security officials cited in the report said that “there were no intentions of using the dogs or handlers for security work. … However, because of the protest events, the dogs were deployed as a method of trying to keep the protesters under control.” 
In a statement cited by the Guardian , Morton County Captain Jay Gruebele said, “Although lists of security employees have been provided, there is no way of confirming whether the list is accurate or if names have been purposely withheld.” 
Water protectors, in the meantime, are left to deal with absurdly disproportionate state violence — and the altogether unacceptable, disrespectful, and demeaning insult of being relegated to dog kennels after being arrested for exercising their rights. 
As Lakota Country Times editor Brandon Ecoffey wrote in an editorial Thursday, 
“Over the course of the last several months the abuse of detainees by Morton County Law Enforcement has overstepped every boundary guaranteed by the American constitution. Water protectors have been seen being bound and hooded by police. People are being stripped searched and abused within their jail for misdemeanor crimes. And police have employed the use of mass surveillance through drones on the protector camps. This isn’t a war zone this is North Dakota.” Share Google + Steve Wilkins 
The American establishment is at war with it’s own people. Corporate arrogance will inevitably be translated into a backlash. It’s a crying shame these people are not being supported by the American public 000’s should be there in mind body and soul. Once again government/corporate overreach squashes the citizen protest. they don’t like it when people bring guns to the party – but look how they treat those that don’t! Sharon Jeanguenat 
Our government is disgraceful! This is as bad as how they treated Indians back when the West was being settled. They give lands to the Indians, then when somebody comes along that needs that land to make money, they up & take it away from the Indians. God help us if Hillary wins this election! Social",0
4411,MI5 Chief Presents Russia As Growing Threat To British Interests,"| November 1, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Russian army soldiers drive their tanks along the Red Square during a general rehearsal for the Victory Day military parade. 
The first time a top British spy has ever given a newspaper interview, MI5 chief Andrew Parker has spoken with the Guardian , playing up the “growing threat” posed by Russia against British interests around the world. 
Parker claimed a “whole range of state organs and powers” in Russia are being brought to bear against Britain and the US, claiming that the advent of cyberwarfare has increased the number of ways in which Russia can move against them. 
Parker went on to claim that Russia defines itself by opposition to the West and, despite being a “covert threat for decades” has been increasingly hostile, citing their operations in Ukraine and Syria as proof that they are acting to just spite the West. 
This has been a common western talking point, but in practice Western (read: US) policy in both Ukraine and Syria appears to have itself been built with an eye toward being on the opposite side from Russia in the first place, and Russia is then condemned for acting in their own interests. 
This was particularly glaring in Syria, where Russia’s interest was obviously in the survival of a friendly Syrian government to host their naval base, and where “countering” Russia has brought the US “anti-ISIS coalition” into increasingly overt support for al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front, simply because they’re the ones most directly fighting against Russia.",0
4412,Hillary Clinton BETRAYED by Her Own Family: “We’re Voting for Trump!”,"Hillary Clinton’s niece has revealed to Radar that she will be voting for Donald Trump next week. 
Macy Smit is the daughter of Bill Clinton’s brother Roger. 
“Something tells me the Clinton side of the family looks at me and my mother as not good enough, but we’re hard-working!” she said. 
“I support Donald Trump — 100 percent! I have been a Democrat my entire life, but Trump is what we need right now — somebody who is going to stand up for us. I think at this point Hillary just wants it for the history books — to be the first woman president for selfish reasons.” 
Macy, a hairstylist in Tampa, is married to a meteorologist with the U.S. Air Force. Her husband is currently stationed in Kuwait coordinating operations in Iraq. 
“They’re not as good as everyone thinks they are,” Macy said in reference to the Clintons. “I went through some very personal things [without their support],” she added, speaking of a miscarriage she suffered last year. 
“The Clintons are all talk!” said Macy’s mother, Martha. “Hillary says she’s all about family, but she’s got a niece she’s never met and never acknowledged. The Clintons have never helped us out.”

4413,Ali’s Least Memorable Fight - The New York Times,"Muhammad Ali, who died Friday, was part of some of the most memorable sporting moments of the 20th century. But he also once got into the ring with a Japanese professional wrestler in a bout, much anticipated at the time, that is almost forgotten today. On June 26, 1976, a week before the celebration of the United States Bicentennial, Ali, the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, faced off in Tokyo against Antonio Inoki, a very popular wrestler in Japan. Organizers promoted the fight as the ultimate test of boxer versus wrestler and touted big paydays for the combatants, supposedly $6 million for Ali and $3 million for Inoki. Although the idea of a professional wrestler meeting the heavyweight champion might seem like a joke, it attracted tremendous attention at the time, with mainstream publications writing about it at length. Ali gleefully joined in the hunt for publicity, frequently pointing out how much money he was going to be making and how impressively he was going to win. There was no television coverage in the United States, and American fight fans had to travel to arenas, stadiums and theaters showing the fight on   TV. And travel they did. More than 30, 000 turned up at Shea Stadium. The fans at Shea were treated to a preliminary bout: the wrestler Andre the Giant against the boxer Chuck Wepner, known as the Bayonne Bleeder, a game if limited heavyweight sometimes cited as a model for Rocky Balboa. The bout lived up to expectations, as Andre lifted Wepner and hurled him from the ring to win in the third round. (The fight inspired a scene in “Rocky III” in which Thunderlips, played by Hulk Hogan, does something similar to Rocky.) If that match whetted appetites for   fans were destined to be disappointed. Ali came into the ring looking like a boxer with standard trunks and boxing gloves. Inoki suited up as a wrestler, with tight black trunks and bare hands. When the bell rang, Inoki quickly fell to the mat in a crablike posture and began kicking out at Ali’s legs. Ali danced around the ring looking for a chance to land a punch but not finding one. To the increasing fury of the crowd in Tokyo, and fans watching around the world, the bout continued in this manner for 15 interminable rounds. When it was over, the judges scored it an honorable draw and the paying customers hurled garbage at the ring. Ali managed only two punches in the fight, both left jabs, The New York Times reported. “Ali, Inoki Fight to Draw in Dull Bout” was the headline. “I wouldn’t have done this fight if I’d known he was going to do that,” Ali said. “Nobody knew this was going to happen, so we had a dead show. ” “It all proved boxers are superior to wrestlers,” Ali insisted. “He didn’t stand up and fight like a man. ” Commentators were unimpressed. “What was billed as ‘The Martial Arts World Championship Fight’ emerged as The ‘Farcial’ Arts World Championship Ripoff,” Dave Anderson wrote in a Sports of The Times column. With a professional wrestler involved, the natural question was whether the bout was fixed. The history is murky, and several versions exist. In one, the bout was a simple fix, though why a more entertaining spectacle wasn’t arranged is an open question. In another telling, Ali came expecting a fixed bout only to discover that Inoki was planning to fight for real. In a third version, Ali was told he was expected to lose the fight because of Inoki’s enormous popularity in Japan. Ali supposedly refused, turning a staged event into a real one. Whatever the truth, Ali’s legs were badly injured in the contest, as he took more than 100 kicks from Inoki. Although he expressed a willingness to wrestle again if the price was right, Ali returned to conventional boxing after the Inoki bout. He lost and then regained the title against Leon Spinks before losing fights to Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick, then retiring. Inoki, now 73, went on to a career in politics and a seat in Japan’s parliament. The bout was a farce, but in a way it was a precursor to the modern spectacle of mixed martial arts in which practitioners of boxing, wrestling, judo, jujitsu and other combat sports can mix it up under unified rules. Ali was always a showman, even in the midst of his most serious and important bouts. It seems almost fitting that a strange and colorful fight against a professional wrestler in the Budokan in Tokyo would be a footnote to his glorious career.",0
4414,The Truth that America Doesn't Want You to Know about War Crimes in Syria,"After claiming the lives of more than a quarter of a million people; causing the biggest refugee crisis since World War II; and fueling the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the civil war in Syria, which started in 2011 as a peaceful protest against President Bashar al-Assad but later turned into an international proxy war, is today, signaling World War III. At least, that’s what the West and the mainstream media want you to believe . However, the truth is the United States and its allies are using the “war crimes” and “crimes of historic proportions” in Syria to prolong the proxy war, overthrow Assad, and annex an independent country. Sadly, the United Nations, Amnesty International, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and other “concerned parties” (including the mainstream media), support the West in its malicious intent.
The Western Claim “Russia and the Syrian regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children and women,” US Secretary of State John Kerry recently commented. Kerry begged for an investigation of the Russian and Syrian military strikes against civilians and medical facilities in Aleppo, as war crimes.
“There is clear and abundant evidence the Assad regime and the Russian government are committing crimes that include, but are not limited to, deliberate attacks on civilians, collective punishment, starvation as a tool of war, torture, murder, inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield,” asserted The Washington Post .
“The ancient city of Aleppo, a place of millennial civility and beauty, is today a slaughterhouse — a gruesome locus of pain and fear, where the lifeless bodies of small children are trapped under streets of rubble and pregnant women deliberately bombed,” observed the UN human rights’ chief, seeking a war crimes inquiry.
The Western Evidence 1. A commission for International Justice and Accountability — a non-profit organization funded by western states including the UK, US, the EU, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Canada and Denmark — smuggled over 600,000 top-secret Syrian government documents brought to Western Europe .
An analysis of some 400 documents “linked the systematic torture and murder of tens of thousands of Syrians to a written policy approved by President Bashar al-Assad, coordinated among his security-intelligence agencies, and implemented by regime operatives.” Current status: Neither the documents nor the evidence has been made public.
2. A decorated American journalist and a former CIA officer, Adam Ciralsky wrote about the 53,275 photos that “Caesar” (a Syrian military photographer turned war crimes whistleblower, who fled the country in August 2013) took as grisly evidence of Assad’s brutality.
“The pictures, most of them taken in Syrian military hospitals, show corpses photographed at close range — one at a time as well as in small groupings. Virtually all of the bodies — thousands of them — betray signs of torture: gouged eyes; mangled genitals ; bruises and dried blood from beatings; acid and electric burns; emaciation; and marks from strangulation,” Ciralsky explained. Current Status: The treasure trove, as well as the photographer “Caesar,” is hidden from the public eye.
3. In 2015, Amnesty International documented the systematic and widespread “unthinkable atrocities” war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed by Assad’s regime, in a 74-page report (including indiscriminate use of explosive weapons, arbitrary arrests, torture, and enforced disappearances). The ‘heartbreaking’ research involved merely 78 residents (mostly former) and 29 professionals working in Aleppo .
4. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights — the London-based monitoring group, often Quote: d as the most authoritative source of information about human rights abuse in Syria — is a tool of Western propaganda run by one man who last visited Syria in 2000 (11 years before the armed conflict began). He relies on “intelligence” allegedly gathered by around 200 “activists” who he has never met. Current Status: Whatever the SOHR claims, the mainstream media reports as truth without verifying its nature – because the SOHR does not reference any sources.
The Western Lies Why is the angry and (nowadays) concerned world not asking the United States and the mainstream media a few pertinent questions? What is the West doing in Syria? Why is the peace-loving West prolonging the war? Why is the West backing the rebels in a foreign country? Why is the West funding and arming ISIS?
Why are the Western forces not being held accountable for war crimes like bombing a hospital? Why is the mainstream media, the NGOs and the UN not holding the West accountable for crimes committed on their own land, or in Israel, Africa or Yemen?
One reason may be because of the abundance of natural gas under Syrian soil, and that this may very well be another ‘petrodollar’ war . The US had long had its gaze set on Syria – years before the civil war and the 2011 “revolution.” Leaked WikiLeaks cables show the US ambassador to Syria (2004-2007) William Roebuck discussing a plan to remove Assad from power, in December 2006 .
While the Russian and Iranian forces entered Syria on Assad’s request to fight against ISIS and armed rebels, the Western military invaded Syria — a sovereign country and United Nations member state — to violently overthrow the Syrian government.
Why didn’t the West invade Saudi Arabia to initiate “humanitarian intervention” and save innocent citizens from its brutal dictator? Saudi Arabia remains a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and a U.S. ally, despite its poor human rights record — if attacking an independent harmless country is justified, why did the US act against Osama bin Laden?
The Western effort to annex Syria has relied on a series of crudely-spun lies and media-generated talking points. In September, RT dared to expose the top 10 Western lies about Syrian conflict that the mainstream media are trading in, to fool the Western public into backing yet another failed ‘nation-building’ project (after Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya). Obviously, the fear mongering media didn’t find it profitable to give the lies much, if any, coverage in the West.
From calling the conflict a fault of wicked Assad, and Assad a brutal dictator who enjoyed no popular support, to portraying him as an uncompromising President interested only in ‘killing his own people’ – and not in peace and reconciliation, the list is endless. From accusing the Syrian government and Russia for helping ISIS and terming the Western interventions in Syria as humanitarian, to claiming Russia was acting out of self-interest and that the West was on the side of the ‘good guys’ in Syria, can you be certain of the ‘truth’? Realistically, the West hasn’t been fighting ‘terror’ in Syria, it has aided it.
Remember the American journalist Serena Shim, who was killed in October 2014, after she revealed the ISIS-Turkey-US link that proved the West was assisting ISIS in Syria?
The Syrian Reality Henry Lowendorf, a member of the Executive Board of the U.S. Peace Council’s Peace and Fact-Finding Delegation to Syria – who returned from Syria in August – noted: “What we saw in Syria goes against everything we read in the United States.”
Before 2011, illiteracy in Syria had been wiped out; the life expectancy was 75.9 years and the government spent massive amounts of money on improving the nation. Developing irrigation, electricity, water and road building projects, and expanding the health services and education to rural areas, all occurred; and China invested hundreds of millions of dollars to modernize Syria’s aging oil and gas infrastructure.",0
4415,Russell Moore Can’t Support Either Candidate - The New York Times,"You have a somewhat different approach than your predecessors at the Southern Baptist Convention. Your tenure has been marked by your advocacy for working with others with whom you can find common cause, particularly in regard to racial reconciliation, which you worked with Obama on. What influenced you to break the tradition? Growing up in Mississippi shaped my life in all sorts of ways, including seeing a Bible Belt, cultural Christianity that was often very tolerant of racism and bigotry. Much of the New Testament has to do with breaking down divisions. As time has gone on, the more I see my identity within the global church and the global body of Christ, so what hurts my   brother or sister hurts me. Do you endorse the concept that black lives matter? Yes. I don’t necessarily endorse everything that any institution or organization by that name might endorse, but I certainly endorse the concept that black lives matter. Have you had much luck, professionally and personally, changing your coreligionists’ minds on this kind of thing? Yes, actually. The Bible speaks so directly to these issues that, really, in order to avoid questions of racial unity, one has to evade the Bible itself. One of the problems we have on the race issue is that so few churches talk about it at all. Increasingly, I hear congregations starting to ask, “How do we change so that our churches actually reflect the kingdom of God?” You’ve been an advocate for the church to be involved in issues that have some crossover across party lines:   reform, racial reconciliation, immigration. That, combined with #NeverTrump, has created bipartisan collaboration in a way I haven’t seen before. Do you think that will continue after the election? I hope so. One of the places of common ground that I’ve found between people on the right and the left is a common commiserating about how bad both of these candidates are. If we can move past the sense that our identity is bound up in our political party or our political ideology, that will be a step forward. Very early in the campaign season, you said that evangelicals shouldn’t support Trump for president. At first, it seemed as if he might not win them over, but now they seem to have come on board. Do you have an explanation for that? Part of the explanation is the recent alliance between the Republican Party and American evangelicalism. I think many evangelicals believe that they face a binary choice and they have no option but to support one of the two. When I talk to   evangelicals, the Supreme Court is the primary concern for them. Do you find their arguments personally persuasive? No, but I understand why people across the religious and political spectrum would conclude that they have to wrestle with their consciences and vote for one of these candidates. I’m       reconciliation,   and   in office, so no matter what happens in November, I lose. Between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, which one do you think you might find more common cause with if he or she were elected? I don’t know. I think that it would vary from issue to issue. It’s been a fairly contentless election or at least a shifting kaleidoscope of content, and so I have no way to predict. I could pretty safely predict to you that Hillary Clinton is going to be working on   reform and sentence reform, sex trafficking, racial reconciliation. We could go down a menu of issues you might potentially be invited to the White House to talk about with her. Name something you could find common cause on with Donald Trump. I don’t know where the points of commonality would be because I don’t actually know where he would stand in office. But I agree with him on Mike Pence and La Guardia Airport, for sure.",0
4416,Щит Евфрата: удастся ли замысел Вашингтона? | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Сирия В своей новой статье постоянный обозреватель НВО Тони Карталучи отмечает, что начиная с 2012 года Вашингтон практически упрашивал турецкие войска вторгнуться в Сирию, чтобы создать там «бесполетную зону» и обеспечить прикрытие контролируемым Вашингтоном «умеренным силам». При этом западные аналитики открыто признают, что данная зона нужна им для свержения сирийского режима, а также что они планируют её расширять.

4417,"World War 3 News: Russia Spits On US As Conflict Ignites, Putin Prepares To Strike - Morning News USA","Comment 
Russia is reportedly planning to attack as the United States remains distracted on election day. According to reports, Vladimir Putin’s war fleet could launch a bloody attack on Syria within 24 hours. Will things turn uglier? 
Russia may be taking advantage as the rest of America continues to be on their toes on its presidential elections. According to reports, Vladimir Putin’s war fleet is expected to launch a massive cruise missile attack on Syria in just 24 hours. 
The coming hours present a perfect opportunity for Russia as “war crimes” and “no fly zones” have been pushed aside as America battles it out on Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump. Russia Spits On US As Conflict Ignites 
The United States called out Russia for its bombing campaign in the disputed region. In fact, Washington also threatened to impose sanctions on the country repeatedly because of what John Kerry referred to as “the largest of humanitarian disasters.” 
Also Read: Russia Fires At United States As Tensions Escalate 
According to Daily Star’s report , experts have warned about the conflict that could ensue should the tensions between Russia and the U.S. continue to rise. 
In another report from the Voice of America , Russia’s Defense Ministry officials clarified on Tuesday that the new strikes against Islamic State terror group will be targeting the outskirts of the northern city of Aleppo and would ensue in the next few hours. However, an unidentified source told VOA that the possible strikes were in support of the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
“The comments from the Russian Ministry of Defense suggest they are more interested in the world seeing Russia’s naval capabilities in action than the world seeing Russia live up to its word,” the official said. “An escalation would make it harder to resolve the brutal civil war in Syria and raise more doubts about Russia’s commitment.”

4418,Worst Chemical Attack in Years in Syria U.S. Blames Assad - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   One of the worst chemical bombings in Syria turned a northern   area into a toxic kill zone on Tuesday, inciting international outrage over the   government impunity shown in the country’s   war. Western leaders including President Trump blamed the Syrian government of President Bashar   and called on its patrons, Russia and Iran, to prevent a recurrence of what many described as a war crime. Dozens of people, including children, died  —   some writhing, choking, gasping or foaming at the mouth  —   after breathing in poison that possibly contained a nerve agent or other banned chemicals, according to witnesses, doctors and rescue workers. They said the toxic substance spread after warplanes dropped bombs in the early morning hours. Some rescue workers grew ill and collapsed from proximity to the dead. The   Health Department in Idlib Province, where the attack took place, said 69 people had died, providing a list of their names. The dead were still being identified, and some humanitarian groups said as many as 100 had died. The government of Mr. Assad, who renounced chemical weapons nearly four years ago after a large chemical attack that American intelligence agencies concluded was carried out by his forces, denied that his military had been responsible, as he has done every time chemical munitions have been used in Syria. A statement from the Syrian military accused insurgents of responsibility and said they had accused the army of using toxic weapons “every time they fail to achieve the goals of their sponsors. ” But only the Syrian military had the ability and the motive to carry out an aerial attack like the one that struck the   town of Khan Sheikhoun. Russia offered another explanation. A spokesman for its Defense Ministry, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Syrian warplanes had struck an insurgent storehouse containing toxic substances to be used in chemical weapons. Witnesses to the attack said it began before 7 a. m. Numerous photographs and graphic videos posted online by activists and residents showed children and older adults gasping and struggling to breathe, or lying motionless in the mud as rescue workers ripped off victims’ clothes and hosed them down. The bodies of at least 10 children lay lined up on the ground or under a quilt. A few hours later, according to several witnesses, another airstrike hit one of the clinics treating victims, who had been sent to smaller hospitals and maternity wards because the area’s largest hospital was severely damaged by an airstrike two days earlier. The scale and brazenness of the assault threatened to further subvert a nominal and often violated   that had taken hold in parts of the country since Mr. Assad’s forces retook the northern city of Aleppo in December with Russian help, emboldening the Syrian leader to think he could win the war. The attack also seemed likely to dampen peace talks that have been overseen by the United Nations in Geneva and by Russia and Turkey in Astana, Kazakhstan. Incredulous over the chemical assault, humanitarian groups demanded action from the United Nations Security Council, where partisan divides over who is to blame for the Syrian war have paralyzed its members almost since the conflict began in 2011. On Tuesday night, Britain, France and the United States were pushing the Security Council to adopt a resolution that condemns the attack and orders the Syrian government to provide all flight logs, flight plans and names of commanders in charge of air operations, including those for Tuesday, to international investigators. The draft resolution, negotiated among diplomats from the three countries on Tuesday, was later circulated to all 15 members of the Council. It could come up for a vote as early as Wednesday. For Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly blamed what he has called President Barack Obama’s failures for the Syria crisis, the chemical weapons assault posed a potential policy dilemma and exposed some glaring contradictions in his own evolving positions on Syria. The White House called the attack a “reprehensible” act against innocent people “that cannot be ignored by the civilized world. ” At the same time, Mr. Trump’s spokesman, Sean Spicer, denounced Mr. Obama for having failed to make good on his famous “red line” statement in 2012, suggesting he would intervene militarily in Syria if Mr. Assad used chemical weapons. But in August 2013, Mr. Trump exhorted Mr. Obama not to intervene after a chemical weapons attack near Damascus that American intelligence attributed to the Syrian military killed more than 1, 400 civilians, including hundreds of children, according to United States government estimates at the time. “President Obama, do not attack Syria,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. “There is no upside and tremendous downside. ” Mr. Trump’s administration, which would like to shift the focus in Syria entirely to fighting the Islamic State, has in recent days described Mr. Assad’s hold on his office as a political reality  —   an assertion that has drawn strong condemnation from influential Republicans who say Mr. Assad must leave power. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who had said that Mr. Assad’s fate “will be decided by the Syrian people,” struck a sharply different tone on Tuesday, urging Mr. Assad’s allies Russia and Iran “to exercise their influence over the Syrian regime and to guarantee that this sort of horrific attack never happens again. ” Mr. Tillerson added that “Russia and Iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths. ” Russia has insisted that it had no military role in the strike. But a State Department official who briefed reporters in Washington said Russian officials were trying to evade their responsibility because Russia and Iran were guarantors of the Assad government’s commitment to adhere to a   in the peace talks that the Kremlin had helped organize in Astana. Rescue workers from the White Helmets civil defense organization said that many children were among the dead and wounded. Radi Saad, who writes incident reports for the group, said that volunteers had reached the site not knowing a chemical was present and that five of them had suffered from exposure to the substance. While chlorine gas attacks have become almost routine in northern Syria, this one was different, medical workers and witnesses said. Chlorine attacks usually kill just a few people, often those trapped in an enclosed space, and the gas dissipates quickly. This time, people collapsed outdoors, and in much larger numbers. The symptoms were different: They included the pinpoint pupils of victims that characterize nerve agents and other banned poisons. One doctor posted a video of a patient’s eye, showing the pupil reduced to a dot. Several people were sickened simply by coming into contact with victims. The opposition minister of health, Mohamad Firas   said in a video that he had been in a field hospital at 7:30 a. m. when more than 100 people arrived wounded or sickened. “The patients are in the corridors and on the floors of the operation rooms, the E. R. s and in the patient rooms,” he said. “I saw more than 10 deaths due to this attack. ” Symptoms included suffocation fluid in the lungs, with foam coming from the mouth unconsciousness spasms and paralysis, he said. “It’s a shocking act,” he said. “The world knows and is aware of what’s happening in Syria, and we are ready to submit evidence to criminal laboratories to prove the use of these gases. ” A    resident of the attacked town, Mariam Abu Khalil, said she had left home for her examination on the Quran  —   scheduled for early morning because fewer bombings were expected then  —   when the attack took place. On the way, she saw an aircraft drop a bomb on a   building a few dozen yards away. In a telephone interview Tuesday night, she described an explosion like a yellow mushroom cloud that stung her eyes. “It was like a winter fog,” she said. Sheltering in her home nearby, she saw several residents arrive by car to help the wounded. “When they got out, they inhaled the gas and died,” she said. The attack appeared to be the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since the August 2013 assault. Under threat of United States retaliation, Mr. Assad agreed to a   deal to eliminate his country’s chemical weapons program, which until that time it had denied having, and to join an international treaty banning chemical weapons. But the operation took far longer than expected and raised questions about whether all the materials were accounted for. The head of the international monitoring body, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, complained in an internal report about misleading statements from Damascus and expressed concern about possible undeclared chemical weapons. Since then, the organization, working with the United Nations, has found that the Syrian government used chlorine gas as a weapon three times in 2014 and 2015, violating the treaty. Rebel fighters, doctors and antigovernment activists say there have been numerous other chlorine attacks, including at least two in the past week, in one case killing a doctor as he worked. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has also accused the Islamic State of using banned mustard gas in Iraq and Syria. The area around Khan Sheikhoun is not held by the Islamic State, but by other insurgents:   militants and a variety of other rebel groups. A chemical weapons attack, if carried out by the government, would be a brazen statement of impunity, coming during a major international meeting in Brussels where officials are debating whether the European Union and other countries will contribute billions of dollars for reconstructing Syria if it is presided over by a government run by Mr. Assad.",0

4420,"Comment on You Are What You Read: Research Reveals The Importance Of What You’re Reading by Du er, hvad du læser. | Dyslexic workers","  According to a new study published in the International Journal of Business Administration in May 2016, your love for “light reading,” and web-based aggregators like Reddit, Tumblr and BuzzFeed may not be doing you any good. The researchers concluded that what students read in college directly affects the level of writing they achieve . In fact, students who pick up academic journals, literary fiction, or general nonfiction wrote with greater syntactic sophistication than those who preferred the former options. Furthermore, the highest scores came from those who resorted to academic journals, and the lowest to solely web-based content. But then again, “good writing” is often subjective. What we’re really talking about here is whether our overall ability to convey what we want to say comes across well to the masses. Why You Need To Start “Deep Reading” As opposed to light reading, which involves little more than comprehending and decoding words, deep reading involves reading that is slow, immersive, emotional, and morally complex. When you are deep reading, you are absorbing language rich in detail, allusion, and metaphor. This style of reading works to engage the part of the brain regions that allow the reader to feel as though they are experiencing the event. It’s thought of as an exercise that promotes brain health — boosting your levels of empathy because you practice reflection, analysis, and personal subtext. Light reading lacks these meaningful attributes. Online blogs, for instance, are said to lack a genuine voice, viewpoint, and analysis that provokes deeper thoughts. Essentially, you’ll likely forget what you read in mere minutes. Likewise, Stanford University researchers concluded the benefits of deep reading as opposed to light reading. They found that close literary reading gives your brain a workout in multiple complex cognitive functions. And while simple pleasure reading increases blood flow to different areas of the brain, deep reading proves more of an effective brain exercise. Why You Should Read Poems An article published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies reported that more emotionally charged writing works to arouse several regions in the brain that respond to music . When comparing reading poetry and prose, researchers found that poetry activates the posterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobes — both of which are linked to self-analysis. For the study, volunteers also read their favorite poems, which stimulated parts of the brain associated with memory. These areas of the brain, predominantly located on the right side, had already been shown to provoke “shivers down the spine” as a result of an emotional reaction to music. Why You Should Read Literary Fiction Recent experiments have revealed that reading literary fiction makes way for better performance on tests of affective theory of mind, or understanding others’ thinking and wellbeing. The study published in the International Journal of Business Administration found that this type of reading enhances theory of mind, which may be influenced by a higher amount of engagement with real works of art as opposed to reading magazine articles, interviews, and online nonfiction reporting.   Pick Deep Reading Over Watching Television When you turn on the TV, you’re signaling your brain power to shut down. Likewise, reading lightweight material for entertainment simply doesn’t fire up your writing brain to help you become a better writer. So, rather than turning on the tube or scrolling through articles on Facebook, spend more time deep-reading literary fiction and poetry.

4421,Five Filipino hostages freed by Somali pirates reunite with families,"More Filipino fisherman Arnel Balbero (R), who was held hostage for nearly five years by Somali pirates, cries as he meets his relatives after arriving at the Manila International Airport on October 28, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Five Filipino fishermen who were released after being held hostage by Somali pirates for nearly five years have reunited with their families. 
The seafarers arrived at the airport in the Philippine capital Manila on Friday. 
""I am so happy. This is what I had been praying for every night,"" said Arnel Balbero, 33, as he was embraced by his four siblings at the airport. 
""Just to be with my family, even if we have nothing, even if we have only little to eat, I am already happy,"" he said. 
His sister, Lilia, trembled at the sight of her brother. ""It's like a miracle. We never lost hope he would be freed,"" she said. 
The Filipinos were among 26 freed hostages from Cambodia, China, Taiwan, Indonesia and Vietnam who were freed on October 22. The 26 hostages plus three others made up the crew of Naham 3, which was seized south of the Seychelles in March 2012. 
The captain of their Omani-flagged but Taiwanese-owned vessel died during the hijacking and two other crew members succumbed to illness in captivity. 
Recounting memories 
Balbero's cousin and fellow ex-hostage, Elmer, said the Somali pirates had cared little about the health of their captives. 
""We asked the pirates for medicine but they did not give us any. Instead they said, 'Where is your money?'"" said Elmer. 
The captives also said they suffered beatings at the hands of the pirates. 
""In our first week, they called it our introduction. They used bamboo to beat us,"" Arnel said. 
To survive, the Filipinos did chores for their captors, washing their clothes and even their weapons. 
""We took it as a chance to also wash. We couldn't take a bath often because they only gave us a liter of water each day,"" Arnel said. 
Hugging his two teenage daughters, Elmer said it was thoughts of seeing his family again that kept him going during his captivity. 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the men were freed after a ransom was paid by the ship's owner as well as groups contracted to negotiate with the pirates, Taiwanese media reported. 
John Steed, who works with the Hostage Support Partnership, said the local community and tribal elders were involved in the ""difficult situation."" 
""These are poor fishermen. The ship had no value, they had no insurance, and of course governments don't want to be involved in these sort of negotiations either,"" he said. Sailors who had been held hostage by pirates for more than four years stand for a group photograph as they prepare to board an airplane after being released in Galkayo, Somalia, October 23, 2016.

The sailors are believed to be among the last remaining captives seized by Somali pirates during the surge in hostage-taking in the mid-2000s. 
Piracy off the coast of Somalia has reduced significantly in recent years due to stronger international naval presence. Loading ...",0

4423,ISIS Suicide Attack Kills 48 in Southern Yemen - The New York Times,"AL MUKALLA, Yemen  —   A suicide bomber disguised as a disabled man blew himself up at a gathering of Yemeni security officers in the southern port of Aden on Sunday, killing 48 people and wounding dozens of others, Yemeni officials said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, naming the attacker and publishing a photograph of him smiling with a rifle at his side and wearing an explosive vest. The attack was the second this month to kill scores of security forces near a military base in Aden, highlighting the failure of the Yemeni government and its allies to ensure basic security in the areas they control. Yemen has been mired in conflict since 2014, when rebels aligned with Iran, known as the Houthis, seized the capital, Sana. They later forced the internationally recognized government into exile in Saudi Arabia. The country is now split, with the Houthis and army units allied with them controlling the northwest and a coalition of forces nominally loyal to Yemen’s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, holding the south and the east. Jihadists have taken advantage of the disorder to launch attacks in the south, where the Islamic State and the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda have a presence. Sunday’s attack occurred as hundreds of members of the Yemeni security forces crowded outside the home of Nasser   the commander of the Special Security Forces, near a military base in Aden, where they hoped to receive their salaries, said Ramzi   the commander’s office manager. The bomber was dressed in a police uniform and pretended to be disabled, infiltrating the crowd before detonating his explosive, Mr. Hassani said. The blast killed 48 people and wounded 84, according to     of the Yemeni Health Ministry. The bombing occurred a little more than a week after a suicide bombing near the same base. That attack, on Dec. 10, targeted a gathering of soldiers, killing 57. The Islamic State also claimed that attack.",0
4424,Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps: a deep insight into Iran’s most powerful institution,"1681 Views November 15, 2016 No Comments Analyses The Saker 
By Aram Mirzaei 
Described by the Western media as a “shadowy organization” involved in “clandestine activity” across the Middle East, not much is truly known about the “Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps” (IRGC) in the West as Western governments and media outlets are having an increasingly difficult time figuring out the IRGC and the role it plays in both the domestic and foreign relations of Iran. You can’t understand Iran and its politics without understanding the IRGC, why it was formed and what role it plays in Iranian politics. 
Guardians of the revolution- The Pasdaran and other armed revolutionary organizations 
Formed on May 5 1979 following the Islamic Revolution, the Sepah Pasdaran-e Enghelabe Eslami (Army of Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, in Iran more commonly referred to simply as ‘Pasdaran’, meaning Guardians) was created to unite the different paramilitary forces that were present in the post-revolutionary Iran, to form a single force, loyal to the revolutionary government and to function as a counter balance to the influence and power of the regular military (Artesh) which was seen as untrustworthy because of its traditional loyalty to the Shah. 
When the Pasdaran was created by decree from Ayatollah Khomeini in May 1979, its original members consisted of some 6,000 militia men who had fought the Pahlavi regime even before 1978, many of which had received guerrilla training with Palestinian and Lebanese groups, most notably the Shia Amal militia in Lebanon. 
Many of the forces that had helped topple the Shah’s Pahlavi regime, like the Fedayeen-e Khalq and Mujahedin-e Khalq, had formed their own organized militias in the struggle, and many more armed groups were created more or less spontaneously during the chaos of the Revolution, as the raiding of armouries and army barracks made weapons widely available to opposition groups. The existence of many independent armed groupings certainly represented a potential threat to any one political faction trying to impose its authority over the post-revolutionary Iranian state. Although eventually growing to become the most important of the paramilitary organizations, the Pasdaran did face its fair share of competitors in enforcing revolutionary ideals. A particular challenge to the Pasdaran’s authority was posed by the plethora of komitehs (committees), makeshift, freelance bands of local Islamists that took control and allocated to themselves the powers of justice and administration over assorted neighbourhoods throughout the major cities of the Islamic Republic as the Pahlavi regime’s authority began to collapse. The triumph of the Pasdaran over these other organizations and centres of power was never preordained, but ultimately derived from the Pasdaran’s superior effectiveness as a guard for the emerging revolutionary government of Ayatollah Khomeini. 
The Pasdaran was from its inception an ideologically driven force that recruited heavily from the faithful supporters of the revolution’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Drawing lessons from the US and UK backed 1953 coup d’etat which saw the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in favour of the young Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the revolution needed to rely on a force of its own rather than borrowing the previous Pahlavi regime’s units. Being one of the first revolutionary institutions, the Pasdaran legitimized the revolution and gave the government an armed basis of support to defend itself. Despite this move to counter the regular army of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini decided not to disband the army altogether since he realized the dangers of doing this, as thousands of servicemen becoming unemployed would turn into potential enemies of the revolutionary government. Rather Khomeini replaced the Army’s commanders and wanted the Army and the Pasdaran to not view each other as rivals, but rather as two branches of the armed forces working towards a common goal. 
The Basij – The people’s militia 
On November 25 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the creation of a youth militia which according to him should be a 20-million-man strong force. Article 151 of the constitution obliges the government to “provide a program of military training, with all requisite facilities, for all its citizens, in accordance with the Islamic criteria, in such a way that all citizens will always be able to engage in the armed defence of the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Formed through a merger of the komitehs (committees) and other various youth movements, the Sazman- Basij-e Mostazafin (The organization for mobilization of the oppressed), commonly known as simply Basij (the organized) was created in April 1980. 
The Basij was to serve as an auxiliary force engaged in activities such as internal security, law enforcement, organizing religious activities and ceremonies, and to help the revolutionary government in fighting against Baluchi, Kurdish and Turkmen separatists in the remote regions of Iran. While the Pasdaran was mainly open for men older than the age of 18, the Basij was intended to be for the youth, however people of all walks of life were eligible to join this organization. The Basij came to open local offices in almost every corner of Iranian cities, with every neighbourhood in every Iranian city having a local Basij office to both recruit people and to defend the Islamic Revolution during its first unstable years. 
In time, the Basij, along with the Pasdaran were to become an integral part of the revolutionary government’s ability to resist its enemies, both internal and external ones. 
The Nojeh coup plot of 1980 
In 1980, the Basij helped to prevent a coup planned to overthrow the newly established revolutionary government when several officers and servicemen from the Iranian Army and former secret service loyal to the Shah were arrested at the Nojeh Air Base near Hamedan in western Iran. The plan was organized by Colonel Mohammad Baqer Bani Amiri, with the help of Shapour Bakhtiar, the last Prime Minister of the Pahlavi regime who provided financial support. The plan was also said to have been supported by Iran’s future arch-enemy, Saddam Hussein who had developed a deep animosity towards the revolutionary government. According to then-Iranian President Abolhassan Banisadr, the government discovered eight major cells, and exposed the plotters’ plan, leading to the arrests: “their plan was to give the appearance of a coup d’etat to restore the Shah, while the real aim was to provide a pretext to cover the Iraqi invasion. According to the information we received, the conspirators had set up a military camp in [the Iraqi city of] Solimanieh and planned to ignite a Kurdish revolt and organize demonstrations throughout Iran. Their strategy was simple: internal disorders would first disperse Iranian military forces, so that on the very first day of the Iraqi attack Saddam could occupy the whole Western part of the country.” According to the Basij themselves, a Basij member was planted inside the conspirators’ group and kept the revolutionary government informed of the activities of the counterrevolutionaries. This enabled them to swiftly act and prevent the coup attempt. 
The Iran-Iraq War 
As a result of the revolutionary government’s attempt to neutralize the potential threat of the Army acting as a counter-revolutionary force, the Army went down from 285,000 to around 150,000 troops at the outbreak the Iran-Iraq war. Perhaps even more damaging for the Iranian Army’s ability to conduct military operations was the forced removal of some 12,000 skilled and trained officers, constituting between 30 and 50 percent of the Iranian officer corps from the rank of major to colonel. Despite these difficulties on the Iranian side however, Saddam Hussein’s gamble that the time was ripe to strike a blow to his neighbouring country was proven to be a major miscalculation. For the revolutionary government, the war was treated as the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the resilience and vitality of the Iranian Revolution to the world. The Iranian people quickly mobilized and rallied to the defence of their country with great patriotic zeal, the Pasdaran developed to take on the size and shape of a full-fledged conventional army to counter the Iraqi threat posed against the gains of the Islamic Revolution. 
The Pasdaran’s role was largely focused on internal threats to the Islamic Republic, as opposed to the strictly external focus of the regular Army, however this was to quickly change with the Iraqi invasion as the revolutionary government advocated the rise and expansion of the Pasdaran to conduct large-scale military combat operations, unwilling to leave the fate of the Islamic Republic in the hands of the still strongly distrusted remnants of the professional and modernized Army of the Shah 
The war which came to be known in Iran as the Holy Defence thus became a defining moment for the Pasdaran, greatly expanding its responsibilities and importance within the emerging revolutionary Iranian state-structure. Relations between the Pasdaran and the regular Army throughout the war remained strained by mutual suspicions, historical grievances and resentments, political differences and uncertainty. A particularly recurring point of contention between the two organizations concerned the reliance on different military tactics,with the professional military insisting on well-planned and well-organized operations, while the ideologically driven Pasdaran argued that religious and nationalistic zeal, determination and superiority in manpower were enough. Pasdaran commander Mohsen Rezaei once asserted that: 
“Unlike the army […] the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps is in charge of safeguarding the revolution and its gains […]. we in the Revolutionary Guards give primary importance to the ideological and political dimensions more than the military ones.” 
The Pasdaran came to see itself as embodying the spirit of the Islamic Revolution, where the will and dedication of the Iranian people had won out over the professional, modernized and “culturally contaminated” security organizations of the Shah’s Pahlavi regime, and sought to wage the war against Iraq along the same lines. This in practice meant a heavy reliance on lightly armed and manpower-intensive infantry attacks, with the ultimate goal of attaining Martyrdom, while the regular Army stressed the importance of conventional tactics incorporating modern, mechanized means of warfare. This constant rivalry severely complicated the ability of the Pasdaran and the Army to perform joint combat operations, and with the Revolutionary government tightening its grip over Iranian society, the favoured Pasdaran increasingly got the last say in the planning and execution of the Iranian war effort. 
The already close relationship between the Pasdaran and the Clerical establishment (Ulema) became even more apparent during the course of the Iran-Iraq War with several members of the Ulema joining the Pasdaran on the frontlines as part of a morale boost campaign, among them a young Ayatollah Khamenei dressed in a Pasdaran uniform. 
The Pasdaran enjoyed numerous privileges over the Army during the war, including superior pay and benefits and first call upon available arms and spare parts. With the Iranian population rushing to the defence of their country, the Pasdaran, soon developed from a revolutionary militia into an organized armed force outnumbering and rivalling the structure of the regular Iranian Army by absorbing and organising the thousands of highly motivated volunteers that flocked to the warfront. The extensive numerical increase in Pasdaran forces alone testify to their rise in power and influence during the war, doubling from some 20,000 – 30,000 in 1980 to around 50,000 during the first year of warfare, this number further increasing nine-fold by 1987, with the total forces of the Pasdaran consisting of close to 450,000 men as the war entered its final year. 
The Pasdaran’s manpower was mobilized through local-level branches of the Pasdaran offices that were established throughout Iran in parallel with the development of the Pasdaran’s national command structure. Many of the lower-level branches grew out of the komitehs or other groups that had seized power in their respective areas in the course of the Revolution, and above the local level the Pasdaran was organized into ten administrative regions, largely corresponding to the then-Iranian provinces. On top of these were the Supreme Council of the Sepah Pasdaran and the Pasdaran Commander. 
Of the Pasdaran’s original members many belonged to the Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution (MIR), a group loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini that was established in the course of the Revolution. Many MIR-members had left the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) because of the MEK’s emphasis on what they perceived to be Marxist over Islamic ideology (the latter became an archenemy of the Islamic Republic in later years), the MIR strongly supported the Islamic character of the revolution. MIR members formed the leadership and the core of the Pasdaran, and this first group generally tended to be better educated and more politically sophisticated than the zealous volunteers that later flocked to the Pasdaran. 
Although relying heavily on ideologically zealous manpower in massive infantry attacks at first, the Pasdaran came to incorporate more sophisticated armed services during the course of the Iran-Iraq War. The Pasdaran soon developed its own armoured and artillery units to reduce its reliance on the regular Army within these fields, and from September 1986 the Pasdaran also started with advanced artillery training. The Pasdaran further rivalled the structure of the Army by creating its own Air Force and Naval Forces, thus expanding into many areas that had previously been the sole domain of the Iranian Army inherited from the Shah’s days. The creation of the Sepah Pasdaran Air Force did however not play a significant role in the war due to the international arms embargo preventing Iran from importing new weapons or spare parts for the aircrafts left behind by the former Shah’s Air Force. 
The Sepah Pasdaran Air Force (later Aerospace forces) did however develop several missile units for air defence against Iraqi aircraft, and managed to fire several surface-to-surface SCUD missiles against military and civilian installations in Iraq. Despite its moderate participation in the war effort, the establishment of the Pasdaran Air Force nevertheless served as a symbol of the Pasdaran’s increased responsibilities and influence. The Sepah Pasdaran Navy however saw more direct action in the Iran-Iraq War. Unofficially in existence since 1982, it participated in the successful 1986 Faw offensive, and was formally inaugurated in 1987 to retaliate against Iraqi attacks on Iranian ships. In the last year of the war, from 1987-88, the Pasdaran Navy was given resources and publicity for its challenge to the US naval build-up in the Gulf, employing hit-and-run tactics from small naval crafts armed with RPG-7’s and missile units armed with Chinese Silkworm surface-to-surface missiles to harass US ships and reflagged tankers. 
Basij during the war 
Another important component of the Pasdaran’s military forces was provided by the Basij-e Mostazafan. The Basij was as previously explained a mass mobilising popular volunteer militia, created following the call from Ayatollah Khomeini to establish a “20 million-man army” to defend the Islamic Republic from both internal and external enemies following the Iraqi invasion. Although the Basij as an organization was officially separate from the Pasdaran during the war and had its own commander, in practice it has always been part of the Pasdaran. The Basij was formally placed under Pasdaran control on January 1 1981, and the Pasdaran recruited, organized, trained and commanded all Basij units during the war, although it was not until 2009 that the control structure of the Basij was officially merged with that of the Pasdaran. The Basij served as a reserve pool of manpower for the Pasdaran, and military training for basijis generally consisted of a two week instruction program in the use of grenades and automatic rifles, heavily imbued with religious and ideological indoctrination with a focus on martyrdom and the promise of heaven for those killed in the war. The Basij was originally a volunteer and not a fixed force, whose members usually served a brief three month tour before returning to their homes, jobs or studies, and seasonal fluctuations made it hard to contemplate the exact capabilities of the basijis. The Basij nevertheless played an integral part in the Iranian war effort, and although the number of readily available basijis probably seldom exceeded 100,000 at any one time, by 1987 some 3 million Iranians had received Basij training, adding substantially to the potential power of the Pasdaran in a scenario of all-out mobilization. The creation of the Basij was thus another development strongly contributing to the rise of the Pasdaran in the course of the Iran-Iraq war. 
According to an Iranian source personally close to me and speaking on the condition of anonymity, the creation of the Basij played an instrumental role in mobilizing the Iranian people to defend Iran from the Iraqi invasion. Every local Basij office was flocked with boys as young as 12 years old who wanted to join what became known as the Holy Defence in Iran. Mothers were proud of sending their sons to the front and according to the same Iranian source, young boys used to run away from home to join the Basij, often leaving behind them letters where they would apologize to their parents for running away but that they were proud to defend their homeland. These boys would often assume non-combat roles on the frontlines, such as cleaning weapons for the Pasdaran, cooking food for the soldiers at the front, helping to spread propaganda across restive regions such as Kurdistan and participating in mine-clearing operations. On some occasions however, these boys did partake in Iran’s infamous human-wave attacks which resulted in devastating losses for the Iranian side. 
Sepah Pasdaran after the war – building upon a legacy 
Much like Ayatollah Khomeini, the Pasdaran opposed the ending of the conflict with Saddam Hussein, and continued to dedicate itself to the slogan of “war until victory”, referring to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime and the export of the Islamic Revolution to the Shia majority Iraq. By 1988 however, there was a broad political consensus forming in the country around the need to end the war due to Iraqi counterattacks, American assaults in the Gulf and the exhaustion caused by the so called “war of the cities” phase of the war. Political leaders like Khamenei started to emphasise that Iran’s endurance, sacrifices and national solidarity throughout the long war had proven that Iran had already fulfilled its divine mission irrespective of obtaining a final victory, thus the need for further hostilities was no longer needed. 
In their book Iran and Iraq at War by Shahram Chubin and Charles Tripp, they assess that “If Iraq succeeds in holding out for a return to the status quo ante bellum, it will have withstood a siege from a country three times its size. Iran, by contrast, can take little glory from a peace that takes it back to the pre-war settlement.” 
This assessment fails to take into account several crucial facts. Firstly, with Iraq being the aggressor in this conflict and their return to the status quo ante bellum represented a triumph for Iran and the Sepah Pasdaran as they managed to deny Saddam Hussein his ambitions, thus costing him a lot of prestige and financial damage that the eight year long war had caused Iraq. Secondly, Iraq might have fought a country three times its size, but Iran had withstood the attack of a country that enjoyed massive superiority in terms of advanced weaponry, financial aid and international support while itself being under a heavy arms embargo. To shed some light on the “balance” in heavy military equipment, in 1987 estimates put Iraq’s capacities in battle tanks and combat aircrafts at 4,800 and 400-500 respectively, while the corresponding numbers for Iran at the time were approximated at 900-1,250 and 80-105. Against these odds, the Iranian achievement of obtaining a peace based on the pre-war settlement must be seen as a victory for Iran and the Sepah Pasdaran. Although not being able to claim a military victory from the conflict, the Pasdaran could none the less derive a huge amount of prestige from having managed to put up a formidable fight in what Pasdaran Commander Mohsen Rezaei characterized as “the war against the whole world”. 
During the war, the Pasdaran grew to become a national actor, defending not just politically likeminded people but also the whole country against the Iraqi invaders. Iranians that were initially not positively inclined towards the Pasdaran or their ideology came to find themselves fighting for the same basic values of Iranian independence in the face of external danger and had to acknowledge the Pasdaran’s crucial role in defending the Iranian nation. By the end of the war, the Pasdaran had become a symbol of national resistance and represented the Iranian people to a much larger degree than before the war, thus adding to its legitimacy as one of the Iranian state’s most powerful institution. 
From its early beginnings, the Sepah Pasdaran were involved in the struggle to control the outcome of the Islamic revolution, after the war, the Pasdaran however became to wield substantial political influence on its own merits. Pasdaran minister Mohsen Rafiqdoost justified the politicization of the Pasdaran, arguing that the Pasdaran was meant to defend the revolution also from within. Unlike the Army, the Pasdaran’s mission was to defend the purity of the revolution; this meant that it was not only a military task but also a political one. There has been a debate as to whether the Pasdaran should engage in politics or not, what however is clear is that their institutional strength has given them the political influence to have a say in Iran’s internal affairs. 
With the huge expansion of the Pasdarans’s organization in the wake of the Iran-Iraq War, the Pasdaran greatly increased its importance and power, making it able to determine and influence the appointment of officials in many other institutions, including the civilian leadership and even the regular Iranian Army. This was seen in the Pasdaran’s successful pressure to reinsert and promote Ali Seyyed Shirazi as commander of the Army’s ground forces in March 1981, and later the promotion of Ali Shamkhani, one of the Pasdaran’s most prominent figures after Rezaei, to become commander of the Navy in October 1989. 
Many former and current Pasdaran members also rose to prominent positions within the post-revolutionary Iranian government. Early examples include Hasan Abedi-Jafari, a former member of the Pasdaran Supreme Council who served as Minister of Commerce until 1988, and Ali Mohammad Besharati, an anti-Shah guerrilla member, former director of the Pasdaran’s Intelligence Unit, and former member of the Pasdaran Supreme Council, who became Deputy Foreign Minister in 1984. 
It should however be said that the Pasdaran personnel did not necessarily remain a united and coherent group when they entered into politics, as factional disputes did indeed exist within the Pasdaran itself, with some former members distancing themselves from earlier hardliner policies. One such example is the current Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehqan, who himself is a Pasdaran member yet part of the Reformist cabinet of President Hassan Rouhani. 
Shortly after the war, at the time of Ayatollah Khomeini’s death in 1989, Pasdaran members, and associates held 5 out of 25 Cabinet positions in the Iranian government, setting a strong precursor for the Pasdaran’s later substantial involvements in civilian politics, not least experienced with the former Pasdaran member Mahmoud Ahmedinejad ascending to the presidency in 2005 through the Principlist Abadgaran alliance platform, widely believed to be a political front for the Pasdaran. The Pasdaran also got involved in other civilian spheres by establishing schools, research facilities and engaging in the procurement and distribution of goods. This has turned the Pasdaran into an independent business empire in addition to its role as the principal guarantor for the Islamic Republics survival. 
Two organizations closely affiliated with the Pasdaran were the Bonyad-e Mostazafan va Janbazan, the “Foundation of the Oppressed and Disabled”, and the Bonyad-e Shahidan, the “Martyr’s Foundation”. The Bonyad-e Mostazafan va Janbazan received the fortunes left by the former Shah’s Pahlavi Foundation and other properties confiscated in the course of the Revolution, including hundreds of companies, factories, housing units, agricultural lands and substantial holdings in the West. These massive assets were then used to reward the loyal supporters of the Islamic Republic and the Pasdaran. When the Iran-Iraq war broke out, the Bonyad-e Shahidan was created and given large funds dedicated to the war effort, especially to take care of the families of martyrs and wounded personnel from the Pasdaran and the Basij. Basically it served as a guarantee for those who lost family members in the war, that their beloved one’s efforts did not go in vain. The families of martyrs received a grant of 2 million rials (roughly $ 30,000 at the time), while those crippled and long-service volunteers were given priority in acquiring scarce goods, job, housing and medical care. 
The close relationship between the Pasdaran and the above mentioned foundations were cemented by the large degree to which Pasdaran members rotated in and out of or served simultaneously in these organizations, with one example being Pasdaran Minister Mohsen Rafiqdoost becoming head of the Bonyad-e Mostazafan after the war’s end in 1988.

Qods Force – Sepah Pasdaran’s foreign wing 
The Pasdaran also developed a foreign wing called the Qods Forces (Sepah-e Qods) dedicated to spreading the ideology of the revolution outside the country and to the wider Middle East region. During the Iran-Iraq war, the Sepah-e Qods provided support to the Kurds in Iraq that were fighting Saddam Hussein but it was also active in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the Sepah-e Qods also oversaw the formation and arming of the Badr Organization, the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shia Iraqi political party and a staunch opponent of the Baathist regime in Iraq. The Badr Organization consisted of several thousand Iraqi exiles, refugees and defectors who fought alongside Iranian troops in the Iran-Iraq war. The Badr Organization and other Shia paramilitary organizations in Iraq are still very much aligned with the Islamic Republic and the Sepah Pasdaran whom they view as a role model for their future. 
Since 1979 the Revolutionary government had supported the Shia Hezbe Wahdat in Afghanistan against the Afghan government of Mohammad Najibullah and the Soviet forces backing his regime. The Sepah-e Qods were sent to train and arm the Hezbe Wahdat militia in an effort to counter both the Saudi backed Wahhabi Afghan militia groups and the Soviet backed government. 
Connections with foreign organizations and militias with the aim of exporting the Islamic Revolution, was to become a hallmark of the Sepah-e Qods who were also instrumental in creating the Lebanese Resistance movement Hezbollah in the midst of Lebanon’s civil war. This cooperation is still ongoing and Hezbollah heavily relies on the Pasdaran for weapons and ideological influences. Heading this special unit of Pasdaran members is the famous General Qassem Soleimani. 
Sepah-e Qods in Syria 
On September 16 2012, Sepah Pasdaran commander Mohammad Ali-Aziz Jafari announced that the Sepah-e Qods were present in Syria, however he added that “this does not mean that Iran has a military presence” and that the aid was limited. According to Iranian sources and security experts, the presence of Sepah-e Qods personnel in Syria rose to several hundred military specialists including several senior commanders with the primary task to gather intelligence and manage the logistics of battle for the Syrian Arab Army forces. Since the Russian intervention in Syria starting from September 30 2015, the presence of Sepah-e Qods personnel has also been boosted with General Qassem Soleimani having been seen on several occasions near the Aleppo frontlines, taking charge of several offensives in the area, most notably the 2015 South Aleppo offensive which saw joint Sepah-e Qods forces, Hezbollah and Iraqi paramilitaries capturing swathes of territory in the southern Aleppo countryside from the US-backed Jihadist militants of Jaysh Al-Fateh. During this time, several Sepah-e Qods commanders and officers have been martyred, most notably the famous General Hossein Hamedani who was killed on October 7 2015. 
Furthermore, it was reported on Sputnik News that in November 2015, the Sepah-e Qods conducted a successful rescue mission of the Russian pilot who was shot down by Turkey over the Latakia province. The commander of the Sepah-e Qods Major General Qassem Soleimani got reportedly in touch with his Russian counterparts and said that a special unit had been formed and was ready for the rescue operation. He also explained that the squad was made up of men from the Lebanese Hezbollah and soldiers from the Syrian Special Forces, who had undergone special training under the guidance of Iranian instructors. Apart from this fact, the Syrian soldiers were familiar with the terrain. 
General Soleimani assumed command of the ground operation and Russian aircraft had to carry out air cover and enable satellite surveillance. Once the location of the Russian pilot was determined via satellite through the built-in GPS device, it became clear that the pilot was located six kilometers behind the front line between the Syrian army forces and the opposition forces. The Special squad that entered the territory controlled by militants was not only able to save the Russian pilot, but also destroy all of the remaining terrorists there who had the most modern weapons in their possession. All of the 24 fighters not only survived, but also returned to their base without injuries. [1] 
Another important mission of the Sepah-e Qods was to establish, train and arm various militias commonly known in Iran as the “Modafean-e Haram” (Defenders of the Holy Shrines). These groups include the Afghan dominated Liwaa Fatemiyyoun and the Pakistani dominated Liwaa Zeynabiyyon that fight alongside government troops battling the Jihadist militants. The Sepah-e Qods mainly recruit these personnel from the Shia Afghan and Pakistani populations that have vowed to defend the holy shrines of Shia Islam from attacks by the Takfiri militants of ISIL and Jabhat Al-Nusra who on several occasions have threatened to destroy these shrines. 
Born as a small militia in the midst of the revolutionary chaos of Iran in 1979, the Sepah Pasdaran has come to grow into the spine of the current political structure and a major player in the Iranian economy while achieving the status of self-sufficiency in the military field. With its rise to become a national power during the Iran-Iraq war, the Syrian war may very well prove to turn the Sepah Pasdaran into one of the most powerful regional forces to be reckoned with.

4425,| Man whose son was killed by illegal immigrant files two suits against feds,"The Hill – by Don Rosenburg 
I always cared about the immigration issue, even before my son was killed. As a 30-year resident of southern California, I’d been noticing for years the extent to which concrete and sprawl was swallowing up the natural environs of my corner of the state. Of all states, I always thought, why is it the one that’s most beautiful and with the most arable and productive land that’s being torn up and paved over. And just how much traffic and gridlock are people willing to take, I would think to myself. Then my son, in his second year of law school, was run over three times and killed by an illegal-alien driver. That’s when I became an immigration-control activist and that’s why I can’t support Hillary Clinton , the open-borders candidate for president. 
And that’s why I’ve just filed two lawsuits; one against the Department of Homeland Security and one against the Justice Department. With the help of the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), I’m pursuing a complaint against DHS for refusing to consider the environmental impacts of its mass immigration policies, a gross violation of environmental law we argue. Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), all federal agencies must take a “hard look” at every “major action” they commit to and produce for the public an environmental assessment which a) explores all potential impacts of the action, and b) considers all possible alternatives. Since the law was enacted in 1970, California’s population has doubled from 20 to 40 million and DHS (including its predecessor, Immigration and Naturalization Services), has never published a single report exploring the possible impacts associated with its immigration policies. As we argue in our brief, if the public knew the effects of runaway population growth maybe they would have rallied that much harder for tougher enforcement and lower immigration-levels. Having ignored their obligations under the statute for so long, this could be one the biggest environmental law violations ever committed in the nation’s history. 
DHS, I must add, does write some NEPA reports. For instance, it calculates the impacts caused by its illegal-alien detainment facilities, just not for the people detained inside them then released to the public. This has to be done, we argue. America’s environmental footprint is gargantuan, the biggest in the world only next to dictatorial China. The American public’s constantly harangued that so-called “Dreamers”, that insufferably inane term, simply want an American standard of living and a piece of the American pie. But as I used to tell my son as a child, ‘wanting’ is different than ‘needing.’ America is a mere 5 percent of the world’s population, yet it consumes 20 percent of its petroleum. So every time a legal or illegal alien comes into the country and settles, the level of greenhouse gases in the world goes up just a little bit more. As for urban sprawl, between 1980 and 2000 America paved over a piece of land (much of it arable) that was around the size of Illinois . But does the correlation between population growth and environmental impact, a simple logical connection your average 3rd -grader could grasp, ever get even a moment’s discussion in the major media? For the future of our kids, it must. 
Same goes for illegal alien-crime. Routinely, we’re told there’s a “ scholarly consensus ” that illegal aliens commit fewer criminal offenses than citizens. As if this could be supportable. Most illegal aliens are absolutely skill-less and skill-less people commit far more crime on average—Never mind for now the labor markets-argument that the last thing our increasingly knowledge-based and roboticized economy needs is more skill-less workers. And nothing, of course, is stopping criminals on the run in Mexico from simply relocating here, out of the policia ’s reach. 
In any case, we know anyway that illegal alien-crime is a Rumsfeldian “known unknown”, as DOJ apparently doesn’t even bother to tally this information–My son’s death was counted as having been killed by a citizen with a driver’s license. At least for the public, that is. And that’s why IRLI and I are suing them as well. The agency has refused to comply with our requests for records on this issue. Why they can’t divulge to the American public these sorts of facts is telling in itself. After all, the Justice Department can tell me how many pick-pocketing crimes there were last year but not how many people were killed by illegal aliens. Not that this should matter in the debate over illegal immigration. Since they shouldn’t have been here in the first place, any crime an illegal alien commits against our own, like the killing of my boy, is a special tragedy. A nightmare that will occur again and again if Hillary Clinton takes the White House.

4426,Poll: Americans Back Donald Trump’s Immigration Reforms 3-1,"Americans support Donald Trump’s Jan. 25 comprehensive immigration reform by three to one, according to a new poll by Rasmussen Reports.[  percent of Americans agree with the immigration priorities described in Trump’s Jan. 25 Executive Order, which seeks to exclude migrants who oppose Americans’ values. Only 19 percent of Americans  —   and only 28 percent of Democrats  —   disapprove of Trump’s decision to align immigration policy with Americans’ civic and cultural values.  Here’s the critical passage from Trump’s reform: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The new Rasmussen poll asked respondents if they favor a proposal that would keep out “those who do not support the U. S. Constitution or who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States would not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred for reasons of religion, race, gender or sexual orientation. ”   percent approved the policy, 19 percent opposed, and 21 percent declined to answer the question.   percent of   supported the policy, as did 49 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents. Trump’s popular policy was largely ignored by the establishment media, which instead focussed on his popular exclusion of Islamic migrants and refugees from several majority Muslim countries. That subordinate part of his plan is being opposed by   Islamist groups, progressives, and judges in the Ninth Circuit of Appeals. Curiously, even though 28 percent of Democrats oppose Trump’s reform of immigration policy to match American values, 65 percent of Democrats also wish to impose tougher penalties on fellow Americans who commit crimes that violate progressives’ political values. When asked “Should criminals be prosecuted more severely if it can be proven that their crime was motivated by the victim’s race, color, religion, national origin or sexual orientation?” 65 percent of Democrats said yes, as did 57 percent of Republicans. The survey of 1, 000 American adults was conducted on Feb.   2017 by Rasmussen Reports. Other polls show that Americans want legal immigrants to integrate into the U. S. culture, and they oppose Americans’ integration into foreign cultures. In June 2016, for example, a poll showed that 56 percent of Americans want to exclude migrants who believe in Islam’s sharia law, which requires that democracy and civic norms be subordinated to the Islamic scriptures. In contrast, only about 20 percent of Americans told the pollster that they did not oppose the immigration of people who believe in sharia law. Through his tenure, President Barack Obama boosted the progressive claim that Americans should not put their culture first but instead should subordinate their   society into a diverse globalist mix of conflicting foreign cultures and governments. Obama described his   policy in a Nov. 2014 speech to Democratic supporters in Chicago: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, ‘Well, I don’t want those folks’  —   even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. Obama made the same   claim in September 2015: When I hear folks talking as if somehow these [foreign] kids are different than my kids or less worthy in the eyes of God, that somehow that they are less worthy of our respect and consideration and care, I think that’s  . I don’t believe that, I think it is wrong and I think we should do better, because that’s how America was made. A July 2016 poll shows that roughly three out of four voters  —   including nearly three out of four Democrat voters  —   believe that “instead of giving jobs and healthcare to millions of refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and put Americans back to work. ” The view was shared by almost 90 percent of   and almost 70 percent of Hispanics.  Under current policy, the federal government annually provide new work permits to roughly 1 million legal immigrants and to roughly 1 million temporary contract workers. That policy adds roughly 2 million new workers to the labor supply each year, just as 4 million young Americans begin looking for work, and it shifts roughly $500 billion per year from employees to employers and investors, according to an analysis provided in a September report by the National Academy of Sciences.

4427,Amazon’s July 12 ‘Day of Action’ for Net Neutrality is Big Communist Anniversary - Breitbart,"Amazon is mobilizing a July 12 collective “Day of Action” for tech corporations and social justice warriors to unite in rebelling against the FCC’s efforts to overturn Net Neutrality. The 12th falls on the 96th anniversary of Lenin’s call to deploy Russian communists to start civil wars around the world. [In a “workers of the world unite “for corporate interests, Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos has mobilized big tech corporate support from Mozilla, Reddit, Kickstarter, Etsy and Vimeo to fill the streets with   allies from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Greenpeace.  The Day of Action seeks to upend the May 18 vote by FCC Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O’Reilly, over the opposition by Democrat Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, to overturn the Obama administration’s 2015 adoption of “Net Neutrality. ” The Democrats’ regulatory regime gave the U. S. government the effective right to take control of the Internet, create new taxation authority, and regulate the “fairness” of political thought under rules that once applied to the old ATT telephone monopoly. Under federal administrative law, the   FCC rule change allows a   initial public comment until July 17, and then another 30 days for replies to those comments by Aug. 16. Advocates of Net Neutrality called it a democratizing principle. But opponents complained that under Net Neutrality, corporate interests like Amazon, Netflix and Google’s YouTube could make huge profits by clogging cable delivery pipes with enormous amounts of data at no cost. The   publication The Nation classified the February 2015   FCC majority’s passage of “Net Neutrality” as “people power.“ But it appeared to be more about the “corporate power” that funded a record $139. 5 million in lobbying expenses by computer and Internet companies to influence the biggest regulatory expansion in decades. Naming July 12th the “Day of Action” will conjure 96th anniversary of the release of Vladimir Lenin’s Report on the Tactics of the Revolutionary Communist Party. Soviets cadres had believed that once Russian workers overthrew capitalism, it would cause spontaneous uprisings by the workers of the world that would quickly sweep capitalism into the dustbin of history. But after four years and no more worldwide revolutions, Lenin used the July 12, 1921 conclusion of the “Third Congress of The Communist International” publish Tactics to encourage Russian communists to export “civil war” and “openly revolutionary uprisings. ” July 12, 1948 was also the day President Truman used the Democratic Party Platform to expand Marshall Plan to fight communism: “Ours is the party under which were conceived the instruments for resisting Communist aggression and for rebuilding the economic strength of the democratic countries of Europe and Asia  —   the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. ”   protests against Trump administration policies have been led by Antifa (antifascist) groups who wear black clothing and   as well as scarves, sunglasses, ski masks and motorcycle helmets. Antifa forces shut down Berkeley in April and May by using fists,   pepper spray and heavy bike locks to prevent presentations by conservative speakers. The Urban Dictionary describes Antifa as: “  champagne    white boys who don’t like nationalists or fascists. They consider themselves to be rebelling against the establishment, whilst upholding all of its   correct views. ” By uniting corporate and social justice forces for a July 12 “Day of Action,” just days before the end of the FCC comment period to oppose dumping Net Neutrality, Silicon Valley could fill the streets of America’s biggest cities with large and potentially violent protests.",0
4429,"Asian-American Fighters Return to Ancestral Homelands, and Find Fans Waiting - The New York Times","SINGAPORE  —   Brandon Vera was recently pinned in a corner by an excited mob at a shopping mall in the Philippines, and briefly thought that he might have to fight his way out. But instead of brandishing weapons, the crowd was armed with pens and cellphones, hoping to get autographs and selfies with Vera, one of Asia’s most popular mixed martial arts fighters. The incident is a common occurrence for Asian celebrities as varied as athletes and actors and Korean boy bands, but Vera’s presence at the center of a fan frenzy made it different: he is an American, a former college wrestler from Norfolk, Va. who moved to his ancestral homeland three months ago, ahead of the first defense of his mixed martial arts heavyweight title, which he won in December in the Philippines. “It’s been overwhelming, wondering why I get so much attention,” Vera, 38, who fights for ONE Championship, Asia’s largest mixed martial arts promoter, said at a recent M. M. A. function in Singapore. “And most of the time I’m thinking, Whoa, whoa  —   what’s going on here? Honestly, that is the question that goes through my head every day. ” While mixed martial arts is one of the   sports in the world, and most of the top M. M. A. fighters in Asia were born on the continent, an increasing number  —   including two current   champions  —   have returned to their ancestral homelands to compete, some with great success and huge fan bases. “I see that their success is that they are very humble and accessible to fans,” said Matt Eaton, editor of The Fight Nation, a leading online M. M. A. news site based in Hong Kong. He said that many young fans “can go out and meet a Brandon Vera, so they don’t feel disconnected from the athletes like they are with other international sports. ” Eaton added: “And they are embracing their heritage, which a lot of people feel is very genuine. People feel they can connect to them. ” Among those projected for international fame are Vera and Angela Lee, the reigning Asian female M. M. A. fighter of the year. Lee, a    atomweight fighter (105 pounds or less) who grew up in Hawaii, was crowned the ONE Championship’s first female titlist in May. Unlike Vera, a heavyweight who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Vin Diesel, Lee has lightning speed that she uses to tackle opponents before forcing them to submit with her wrestling and jujitsu skills. Five of her six professional wins with One Championship have come by submission. But with her new belt and a series of magazine covers, her profile has risen so quickly, she said, that she cannot make it home from training on Singapore’s commuter trains without being surrounded by   admirers. For now, this is her home. Although she comes from a multiethnic family, Lee enters the cage for her fights draped in a Singaporean flag. “I, myself, am a   American, raised in Hawaii, but of Korean and   ethnicity,” Lee said. “How can you wrap your head around that? “So who do you really represent? I’m equally proud to represent everywhere  —   all my ethnicities, all my nationalities, because it makes me who I am. I’m not just one thing. You can’t just live with me as Singaporean, as Canadian, as American. I’m everything together. ” So is Aung La N Sang, a Burmese middleweight contender who, along with his mother and two siblings, was granted political asylum in the United States after he moved there in 2003 to attend Andrews University in Michigan. Aung graduated with an agricultural degree in 2007 and worked as a migratory beekeeper while keeping up his training. Eventually he turned professional, and he became an American citizen last December. Aung does most of his training in Baltimore, but on Oct. 7 he will fight for the second time in Yangon, Myanmar. He said he hoped to earn a title shot next year. Still, he is taking his sudden celebrity  —   he says he has trouble using restaurant bathrooms without people approaching him for selfies  —   with a grain of salt. “The way society is set up there, they don’t promote sports as much,” Aung said. “Parents in Myanmar don’t really tell you to be a football player they tell you to be a lawyer, doctor or businessman. So it’s hard to develop sports stars, in that sense, and all the industries promote singers, models, actresses  —   those people are always on the front of the magazine covers. They look up to them, not athletes. ” Yet that may only add to the appeal of foreign fighters. Since many Asian M. M. A. fighters, in particular those from developing countries, are still developing the skills to compete for major international titles, promoters have found that fans in the Philippines, Singapore, Myanmar and elsewhere are eager to support   fighters who have embraced their heritage. “Because there is a lack of homegrown stars,” said Marcus Laur, the founder of the sports marketing company Total Sports Asia, “these foreign imports grab that vacant space and the fans jump on it. ”",0
4430,Complete Text of President Donald Trump’s Inaugural Address,"The following is the complete video and text of President Donald J. Trump’s inaugural address delivered on January 20, 2017.[ Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you. We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another  —   but we are transferring power from Washington, D. C. and giving it back to you, the American People. For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished  —   but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered  —   but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes  —   starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities   factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation  —   and their pain is our pain.  Their dreams are our dreams and their success will be our success.  We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military, We’ve defended other nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own, And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it’s going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs.  Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body  —   and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.  We will bring back our wealth.  And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work  —   rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world  —   but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones  —   and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity. ” We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear  —   we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action  —   constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Proud Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America.",0
4431,"Obama Visits Midway, Highlighting Monument and Commitment to Environment - The New York Times","MIDWAY ATOLL  —   President Obama, taking his campaign to confront climate change to a pristine spit of land in the remote Pacific Ocean, said on Thursday that it was critical to examine the effects of the planet’s warming on the seas and to protect wild areas from degradation caused by human activity. “Part of what we’ve been trying to do is provide some visual aid to understanding what’s happening” with climate change, Mr. Obama said in a brief interview here, looking out over lush vegetation and a lagoon so iridescent it turned the clouds above an otherworldly shade of green. That means “being able to highlight the incredible beauty of a place like this, but also recognizing that if oceans continue to get warmer, that a lot of the marine species here could be affected, and ultimately that’s going to have an impact on human populations,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama traveled to Midway, part of the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, to recognize his expansion last week of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the world’s largest protected area and home to more than 7, 000 species of wildlife, some of them endangered and others found nowhere else. The area has millions of tropical sea birds, including rare albatrosses, and it teems with sea life such as endangered whales, sharks and dolphins, as well as   black coral, considered the   marine species. “For us to be able to protect and preserve this national monument, to extend it, and, most importantly, to interact with native Hawaiians and other stakeholders so that the way we protect and manage this facility is consistent with ancient traditions and the best science available, this is going to be a precious resource for generations to come,” Mr. Obama told reporters after touring the 2.   atoll in a golf cart motorcade and receiving a briefing from the Fish and Wildlife Service officials who manage it. Under a blazing hot sun, white terns cruised overhead and dotted the trees, their fuzzy chicks cooling themselves in puddles by the side of the rough path Mr. Obama passed over as he took in the lush landscape. “Spectacular,” the president said as he stood at Turtle Beach, as four endangered green sea turtles rested on white sand nearby, with nothing but cyan waters stretching behind him. “I can’t wait to get in,” added Mr. Obama, who snorkeled off the coast later in the day. The expansion of the marine reserve and Mr. Obama’s trip to the island, named for its location about halfway between Asia and North America, were part of an effort by the president to showcase his commitment to combating climate change and protecting lands and waters that can serve as refuges as the planet increasingly experiences the effects of global warming. After Midway, the president was scheduled to fly to China to discuss climate change. Mr. Obama, nearing the end of his eight years in office, is reaching for lasting symbols of his achievements and seeking opportunities to check items off his   list while he still has the trappings and travel perquisites of the presidency. He is also looking toward life after the presidency, when he said he might have an easier time fostering consensus on the need to confront climate change and mobilizing the public around a bipartisan approach. “My hope is maybe as   I can have a little more influence on some of my Republican friends, who I think, up until now, have been resistant to the science,” Mr. Obama said in the interview. “This is something that all of us are going to have to tackle, and maybe I get a little more of a hearing if I’m not occupying a political office. ” Mr. Obama announced last week that he was vastly expanding the Papahanaumokuakea monument, created by President George W. Bush a decade ago, bringing its size to more than 580, 000 square miles  —   three and a half times the size of California  —   from a little less than 140, 000 square miles. Scientists and environmental groups have cheered the action. But commercial fishing interests have expressed strong opposition, arguing that Mr. Obama has harmed their industry by prohibiting   fishing in vast waters. “We do not believe the expansion is based on the best available scientific information,” Kitty Simonds, executive director of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council, said in a statement. “It serves a political legacy rather than any conservation benefits. ” Mr. Obama was concerned on Thursday with both. Midway and the surrounding islands and waters are regarded as a climate refuge, a place whose natural characteristics make it more resilient to climate change. “The president has made a very bold statement that the world needs to take more tangible, bold actions to make sure that we’re protecting our ecosystems from climate change,” said Matt Rand, director of the Ocean Legacy Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts. In visiting the island, Mr. Rand added, Mr. Obama was getting “a view into what our oceans and our planet looked like 100 years ago, really before we had significant human degradation in the ecosystem,” when bird life and top predatory fish were abundant and coral was healthy. Mr. Obama is not the first American president to visit the remote island. Richard M. Nixon stopped there in June 1969, at the height of bird breeding season, for five hours of meetings with President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam, during which the two agreed on plans for the United States to begin withdrawing troops. Mr. Obama visited during a season when most of Midway’s birds have finished breeding and flown out to sea, leaving some of the island’s most fervent protectors feeling that the president was missing out. “Come back” in June 2017, Teya M. Penniman implored Mr. Obama in a message posted on the website of Friends of Midway Atoll. “Even though you won’t be the current president, it will still give you a much better understanding of what you’ve just done,” Ms. Penniman wrote. “The birds, fish, corals, seals, algae, turtles, dolphins and whales thank you. ”",0

4433,Federal Agents Will Be Watching You Vote on Election Day,"Federal Agents Will Be Watching You Vote on Election Day November 07, 2016 Federal Agents Will Be Watching You Vote on Election Day 
Personnel from the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division will be deployed to polling sites in 28 states to monitor Tuesday's election, five more than it monitored in the 2012 election, the department said on Monday. Most of those states will receive Justice Department staff who have no statutory authority to access polling sites as a result of a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act, curtailing the department's ability to deploy election observers with unfettered access to the polls. More than 500 Justice Department personnel will be deployed on Tuesday, compared to more than 780 personnel the department dispatched during the 2012 general election. A JusticeDepartment spokesman declined to say how many of Tuesday's personnel will be full-access observers. Tuesday's hotly contested election, including the presidential race pitting Republican Donald Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton, will be the first in decades in which the JusticeDepartment can only send full-access observers to states where a federal court ruling has authorized it. 
On the campaign trail, Trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities. Numerous studies have found that U.S. voter fraud is exceedingly rare. 
""As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially, with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides,"" said Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a statement. 
Courts have granted the Justice Department permission to deploy full-access observers in five states: Alaska, California, Louisiana, New York, and Alabama. But the court order for Alabama only pertains to municipal elections and it is not on the list of states where the JusticeDepartment is deploying poll watchers this year.

The Justice Department staff who are deployed to the other 24 states on Tuesday will be election ""monitors"", who must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations. 
“In most cases, voters on the ground will see very little practical difference between monitors and observers,"" said Vanita Gupta, the head of the department's civil rights division, in a statement.

4437,Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin to Separate After His Latest Sexting Scandal - The New York Times,"It was supposed to be a quiet,   weekend on the exclusive shores of the Hamptons. But on Sunday, Huma Abedin, the closest aide to Hillary Clinton, received devastating news. After accompanying Mrs. Clinton to   Ms. Abedin learned from her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, that The New York Post was about to report that he had again exchanged lewd messages with a woman on social media: the sort of behavior that destroyed his congressional career and 2013 mayoral campaign. Only this time, the online indiscretions included an image of Mr. Weiner’s crotch as he lay next to the couple’s    son. Now, Mr. Weiner’s tawdry activities may have claimed his marriage  —   Ms. Abedin told him that she wanted to separate  —   and have cast another shadow on the adviser and confidante who has been by Mrs. Clinton’s side for the past two decades. Ms. Abedin was already a major figure this summer in controversies over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information as secretary of state and over ties between the Clinton family foundation and Mrs. Clinton’s State Department. Mr. Weiner’s extramarital behavior also threatens to remind voters about the troubles in the Clintons’ own marriage over the decades, including Mrs. Clinton’s   decision to remain with   Bill Clinton after revelations of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Abedin’s choice to separate from her husband evokes the debates that erupted over Mrs. Clinton’s handling of the Lewinsky affair, a scandal her campaign wants left in the past. Clinton advisers expressed only sympathy for Ms. Abedin on Monday and said they were confident Mr. Weiner’s actions would not hurt Mrs. Clinton, who learned about them from Ms. Abedin and offered support. But Mr. Weiner’s behavior quickly became fodder for Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton’s Republican opponent in the presidential race. “Huma is making a very wise decision,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him. ” He then went further, claiming that the marriage’s breakdown was a matter of national security. Mrs. Clinton received her first intelligence briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee on Saturday at the F. B. I. field office in White Plains. No aides accompanied her to the briefing, according to a campaign official. “I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,” Mr. Trump said, using language that echoed criticism of Mrs. Clinton this summer by the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey Jr. “Who knows what he learned and who he told? It’s just another example of Hillary Clinton’s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this. ” A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks. The spotlight on Ms. Abedin and her proximity to Mrs. Clinton has been an increasing distraction for the campaign. Several of Ms. Abedin’s emails on Mrs. Clinton’s private server have drawn scrutiny amid accusations that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access to the State Department. And political opponents, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have questioned Ms. Abedin’s arrangement to earn income privately while she worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. In addition to being on Mrs. Clinton’s personal payroll, Ms. Abedin received money from the Clinton Foundation and Teneo, a consulting firm founded in part by Douglas J. Band, previously a senior aide to Mr. Clinton. Ms. Abedin, 40, has been at Mrs. Clinton’s side since she was an intern to the first lady in the 1990s. Now vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, Ms. Abedin, often described as a surrogate daughter, occupies an almost singular role as a trusted, and visible, confidante to Mrs. Clinton. Their lives took similar tracks, as both women, citing their religious beliefs, seemed determined to remain married despite their husbands’ sexual proclivities. Mrs. Clinton strongly supported Ms. Abedin when Mr. Weiner’s sexually charged text messages came to light in 2011, a year into their marriage, and again in 2013, when Mr. Weiner was running for mayor of New York. Friends of Mrs. Clinton said that she had spoken to Ms. Abedin at length about the marriage and that she supported Ms. Abedin’s decision to remain with Mr. Weiner and work on their relationship. The couple’s marital problems have been a subject of years of tabloid mockery and humiliation since Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 amid revelations that he had sent sexual images of himself to women on social media. His 2013 campaign for mayor was damaged, too, when Mr. Weiner admitted that he had continued flirting with women online. By Monday morning, when the Post cover showing Mr. Weiner and his son, Jordan, hit newsstands, Mr. Weiner had left the Hamptons for New York City aware that Ms. Abedin planned to announce their separation, said two people close to the couple who discussed private conversations on the condition of anonymity. “After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,” Ms. Abedin said in a statement. “Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy. ” In the latest issue of Vogue, Ms. Abedin portrayed Mr. Weiner as a devoted father and their marriage as a true partnership. “Many working moms feel this way  —   there is a lot of guilt,” she said. “I don’t think I could do it if I didn’t have the full support system I have, if Anthony wasn’t willing to be, essentially, a   dad. ” But the two people close to the couple said Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner had been growing apart for some time, with Ms. Abedin often on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weiner at home with Jordan. They said the Post article had not caused a sudden and unexpected rupture to a happy marriage, but rather was the final catalyst for Ms. Abedin to move for a separation. Campaign officials had braced for new revelations about Mr. Weiner after The Post reported this month that a Republican had baited Mr. Weiner into a flirtatious online chat. Asked by The New York Times this month whether he was still engaging in the behavior that had foiled his political career, Mr. Weiner said, “I’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that. ” Mrs. Clinton had hoped to ride out the final week of August with limited distractions as she seeks to maintain her solid lead in national polls. On Monday, she attended three   in the Hamptons, without Ms. Abedin, and spoke briefly on a conference call with policy experts and medical providers to unveil her proposals on mental health. “We’ve got to make clear mental health is not a personal failing,” Mrs. Clinton said. Aides said that Ms. Abedin’s marriage was a private matter and that her decision to announce the separation meant the frenetic news cycle would soon move on. “The best way to get rid of a problem is to get rid of a problem,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. “The end of that marriage publicly announced makes it impossible for Anthony Weiner to have anything to do with the campaign. ” But unlike many political aides, Ms. Abedin has become a public figure in her own right, posing for Vogue, snapping selfies with voters on the rope line at Mrs. Clinton’s campaign events and hosting her own   on her boss’s behalf. Hours after Ms. Abedin released her statement, Showtime blasted out a news release announcing the October television debut of “Weiner,” an unfettered documentary about the implosion of Mr. Weiner’s mayoral campaign and the couple’s interactions after his second scandal. In the messages reported by The Post, Mr. Weiner exchanged photos with a woman. She appeared in various bikinis, and Mr. Weiner was   showing off his stomach or his groin  —   and they talked about sex. In one message, Mr. Weiner abruptly changed the discussion from massage parlors and reportedly wrote, “Someone just climbed into my bed. ” “Really?” the woman replied. His response, in a screen shot dated July 31, 2015, showed a child curled up next to Mr. Weiner, who was wearing only white briefs.",0
4438,Steve Harvey to Work With Trump Administration On Inner Cities,"Actor, comedian, and Family Feud host Steve Harvey met with   Donald Trump on Friday at Trump Tower in Manhattan. [“I stepped from behind my microphone and I came and talked to the guy who is going to be the 45th president,” Harvey told reporters about his meeting with Trump, whom he said he found “both congenial and sincere. ”  ”I stepped from behind my microphone and I came and talked to the guy who is going to be the 45th president,” Steve Harvey said pic. twitter.   —   CBS News (@CBSNews) January 13, 2017,  Harvey said he plans to partner with Trump’s Department of Housing and Urban Development nominee Dr. Ben Carson on restoring America’s inner cities. “Trump wants to help with the situations in the inner cities so he immediately got Dr. Ben Carson on the phone to put us together to begin dialog in looking at programs and housing to help our inner cities and he’s very open to my mentoring efforts across the country,” Harvey said. “I walked away feeling like I had just talked with a man who genuinely wants to make a difference in this area,” he added. “I feel that something really great could come out of this  …     I would sit with him anytime. ” My meeting with @realDonaldTrump   …     pic. twitter.   —   Steve Harvey (@IAmSteveHarvey) January 13, 2017,  Harvey, who endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, came under fire after it was discovered that his staff provided prepared questions to Clinton’s campaign before a February interview on his radio show. “Another one they want to start with as a target is Detroit,” Harvey told reporters. “Ben Carson expressed that because quite naturally he is from Detroit. I want to do something with all of the major inner cities to see if we can bring about some change and help some of these young people out. And so that’s why I’m here, and it was a successful meeting. And he seemed really sincere. ” “It’s an honor to be invited to talk, and I think that’s the only way that we’re going to unify our country,” Harvey said. “We’ve got to talk. ”",0
4439,SoftBank President Nikesh Arora Plans to Step Down - The New York Times,"TOKYO  —   A former Google executive and Silicon Valley star was on course to be the next chief executive of SoftBank of Japan, one of the world’s most prominent technology conglomerates. Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank’s global ambitions. When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google’s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent. Mr. Arora was vaunted for his   prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son’s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise. The honeymoon did not last. Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank’s overseas deals. Investments in   like DramaFever and Housing. com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered. And the carefully orchestrated succession plan  —   or what appeared to be  —   has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon. Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to “work on a few more crazy ideas” at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer. “This will require me to be C. E. O. for at least another five to 10 years  —   this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,” Mr. Son said. Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. “Masa and I are still in love with each other,” he posted on Twitter. “I will support everyone I invested in, and they know that. ” Mr. Arora’s legacy  —   good or bad  —   will ultimately be determined by his investment record. SoftBank’s strategy is centered on acquiring other companies, from established businesses to tiny  . Shortly before Mr. Arora arrived, SoftBank bought Sprint for $21. 6 billion, a major expansion of Mr. Son’s empire overseas. The Japanese conglomerate also made a fortune when its early investment in the Chinese   company Alibaba slowly swelled to billions of dollars in value. After joining SoftBank, Mr. Arora was put in charge of picking takeover targets around the world. His mandate was to diversify a company that, despite the Sprint acquisition and others, still makes about 70 percent of its operating profits in its home market. It owns a major mobile phone network and a controlling interest in Yahoo Japan, among other domestic assets. Mr. Arora struck more than a dozen deals, placing bets on technology, telecommunications and media companies in India, Indonesia and Singapore, among other countries. SoftBank paid $1 billion for a stake in the Korean   company Coupang. It plowed $250 million into   the giant American media and sports agency. India has been a particular focus, and Mr. Arora led investments into businesses like Snapdeal and OYO Rooms, which aspire to be its Amazon and Airbnb. Recently, SoftBank has been selling assets and raising cash, a pattern that has been a prelude to big, strategic deals. On Tuesday it sealed an agreement to sell its majority stake in Supercell, the developer of “Clash of Clans” and other mobile games, to China’s Tencent Holdings for about $8. 6 billion. It also recently sold about $10 billion of shares in Alibaba. Expectations for Mr. Arora had been high. Besides his Google pedigree, he had been unusually well paid. In his first six months at SoftBank, Mr. Arora earned 16. 6 billion yen, or $159 million at current exchange rates, including a signing bonus, according to company disclosures. That made him one of the best compensated executives in the world during that period, and one of the highest paid executives in Japan, a country known for relatively low pay at the upper echelon. He earned about 8 billion yen last year. Mr. Arora made a huge personal financial commitment to SoftBank in 2015, buying 60 billion yen of the company’s shares. But some of his bets haven’t panned out. DramaFever, a Korean video site, shed traffic months after SoftBank invested in the business, prompting the Japanese company to find buyers for some of its stake. This year, SoftBank has defended Mr. Arora against criticism from a group of mostly anonymous international shareholders, who laid out their case against Mr. Arora in a letter to the company’s board in April. They said a number of   he backed have fizzled. They also questioned his decision to remain an adviser to an American investment firm, Silver Lake, that could potentially compete with SoftBank for deals. “Mr. Arora’s investment strategy as the C. E. O. of SIMI appears to be nothing more than throwing a dart at a dart board,” a lawyer representing the investors wrote in the letter, referring to SoftBank’s internet and media operations as SIMI. “How many more millions of dollars of shareholder value must be wasted before the board realizes something must be done?” A representative for Silver Lake declined to comment. Advisers like Mr. Arora generally receive limited insight into the private equity firm’s deliberations and spend only a few hours a month with Silver Lake. SoftBank said on Monday that an internal panel set up to investigate the investors’ claims had found no evidence of conflict of interest or other misconduct. Still, the episode may have shaken Mr. Son’s trust in Mr. Arora, soured Mr. Arora on SoftBank, or both. “Clean chit from board after through review. Time for me to move on,” Mr. Arora said in another tweet on Tuesday. And it was always an open question whether Mr. Son would readily give up control. Mr. Arora was one of only a small number of   to have attained a top management position at a major Japanese company. He faced fewer bureaucratic and cultural obstacles than most, in part because SoftBank’s power structure is simple. SoftBanks starts and ends with Mr. Son, who founded the company in the 1980s and runs it with unquestioned authority. “I feel my work is not done,” Mr. Son said in a statement on Tuesday.",0
4440,End of Biden Vice Presidency Dims Eight-Year Spotlight on Delaware - The New York Times,"GREENVILLE, Del.  —   The state beverage of Delaware is milk, and as Angelina Squillace was stocking it in a grocery store here, she paused, in response to a question, to think about what else defined this state. “It’s like, tax free,” said Ms. Squillace, 17, referring to her home state’s zero percent sales tax, “and it’s Joe Biden. That’s really what it is. ” The handover of presidential power in Washington, 110 miles away, has brought joy to many in the country and thoroughly unsettled others. But here in Delaware, it foretold an especially bittersweet adjustment. The end of the vice presidency of Joseph R. Biden Jr. has dimmed an   spotlight on a state that, even its own residents admit, can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. “There’s this big joke, people say, ‘ ? ’” Karen Friday, 48, a   mother in Hockessin, Del. said as she waited recently at the Wilmington train station  —   which is named after Mr. Biden  —   for a friend to disembark. “He’s contributed so much to letting people know who we are. ” “I think,” said Bob Jones, 72, a shoe shiner at the station, “he’s the   person we ever had. ” Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. (and he speaks of it often) but he moved to Delaware as a young teenager and has considered it home, more or less, since. Over some 36 years of commuting from here to his job in the United States Senate, and after eight years as the No. 2 man in the Obama administration, Mr. Biden has kept his indelible link, forged by family and framed by tragedy, to the nation’s   state. He owns a home here in Greenville, close to Wilmington, and is expected to keep spending weekends here even though he also plans to have a house in Washington. For decades, he has been Delaware’s biggest cheerleader, and the state has loved him right back. “One of the historians who specialized in Delaware history pointed out that he probably ranks in Delaware history at the same level as the Delaware leader during the Revolution who rode to Philadelphia to sign the Declaration of Independence,” said Joseph Pika, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Delaware, referring to Caesar Rodney, who was a lawyer, a member of the Continental Congress and the president (governor in modern political view) of Delaware during most of the Revolutionary War. “There are people who if he put his foot in his mouth would say, ‘Oh that’s typical of Biden,’” Mr. Pika said. “That’s about the harshest criticism you would hear. ” The University of Delaware is Mr. Biden’s alma mater and he is planning some kind of partnership as he   civilian life, although the details are still hazy. “This is a time we could make history,” said Dennis Assanis, the president of the university. “He’s one of our most prominent alumni. ” Mr. Biden, who is 74, is also planning to have a center at the University of Pennsylvania, and to work on a cancer initiative. Mr. Biden had been a lawyer and a councilor for New Castle County  —   one of Delaware’s three  —   when he won his upstart bid for Senate in 1972, at the age of 29. His first wife and their daughter were killed in a car crash that injured his two sons. Mr. Biden took his oath of office at the bedsides of his sons and decided to come home every night, binding the state to his grieving family. “Everyone could relate to the tragedy that he experienced,” Mr. Pika said. He became a ubiquitous presence on the Amtrak train, commuting between Washington and Wilmington as he climbed the ranks in the Senate, and mounted his own failed bids for the presidency before he became the vice president in 2009 as Barack Obama’s running mate. “We’re not a big state that’s produced a lot of presidents or vice presidents  —   or any presidents or vice presidents,” said Mike Castle, the former Republican governor and congressman for Delaware who described himself as a friend of Mr. Biden’s, “and all of a sudden, one of our residents is plucked out to be the vice president of the United States. ” “It’s a real honor for us,” Mr. Castle added. Mr. Biden’s family remained closely linked to the state. His second wife, Jill, was a longtime community college teacher here (she now teaches in Virginia) and their daughter, Ashley, now runs a nonprofit organization in the state. But no one was more prominent than his son, Beau Biden, who became the state’s attorney general and was widely expected to become the state’s governor, before he died of a brain tumor in 2015. “Joe Biden stood for eight hours one day as mourners visited to give their condolences,” Mr. Pika said. “It was felt by the entire state. ” Other American statesmen have, of course, become closely associated with their home states. Everyone knows Abraham Lincoln is from Illinois, that the Bushes call Texas home, and that Ronald Reagan lived in California. But this is a state with a population the size of a large city, and one that so many Americans have simply driven through without stopping. So Mr. Biden, who knows everyone and always came back, looms large. “We really haven’t had national figures,” said Bill Gee, a commercial and real estate lawyer who sometimes sees Mr. Biden at the Wilmington Country Club, and had voted for him for Senate despite being a Republican. “It was kind of nice for little Delaware. ” Mr. Gee, like others here, pointed out that Delaware “punches above its weight,” like with the tax laws that have drawn scores of businesses to incorporate here. It is close to Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia. And there are nice beaches. “If you said name something in Delaware, a lot of people would know DuPont,” Mr. Gee said, referring to the chemical company. “After that, hm, people know that we’re one of the large   states. ” While the state’s corporate clout is significant, it has, like much of the rest of country, shed manufacturing jobs, and even DuPont has had layoffs in recent years. Mr. Biden has “outlasted the DuPont reputation,” said Nancy Karibjanian, a former reporter who has covered Mr. Biden, and the director of the University of Delaware’s Center for Political Communication. “The sales tax is nice, but I think Joe Biden is in a category of his own. ” It helps that, in a state so small, it is easy to get to know the power players  —   and just about everyone else, too. Indeed, nearly every single person approached at random by a reporter on a recent day at Wilmington’s train station claimed to have personally met the man. “The very first year he ran for Senate, he was out campaigning in a strip shopping center, all by himself,” Margo Johnson, a retiree, recalled. “He just chatted it up with my mother. She just thought he was wonderful. ” Tyrone Young, 63, a denture maker, said he had waited in line for an hour and a half to pay his respects to the Biden family after Beau died. “That’s honor, dignity, respect,” Mr. Young said, adding that the Bidens “showed you the same thing. ” Mr. Biden speaks often of his love for the state. When he arrived at the train station here on Friday, after President Trump’s inauguration, he made a characteristic Joycean reference: “When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart. ” He sounded a similar note eight years ago, during a speech days before he and Mr. Obama were inaugurated. “Delaware,” Mr. Biden said, “I’d not be taking this journey were it not for you. ”",0
4441,Comment on Trump’s election will be the biggest F-you in history by Dr. Eowyn,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 10 Comments 
If we go by most of the MSM/corporate polls, Hillary Clinton will win on November 8. 
But there are dissenting voices. Among them is Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , who’s still predicting a 98% chance of not just a Trump win, but a landslide. Interestingly, the dissenters also include a flaming leftist — docu-maker Michael Moore. 
Moore is loathsome, but I don’t think anyone has captured or articulated the reasons why so many Americans resonate to Trump’s anti-globalism as well as Moore. 
Below is an excerpt from a recent speech Moore delivered, followed by my transcription: 
“I know a lot of people in Michigan that are planning to vote for Trump…. They don’t necessarily like him that much and they don’t necessarily agree with him. They’re not racists and rednecks certainly; they’re actually pretty decent people. And so I wanted to, after talking to a number of them, I wanted to write this. 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said, ‘If you close these factories you’re planning to do in Detroit and build them in Mexico, [when I’m President] I’m going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody’s gonna buy them.’ 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician, Republican or Democrat, had ever said anything like that to these executives, and it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, the Brexit states. You live here in Ohio, you know what I’m talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he’s saying the things to people who are hurting. That’s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff — what used to be part of what was called the middle class — loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they’ve been waiting for, the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th, Election Day, although they lost their jobs, although they’ve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce, and now the wife and kids are gone, the car’s been repo’ed, they haven’t had a real vacation in years, they’re stuck with the shitty Obamacare plan when you can’t even get a fucking [inaudible]. They’ve essentially lost everything they had, except one thing. The one thing that doesn’t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution — the right to vote. 
They might be penniless, they might be homeless, they might be fucked over and fucked up. It doesn’t matter because it’s equalized on that day. A millionaire has the same number of votes as the person without a job — one. And there’s more of the former middle class than there are in the millionaire class. 
So on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever or felt pen or touchscreen and put a big fucking X in the box by the name of the man who is threatening to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
They see that the elites who ruined their lives hate Trump. Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The media hates Trump, after they loved him and created him and now hate him. Thank you, media. 
The enemy of my enemy is who I’m voting for on November 8. Yes, on November 8, you, Joe Blow, Steve Blow, Bob Blow, Billy Blow, Billy Bob Blow — all the Blows get to blow up the whole goddamn system because it’s your right. Trump’s election is going to be the biggest fuck-you ever recorded in human history, and it will feel good.” 
Perversely, after articulately so beautifully the profound alienation of so many Americans and why Trump speaks for them, Michael Moore then proceeded to make a whole-hog defense and endorsement of Hillary Clinton. 
Here’s a screenshot from a video showing “Jabba the Hut” Michael Moore making the speech you heard and read above. 
What if Trump loses? 
Below are excerpts from a powerful essay, “ The Elite ‘Have No Idea’— Society is Near the Breaking Point ,” written by a guy who calls himself Chindit13 for ZeroHedge : 
“What I find most surprising today is that the insiders and the elite have no idea what is percolating just beneath the surface . Okay, maybe their arrogance actually produces its own fog, so it should not come as a surprise that they are blinded. They do not look at the calendar, which, if one really looks, says ‘1788’ on it. Something is close. Very close. Society is near the breaking point. 
My own experience is that Hillary’s so-called Deplorables are actually the most reserved, most polite, and most honest demographic in the country . They are more informed, more self-reliant, and among other things, better armed. Regarding their arms, they are incredibly responsible, and not the source of the violence for which the implement, and not the person, is too often blamed. The Deplorables have the longest fuse. It is, however, a fuse. […] 
The Deplorables, however, are not possessed of infinite patience. Like a capacitor, there is a charge building, and at some point it will be released into the circuitry of society. 
The media and other insiders believe themselves to be immune. That thought no doubt results from being immersed inside a cocoon where dissonant voices are not allowed. When the levee breaks, or the capacitor releases its charge, they are going to be gob smacked. 
Precious few of them are anywhere near as immune as they believe themselves to be. Additionally, what they might think, or hope, is their support, their security, their safe space, doesn’t really exist. 
Most of society’s guardians, whether they are law enforcement or military, are card-carrying members of the Deplorables. 
France was similarly constructed in the late 1780s. The elite were isolated only in thought, not in reality. Their protection was of a Potemkin Village nature: not actually there, but merely a facade that gave them false comfort. 
They paid dearly for their arrogance and ignorance. 
History may not repeat, but it does rhyme. The calendar really does seem to say 1788, so 1789—and 1792–are not as far off as some would like to believe. 
This is not a call to arms, but it is a call to reality. Ignore it at your own peril. 
Some may see these words as a threat. They are not. They are, however, a warning, and a warning from someone who is a student of history. 
Every society eventually reaches a breaking point. Ours is nearly there. Some of those who might feel threatened, the so-called elite and insiders, think that they can buy protection as easily as they can buy a Gulfstream. How naïve! Who are the private security contractors? Who are the various SOGs? Like law enforcement and the rest of the military, they are the Deplorables. The Deplorables will take your money, but you will not take their lives. Better said, they won’t give up their lives for you or your family. The security you believe you have purchased is an illusion. Make that delusion. Best to get that out front here and now. 
Some might think this is all Trump’s fault. Again, that shows a degree of ignorance and naïveté which characterizes the elite. Trump is a symptom, not a cause. He might even be a salve, as the changes he could bring might defuse some of the current anger. 
On the other hand, Hillary is a lit match in a room of dynamite. She, like many of the self-important, thinks her very existence is a favor to the rest of us. She epitomizes the absolute worst of what America has become. Above the law, wealthy not through accomplishment, but through influence peddling only, and a bull in a china shop in terms of her effect on both the country and the world—and I apologize to bulls for that analogy. The world is more unstable because of her. 
America is less safe because of her. Russia and the US—the two largest nuclear powers—are more at odds because of her. With her in power, we will reach the breaking point at home and internationally, perhaps leading to ‘accidental’ nuclear war, as the heightened rhetoric impacts clear thinking. Society is more stratified because of her. Race relations have deteriorated because of her (and Obama). 
There are few current ills in society and in geopolitics that cannot be laid at her feet, at least to some extent. The Great Deceiver to many, who exhibits an astonishing aversion to truth telling, is enough to make even an agnostic wonder if the anti-Christ hasn’t finally arrived for its three and a half years of rule. 
A recently hacked email of John Podesta finds him saying ‘she (Hillary) has begun to hate everyday Americans’. No doubt the same feelings were voiced by [Romania dictator] Nicolas Ceaucescu. It turned out the feeling was mutual. […] 
Elect Hillary, and continue with business as usual, and it is likely this warning will become an epitaph for the America we know. Society may collapse regardless, because the rot is already very great, but she will hasten the day of reckoning. […]”

4442,"Milan Fashion Week, Day 2: It Will Be Frenzied - The New York Times","Good morning, Milan. Proceedings kick off early on Thursday, even if you partied until the wee hours with Fergie after her set at Philipp Plein last night (as we did). There are no excuses not to be on time, people. It’s only Day 2, and as we’ve said, fashion month is a marathon, not a sprint. Here’s what’s on today: • At 9:30, after a quick    espresso, the day starts with MaxMara, the   label few others can touch when it comes to the cut of an overcoat. The company has hired the model Gigi Hadid to be the face of its accessories campaigns, and Ms. Hadid will be hosting a cocktail party at the Corso Vittorio Emanuele store tonight. Expect a scrum to get in. • Fendi is likely to put on yet another Karl Lagerfeld exercise in refined grandeur. (Cameos from the Fendirumi, the furry   versions of the label’s   $1, 500 Bag Bugs, are now standard.) The industry is still buzzing about the spectacular Fendi couture show in Rome in July, with a glass catwalk across the Trevi Fountain to celebrate its 90th anniversary. • Once a predictable riot of color and print beloved by the jet set for their summer vacation wardrobes, Pucci is only somewhat less splashy under the direction of Massimo Giorgetti, its young and energetic creative director, now entering his third season. The last show took the label off the beach and into the realm of stretchy daywear inspired by St. Moritz. Who knows what path it may take next. • With twilight (and a Negroni and antipasti beforehand) comes Prada, one of the biggest and most creative names on the Milanese calendar. Its last tour de force collection was a highlight of the season. Commercially, the company has not fared as well it said in April that 2016 would be “a turning point,” after announcing its lowest profits in five years. All eyes will be on Mrs. Prada to see what magic she can produce. Arrive early to take a spin around the art collections at the nearby Fondazione Prada. • Last but not least, Moschino rounds off the first full day. An unapologetic maximalist, the creative director Jeremy Scott makes the hectic rounds between Los Angeles (where he lives) Milan (where he shows his collection for Moschino) and New York (where he shows his namesake collection). Expect a kitschy set, voguing models and a million posts on Instagram: The label’s fans can’t seem to get enough. And in case you missed it: Gucci’s Sequined, Studded, Spangled Saga.

4444,The Sex Scandal That Could Change The Election,"We Are Change 
With only days away from the most followed and extraordinary Presidential election of all time, the debate has devolved into the sexual behaviors surrounding the candidates more than ever.
Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, Hillary’s husband Bill Clinton, the former President of the United States, and now Anthony Weiner has somehow entered the fray. It is quite sad indeed that the media has chosen to run with this angle, and it speaks volumes about the tabloid celebrity obsessed nature of the United States, but if we are going to go there, let’s go there.
First we have Donald Trump, a man who has been married 3 times, has been very open and frankly arrogant about his opinion of women, especially in televised interviews over the last 3 plus decades, and is now being crucified for grabbing the world by the pussy. Seriously? Folks everybody knew what they signed up for when he announced he was running. He ran beauty pageants for Christ’s sake. Has Trump been a misogynist in the past? Absolutely .
The truth is how many men out there can say they haven’t acted in that manner at some point in their lives, let alone yesterday? It’s not something I, or any other man should be proud of, but lets put the shoe on the other foot for a second. If a group of women were having a conversation and the most attractive one of them stated “Sometimes I just walk up to the hottest guy at the bar and grab him by his cock, they let me do it,” would anybody really be outraged? I highly doubt it.
Now let’s take a look at Bill Clinton. Ever since Bill Clinton first ran for President in 1992, his sexual promiscuities and alleged predatory sexual behavior, including rape , have been widely available to the public. I would never defend any type of unwanted sexual advances, but once again we all knew this years ago. Although the mainstream has underplayed this, perhaps the most striking thing they have failed to detail in any depth is his relationship to Jeffrey Epstein.

It was revealed in May that Clinton’s flight logs had him traveling with Epstein at least 26 times during his presidency. Epstein, a billionaire, flew in a private jet dubbed “The Lolita Express” . Those unfamiliar with Epstein should note that he is a convicted pedophile who allegedly ran what many refer as “Sex Slave Island” which trafficked in underage girls for the upper echelon of society in the Virgin Islands. To be fair, there have been allegations of Trump being tied to it as well, but so far there is no hard evidence. Meanwhile, Hillary reportedly went with Bill to the sex island – six times . 

Where is the outrage regarding the sexual abuse of children among global heavyweights including the political elite?
Now this brings us to some of the latest revelations regarding Anthony Weiner who is now somehow involved in the email scandal with his regards to SEXTING A 15 YEAR OLD GIRL ! Huma Abedin happens to be married to Weiner and up until the scandal hitting the news, Hillary’s top aide. Weiner is probably the worst of the worst at being caught in his serial deviant sexual behavior, but those in the know understand this is par for the course.
Little is yet to be reported on what is actually in these emails other than they apparently contained classified information, and the fact is we can’t be expected to know before the election what’s in them…unless of course Wikileaks is planning on one last dump in the next day or so. It is again worth noting of the under-reporting of the pedophilia angle of this story.
So what’s missing here? Um, well, how about Hillary Clinton herself? The mainstream media has NEVER strayed into the possibility Hillary has been unfaithful to Bill, or that their is an open marriage arrangement between the two of them. House of Cards anyone? Those unfamiliar with the show should note that the protagonists of the series, the Underwoods, a political power couple, have an open marriage that also take part in all sorts of sexual decadence , the type only reported upon briefly in the media, if at all.
The truth is that Hillary has been rumored to have a plethora of sexual partners outside of her marriage , both male and female, the latest of which is her aid Huma. However we are not here to speculate in such matters. Instead let’s look at one case in particular. Webb Hubbell.

Those unfamiliar with Hubbell should note that he, Hillary Clinton, and Vince Foster all came up together in the Rose Law Firm during the 70’s. By all accounts they were a tight knit unit that spent countless hours together in their quests for social mobility. Hubbell would become the Mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas in 1979. Bill Clinton, who married Hillary in 1975, would take the Governorship the year prior.

So what evidence is their of an affair between the two? Many believe the existence of Chelsea Clinton, based on looks alone. Chelsea appears to have no physical resemblance whatsoever to Bill, however she looks ASTOUNDINGLY like Hubbell.

The interesting thing is that Hubbell has refused to deny that he is her biological father! When asked by World Net Daily Hubbell responded “No Comment” . Truly bizarre if indeed their is no possibility of such a thing.
In the end why would this matter? It just goes to show you the level of secrets the Clintons have kept for decades upon decades in their continued quest for more and more power. It also gives a very candid portrayal on how the media has handled scandals involving the Clintons over the years. When you go to the voting booth keep that in mind.

4445,Email Case May Complicate Clinton Aides’ Pursuit of Security Clearance - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Questions raised by the F. B. I. about the State Department’s handling of Hillary Clinton’s emails have cast a cloud of doubt over the political futures of a number of her top advisers, including some expected to hold   jobs in her administration if she is elected president. Though Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch formally affirmed on Wednesday that the Justice Department would not seek criminal charges against anyone in the email case, fallout from the matter is sure to affect several dozen State Department advisers who, records show, facilitated Mrs. Clinton’s unorthodox email arrangement or used it to send her classified documents. Among those drawing the most intense scrutiny are Cheryl Mills, Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, onetime aides who could face difficult questions in pursuing security clearances for diplomatic or national security posts because of their involvement with Mrs. Clinton’s emails. The State Department said it would restart an internal review into the handling of Mrs. Clinton’s emails now that Justice’s investigation is formally closed, and that review could threaten the security clearances of several dozen other career officials and political appointees who knew of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server. As for Mrs. Clinton, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday that in light of the F. B. I. ’s findings, intelligence officials should deny her the classified briefings normally given the major nominees. “I’ve never seen anything quite like this,” Bill Savarino, a Washington lawyer specializing in security clearances, said on Wednesday. “You’ve got a situation here where the woman who would be in charge of setting national security policy as president has been deemed by the F. B. I. unsuitable to safeguard and handle classified information. ” In a briefing Tuesday on the F. B. I. ’s findings, the agency’s director, James B. Comey Jr. said that in situations similar to Mrs. Clinton’s, people found to have mishandled classified information “are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. ” He also criticized what he said were inadequate security measures at the State Department in the handling of classified material, a characterization the department has strongly disputed. While Mr. Comey’s criticism of Mrs. Clinton attracted the most attention on Tuesday, his comments included other unnamed colleagues. “Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of the classified information,” Mr. Comey said, “there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. ” Indeed, a review of thousands of pages of emails and depositions that have been made public over the last two months shows that State Department officials ignored numerous red flags about the problems created by Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server, both in the handling of classified information and the preservation of public records. Those few employees who raised questions about the email arrangement were told to keep quiet about it, the State Department inspector general found. Mrs. Clinton herself seemed glib at times about the risks posed by her private email system. In one email exchange in 2011, she was puzzled about how emails from her private account to a State Department employee ended up in the aide’s Gmail account, and jokingly blamed foreign hackers. “Maybe the Chinese hacked it and focused on you!” she wrote. A federal court ordered a number of State Department aides to give lengthy depositions about their knowledge of Mrs. Clinton’s email system as part of a lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group. Her top aides said they gave little thought to the problems that the private server might create. Both Ms. Mills and Ms. Abedin said they now regretted the lack of attention they had given to the system, while other officials said they simply did not remember much about how it was set up and used. In a deposition last week, Patrick F. Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management and operations, said repeatedly that he could not recall details about Mrs. Clinton’s email use, even though he responded to emails from her. Asked if her use of a personal email address raised any questions in his mind, he said that “it did not strike any bells in my mind, no. ” “Why not?” the lawyer for Judicial Watch asked. “Because it did not,” Mr. Kennedy said. The State Department has continued to defend its handling of classified material, and it challenged Mr. Comey’s assertions about a small number of the Clinton emails that were marked as classified. John Kirby, the department’s spokesman, said Wednesday that because of “human error,” one of Mrs. Clinton’s aides at the time, Monica R. Hanley, had mistakenly marked as classified two emails involving routine diplomatic phone calls to foreign leaders. Those appeared to be ones that Mr. Comey singled out as bearing classified markings, in this case designating them as “confidential,” but Mr. Kirby said that information that was initially considered classified was not by the time Mrs. Clinton decided to make the calls. It was not clear if Mr. Comey also referred to other emails with such markings. Sean M. Bigley, a Los Angeles lawyer who specializes in security clearances, said the handling of classified information could be “a major issue” for officials who sent emails that ended up on Mrs. Clinton’s server. He said his firm has routinely defended clients who have lost their security clearances  —   often a requirement for employment  —   because of violations “much less egregious” than what Mr. Comey described. “The folks who were involved with this, even on a peripheral basis, at least are going to be facing administrative action, or should be, based on the historical cases we’ve dealt with,” he said. Mr. Savarino, the Washington lawyer, shared that assessment. He said that if any of Mrs. Clinton’s former aides involved in the email controversy were to approach him for help in seeking a future clearance, “I’d tell them that ‘you’ve got a fight on your hands. ’” Decisions on security clearances rest with the hiring agencies. At the White House, the Executive Office of the President makes these decisions based on background checks conducted or overseen by the F. B. I. sometimes with the help of outside contractors. But even if a clearance is rejected, the president has the power to overturn that decision and order the clearance. The rules for security clearances  —   including challenging decisions to strip them  —   were signed by President Clinton in 1995 in the wake of the Aldrich Ames spy scandal. Mr. Bigley said that contrary to Mr. Comey’s characterization, the State Department practiced strict enforcement on matters that could affect security clearances, which include not only the mishandling of classified information, but also financial problems, exposure to foreign influences, drug and alcohol abuse and other personal misconduct that could expose an official to blackmail by a foreign intelligence agency. He said the threshold for administrative punishment  —   including suspension of a clearance  —   was much lower than for criminal prosecution. Without disclosing specific clients, he cited cases involving government employees penalized for bringing their cellphones into secured areas or making Skype calls from a specially designated room, known as a SCIF: Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. “Ten,   careers we’ve had completely ruined because of mistakes like that,” he said. Cases are routine, but often shrouded in secrecy. Only two agencies  —   the Pentagon and the Department of Energy  —   publish records of decisions. The Pentagon’s, which covers private military contractors, showed that 1, 657 cases were adjudicated in 2015. In a letter in May to the State Department, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, tried to find out whether a number of former Clinton aides, including Ms. Abedin, Mr. Sullivan and Philippe Reines, have kept their security clearances, “in light of the fact that classified information has been discovered” on Mrs. Clinton’s private server. The State Department declined to tell him, saying it would not discuss the status of individuals’ security clearance. Mr. Grassley pushed the issue again Wednesday, asking Mr. Comey in a letter whether the F. B. I. had recommended that Mrs. Clinton or any of her senior aides lose their security clearances. “If not,” the senator asked, “why not?”",0
4446,F.D.A. Warns Whole Foods on Failure to Address Food Safety Problems - The New York Times,"Prepared foods are an increasingly important part of the grocery business, delivering fat margins at a time when sales of traditional packaged foods are lackluster. But the strategy also comes with serious risks. In the clearest example yet, the Food and Drug Administration this month sent a stern warning letter to Whole Foods Market, a longtime champion of fresh and healthy foods, saying that the company had failed to address a long list of food safety issues at its food processing plant outside of Boston. Among the problems cited: condensation dripping from the ceiling near food an   sanitizer used on a work surface near the preparation of a salad and a failure to separate dirty dishes from    . The letter from the F. D. A. is just the latest headache to afflict Whole Foods. Over the last couple of years, the company has struggled with slower growth as competitors have gotten better at copying what it did to distinguish itself in the grocery market. Other wounds have been   like last year, when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs called it out for mispricing some merchandise based on weight. Prepared foods, which have almost double the profit margins of packaged foods sold on grocery shelves, have remained a bright spot at the company  —   at least for now. Such foods accounted for almost 20 percent of its sales in 2014, ringing up $2. 7 billion in revenue. But the letter from the F. D. A. is the second black eye for health issues at the plant outside of Boston, known as its North Atlantic Kitchen, and could put some of those sales in peril. Phil Lempert, an expert on grocery store operations and marketing, said that the food safety crisis at Chipotle Mexican Grill late last year should have been a   call for Whole Foods and anyone else in the business of preparing fresh foods for sale. “For Whole Foods to be in this predicament, frankly, there really is no excuse,” Mr. Lempert said. “Because Wall Street has put it under such pressure to expand growth, I think Whole Foods has gotten sloppy  —   there’s no reason anyone should have water dripping into foods. ” Last fall, Whole Foods voluntarily recalled batches of Curry Chicken Salad and Classic Deli Pasta Salad after a sample prepared at the North Atlantic Kitchen tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogenic strain of the bacterium. The plant is one of three preparation kitchens that help stock its stores in the Northeast,   and South. (Most of the company’s foods are prepared at the stores themselves.) In February, the inspectors spent five days at the plant and then shared their findings with Whole Foods, which responded within 15 business days. The company told the F. D. A. that it had retrained employees to address most of the issues the agency raised. That response, however, failed to satisfy the F. D. A. “We do not consider your response acceptable because you failed to provide documentation for our review, which demonstrates that all your noted corrective actions have been effectively implemented,” the agency wrote in its June 8 warning letter. Whole Foods said the letter came as a surprise. The company said it had taken steps to correct the problems and would meet on Thursday with the F. D. A. to discuss what the issues are and how to address them. “What’s confusing to us is the fact that the letter identifies issues we’ve already corrected,” said Ken Meyer, the company’s executive vice president for operations. “We worked with a   consultant and our own global food safety team,” he said, “to address their concerns and assumed we were in good standing with them until this letter arrived on Friday. ” Whole Foods now has about two weeks to provide evidence to the F. D. A. that steps it has taken bring the company into compliance. Otherwise, the company might have to pay the agency to reinspect the facility. Groceries have long offered prepared foods like rotisserie chickens and broccoli salad. But as business has declined in the center store, companies have upped their game, adding sophisticated meals that consumers can take home or eat in the store. Research this year from the Food Marketing Institute and Technomic found that sales of prepared foods in groceries increased 10. 4 percent from 2006 to 2014, making the prepared foods department one of the highest performers in the food business. While only 8 percent of the supermarkets responding to that survey reported sales growth of more than 5 percent, more than   of them said they had growth at that level or higher in their prepared food businesses. The risk for grocery companies is that preparing food receives a higher level of scrutiny from regulators than selling food made and packaged by others. A bad inspection in one location, or reports of food illnesses, can damage an entire brand. Shares in Whole Foods fell nearly 5 percent on Wednesday. Last year, Costco recalled celery sticks and turkey dinners, King Sooper recalled curried chicken salad and Raley’s recalled its Asian Blue Cheese, Potato and Bacon salad after E. coli was found in celery supplied to all by a single supplier. Still, perhaps no company has been more aggressive about integrating prepared foods than Whole Foods. The company has long put bars and restaurants into its stores  —   a new store in Hawaii will have about 200 seats for shoppers to sit and enjoy a meal and a drink. “Whole Foods is one of the pioneers in providing restaurant quality meals to consumers,” said Joe Pawlak, managing principal at Technomic. Now, stores like ShopRite and Safeway are opening   groceraunts, too. The oyster bar at one of the Mariano’s groceries in Chicago has become a place for a Friday night date, and a ShopRite in Morris Plains, N. J. added a    atrium where people can enjoy a meal. Supermarkets tried moving into the food preparation business in the 1990s, Mr. Pawlak said, but offered too broad a menu and ended up throwing a lot of food away. “Now what’s happened over the last five or six years, they’ve hired food service professionals who understand restaurants and how items move on a menu,” he said. “That’s taken the quality up to where I can get just as good a meal at the grocery store as I can in many   restaurants  —   and for a lot better value. ” An F. D. A. spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on whether its inspection of grocery food preparation operations was increasing. A Yahoo News analysis of the F. D. A. ’s food safety recalls in 2015 found that prepared foods accounted for more recalls than any other food category.",0
4447,Syria Calls on UN to ‘Punish’ Israel Over Airport Attack,"BEIRUT (AP)  —   Syria on Friday called on the international community to “punish” Israel for an apparent missile attack on a major military airport west of Damascus, and accused the US, Britain and France of supporting the assault. [The Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the missile attack in two letters to the UN   and the president of the UN Security Council, saying such an attack would not have occurred had it not been for the “direct support from the outgoing American administration and French and British leaderships. ”  The ministry said the Israeli assault on the Mezzeh military airport comes as part of a series of periodic Israel attacks that started with Syria’s war in March 2011. It called on the international community to “punish the Israeli aggressor. ” The attack was the third such incident recently, according to the Syrian government. In a statement carried on the official news agency SANA, the Syrian military said several missiles were launched just after midnight from an area near Lake Tiberias. The missiles fell in the vicinity of the Mezzeh military airport on the western edge of the Syrian capital. The statement did not say whether there were any casualties. Residents of Damascus reported hearing several explosions that shook the city. The Mezzeh airport compound, located on the southwestern edge of the capital, had been used to launch attacks on   areas near Damascus and has previously come under rebel fire. The Syrian army said Israel, through its attacks, was assisting “terrorist groups” fighting the Syrian government. “The Syrian army command and armed forces warn the Israeli enemy of the repercussions of this blatant attack and stress that it will continue its war on terrorism,” the statement said. On Dec. 7, the Syrian government reported Israel fired    missiles that also struck near the Mezzeh airport. A week earlier, SANA said Israeli jets fired two missiles from Lebanese airspace toward the outskirts of Damascus, in the Sabboura area. The Israeli military has declined to comment on those incidents, and there was no immediate comment on Friday’s reported attack. Israel is widely believed to have carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria in the past few years that have targeted advanced weapons systems, including     missiles and   missiles, as well as positions of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group in Syria. The Shiite group has sent thousands of its fighters to Syria to support President Bashar Assad’s forces in the country’s civil war, now in its sixth year. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman recently reiterated his government’s position to not get involved in the Syrian war.",0
4448,Seth Meyers Schools Idiot Trump: You Don’t Even Know What Obamacare Is! (VIDEO),"With the recent news that Affordable Healthcare rates are predicted to rise in 2017, you’d expect that any even partially informed Republican presidential candidate would jump on that news and spin it into oblivion. 
Not Trump, though. Nope. He was too busy plugging his new Florida resort to care. 
Seth Meyers spent Wednesday’s Late Night segment, A Closer Look , focusing on the abysmal way the Trump campaign is being managed and how it, as Seth put it, “never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.” 
While some of the segment was aimed at Trump spokesperson Newt Gingrich and his total meltdown on The Kelly File , Seth spent the better part of his time ripping Trump and his complete lack of knowledge about Obamacare to shreds. 
After showing video of Trump at his new Florida resort this week saying that all of his “employees are having a tremendous problem with Obamacare,” Seth had this question: 
“What are you talking about?! Obamacare is for people who don’t have health insurance, but your employees do get health insurance through you!!” 
We’ll see if Trump answers. 
Meanwhile, further proving his point, Meyers shows a clip of Trump’s resort manager clarifying to the media that 99 percent of their employees are indeed insured through the company and not Obamacare.

4449,Mondelez Abandons Its Efforts to Combine With Hershey - The New York Times,"For two brief months, it looked as if there was a possibility of a more than $20 billion takeover that would combine the makers of Oreos and Hershey Kisses. But chocolate lovers’ hopes were dashed on Monday, when the deal discussions ended. Mondelez International, the owner of snack brands like Oreo and Nabisco, said on Monday that it was no longer seeking to acquire the Hershey Company. Hershey rebuffed a $23 billion offer from Mondelez in June, but on Monday it became apparent that they had restarted talks more recently. “Following additional discussions, and taking into account recent shareholder developments at Hershey, we determined that there is no actionable path forward toward an agreement,” Irene B. Rosenfeld, the chairwoman and chief executive of Mondelez, said in a statement. “While we are disappointed in this outcome, we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions, and confident that our advantaged platform positions us well for   performance over the long term. ” Shares of Hershey tumbled almost 12 percent in   trading, while those of Mondelez gained about 3 percent. Mondelez’s offer in June consisted of $107 in cash and stock for every Hershey share  —   a 10 percent premium at the time. Over the last few weeks, Mondelez floated an offer of about $115 a share, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Hershey indicated that the figure had to be at least $125 to continue negotiations, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the talks publicly. That gap in pricing, as well as uncertainty surrounding the status of Hershey’s largest shareholder, were the primary reasons the bid was abandoned. A representative from Hershey confirmed that there were additional communications with Mondelez and that Mondelez was no longer pursuing a deal. She declined to comment further. The Hershey Trust Company, which wields 81 percent of the voting power of Hershey shares, has been a thorn in many of the company’s   efforts in years past. That was true when Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company wanted to buy Hershey in 2002, and again when Hershey wanted to buy Cadbury eight years later. The charitable trust votes Hershey shares on behalf of the Milton Hershey School for underprivileged children, which was started in 1909 and named for the company’s founder. More recently, the trust has come under fire over corporate governance mishaps. In July, the trust reached a settlement with the Pennsylvania attorney general, which restricted the amount of time directors could remain on the board as well as their compensation. The trust’s board, which has already experienced tremendous turnover, will be reshaped as the agreement requires three trustees to step down by the end of the year. Two others will remain until the end of 2017. Mondelez had offered other concessions to make a deal work, including keeping jobs and moving the combined entity’s operations to Hershey, Pa. Mondelez also planned to keep the Hershey name. Mondelez, which was spun out of Kraft Foods in 2012, has had to contend with the wishes of its own shareholders. Two of the biggest are prominent hedge funds: Trian Fund Management, led by Nelson Peltz, and Pershing Square Capital Management, led by William A. Ackman. Mr. Peltz, who took a seat on Mondelez’s board in 2014, had been pushing for a merger between PepsiCo and Mondelez, and then a spinoff of its snack operations with Mondelez’s. He ultimately dropped this plan and recently sold  his stake in Pepsi.",0
4450,"Japanese Leader’s Pearl Harbor Visit, Called a First, Looks More Like a Fourth - The New York Times","TOKYO  —   When President Obama made a historic visit to Hiroshima in May, there was no question that he was the first sitting American president to do so. But as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to pay his respects at Pearl Harbor on Tuesday, Japanese officials are scrambling to identify what, exactly, is unprecedented about his reciprocal visit. Mr. Abe announced this month that he would visit Pearl Harbor. Japan’s Foreign Ministry, in news briefings, indicated at the time that he would be the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor, the site of the surprise attack on a United States naval base 75 years ago. It turns out, though, that he might not be the first, or even the second. It now appears that he is the fourth. A few days after Mr. Abe announced his visit, news reports emerged that a predecessor, Shigeru Yoshida, had stopped in Hawaii in 1951 on his way home from signing a treaty in San Francisco and had paid a quiet visit to Pearl Harbor. And last week, a   newspaper in Hawaii reported that it had found in its archives articles about two other visits there by sitting Japanese prime ministers in the 1950s, including Nobusuke Kishi, Mr. Abe’s grandfather. In response to the reports, Japanese officials are now characterizing Mr. Abe’s visit as the first by a sitting prime minister with an American president to the memorial atop the remains of the U. S. S. Arizona, the American battleship on which the worst losses occurred. Mr. Abe will accompany Mr. Obama to the memorial, which was constructed in 1962. After the existence of the prior visits was reported, Japan’s Foreign Ministry acknowledged that in 1956 Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama had visited the United States Pacific Command in Honolulu, and that Mr. Kishi had followed in 1957. Mr. Kishi was also reported to have visited the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, a mountaintop shrine dedicated to the American dead in several wars. Mr. Abe’s office said that “it was difficult to confirm as it was contained in records more than 60 years ago. ” It is possible that the current government did not realize that the prime minister’s predecessors had visited Pearl Harbor. Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, said he was not familiar with either Mr. Hatoyama’s or Mr. Kishi’s visits. “They weren’t big time, official state visits,” he said. At the time, the news media on both sides of the Pacific provided scant coverage. The New York Times did not cover any of the prime ministers’ visits to Pearl Harbor, and both The Associated Press and The Nikkei Shimbun of Japan described Mr. Kishi’s visit to Honolulu without mentioning Pearl Harbor. In a memoir, Mr. Hatoyama recounted his trip to Honolulu and his stop at the United States Pacific Command. “In front of the building, the Army brass band was ready and they fired a   salute and the band played the Japanese national anthem for me,” Mr. Hatoyama wrote. “It happened at the top of a hill overlooking Pearl Harbor, so I got a catch in my throat. ” Mr. Abe apparently did not know that his grandfather, Mr. Kishi, had been to Pearl Harbor. Mr. Abe has professed his desire to fulfill his grandfather’s thwarted effort to revise the pacifist clause in Japan’s Constitution. Historians speculated that the prime ministers who visited Pearl Harbor in the 1950s would have kept a low profile because the wounds of the attack were still raw and the United States and Japan were establishing the terms of their postwar alliance. What’s more, said Hironao Suzuki, a professor of political science at Shizuoka University, the “political conflict between the left and right was so fierce that there might have been concern that the public might not accept the visits. ” In postwar Japan, the left assailed the Japanese alliance with the United States, while the right defended Japan’s actions during World War II as a matter of  . The Americans also had strategic reasons to treat the early Japanese visits to Pearl Harbor with delicacy. “For the American public, also, we had to do this real pirouette from vilifying the inhuman, disgusting, vile Japanese to being our best friends in the Pacific,” said Jeff Kingston, the director of Asian studies at Temple University in Tokyo. And in the case of Mr. Kishi, who was accused of war crimes (although he was never indicted) the American government might have been reluctant to highlight his trip to Pearl Harbor. “There was no possible gain to be made from making this public,” Mr. Kingston said. “And there was some political risk at making it known. ” In answering questions about why the Japanese government had not recognized the earlier visits, Yoshihide Suga, Mr. Abe’s chief cabinet secretary, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Abe would be “the first to express remorse” at the Pearl Harbor memorial. Indeed, the politics of apology began to gain currency only in the 1980s, said Alexis Dudden, a professor at the University of Connecticut who specializes in modern Japanese history. Both Mr. Hatoyama and Mr. Kishi would have stopped in Hawaii because they needed to make refueling stops on the way home from Washington. And when they visited the United States Pacific Command, Ms. Dudden said, “those were more likely visits of assurance that in fact now the Cold War was up and running and Japan was very much an ally. ” Mr. Abe’s visit, on the other hand, represents “a formulaic understanding of contrition that enables a nation to reinstate itself as sufficiently contrite in order to move on into the future,” she said. For those on the left in Japan, as well as critics in China, South Korea and elsewhere, the prime minister’s visit to Pearl Harbor ignores Japanese aggression closer to home in Asia. “I can only hope that building on this visit, Abe will take the opportunity to go to Nanjing and Seoul,” Ms. Dudden said. Other historians said that whether Mr. Abe was the first or fourth prime minister to visit Pearl Harbor was less significant than what he does when he is there. “What we should watch is what Mr. Abe will say,” said Masayasu Hosaka, a historian who has written books about the wartime Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. “That’s more important. How his speech will be evaluated historically and internationally is more interesting. ”",0
4451,Clickventure: You Were Abducted By Aliens. Will Anyone Ever Believe You?,"You begin describing small aliens… 
“They were small.” 
“Ah man,” says the cabbie. “Just some little small aliens, huh?” 
He seems disappointed. Wait, I changed my mind. They were big. 
You begin describing the big aliens… 
“They were big.” 
“Wow! Big aliens,” says the cabbie. “Now we’re talking. I never heard of anything like that. What were the big aliens like? Did they have legs?” They had skin like leather. 
You don’t tell the cabbie about aliens. 
“That’s okay,” he says as he drives on. “Aliens! Gee. Makes sense, I guess. I never heard of nothing like aliens.” Pass the rest of the ride in silence. Come to think of it, I did see some aliens tonight. And they were big. 
“Ah, that’s too bad,” says the cabbie. “Like I said, I never heard of anything like aliens before, but I was getting ready to believe you, especially if they had big, nice legs. Ones like you just described, though? Thanks but no thanks.” Pass the rest of the ride in silence. Come to think of it, the aliens I saw did have big, nice legs. Five of them! 
The cabbie nods excitedly. …and these hollow black eyes. …and that's it. 
The cabbie is rapt with awe. …with fearsome ivory fangs. 
The cabbie signals you to keep going. …and five big, nice legs. …and that's it. 
“Ah, the legs! I can picture it perfectly,” says the cabbie. “Aliens! I never heard of nothing like that before, but I can practically see those legs kicking, so nice and so big!” 
The cab begins to swerve as the cabbie becomes more excited about how big the aliens’ legs were and is no longer paying any attention to the road. I'm telling the truth! The legs were big! Wait, I just remembered! The legs were small! 
“Yes, those big alien legs!” the cabbie shrieks as he completely loses control of the vehicle, which goes careering up a nearby volcano. His last words as the taxi plummets over the verge and into molten lava are, “I believe you!” 
Someone believed that you were abducted by aliens, but at what cost? At the cost of dying in a volcano. Start Over 
“Here we are! Sister’s apartment!” says the cabbie. Great. How much do I owe you? Leave without paying. 
“This one’s on the house!” says the cabbie. Thanks! 
You’re outside your sister’s apartment complex, which is where your sister makes $1,111 per day working from home. 
You super trust and super admire your sister. She is a master of logic and facts, and you know she’ll have a high bar for believing your story. You’ll need to remember a lot of good detail if you hope to convince her, and you’ll need to hurry, since your memory is already feeling a little fuzzy… Text your sister about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens. Send your sister nine emails about the fact that you are outside and have seen aliens. Text your sister the ""alien"" emoji, the ""abduction"" emoji, and the ""outside apartment"" emoji. 
Your sister answers the door immediately. She invites you to sit down on the couch and hands you a microphone with the local news channel’s logo cube on it and asks you to tell her what happened. I was abducted by aliens, and I am going to tell you all about it. Stand back, my sibling. I am going to convince you that I was abducted by aliens. 
“Aliens, eh?” your sister asks. “Abducted by?” Yes, my sister, they stole me from the atmosphere, and now I'm back. Precisely. Now listen up, my sibling. Here comes the tale. 
“Go ahead then,” says your sister. “Tell me a story about how aliens stole you from the atmosphere.” It began like any other night… It began right away with aliens… It began right after the aliens had left me in the forest and disappeared… 
You begin your story… 
“The alien light dissipated. I was alone in the forest at night. 
I decided to hail a cab, so I stuck out my arm in the universal sign for ‘taxi.’ Immediately, a cab burst from the forest. 
‘Where you headed?’ the cab driver asked.” I got in and told him to go to my sister's house. The cabbie got out of the cab. 
“It was then I remember the cabbie got out of his cab.” Then he got back in the cab. And that's all I remember. 
“So,” says your sister. “If I have your story right, you hailed a cab in the forest, and at some point the driver got out of the vehicle, and that’s all you remember.” Exactly. There's more to the story. Let me start over. 
“The next thing I knew, he was back in the cab. 
‘Where you headed?’ he asked me again.” I told him to go to my sister's house. He got out of the cab again. 
“I believe you about the driver getting out of the car, but I don’t think you saw any aliens,” says your sister. “I’m sorry, but that’s just how I feel.” 
Your sister doesn’t believe that you were abducted by aliens. You have failed. Start Over 
“The cabbie floored it, and pretty soon we were driving through the city on the way to my sister’s house, which is where you live.” We arrived, and I thanked the cabbie for his service. 
“When we arrived, I got out of the cab. The cabbie and I pointed at each other and waved goodbye in silence for three minutes.” And that's the end of my story. 
“Well, it certainly sounds like you took a taxi from the forest to my apartment, but I’m sorry to say I’m not convinced that you saw any aliens,” says your sister. “Is that really the whole story?” Yes, that's it. There was more. 
“Then I don’t believe you saw any aliens.” 
Ouch. You really bungled the story about how you were abducted by aliens. You are a miserable bard of the supernatural, and your sister didn’t believe you at all. You have failed. Start Over 
Your sister settles in as you begin your alien testimony… 
“It began like any other night. I thought it was Guy Fawkes Night, so I was in the forest setting off fireworks by myself.” I would light the firework, run back to safety, look up, and… 
“ Boom! Good riddance, Sir Fawkes!” It was so much fun, I decided to light another firework. I wasn't having fun, but I decided to light another firework. 
“I lit the firework, stepped back, and looked up. I expected to see a sparkling skyrocket. What I saw was…” A sparkling skyrocket, just as I had expected. A strange light in the sky. 
“Yes, it was a skyrocket. My expectation was on the money. 
I prepared to launch another firework into the sky. I loaded it up, sprinted back to safety, and looked to the sky again, this time expecting to see the gorgeous blue and purple firework known as the Butcher’s Delight…” And the Butcher's Delight it was. And that's when it happened. 
“I was right again. In the clear sky above me, I saw the firework called the Butcher’s Delight. 
I set up the last firework, drew a match, and lit the fuse. It was a quick fuse, so the firework had already launched by the time I turned around and looked up, thinking I would see the unmistakeable multicolored burst of the Salute to James Buchanan firework. But is that what I saw, looking to the skies?” Yes, it was. It was not, for that was when it happened. 
“Yes, my sibling. The Salute to James Buchanan firework exploded as planned. 
I applauded at the fireworks finale, congratulating myself on another successful night of fireworks even as I realized that I had bungled the Guy Fawkes date again.” Then I went home. Then I came right to you. 
“Thank you,” says your sister. ”That was a very nice story about how you set off fireworks in the woods by yourself. And did you see any aliens while you were at it?” Yes. No. 
“Well, I don’t believe you. You only told me about fireworks. I was expecting to hear more about aliens.” 
You have not convinced your sister that you saw aliens. Wait, I didn't tell it right. Start Over 
“Okay,” says your sister. “It’s too bad nothing happened with aliens.” 
You have not convinced her that you were abducted by aliens. Wait, I didn't tell it right. Start Over 
“A strange light appeared in the sky.” I ran, but the strange light followed me. I couldn't escape it. There was a sudden burst of futuristic light. 
“Science enveloped me.” The light only got more futuristic. Then all of a sudden, I was standing on the UFO deck. 
“When the light faded, I noticed that I was on a spaceship. 
This part of the ship was clean and triangular.” I noticed that the spaceship had some sort of artificial gravity. I could tell immediately that the spaceship was in space. 
“Okay, I think I understand that you were on a spaceship,” says your sister. “Get to the aliens, though. How about some aliens in the story? When you were on the spaceship, were there any aliens that you saw?” Yes. I don't know, but my boss from my first job was there. 
“My boss from my first job was there, and he was happy to see me.” My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said “Yes, that seems right.” My boss said that I was dreaming, and I said, ""No, that's wrong,"" but it later turned out that he was right. 
“Hmm,” says your sister. “It sounds to me like instead of encountering aliens, you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. Could that be right?” Yeah, that's definitely right. Wait, I told the story wrong. Let me start over. 
You were trying to get your sister to believe that you had seen aliens, but all you managed to convince her of was that you had a dream about seeing your boss in space. You failed! Start Over 
“There were aliens. A crowd of them. Huge, mighty creatures with skin like leather, hollow black eyes, and fearsome ivory fangs.” The aliens were shouting at me, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. ""JENCH CREV AMAMU!"" the aliens shouted, but I could not understand. 
“From among the aliens, a bigger alien stepped forth. I immediately realized this was their mayor of the aliens, as the alien was wearing a ceremonial mayoral jacket.” The mayor took out a device. 
“The mayor reached out and put the device over my eyes. 
Suddenly, I could hear everything differently.” The mayor then seemed to speak to me in English. 
“‘Welcome to my UFO,’ said the mayor. ‘You are now wearing language glasses. They allow you to understand anything that we say in our language, but be careful: It doesn’t work the other way around. If you want to learn how to talk like us, you’ll need to visit the Language Room and earn a diploma from the language guide.’” I told the mayor that I understood. I told the mayor that I didn't understand. I asked the mayor to explain who the aliens were and what their purpose was. 
“‘I don’t know what you’re saying, but I’m going to assume you asked who we are and what our purpose is. 
‘To do that, I will need to tell you how the world works. In the universe, there are three kinds of things. First, there is us. We are called people. You can tell we’re people by inspecting our beautiful ivory fangs and big, thick legs. It’s obvious. 
‘Second, there is God. God is special, secret, and far away, and there is only one of him. And we need to find him so that we can hold hands forever. We don’t know where God is, but we are looking for him. 
‘Last, there is rocks. Rocks is everything else. Planets are rocks. Spaceships are rocks. Since you are not a person, you are probably also a rock…unless of course you are God. But that’s very unlikely and illegal.’” I asked the mayor how to find out if I am a rock or if I am God. 
“‘I still can’t understand you, but here’s the deal. I’m going to retreat to the observation deck and look at the majesty of space for a while. Go to the Language Room, learn our language, then come find me and we’ll see if we can find a use for you.’” The mayor left, and I was alone with the crowd of aliens. 
“In the spaceship’s deck, the crowd of aliens was talking excitedly about God and about the kinds of dances they would do together when they found him at last.” I left the deck area and went south into the hallway. 
“In the Language Room, a man was standing on a small, circular stage. 
Above him hung a giant banner that read ‘LANGUAGE TUTORIAL FOR ENGLISH SPEAKERS.’” He began the tutorial. 
“‘Welcome to this free alien-language tutorial for English speakers!’ said the man. ‘If you are viewing this in hologram form, it means our captors have determined I am no longer necessary, and that they have mercifully killed me and freed me from my didactic prison. Right on!’” I waved my hand through him to confirm that he was a hologram. I continued watching the presentation. 
“He was not a hologram. 
‘Ha! Not yet! I wish!’ he said. ‘Please sit down, and let’s get this presentation over with!’” I sat back down and kept watching the presentation. 
“‘Let’s begin with the most basic grammatical element of the language: the word CREV,’ the man began. 
He gestured in the air beside him, where the word CREV appeared in red light. 
‘CREV is a verb that roughly translates as “to be about to point at something.” If you want to communicate effectively with the aliens, it’s an extremely important word to know.’” ""CREV,"" I managed to say. ""CREB,"" I blurted stupidly. 
“‘For example, to announce that I am ready to point at something, I would begin with the word AMAMU, which means “me,” then I would say, “CREV,” then I would say what I am pointing at.’ 
‘Like this: AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP.’” I looked where the man was pointing. I knew then that the man was pointing at Meryl Streep. 
“‘Hello!’ said Meryl Streep. ‘I am definitely a hologram.’” ""AMAMU CREV MERYL STREEP,"" I said as I pointed at the Meryl Streep hologram. 
“‘Very good. The next word we’re going to learn is important, but be aware that it is very politically charged. I am of course talking about the controversial word CREVV, and you must be very careful with it. It’s a slur that means “bad alien” and is extremely insulting to use in any situation but language tutorials.’” ""CREVV,"" I said. I nodded solemnly. I asked the teacher for an example of the bad word in context. 
“‘Here is an example of CREVV used in English context: Oh God. The aliens are killing me. Why did I say CREVV? Why didn’t someone teach me not to say CREVV? I shouldn’t have said CREVV.’” I said, ""Okay."" I said nothing. 
“‘CREVV,’ I said. 
No sooner had the word left my lips than a fearsome ivory fang had pierced my vulnerable stomach and sent everything inside me all over the place.” I was dead. 
You wrap your story about the aliens 
“Ah. So…you died?” your sister asks. Yeah. Wait, I didn't tell the story right. Let me start over. 
“Hmmm. I…doubt it,” says your sister. 
You told a story about how you got abducted by aliens and died, but your sister doesn’t seem convinced. 
No one believed you! You failed. Wait, I didn't tell the story right. Start Over 
“‘At this point, you’re almost conversant in the language. You just have a couple more words to get through. I am now teaching you the word JENCH. It means “God.”’” I said, ""JENCH."" 
“Finally, ‘The word BRIDE is the equivalent of the English word “um.” When you say the word BRIDE, it means that you have forgotten how to speak, and you are trying to remember.’” I said, ""BRIDE."" 
“‘This concludes this first and only module of alien language for English beginners. Thank you for learning with me. Get out there, start speaking the language, and remember: If I’m not already dead, please find someone who will kill me!’ 
With that, the teacher handed me a diploma with some inscrutable symbols on it and ushered me out of the Language Room.” I left the Language Room and went back out to the ship hallway. I went east. 
“I was in the ship corridor to the south of the first room.” I went north.",0

[“The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people U.

However, military officials have often been quick to dismiss such fears,” they continued. “In August 2015, Lt.

4454,Harvard Business Review: American Families Face Increasing Financial Instability - Breitbart,"The financial situation of many middle class American households is strikingly unstable, according to a new report from the Harvard Business Review. [The Harvard Business Review finds that there is increasing trend of financial vulnerability for lower and middle class American households. According to the report, households experienced an average of five months per years in which household income increased or decreased by more or less than 25 percent.  Our first big finding was that the households’ incomes were highly unstable, even for those with   workers. We counted spikes and dips in earning, defined as months in which a household’s income was either 25% more or 25% less than the average. It turned out that households experienced an average of five months per year with either a spike or dip. In other words, incomes were far from average almost half of the time. Income volatility was more extreme for poorer families, but middle class families felt it too. The report’s authors, Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, claim that income volatility is the result of shifts in the labor market, such an increasing amount of laborers who rely on income from commissions, tips, and hourly work. The study claims that household spending was just variable as income. Factors such as car repairs, college tuition bills, and healthcare contributed to the volatility of household spending. We found that monthly spending was just as volatile as income. On top of regular expenses, emergencies arose frequently: Cars needed repair, roofs needed fixing, tuition bills came due, and people got sick. In addition, the rising relative costs of health care, housing, education, and transportation stretched budgets and cut into the slack available to buffer shocks, especially with the   stagnation of real wages for most workers. In 2015   and   families devoted about   of their earnings to housing, and they have seen housing prices rise 25% —  50% since the  . The cost of a bachelor’s degree from a public college has risen by   from 2003 to 2014. The Affordable Care Act, which was designed to reduce health care costs for lower and middle class Americans, has only further complicated spending. Health care costs have continued to grow, leaving lower and middle class households with plans with high deductibles, which means large    expenses during their trips to the doctor. Morduch and Schneider argue that financially instability is in itself a form of economic inequality. They suggest that employers look to restructuring some of their practices, such as scheduling policies, so that lower and middle class American workers can ultimately find economic stability.

4455,The Passion Behind Standing Rock Protest,"The Passion Behind Standing Rock Protest October 29, 2016 
Police arrested more than 140 Native American and environmental protesters challenging an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, a project touching the raw nerves of water and global warming, reports Dennis J Bernstein. 
By Dennis J Bernstein 
The months-long struggle to stop the Dakota Pipeline near the territory of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota has raised passions among Native American activists and environmentalists who have clashed with police trying to sweep the protesters aside. 
To explain the intensity of the resistance, I interviewed Bill Means, co-founder of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and chairman of the International Indian Treaty Council, which has supported the North Dakota pipeline protests. 
In late August, the Treaty Council joined forces with the local tribes of The Standing Rock Sioux and appealed to the United Nations to intercede and take formal action in support of the their fight against the construction of the Dakota pipeline over sacred Indian lands. Native American activist Bill Means 
“We specifically request that the United States Government impose an immediate moratorium on all pipeline construction until the Treaty Rights and Human Rights of the Standing Rock Tribe can be ensured and their free, prior and informed consent is obtained,” stated Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault, and the Treaty Council, in their joint appeal to U.N. human rights officials. They requested actions by four U.N. human rights Special Rapporteurs citing “ongoing threats and violations to the human rights of the Tribe, its members and its future generations.” 
The interview preceded this week’s latest round of arrests. 
Dennis Bernstein: Bill Means, your work with the American Indian Movement as a co-founder and your knowledge of the treaties, and how many times are broken, and how they’re broken by the United States government, has always been enlightening and important. I know you are monitoring Standing Rock, and have taken an active stand, as a current board member of the International Indian Treaty Council. 
Why don’t you just say first what it signifies at this point, in the struggle. And then some of the things that come to mind in terms of what you’ve been observing about it. 
Bill Means: Well, first of all the overall struggle against global warming is really the backdrop to Standing Rock. And that’s the reason why I think so many people around the world, and the tribes all over America, are beginning to find affinity and support and solidarity with the people at Standing Rock, because it represents this world-wide struggle for sacred Mother Earth. So having that backdrop we’ve got various types of good news, and some sad news. 
Of course, the very good and healthy news is we had the first baby born on the base of the Missouri River, at the Sacred Stone Camp at Standing Rock, which was beautiful. Born with the midwives there, and all the attention and support of the community. The women came forward and brought this new life here into this world at Standing Rock. So we hope that this young child will have a Mother Earth that she can be proud of, that she can grow up in that’s clean, and has clean water, and so that represents the future. 
Also developing was the fact that our good friend and colleague, Miss Amy Goodman, had her case thrown out … by a federal judge in Bismarck, North Dakota. Where he said that she’s a journalist, doing her job, and she shouldn’t have been charged with these type [of] charges in the first place, and completely threw the charges out. So that’s a good development, as well as several other people she was arrested with. So I think that’s a beginning to turn the table on the illegal use and manipulation of the law to prevent legal, shall we say, dissent, to prevent people that are protesting legally and peacefully from their acts of courage. So that was good news, on that front. 
And then, of course, we have the ongoing problem that people have recorded …, massive trucks, semis carrying pipe. And so they are anxiously and quickly trying to get as much pipe laid towards the Missouri River as humanly possible, before there’s any type of interruptions of specific places they can’t go, which we know right now is being held up from crossing under the Missouri River. And we’re hoping that this extends itself out to other areas. The #NoDAPL water Protectors took non-violent direct action by locking themselves to construction equipment. This is “Happy” American Horse from the Sicangu Nation, hailing from Rosebud. August 31, 2016 (Desiree Kane, Wikipedia) 
And so right now the company, the DAPL, Dakota Access Pipeline people are, where they can, they’re still building as fast as they can without any regard to the restraining orders or any regard to the federal authorities that asked them to quit and to cease and desist from building until the tribe, and other proper authorities have been, shall we say, counseled with, have been involved in some type of negotiation on [these] whole various issues of treaty rights, water rights, environmental issues. And so there’s plenty of law that needs to be settled but yet the Dakota Access pipeline continues to be built. 
So we have in the face of these positive developments, we have yet to see the company cease and desist in the other areas. 
DB: Bill, let me ask you to … step into that role for a moment and talk about the stand that the council has taken and the significance in history in terms of this stand, and this place, that we’re talking about in North Dakota. 
BM: Well, first of all to give you a larger picture, the Missouri River, as you know, covers about four states, and bisects the state of South Dakota from north to south, I should say north-west to south-west. Also, including North Dakota, and Montana, and Iowa, and a little bit of Nebraska. So, having said that, you get that picture in your mind, they built at least four dams on the Missouri River that are directly built on Indian treaty land. 
See, in our treaty of 1868 and 1851, those two treaties significantly for time immemorial set the borders of the Great Sioux Nation on the east bank of the Missouri River. And the 1851 treaty was even past east of the Missouri River. So you see those treaties being violated from the beginning of building all these dams. Because the dams are built on federal reservations and flood, primarily, federal Indian land. 
So there’s many communities, including Standing Rock, which was flooded by the Oahe Dam, built in Pierre, South Dakota, in that region, which flooded not only Standing Rock but Cheyenne River Reservation. And then you have Yankton Reservation flooded twice, once by the Gavins Point Dam, and another time by the Fort Randall Dam. […] There’s a famous act known as the Pick-Sloan Act of federal government that was passed back in the ’40’s that allows these dams to be built. 
And so we have a situation where [there is] the continued violation of treaty rights and water rights. The water, by treaty, belongs to Indian people. Now, Indian people have the philosophy that the water belongs to everyone. But we have to maintain these treaty rights and these water rights. And there’s a famous case in the water rights that says, “All the water necessary for the survival of Indian people should be granted in any kind of negotiation, should be under the jurisdiction of the Indian tribes.” And that was a famous case up on the Milk River in Montana. And so it’s called the Winters Doctrine of Federal Indian Water Law. So that’s kind of a doctrine that’s been there for many, many years. 
Now, in spite of that, the government began to develop these dams on the Missouri River, and […] the Missouri River was never litigated, that is, the water was never divided up like it is, say, on the Colorado River over further west. And so, since their water rights have never been litigated, the water has not been quantified like who owns what drop of water, who owns this bank, who owns that bank, has not been decided. 
And so, in our mind, in the federal law’s mind, we still have authority over the Missouri River, not only by treaty but by federal Indian water rights. So that’s the idea and the legal fight for Indian people. And that’s how Standing Rock got involved because of all these dams being built on the Missouri. 
And there’s also the issue not only of the environmental issues, in which the federal government is required by law to do what they call environmental impacts statements, environmental impact study, which is supposed to give warning. [But] they’re supposed to give the impact of these massive development projects on the people. Not only Indian people, but non-Indian people. 
So a lot of these rules and regulations are either being trampled on by the corporate entities or ignored by the federal government, or given some kind of a lip service to state government, or what they call the Public Utilities Commission. So this is kind of the backdrop, where we have state and federal authorities negligent throughout this process, historically, and even today, in protecting the rights of not only American Indians, but American citizens. So this is why we fight. Activists carry the American Indian Movement flag at a protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline. (Flickr John Duffy) 
DB: We saw their struggle at Wounded Knee, many of their struggles, but a big one at Wounded Knee. Bill also is on the Board of the International Treaty Council, and they’re working with the local tribes in this struggle. And, Bill, can I ask you to just talk a little bit about the stand that the Treaty Council has taken and how you’ve been working with the local tribes legally, if you will? 
BM: Ah, yeah, we’ve been working in two areas. [First] helping them to organize through the National Lawyers Guild– legal defense for those water protectors that are being charged with various crimes as they do their legal, and peaceful, protests to the pipeline. So that’s one area that’s very important. And we want to give kudos and strength to the National Lawyers Guild for lending that support, and other lawyers both that work for the tribe and others. 
Another area that’s significant is that the International Indian Treaty Council along with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe filed [a] human rights complaint with the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, as part of the United Nations under the Human Rights Laws and Protocol that the United States has agreed to as being part of the United Nations. 
Here we’ve presented the evidence of which I’ve talked about–federal/state regulations, treaty rights, water rights that are facts in law–and presented those human rights as human rights violations in the struggle of Indian people to maintain clean water, and access to clean water, and drinking water. So we presented to specific, what they call, repertoires. These are people that study the issues, internationally in the Human Rights Commission. And those special repertoires, or the issues they’re studying, of course, is the special repertoire on water, the special repertoire on indigenous peoples, the special repertoire of sacred places. 
As you know, in Syria and in other wars around the world, these armies, these militants, these people have destroyed many, many graves, artifacts, in an attempt to promote their way of life. And so this has become an international issue. […] The DAPL pipeline in particular has destroyed graves already. And so all these issues, whether it’s water, whether it’s the rights of Indigenous people, are now being studied by the United Nations. And the United States has to answer these questions as party to these human rights treaties that they signed. 
So, we have pressure being exerted internationally by the United Nation’s human rights system. While all these other issues are going on both locally, in the courts from the water resisters, as well as the water protectors, as well as the tribe itself in federal court. So we have a court case going against various federal agencies, and now some negotiations are taking place with the Department of the Army which handles Corps of Engineers, which governs the river ways and waterways of America. Also, we have involved the Department of Interior and the Department of Justice. So we can tell from those various words that they have significant interests in these issues. 
The Bureau of Indian Affairs is totally within the Department of Interior. And, of course, the Department of Justice is supposed to be protecting us, the Indian people, the American people from these corporate carpetbaggers, and these corporate interests that continue to ignore the laws of the United States and treaty laws. 
So, here we have three agencies now involved in trying to carry out negotiations and what they call “consultations” with the tribes and the local communities of non-Indians who are also protesting. 
DB: There’s a couple things in terms of the terminology I want you to expand on, but first of all, in terms of the graves… you say that sacred grave sites, burial sites have already been destroyed. Who would have been in those graves? 
BM: Well, these ancient sites, some of our ancestors were buried along the river, as you know, we have a saying in our language which goes “water is life.” So in respect for the life, many times historically our people were buried overlooking the river, overlooking the water. And that attachment goes back centuries, in our culture the role of water [is] as the first medicine to our people. And the role that water plays in humanity, and its need for purity. Its need to allow our people to grow, to live. 
And so, this is one of the areas that historically our people were buried and then, as this pipeline goes, there’s even a federal act for that called American Indian Graves and Historical Preservation Act. And in that federal law, federal entities and companies are supposed to consult and they’re supposed to work with Indian tribes when they come across these ancient burial grounds. Activists protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. (Flickr John Duffy) 
And so, these go back for many centuries, some of these burial grounds, as well as fairly modern day areas. So rather than consult, they generally just go through and destroy them. Or when they do consult, their way of consulting is they call the local state university, have the anthros come out, dig up the bones that are left and haul them off to the university, in total disrespect for our culture, for humanity, for our way of life. 
And so, this is a problem that has [been] seen time and again with these pipelines, these development projects, in and around the Missouri River, especially because water being life, there’s a lot of, shall we say, generations that have grown up around that river, and continue to live in those areas. So that’s why it’s important. It would be akin, I guess, like if we went in and started digging up maybe some famous cemetery. You know, what if we went to say the National Military Cemetery, in Washington, D.C. and started digging them up. 
DB: …over there at Arlington, where they have the ceremonies every year. 
BM: Yeah, if we went there and started digging them up, or maybe to the Cathedral of Saint John, in New York. And where they have their burial ground, outside there in New York, we go there and start digging up and say we want to look for the size of the heads, or we want to study the white man, in these Indian universities and Indian colleges. People would be outraged. But, yet, when it’s Indian people calling for justice for destroying our culture, and our historical artifacts, and our graves, somehow we get ignored. Somehow we get a dual standard of justice when it comes to Indian people. 
And so, we have to make this resistance in order to send a message to America that, “We’re still here as Indigenous people.” Not only here in America but wherever the minerals, wherever the clean water still exists, that’s where Indigenous people are today, all over the world. 
DB: And, to put this in the political context, obviously there’s a presidential election going on. Have any of these candidates expressed any sympathy for the Indigenous community for this case against destroying sacred burial grounds and digging up graves, so that universities can study the bones? Has anybody stepped forward? Have you been impressed by any of the politicians? 
BM: Ah, no not at all. As a matter of fact, Donald Trump said there’s a war on coal, and that he’s going to stop that war. Now, coal is probably the most devastating form of energy production that we have in America, or in the world. So that gives you an idea about his concern about Mother Earth. Hillary, on the other hand, has only paid lip service to Indian issues. We haven’t heard her come out on the DAPL pipeline, or any other pipeline. She did say that she changed her position on the XL pipeline, which President Obama stopped, along with some white ranchers in Nebraska, and Indian people that worked together–what they called the CIA, Cowboy and Indian Alliance, which is getting stronger by the day, where white people and Indian people have come together–to protect their land. 
And so, the candidates, they haven’t even voiced a public statement, for sure. And it only comes out when asked maybe in a local rally or something, then they give basically lip service, and talk about window dressing on the issue. 
DB: Before we let you go, and this is something I’ve really been wanting to speak with you about. I think one of the most powerful parts of this movement is that the Indigenous community is really taking the lead. They’ve really come together and opened the door in a way that white people and all people can sort of come in and be a part of it. But the fact is, that… and the power is, we now refer to the protestors as water protectors, or water resistors, this is through the Indigenous communities vision of life which is really a vision in the context of global warming, it’s the only vision that can save us. People gather in Seattle to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline, September 2016. (Flickr John Duffy) 
BM: Exactly right. I think that what Indigenous people have to offer the world is the fact that we have to build our policies and our governments around the future of Mother Earth. And so whether you’re left or right, we all have to live on the Earth. Whether you’re left or right, you have to drink water, water that is pure. 
And, so these basic issues of human life are what Indigenous people have been calling for respect, all these years. It’s only when we protest that it brings this issue into the forefront of the rest of the world, where they decide hey, maybe this global warming does have an impact on Indigenous people, because it’s impacting us. Whether that’s in Europe, whether that’s in the United States, Latin America. The pollution has gotten so bad that it’s beginning to affect our daily lives. And so, until you respect Earth itself, and the power of Mother Earth, then you will never respect the future of our future generations, and those who come after us. 
The Indian philosophy of life is that we have to look seven generations ahead when we make these decisions about development, about exploitation of natural resources, about all these extractive industries. What harm does that do to our Mother, the Earth? And what is the impact on the future generations? So that’s the philosophy that’s beginning to come out in terms of political variations in government policy around the world, is that we really have to, no matter what form of government you have, you have to be able if you look at Mother Earth as the leading policy, as the primary very function of government – just protect the Earth, not corporations. And so, until we can do that then I think we’re in a losing battle. 
And we hope that these types of struggles, which we have no intention of changing because it’s going on all where Indigenous people are around the world, which is now 400 million Indigenous people who still speak their language, still have their traditional government, still have their culture and language. These are the people who are protecting the Earth. And we hope to enlarge that Earth protective family, to include each and every American, each and every citizen living on Mother Earth. Native American activist Leonard Peltier’s FBI headshot (Wikipedia) 
DB: Bill, it’s almost a tradition with us in terms of remembering Leonard Peltier. Now, last we spoke you gave President Obama an F for keeping his promises in terms of really making a difference in the Indigenous communities of North America. Do you think, and what would you say, do you think he could raise his grade from and F to a D or a C, if he decided to take a courageous action and finally, finally free Leonard Peltier? 
BM: Yes, I think he really could because Leonard Peltier represents the treatment the United States government has given to Indian people throughout the history of this great country. And so until we can deal with the basic issues of human rights and justice, then I think Indian people will always be on the bottom rung of the ladder of social justice. And so I think it’s up to President Obama, before he leaves to try to take this one act of clemency, in which everyone will be able to sit down at the table and say, “Leonard Peltier is finally free. He’s going home. He’s going to see his children, for the first time in 41 years.” And we hope and we pray that that happens before the president goes out of office.

4456,Big Pharma Targets Profits in Rare Diseases,"Big Pharma Targets Profits in Rare Diseases All of the world's most expensive drugs are used to treat uncommon conditions Image Credits: StockSnap/Pixabay . 
One might think Big Pharma garners most of its profit peddling pills for more well-known diseases, but new research shows that pharmaceutical companies are instead searching for the next “big thing” in rare diseases. 
Big Pharma’s profit margins continue to rise considerably with rarer diseases, simply because they can charge more for the pills than they do for medication for more common ailments. 
The search for the next money-maker within rare diseases has actually halted some of the advancements for more common ailments, which may explain why they still haven’t discovered a cure for some of the most common diseases affecting the world’s population. 
In 1983, the Orphan Drug Act started to incentivize the creation of drugs for rarer diseases to ensure that those suffering from uncommon conditions were not neglected in new scientific research simply because the drugs weren’t as profitable. 
Because of the incentives, which include reduced taxes and reduced or waived regulatory fees, over 500 new drugs for uncommon diseases have hit the market since the law was introduced. 
For common illnesses, Big Pharma can get still turnover big profits while not charging a fortune for the drug. For example, Liptior (atorvastatin), which is used to regulate cholesterol, generates a sales profit of $131 billion with the prescription only costing patients around $2 per day. 
But with rare diseases, prices must be kept high in order to keep Big Pharma in business. This means that while those with uncommon illnesses may benefit healthwise from the new measures, their pocketbooks are in for a hit. 
For example, the cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco by Vertex costs individual patients $311,000. 
Gilead’s Sovaldi, used to treat Hepatitis C, cashes in at $84,000 for a paltry 12-week course of medication. 
And Soliris, used to treat rare blood conditions, costs the patient a whopping $400,000 per year. 
The list of the 10 most expensive drugs that are currently manufactured are all created to treat “orphan” or uncommon illnesses. 
Thanks to these laws that allow Big Pharma to charge these insane amounts of money, they can use those who suffer from rare diseases as their cash cows. 
Drugs for rare diseases will account for 19% of pharmaceutical branded drug profits by the year 2020. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew. Related Articles",0
4457,"Crisis of Conscience? Obama Frees Scores of Drug Offenders from Prison, Including 42 Lifers, Days Before Election","Home / #Solutions / Crisis of Conscience? Obama Frees Scores of Drug Offenders from Prison, Including 42 Lifers, Days Before Election Crisis of Conscience? Obama Frees Scores of Drug Offenders from Prison, Including 42 Lifers, Days Before Election Matt Agorist October 28, 2016 1 Comment 
“Prison is for rapists, thieves, and murderers. If you lock someone up for smoking a plant that makes them happy, you’re the fucking criminal.” – Joe Rogan 
Washington D.C. — The timeless words of Joe Rogan seem to be taking their toll on the consciences of American politicians. To kidnap and lock people in a cage for a personal choice and action that harms no one, is an evil act. Some politicians are figuring this out — or at least pandering to public demand. Either way, the result is the same. 
Despite largely continuing the drug war and drastically increasing raids on medical marijuana facilities as compared to his predecessor, Barack Obama has somehow managed to dupe people into thinking he was pro legalized pot. And now, as his reign comes to an end, he seems to be reversing course. 
Over the years, Obama has blown a lot of smoke (pun intended) when it came to his views on the war on drugs. He’s played Mr. Nice Guy while his heavily militarized government task forces have laid waste to the rights and property of peaceful people trying to help their fellow man by growing medical marijuana. 
Under Obama, police in America, through the federal 1033 program , have acquired MRAP’s, grenade launchers, and even Apache attack choppers; most of which have been used enforcing immoral and unethical drug laws. However, no one, not even the almighty Barack Obama, can stop an idea whose time has come. 
The people have spoken, and politicians who continue to call for the imprisonment of non-violent individuals for their personal choices are being exposed for the vile and obstinate tyrants they are. 
Apparently this notion has made it to the ear of his majesty, Barack Obama. In a recent show of humanity, he’s freed several dozen more non-violent drug offenders. 
According to Reason Magazine , this latest batch of commutations raises Obama’s total so far to 872, nearly all of them involving nonviolent drug offenders. That is more commutations than were issued by his 11 most recent predecessors combined. According to the White House , the 688 commutations since the beginning of 2016 are “the most ever done by a president in a single year”—not surprising, since Obama’s commutations have been strikingly backloaded, with 79 percent coming during his last year in office and 98 percent in the second half of his second term. He shortened just one sentence during his first term. 
As the chart shows below, either Obama’s conscience is weighing on him or political pressure is is winning. 
According to a report from Reason: 
Obama clearly is trying hard to make up for lost time. In a speech on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said there will be “many more [commutations] to come.” Wednesday White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said Obama is committed to “using his clemency authority through the remainder of his time in office.” If he maintains this month’s rate in November, December, and January, his total will be around 1,500. If he picks up the pace, he could still reach the “thousands” predicted in 2014. 
Even 2,000 commutations would represent just 6.9 percent of the 29,000 or so petitions Obama has received , making him slightly more merciful than Richard Nixon by that measure. That nevertheless would represent a huge improvement from where Obama stood just six months ago. 
Any time the state admits it was wrong, and innocent people are freed from their cages of oppression; it’s a win for freedom. If one life is spared the horrid fate of being caged like an animal for possessing or ingesting a plant that grows from the ground, this is good news. 
However, there are tens of thousands of non-violent drug offenders locked in steel cages across this country, many of them are in for possession alone. The slow and rusty cogs of the bureaucratic leviathan can’t turn fast enough. For every non-violent drug offender the president frees, five more are thrown in. Why? Locking up drug users has proven to be quite the profitable venture. 
It is much easier to walk out on the street corner and shakedown a teenager who may have an illegal plant in his pocket than it is to examine the evidence in a rape or murder case. The so-called “Private” Prisons know this and have subsequently found their niche in this immoral war on drugs. 
The term Private Prison is a farce from the get-go. 
A truly Private prison would not be solely funded by taxpayer dollars. These Private prisons are nothing more than a fascist mixture of state and corporate, completely dependent upon the extortion factor of the state, i.e., taxation, as a means of their corporate sustenance. 
A truly Private prison would have a negative incentive to boost its population for the simple fact that it is particularly expensive to house inmates. On the contrary, these fascist, or more aptly, corporatist prisons contractually require occupancy rates of 95%-100%. 
The requirement for a 95% occupancy rate creates a de facto demand for criminals. Think about that for a second; a need or demand for people to commit crimes is created by this corporatist arrangement. The implications associated with demanding people commit crimes are horrifying. 
Creating a completely immoral demand for “criminals” leads to the situation in which we find ourselves today. People, who are otherwise entirely innocent, are labeled as criminals for their personal choices and thrown in cages. We are now witnessing a vicious cycle between law enforcement, who must create and arrest criminals, and the corporatist prison system that constantly demands more prisoners. The police and prison corporations know that without the war on drugs, this windfall of money, cars, and houses — ceases to exist. 
If you want to know who profits from ruining lives and throwing marijuana users in cages, we need only look at who bribes (also known as lobbies) the politicians to keep the war on drugs alive. 
Below is a list of the top five industries who need you locked in a cage for possessing a plant in order to ensure their job security. Police Unions: Coming in as the number one contributor to politicians for their votes to lock you in a cage for a plant are the police themselves. They risk taking massive pay cuts and losing all their expensive militarized toys without the war on drugs. Private Prison Corporations: No surprise here . The corporatist prison lobby is constantly pushing for stricter laws to keep their stream of tax dollars flowing. Alcohol and Beer Companies: These giant corporations hate competition, so why not pay millions to keep a cheaper and far safer alcohol alternative off the market? Pharmaceutical Corporations: The hypocrisy of marijuana remaining a Schedule 1 drug, “No Medical Use Whatsoever,” seems criminal when considering that pharmaceutical companies reproduce a chemical version of THC and are able to market and sell it as such. Ever hear of Marinol? Big pharma simply uses the force of the state to legislate out their competition ; which happens to be nature. Prison Guard Unions: The prison guard union s are another group, so scared of losing their jobs, that they would rather see thousands of non-violent and morally innocent people thrown into cages, than look for another job. 
What does it say about a society who’s resolute in enacting violence against their fellow human so they can have a job to go to in the morning? 
The person who wants to ingest a substance for medical or recreational reasons is not the criminal. However, the person that would kidnap, cage, or kill someone because they have a different lifestyle is a villain on many fronts. When does this vicious cycle end? 
The good news is that the drug war’s days are numbered, especially seeing that it’s reached the White House, and they are taking action, even if it is symbolic. Evidence of this is everywhere. States are defying the federal government and refusing to lock people in cages for marijuana. Colorado and Washington served as a catalyst in a seemingly exponential awakening to the government’s immoral war. 
Following suit were Oregon, D.C., and Alaska. Medical marijuana initiatives are becoming a constant part of legislative debates nationwide. We’ve even seen bills that would not only completely legalize marijuana but deregulate it entirely, like corn. 
As more and more states refuse to kidnap and cage marijuana users, the drug war will continue to implode. We must be resilient in this fight. 
If doing drugs bothers you, don’t do drugs. When you transition from holding an opinion — to using government violence to enforce your personal preference, you become the bad guy. Don’t be the bad guy. Matt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

4458,When a Senator Passes Judgment on a Chief Justice - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The other day, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, decided to lecture Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Senate Republicans, Mr. Grassley said, were not to blame for the partisan deadlock over President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. The real culprits? The chief justice and his colleagues. Mr. Grassley’s   delivered on the Senate floor, was in response to an analysis in this column last month of the chief justice’s stance as Senate Republicans refuse to consider the nomination. Chief Justice Roberts has said, for instance, that partisan confirmation hearings feed a false public perception that justices cast their votes “as Democrats and Republicans,” rather than as neutral arbiters of the law. Mr. Grassley offered a different take. “The chief justice has it exactly backwards,” he said. “The confirmation process doesn’t make the justices appear political. The confirmation process has gotten political precisely because the court has drifted from the constitutional text and rendered decisions based instead on policy preferences. ” “Physician, heal thyself,” Mr. Grassley told the chief justice. Mr. Grassley did not list the decisions that troubled him. But he did say that only two members of the court, presumably Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. “stick to the constitutional text and vote in a consistently conservative way. ” Mr. Grassley’s logic, if that is the right word, was that conservative decisions are apolitical but that liberal ones are partisan. As for Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. Grassley said, “a number of his votes have reflected political considerations, not legal ones. ” Again, the senator did not say which votes he was talking about, but they probably included ones rejecting challenges to the Affordable Care Act. Chief Justice Roberts has said that the president’s two previous nominees, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were “extremely well qualified for the court. ” Yet they were confirmed almost strictly along party lines, he said in remarks in Boston 10 days before Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13. “That doesn’t make any sense,” Chief Justice Roberts said. “That suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees. ” There is truth on both sides, said Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. “I think Grassley may be right,” she said, “to blame the court for the increasing role of ideology, as opposed to qualifications and other factors, in Senate confirmation proceedings. ” She added that politics had played a significant role in Supreme Court decisions since at least the 1950s. “But Chief Justice Roberts is also right,” Professor Epstein said. “Political science research shows that Americans are less likely to support the court when it is portrayed as a political body  —   as it is during confirmation proceedings  —   and not a legal body. ” Chief Justice Roberts has said nothing in public about the confirmation process since Justice Scalia died. He has been silent on the nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland. Mr. Grassley’s remarks, made on April 5, seemed calculated to make sure that Chief Justice Roberts stays quiet notwithstanding exhortations from constitutional scholars that he speak up. “That’s a political temptation that the chief justice should resist,” Mr. Grassley said. But there is precedent for measured intervention by a chief justice in a clash over the nature and future of the Supreme Court. Consider another chief justice’s response to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s   plan. In 1937, unhappy with Supreme Court decisions striking down New Deal programs, Roosevelt announced a plan to add justices, saying the current ones were overworked. The plan was defeated after a letter from Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes to the Senate rebutted Roosevelt’s charges in mild language backed by detailed figures. “The present number of justices,” Chief Justice Hughes wrote, “is thought to be large enough so far as the prompt, adequate and efficient conduct of the work of the court is concerned. ” Chief Justice Roberts may also have views about whether the present number of justices on his court  —   eight  —   is adequate. He certainly admires Chief Justice Hughes, as he made plain in remarks in November at New York University’s law school. “One of the greatest crises facing the Supreme Court since Marbury v. Madison was F. D. R. ’s   plan,” Chief Justice Roberts said, “and it fell to Hughes to guide a very unpopular Supreme Court through that   showdown against America’s most popular president since George Washington. ” “There are things to learn from it,” Chief Justice Roberts said. James F. Simon, the author of “F. D. R. and Chief Justice Hughes,” said he saw parallels between the two historical moments. “I think Hughes would have been frustrated and annoyed by the present Senate Republicans’ vow to ignore their constitutional obligation to consider Garland’s nomination,” Mr. Simon said. “I suspect that Roberts shares those feelings. Both Hughes and Roberts put great value in protecting the court’s integrity. ” The key difference, Mr. Simon said, is that senators had asked for Chief Justice Hughes’s views. “Should the Senate Judiciary Committee make a similar request to Roberts, I think he would probably respond, giving a carefully worded nudge to the committee to consider Garland,” Mr. Simon said. “But I don’t see Grassley reaching out to the chief justice. ”",0
4459,Why Dakota Is the New Keystone,"License DMCA 
MIDDLEBURY, Vt. -- The Native Americans who have spent the last months in peaceful protest against an oil pipeline along the banks of the Missouri are standing up for tribal rights. They're also standing up for clean water, environmental justice and a working climate. And it's time that everyone else joined in. 
The shocking images of the National Guard destroying tepees and sweat lodges and arresting elders this week remind us that the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline is part of the longest-running drama in American history -- the United States Army versus Native Americans. In the past, it's almost always ended horribly, and nothing we can do now will erase a history of massacres, stolen land and broken treaties. But this time, it can end differently. 
Those heroes on the Standing Rock reservation, sometimes on horseback, have peacefully stood up to police dogs, pepper spray and the bizarre-looking militarized tanks and SWAT teams that are the stuff of modern policing. (Modern and old-fashioned both: The pictures of German shepherds attacking are all too reminiscent of photos from, say, Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.) 
The courage of those protesters managed to move the White House enough that the government called a temporary halt to construction. But the forces that want it finished -- Big Oil, and its allies in parts of the labor movement -- are strong enough that the respite may be temporary. 
In coming weeks, activists will respond to calls from the leaders at Standing Rock by gathering at the offices of banks funding the pipeline, and at the offices of the Army Corps of Engineers, for protest and civil disobedience. Two dozen big banks have lent money to the pipeline project, even though many of them have also adopted elaborate environmental codes . As for the Corps, that's the agency that helped ""expedite"" the approval of the pipeline -- and must still grant the final few permits. The vast movement of people across the country who mobilized to block fossil-fuel projects like the Keystone pipeline and Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic need to gather once more. This time, their message must be broader still. - Advertisement - 
There are at least two grounds for demanding a full environmental review of this pipeline, instead of the fast-track approvals it has received so far. The first is the obvious environmental racism of the whole project. 
Originally, the pipeline was supposed to cross the Missouri just north of Bismarck , until people pointed out that a leak there would threaten the drinking water supply for North Dakota's second biggest city. The solution, in keeping with American history, was obvious: make the crossing instead just above the Standing Rock reservation, where the poverty rate is nearly three times the national average. This has been like watching the start of another Flint, Mich., except with a chance to stop it. 
The second is that this is precisely the kind of project that climate science tells us can no longer be tolerated. In midsummer, the Obama administration promised that henceforth there would be a climate test for new projects before they could be approved. That promise was codified in the Democratic platform approved by Hillary Clinton's campaign, which says there will be no federal approval for any project that ""significantly exacerbates"" global warming. 
The review of the Dakota pipeline must take both cases into account. 
So far, the signs are not good. There has been no word from the White House about how long the current pause will last. Now, the company building the pipeline has pushed the local authorities to remove protesters from land where construction has already desecrated indigenous burial sites, with law enforcement agents using Tasers, batons, mace and ""sound cannons."" - Advertisement - 
From the Clinton campaign, there's been simply an ugly silence, perhaps rooted in an unwillingness to cross major contributors like the Laborers' International Union of North America , which has lashed out against the many other, larger unions that oppose the project. But that silence won't make the issue go away: Sioux protesters erected a tepee in her Brooklyn campaign office on Thursday. If Mrs. Clinton is elected on Nov. 8, this will be the new president's first test on environmental and human rights. 
What's happening along the Missouri is of historic consequence. That message should reverberate not just on the lonely high plains, but in our biggest cities, too. Native Americans have carried the fight, but they deserve backup from everyone with a conscience; other activists should join the protest at bank headquarters, Army Corps offices and other sites of entrenched power. 
The Native Americans are the only people who have inhabited this continent in harmony with nature for centuries. Their traditional wisdom now chimes perfectly with the latest climate science. The only thing missing are the bodies of the rest of us joining in their protest. If we use them wisely, a fresh start is possible.

4460,Glazer & Moynihan’s Beyond the Melting Pot,"Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
Beyond the Melting Pot, 2nd Edition 
Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1970. 
Beyond the Melting Pot: The Negroes, Puerto Ricans, Jews, Italians and Irish of New York City was written in 1963 and revised in 1970, but its critique of American assimilation mythology is as relevant as ever. Co-authors (((Nathan Glazer))) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan note that the term âmelting potâ itself was popularized by the London-born Russian Jew (((Israel Zangwill))), who in his play of the same name wrote: 
âAmerica is Godâs Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reformingâŚ Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians â into the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.â 
What should surprise literally no one familiar with Hebrew duplicity is that (((Zangwill))) himself was a zionist, that is to say he wanted a territorial nation-state for Jewish people established somewhere in the world (and preferably with few extant inhabitants, which is why he opposed the choice of Palestine). It would appear then that (((Zangwill))) did not really believe in his melting pot in a universal sense. And neither do the authors of Beyond the Melting Pot, who describe 1960s New York as a very identitarian place, one of both conflicting and allied power-blocs rooted in ethnic affinities. One may be left wondering if any âAmericansâ even lived in New York apart from a trickle of WASP transplants, given how the co-authors slice what were the cityâs five largest ethnic groups. They literally have an entire section dedicated to naming the Jew, who at the time populated a fourth of the city. Is that America? Will it become America? 
And now to burst your bubble. (((Glazer))) and Moynihan were both liberals and sociologists, though contemporary liberals and sociologists would probably hate them. (((Glazer))) was a staunch anti-communist (and sometimes even labelled a neoconservative), while Moynihan was infamous for a report he put together while Assistant Secretary of Labor that criticized dindu family structure (high rates of bastardy) and was skeptical of providing welfare to single mothers (a toxic incentive). Critics accused the so-called Moynihan Report of âblaming the victim,â a leftist retort that has since become increasingly common. While he was the 12th American ambassador to the United Nations, Moynihan gave a speech before the General Assembly denouncing a resolution which had declared zionism to be a form of âracism.â Not very endearing for the current year. And while a senator in the 1980s, he predicted that ethnic nationalism and the slumping economy of the Soviet Union would become existential threats to communism in Eastern Europe, and criticized Reaganâs overhyped fears of its expansion. The co-authors of Beyond the Melting Pot were clearly liberals of an older stock than one is used to reading. 
And that more than anything else is what makes this book so fascinating. Beyond the Melting Pot tells us a lot of things we on the Alt-Right already know, but the writers are not on our side. It tells us about the alliance between elite WASPs, Jews, and blacks in politics. It tells us how Jews have been heavily involved in liberalism, socialism, labor movements, psychology, higher education, government and politics, and the civil rights movement relative to their size, and how almost all of American Jewry traces through New York. It tells us how Jews didnât want religion added to the US Census because they didnât want anti-semites to be able to track their numbers or influence. It tells us how liberals donât view âWhite Americansâ as an identity group but are willing to concede that, say, Irish, Italian, or Polish people exist. It tells us how earlier Northern European migrants such as Scots, Welsh, Dutch, Germans, and Scandinavians had a much easier time assimilating into an (Anglo) American identity and losing their old ethnic consciousness. It tells us that blacks and Hispanics use the most welfare per capita and are less industrious than Whites and Jews, in addition to having very different family structures. It tells us that White Catholics have produced very little intelligentsia in New York and the United States despite their large share of the population (though your author is part of an aspiring post-Catholic intelligentsia). 
I am not deducing these or gleaning these points from the text. They are the text. This is what a sociology book on the ethnography of New York written by a pair of older school liberal academics has to say. 
Perhaps most surprising is the co-authorsâ stance that there are positive elements to the formation and existence of ethnic communities and neighborhoods, and that the government should not try to destroy such communities through aggressive integration programs. To some extent, this is just realism regarding the conditions of New York. It is purely descriptive, then and now, to say that ethnic neighborhoods exist where one group predominates. But even that is refreshing coming from authors of the left, for whom it is so often the case that race and ethnicity are social constructs and therefore neither real nor of value. It is further than that even, as (((Glazer))) and Moynihan do not merely recognize identity-based communities exist, but suggest they are beneficial in some ways and not necessarily products of âracism.â Can you imagine the Department of Housing and Urban Development suggesting that âsegregated communitiesâ are not âracist,â and that the government doesnât need to break them up in the name of integration? What would Julian Castro do? 
(((Glazer))) and Moynihan do believe in the false idols of equality and integration, but they arenât totally stupid about it. They know that building (implicitly Afro-Latino) public housing in a middle-class neighborhood always triggers White flight once the colored population hits critical mass, and results in ethnic succession rather than integration. They donât have radical solutions for tackling the structural problems of ethnic diversity in a society. They tend towards gradual economic improvement as the solution, but as we all know, the United States by and large for most people is not a land of social mobility anymore, nor is it one where you can magically uplift radically different biocultural groups by pouring money into them. 
What you get from a book like Beyond the Melting Pot is a real Rorschach test of what you are already primed to find evidence for. If you already knew Americans voted in identitarian blocs, then you now know that it is nothing new. If you already knew some immigrants assimilate better than others into mainline American culture (or the regional culture of the area they move to), then you now know that it is nothing new. If youâve already read Culture of Critique and knew about the involvement of overseas Israelis in leftist agitation and the institutional long march, then you now know that it is nothing new (and moreover that when Jews write about it, it is considered non-controversial). 
Ultimately, I would recommend Beyond the Melting Pot as a companion text. On its own, it is really just a general interest book with no application beyond 1960s New York City. In conjunction with other literature , it becomes much more illuminating.",0
4461,Hillary Clinton Warns That Donald Trump’s ‘Thin Skin’ Would Set Off War or Economic Crisis - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton delivered a lacerating rebuke on Thursday of her likely Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, declaring that he was hopelessly unprepared and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief. Electing him, she said, would be a “historic mistake. ” Speaking in a steady, modulated tone but lobbing some of the most fiery lines of her presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton painted Mr. Trump as a reckless, childish and uninformed amateur who was playing at the game of global statecraft. “This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,” she said, “because it’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign had grappled for weeks over how to handle Mr. Trump, seemed to find her footing as she addressed an audience in San Diego that laughed and cheered as she deconstructed Mr. Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements. They were, she said, “not even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies. ” The speech, which mixed biting sarcasm and somber assessments of the foreign crises of the Obama years, unfurled what is likely to be the core argument that Mrs. Clinton will carry into the general election. Her remarks were billed as a major foreign policy address, and she was flanked by a row of 19 American flags as majestic as those that often back Mr. Trump at his public events. Yet the speech was devoid of new policy prescriptions, and she skipped over difficult episodes during her tenure as secretary of state, including the NATO intervention in Libya and its bloody aftermath in Benghazi. Instead she borrowed a tactic from President Obama, reeling off zingers that are catnip to   channels. It won her the kind of sustained live coverage that Mr. Trump has enjoyed routinely but Mrs. Clinton has not, though the announcement by Speaker Paul D. Ryan that he planned to vote for Mr. Trump stole her thunder in the opening moments of the   address. She said she imagined Mr. Trump was “composing nasty tweets” about her even as she spoke. And indeed he was: “Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!” Mr. Trump wrote. “Reading poorly from the teleprompter! She doesn’t even look presidential. ” But Mrs. Clinton sought to turn Mr. Trump’s prolific Twitter habit into an additional bullet point demonstrating that he was “unfit” for the presidency, as she put it. She twice referred to the scene in the White House Situation Room where as secretary of state, she advised Mr. Obama on the raid on a compound in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. “Imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room, making    decisions on behalf of the United States,” Mrs. Clinton said, eliciting cries of “No!” from her audience. “Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he’s angry, but America’s entire arsenal. ” In an interview with The New York Times during Mrs. Clinton’s speech, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton’s performance was “terrible” and “pathetic. ” He added: “I’m not   at all. I’m the opposite of  . ” For Mrs. Clinton, whose formal speeches tend to be earnest and laden with policy prescriptions, it was a striking departure  —   a rollicking political indictment that doubled as Mrs. Clinton’s first   response to Mr. Trump’s drumbeat of criticism about her ethics and judgment during a   in public life. The speech came after weeks of study by Clinton aides to determine which attacks by Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals had not worked. It was studded with punch lines: Mr. Trump “doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about,” Mrs. Clinton said at one point. “Donald doesn’t see the complexity,” she said at another. “This isn’t reality television,” she said of a Trump presidency. “This is actual reality. ” After her campaign had initially issued a tepid response to Mr. Trump’s proposal of defaulting on the national debt, calling the idea “risky,” Mrs. Clinton said Thursday that such action would lead to “an economic catastrophe. ” “He believes we can treat the U. S. economy like one of his casinos,” she said. The speech was roughly 10 days in the making and written by Mrs. Clinton’s speechwriters, Dan Schwerin and Megan Rooney, and top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, with outside advisers including Mr. Obama’s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, reviewing a late draft. Ms. Rooney, a former State Department speechwriter, was perched on the arm of Mrs. Clinton’s chair on a flight from Boston to San Diego on Wednesday night, making revisions on her laptop and making sure the lines echoed Mrs. Clinton’s sardonic humor. The address was a meaty rebuttal to Democrats who had expressed concern that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign lacked gumption in going after Mr. Trump, particularly because Mr. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have relished opportunities to skewer him. By turns mocking and stern, Mrs. Clinton derided Mr. Trump for suggesting that Japan should acquire nuclear weapons to deter North Korea, that the United States should have walked away from the nuclear deal with Iran, and that “maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS. ” “He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia,” Mrs. Clinton said. “And to top it off, he believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a ‘  country. ’” In vivid strokes, Mrs. Clinton framed not just her case against Mr. Trump but the broader   debate in the election: She cast herself as the defender of an   world order against an insurgent who did not understand, let alone respect, the network of alliances the United States constructed after World War II to safeguard its interests. Mrs. Clinton presented herself as a   commander in chief, a fervent believer in America as an exceptional country, tested by her time in the Situation Room. She highlighted her ability to go “toe to toe” with leaders in Beijing and Moscow, contrasting that with what she said was Mr. Trump’s “bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America. ” “I’ll leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants,” she said. “I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America’s real friends are. ” Even as she excoriated Mr. Trump, Mrs. Clinton kept a close eye on domestic politics. She noted, for example, that she understood the deep qualms that voters had with trade deals. Still, Mr. Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Mrs. Clinton said, would set off a trade war of the kind that deepened the Great Depression in the 1930s. Mrs. Clinton recited a handful of highlights from her time at the State Department, including her role in brokering a   between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in 2012 and rallying the world to impose sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program. But she failed to flesh out her proposals for dealing with the Islamic State or the civil war in Syria. To Mrs. Clinton, such policy details were not as important as the    differences between her and Mr. Trump. “He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists, even though those are war crimes,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He says he doesn’t have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has, quote, ‘a very good brain. ’” “He also said, ‘I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.’ You know what?” she continued. “I don’t believe him. ” Mrs. Clinton ended her remarks on a more solemn note, arguing that Mr. Trump’s proposals, like barring Muslims from entering the United States, “could fuel an ugly narrative about who we are. ” Mr. Trump, she said, would undo decades of statecraft by Republicans and Democrats. Striking a bipartisan note, Mrs. Clinton recalled an advertisement Mr. Trump took out in newspapers in 1987, during the Reagan administration, “saying that America lacked a backbone and that the world was, you guessed it, laughing at us. ” “You’ve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our president,” she said.",0
4462,Is Bottom In For The Latest Gold Market Paper Attack?,"Financial Markets , Gold , Market Manipulation , Precious Metals , U.S. Economy Comex , LBMA , silver , silver eagles admin 
The move by Modi to eliminate large-denomination cash bills from India has set off an unanticipated physical gold buying frenzy that has driven Indian ex-duty import premiums in the mid-$30’s. It’s the widest I’ve seen in them in the many years I’ve been tracking that data (via John Brimelow’s Gold Jottings report). “”I’m getting non-stop calls from unknown numbers from people asking for gold,” the jeweller told a Reuters reporter in an interview inside his shuttered showroom..” 
Ditto for China. The SGE premium last night was $12.59 to spot gold. As Brimelow describes: “In this case the high premiums probably simply reflect capacity constraints among Chinese import dealers. Possibly there is a Trump/devaluation effect boosting local appetite, besides of course the price decline.” 
My personal view is that, given the extreme amount of paper being launched at the LBMA and Comex right now, and given that the price of gold seems averse to going any lower (at least for now), the worst of the beat-down is over. Too many people are looking “down” right now…Eric Dubin has also called a “double bottom in gold.” He and Jason discussed the precious metals market, among many other topics in their lates Welcome to Dystopia episode, which you can access here: The Bottom Is In.",0
4463,Exclusive—Tuesday Group Co-chairman MacArthur on Lessons Learned from AHCA: Include All Members,"Tuesday Group   Tom MacArthur ( ) told Breitbart News that House leadership should include more members in the process for drafting legislation, saying, “It’s important that we include all members. ”[Congressman Tom MacArthur brokered a deal with Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows ( ) that assembled enough votes to pass a health care overhaul package through the House. The deal, known as the MacArthur amendment, would allow states to obtain waivers to eliminate Obamacare regulations such as essential health benefits and community ratings, regulations that MacArthur argues drive up the cost of premiums and deductibles.  The previous version of AHCA failed to garner enough support after Speaker Paul Ryan drafted the bill with little input from    members of the House. The bill also retained many aspects of Obamacare. Critics dubbed the previous version of the American Health Care Act, “ ” and “Ryancare. ” Congressman MacArthur told Breitbart News that he was relieved to see the bill pass through Congress and that this bill will lower premiums. He said: I’m glad we got it through. I think it’s really necessary that we at least start moving forward on a fix for the health care system before it collapses further. I’ve been careful since yesterday, I don’t want to get too much into cheering as I watch the Democrats jeering and I think that’s inappropriate. We got to remember there’s a lot of Americans that are scared right now because they don’t understand what was done. You know, they’ve been listening to tens of millions of dollars worth of paid lies that tried to instill people’s fears. I’m going to try to help people at home and across the country, they need to understand this will help them, not hurt them. It will help those with   conditions but also bring costs down for the rest of the country. People are struggling across the country to pay for health insurance and decide to go without. Obamacare failed. While it covered a lot more people, it failed to do it in a sustainable way, and it failed to do it in a way that did not hurt millions of other people. I think we have to help the American people understand and that’s my focus right now. The Tuesday Group   explained the process by which he and the Freedom Caucus chairman brokered a deal on the health care bill. MacArthur shared: Well, it came about because the week before the Easter break, there were attempts to bridge this divide between what the Freedom Caucus pushed and what the   Republicans wanted. When it collapsed, I really thought it was a lost opportunity, I really saw us much closer than what was being acknowledged. And what I admired about the what the Freedom Caucus was pushing for is in my view that they rightfully recognized that if we didn’t change the regulations, if we didn’t give the states any flexibility there was simply no way they could bring costs down. That’s part of the problem, everyone is talking about   conditions and protecting people, but we have to bring costs down. In any event, we went home over recess, and I couldn’t get it out of my mind, so I started crafting an amendment to give states the flexibility to handle the most costly parts of Obamacare. I took it to the Speaker, who thought that it had potential and asked me to speak to Mark [Meadows] and you know Mark and I were getting to know each other before we left to go on the break. We often huddled together on the floor to discuss ideas, I like him and I know there’s a lot of noise about the Freedom Caucus but what I like about them is that they’re focused on policy. They’re not just focused on the politics of what we do they’re trying to get it right. I don’t find it impossible to work with them at all. So Mark and I started talking over the break about my amendment, and he told me what mattered to his group and made some changes to it, and we actually agreed with each other on the solution. I went ahead and proposed it with the hope that he would get more of his guys to join. He said to me all along that this is far from what they want, his group wanted a full repeal of Title I. I guess they realized that this is the furthest they could get at this point. Tom MacArthur said that he coordinated with the president, vice president, and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus during the health care negotiation. He recounted: I frequently spoke with the Vice President throughout the process. Moreover, Reince and I spoke throughout the recess, but the Vice President was the person I spoke with the most. I spoke with the President a number of times as well. I spoke with the Speaker’s health care staffer, Matt Hoffman, who gave us technical advice and spoke with the Energy and Commerce staff to help draft this legislation. The Vice President was checking in fairly regularly, I think that he has clearly been very interested in this whole process. MacArthur continued, telling Breitbart News that by incorporating more    members into the legislative process, they can avoid more missteps in the House. He said: I think that one clear lesson on any significant legislation we have to leave plenty of time, open ended time, and make sure we get to a real consensus that people can vote on. It’s important that we include all members, the committee especially needs to be involved, but I think there’s a number of people that need input that are not on the committee and sometimes that’s necessary even. I’m glad I could play that role on this bill. MacArthur believes that passing tax reform will go smoother than passing a health care overhaul. The New Jersey congressman told Breitbart News: I hope tax reform goes more smoothly. I think tax reform in some regards is an easier lift, it’s not as visceral as health care, it’s not as emotional as health care. You know with health care you get people Jimmy Kimmel on air who tell a   story and makes people feel that our bill must be bad. I don’t think you’re going to get those types of stories out of tax reform. I think that should help cooler heads prevail. We’re doing a repeal and replace of   and I don’t think that will have the same sort of emotional intensity either. “We passed the Financial Choice Act out of committee yesterday. It repeals the Volcker Rule, it reigns in the CFPB, and I think that it will help community banks prosper. I voted quite happily for the Choice Act,” he added. At the White House press briefing on Thursday, MacArthur said we should put “people over politics. ” MacArthur elaborated on that sentiment, telling Breitbart News: I think that it’s very important for the Republican party and for people to know that we’re not just celebrating a political win. We’re doing what we believe will fix the health care system. A lot of people are just not aware of what’s going on. Insurers are leaving in droves. Premiums and deductibles are soaring, and people are not able to afford insurance. I think when the Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act I don’t think they thought about whether or not it will last, they thought that if it fails then the government will just take over and I think that was a perfectly acceptable outcome for them. It’s not an acceptable outcome to have another segment of health care taken over by the government. All you’ll have is bureaucrats deciding how much coverage you get, how many hospitals get paid, how much doctors get paid, you’ll have bureaucrats deciding how long you’ll have to recover from a knee surgery. That is not how America works. America thrives best when we have insurers competing with each other and offering the best products and putting pressure on insurers to lower costs when health care providers work with insurers to make sure costs are reined in. That’s when we’re going to have the best outcomes. The idea that we’re just going to have a   system is not good for America. Democrats alleged that this health care overhaul will eliminate protections for patients with   conditions. MacArthur explained how Democrats deceived the public on the issue of   conditions: The other side has spent too much time speaking to people’s emotions and misstating the facts.   For example, with   conditions the bill could not be more explicit that insurers cannot discriminate, they can’t deny coverage, they can’t deny renewals, they can’t health rate someone who’s sick in the middle of being insured. If you get sick, your health rates don’t skyrocket. What it does say is that if you don’t maintain coverage for more than 63 days, you will pay an extra premium. However, states can request a waiver to look at those people, but they have to create a risk pool to ensure that the neediest amongst are not left behind. It balances to make sure people don’t skip out on buying health insurance when they get sick. That’s not fair to the rest of the American people. That’s like not buying home owner’s insurance until your house floods. I think we struck the right balance and caring for the vulnerable and providing a significant amount of money for caring for the needy, we provided $138 billion dollars for   pools. This is the individual and small group market which is 7 percent of the population, so you’re talking about within that 7 percent of people with   conditions, and now you’re talking about people within that market that don’t maintain health insurance coverage. That’s who the $138 billion   pool applies to.  The idea that we haven’t invested in enough money is simply ludicrous, and it’s a deception that the mainstream media is complicit in and the left is pushing. That’s not the truth. If we don’t fix this, people with   conditions will have nothing. They’re insurance market will collapse. Critics attacked House Republicans for a provision in AHCA that would allow for Congress and their staff to be exempt from changes to Obamacare regulations. MacArthur said they never meant to retain that rule, and that House Republicans passed a bill that would eliminate that provision. MacArthur admitted, “That was our intention, the reality that the House has to write its legislation in a way that is consistent with the Senate’s rules and we would have to go back into this issue in a separate piece of legislation which I cosponsored. I voted on this bill before we voted on the American Health Care Act. By the time we voted on ACHA, we already voted on another standalone bill to mandate that Congress and our staff are covered by the same provision. ” MacArthur told Breitbart News about his experience working with Frederick Trump, President Donald Trump’s father. He recounted: I worked with him even before I became the CEO of York when I was a young manager. In the 80’s and in the 90’s I handled Fred’s insurance, and he had thousands of properties in Brooklyn. He had a retention which meant that he kept a certain amount of the risk himself per claim. He kept quite a bit of them himself, which meant that we would have to work with him to settle claims. He was very detail oriented. So every few weeks I would have to go out to Brooklyn and go out to Fred’s car and would drive around Fred’s property.  I would watch him interreact with his employees and his tenants, and he clearly cared about his tenants and you know they were   apartments but he wanted them to be neat and clean and safe for his tenants, and I like him, I liked the way he interacted with people. MacArthur added, “He was very careful with his money. I always enjoyed working with him. He was stern but always had a good sense of humor. ”",0

In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort.
Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did.
In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities.
He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars.
He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation.
Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money.

4465,Arrests for Cannabis Possession Outnumber Arrests for All Violent Crimes Combined,"Waking Times 
As the U.S. government continues to fight its futile war on drugs , marijuana possession arrests have now become more common than all other crimes combined , according to a new report focused on showing the human toll of criminalizing drug use and published by Human Rights Watch ( HRW.org ). 
The war on drugs in the U.S. is a palpable failure. Drug-possession arrests more than doubled between 1979 and 2016. The prison population now includes more than half a million Americans jailed for drug offenses , in comparison to only 41,000 in 1980. Over the last four decades, the war on drugs has restricted individual rights and created an environment of violence and inequality, but it has done almost nothing to solve the problems associated with drug abuse. 
“Evaluations of specific tactics, such as raids on crack houses and crackdowns, suggest that their effects on drug availability are minimal, decay rapidly, and may displace drug activity to other areas and increase drug-related violence.” ~ 2016 study published in by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, entitled War on Drugs Policing and Police Brutality Shocking Rise in Cannabis Possession Arrests 
Despite the ongoing war, cannabis usage is becoming more acceptable and even legal, proving that opinion and policy vary wildly. In fact, a study conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that the number of Americans who use marijuana has doubled from 2001-02 to 2012-13. The 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that over 22 million Americans use the plant either for medical purposes and/or recreationally. 
Americans have become accepting of cannabis, even though it is still illegal under federal U.S. law. Over the last decade, immense amount of research has shown the medical benefits of the cannabis plant . Legalization of the plant in several U.S. states has demonstrated that it is not a threat to public safety. It seems that the most dangerous aspect of cannabis use is the possibility of police confrontation, arrest and incarceration. 
Regardless of the trends showing an increase in cannabis popularity, the report by HRW.org found that policing of marijuana-possession laws continues to be quite aggressive when compared to the enforcement of other laws. 
“Despite shifting public opinion, in 2015, nearly half of all drug possession arrests (over 574,000) were for marijuana possession. By comparison, there were 505,681 arrests for violent crimes (which the FBI defines as murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault). This means that police made more arrests for simple marijuana possession than for all violent crimes combined.” 
Through the evaluation of court data for the state of Texas, HRW discovered that many of those prosecuted “were prosecuted for small quantities of drugs—in some cases, fractions of a gram—that were clearly for personal use.” Other sources reveal that 8 in 10 drug arrests in 2013 were for drug possession rather than sale and manufacturing. Drug Crimes and Prisons 
Every 25 seconds, someone in the U.S. is arrested for drug use or possession. More than one of nine arrests by state law enforcement are for drug possession, amounting to more than 1.25 million arrests per year. 
As a result of this aggressive enforcement of drug laws, on any given day at least 137,000 people sit in local and state jails on drug possession charges awaiting their day in court. Drug possession offenders in general will soon make up 25% of the prison population. Because federal law mandates a sentence of life without parole for anyone whose third strike is a federal crime (such as drug possession and, in many states, marijuana possession), 10 times as many third-strikers are serving time for drug possession as a second-degree murder. 
It’s clear that people from all demographics wish to have safe access to cannabis , both for recreational purposes as well as for a growing list of medical benefits. While access opens up in U.S. states where legalization continues to gain steam, safe access to cannabis is still an issue for many, which is why people are creating businesses like Buy Weed Online Canada , and until the government fully decriminalizes cannabis, our prison system, court system and police forces will continue to be bogged down with the persecution and prosecution of non-violent offenders.

4466,$7 Million in Donations to Go Directly to Orlando Kin and Survivors - The New York Times,"ORLANDO, Fla.  —   The city announced Friday that the $7 million it collected after the nightclub shooting would be given directly to family members and survivors instead of being distributed through charities and nonprofit groups. The change was necessary, Mayor Buddy Dyer said, because survivors of the nightclub attack and relatives needed help immediately with expenses like rent and groceries. “We are working through exactly the way they are going to do that,” Mr. Dyer said. “The most important thing is to do it right, do it transparently and make sure our funders are comfortable with how we are doing this. ” A charitable and advocacy organization, the National Center for Victims of Crime, which is based in Washington, had criticized Orlando’s plan to distribute money via nonprofits, saying that too little money donated in that manner had made its way to victims and their families after similar tragedies. Of the $7 million collected for the OneOrlando fund, Mr. Dyer said, $6. 5 million came from corporations. With the move, Orlando is the latest to shift away from established charities and opt for direct donations, a move that has become increasingly common, in part because of questions about how some charities use donations. The shooting early Sunday at Pulse, a gay nightclub, left 49 people dead and more than 50 wounded. The gunman, Omar Mateen, 29, claimed allegiance to the Islamic State during a phone call to the authorities in the midst of the attack. Mr. Mateen was killed in a gunfight. Here in Orlando, the families of victims are already receiving help with funerals and airfare, Mr. Dyer said. In Puerto Rico, a representative of the governor’s office said each family was receiving $7, 500 to bury loved ones. Mr. Dyer made the announcement at the Camping World Stadium, once known as the Citrus Bowl, where 35 agencies have set up to offer services to the family members. Already 94 families and 256 people have received help, Mr. Dyer said. The city has also established a board led by Alex Martins, chief executive of the Orlando Magic basketball team, to develop a plan to distribute the money. The outpouring for Orlando has raised millions through traditional charities and online campaigns, including through crowdfunding websites. On one such site, GoFundMe, more than 300 campaigns have raised $6. 2 million, including $5. 2 million by Equality Florida, an advocacy group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, a GoFundMe spokesman, Dan Pfeiffer, said. “There is a real power to being able to give to an individual story and being able to follow that story,” Mr. Pfeiffer said. “It is the power of those individual stories. ” Charity officials said the individual campaigns were also a reflection of the public’s concern that their donations get to the people for which they were intended. After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, the American Red Cross came under intense criticism for collecting millions of dollars in the name of the victims and then making plans to use the money elsewhere. Eventually, the Red Cross agreed to use all of its $543 million Liberty Disaster Fund to assist those affected by the attacks. Specialists in charitable giving said Orlando’s decision could alter how local governments handle the sudden outpouring of money from the public after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and mass shootings like the one in Newtown, Conn. “There have been so many scandals we’ve seen after these sorts of situations, so it is a big deal that they’ve bypassed nonprofits because it shows a distrust in how nonprofits are doing things,” said Stacy Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. “This sends a big message, too, because other cities might decide to use this as a model in the future. ” Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said Friday that the group, as well as some family members, had told city officials that they feared donations from OneOrlando would not get to victims if a traditional nonprofit was placed in charge. The organization founded a charity, the National Compassion Fund, in 2014, to ensure that donations made after tragedies go to victims. The group has raised about $5 million for Orlando’s victims, Ms. Fernandez said, and will start to distribute the money in the next several weeks. Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer who oversaw the federal government’s   victim compensation fund and has become the administrator for a number of such accounts, said Friday that he had consulted with officials in Orlando but had not taken a formal role. Mr. Feinberg said he believed that people who donate money after tragedies intend it to go directly to victims. “There is the understanding that it is a special fund for a special tragedy requiring a special effort,” he said.",0
4467,"How To Distinguish Fake, Plastic Rice From Real","Share on Facebook China remains the world's largest producer of rice. The Middle Kingdom harvests over 200 million tons per year and a large share of it gets exported all over the world. But cooks and diners alike should take care: not only are untold amounts of pesticides used in Chinese agriculture, but according to a report in The Korea Times rice is also now being manufactured artificially. Potato starch gets mixed with plastic (synthetic resin, for instance) and then formed into rice-shaped kernels. Finally the grains are steamed with a typical rice aroma. Doctors have emphatically warned against consuming the artificial product: three full portions apparently contain as much plastic as there is in a little plastic bag. That's alarming! With these simple tricks you can test whether your rice is wholesome and plastic-free: The Water Test Pour a tablespoon of uncooked rice into a glass with cold water. If the rice all sinks to the bottom of the glass, it's fine. If the grains float up to the surface, be careful! The Fire Test Try setting a little bit of your rice on fire with a match or lighter. If it starts burning right away and smells like burning plastic, then you know what to do! (Do not eat it!) The Mortar And Pestle Test When you crush a few grains of rice with a mortar and pestle they should be reduced to a fine, white, starchy powder. But with artificial rice, you will see a light yellow discoloration instead. The Mold Test If you want to know for sure whether your cooked rice is quite safe, put a small quantity of cooked rice into an airtight container and leave it in a warm place. Within a couple of days it will have gotten moldy. Only fake rice stays mold-free. This is how to be on the safe side. Show these tricks to your rice-eating friends and that way no one will have to eat plastic for dinner! Related:",0
4468,Libertarians See Chance Amid Discontent Over Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton - The New York Times,"ORLANDO, Fla.  —   Delegates puffed on   between chants of “freedom!” Educational booths proclaimed the virtues of hemp, “  economics” and the literature of Ayn Rand. A woman on stilts wearing purple angel wings greeted activists as they milled between seminars on drug war policies and on “how to abolish the government in three steps. ” In a year when the two major parties are consumed by tensions, defections and chaos, the Libertarian Party, which sees itself as their alternative, displayed some of the same traits as it wrestled with nominating two former Republican governors for its presidential ticket at its annual convention over the weekend. But there was also a palpable sense of excitement at the event, held at a hotel here less than 10 miles from Disney World. For an antiwar party that promotes legalizing marijuana and tearing up the tax code, 2016 has brought hope that acceptance in the political mainstream is imminent amid broad discontent with the probable nominees from the major parties. “We have been given the gift of Trump and Clinton,” said Larry Sharpe, a businessman and candidate for the Libertarian   nomination. “Their ears are open, and I want them to hear who we are and vote for us for who we are. ” The Libertarian Party is the country’s third largest by voter registration, excluding people who consider themselves independent, but it is often overlooked as a political sideshow with a hodgepodge of positions that many consider to be either overly liberal on social issues or too conservative fiscally. With Donald J. Trump’s rise spawning a contingent of conservative Republicans who will not support him and backers of Senator Bernie Sanders feeling that the Democratic Party is favoring his opponent, Hillary Clinton, Libertarians think they are poised to peel away voters from both sides. The party aims to be on the general election ballot in all 50 states. “There are Republican voters who are going to feel cheated by the fact that their presidential nomination has been taken by a reality show star, and there are Democratic voters who are going to feel cheated when that corporate shill boxes out Senator Sanders at the convention in that rigged process,” Nicholas Sarwark, the Libertarian Party’s national chairman, said on Sunday. “When those people feel cheated, we present an option for them. ” Although only the most fanatical party loyalists feel confident about their chances of winning the presidency, many think that Libertarians are poised to win a record number of votes. Some believe they could steal a state, which no third party has done since George Wallace in 1968, or get enough votes to influence the election, as Ross Perot and Ralph Nader did. More than disrupting the election, though, they see it as a golden opportunity for true national exposure and expansion. The party received more than a million votes in 2012, its most ever, and recent polling suggests a growing appetite for   candidates. An NBC   Street Journal poll this month found that 47 percent of registered voters would consider a   candidate if Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were the major party nominees. Political analysts were taken by surprise this spring when two separate polls showed Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor and the 2012 Libertarian Party nominee, pulling 10 percent and 11 percent of the national vote. The party chose Mr. Johnson again as its   at its nominating convention on Sunday. If he can get to 15 percent in polls, he can stand on the debate stage as the first   candidate to do so since Mr. Perot in 1992. The feat would provide a bounty of free news media attention for a party that does not have the money for expensive advertising or   efforts. Mr. Johnson believes that with sufficient exposure and a positive message he can attract both the young, progressive voters who are backing Mr. Sanders and Republicans who want limited government but fear that Mr. Trump would ratchet up spending and start trade wars. “We should be portraying an optimistic message,” Mr. Johnson, dressed in a dark suit with no tie and wearing sneakers, said in an interview. “Life is good in America. ” Looking to add credibility to his campaign, Mr. Johnson is teaming up with William Weld, the former Massachusetts governor, as his running mate. Mr. Weld, who has compared Mr. Trump’s immigration policies to those of Nazi Germany, said he was reaching out to Republican donors who have decided that they cannot support their party’s presumptive nominee. “I’m going to go knocking on every door I can to try to help us along,” Mr. Weld said. As with Republicans and Democrats, the Libertarians displayed their own intraparty divides on Sunday during a raucous round of voting. Many delegates expressed concern that the party was becoming a landing ground for failed former Republicans and sacrificing its purity to appear more palatable. Mr. Johnson secured the nomination on the second ballot of voting, and Mr. Weld was forced to publicly promise his allegiance to the party before he was voted onto the ticket, also on a second ballot. The possible effect of the Libertarians on the November election remains unclear, as most state polls have not included any of the candidates and the party is not yet on the ballot in every state. Kyle Kondik of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia said a ticket with Mr. Johnson and Mr. Weld could capture many votes in their home states of New Mexico and Massachusetts. Alaska, Arizona, Colorado and Nevada have also shown a propensity to find unconventional candidates appealing, he said, so the Libertarians could tilt close races there. “The Libertarian ticket is kind of a mix of left and right,” Mr. Kondik said. “There is potential appeal for it to be a soft landing spot for voters of all stripes. ” Still, the climb will be steep. There were just 411, 000 registered Libertarian voters as of February, and, Mr. Kondik noted,   candidates tend to underperform their poll numbers. “Ultimately it would be a giant shock if they carried even one state,” Mr. Kondik said. “Perot never did, and he got 19 percent. ” Despite efforts to broaden their base and become an acceptable alternative to the American public, Libertarians battle perceptions that they are “Republican lite” or “old white guys. ” The convention’s   atmosphere belied those caricatures: A   clad in a   leotard strode across the stage with an umbrella to introduce one candidate, and professional dancers basked in strobe lights at a party before the candidates debated on Saturday night. The debate itself offered a window into some of the challenges the Libertarians face as they try to package themselves for broader consumption while sticking to their   principles. The conversation often drifted into strained arguments about how common sense would keep heroin out of the hands of children, how   driver’s licenses are unnecessary  —   one suggestion was a pink flashing light for new drivers  —   and how public infrastructure could be built without taxes. “Who will build the roads?” Austin Petersen, a presidential candidate and founder of The Libertarian Republic, a magazine, said during the debate. “Where we’re going we don’t need roads. ” There were also   presidential hopefuls such as Vermin Supreme, a performance artist who wandered the event with a rubber boot on his head, and Marc Allan Feldman, who began his speech with a Libertarian rap in which he proclaimed, “Republicans and Democrats are wack. ” And then there was John McAfee, the antivirus software pioneer who in 2012 was in hiding in Belize after the police there sought him for questioning in the death of his neighbor. Mr. McAfee, who presented a campaign video declaring, “Here’s to the crazy ones,” doused some of the enthusiasm when he said none of the candidates  —   himself included  —   had any chance of becoming president. Win or lose, most remained encouraged that this year will be important for the Libertarian Party and that even if they do not take the White House this time there are opportunities to win state and local races and to convert Republicans and Democrats. Scott Scrimshaw, a community chaplain from Oregon, switched from Republican to Libertarian six months ago after he surveyed the field of candidates and found himself disappointed. A longtime admirer of Ronald Reagan, he said that he could not trust Mr. Trump with his vote and that he did not want to choose between “the lesser of two evils. ” “I feel we are really on the edge of entering a new era of American politics,” Mr. Scrimshaw said. “The era of the third party. ”",0

The Guardian 
Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. 
Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey’s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton’s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. 
“The FBI is Trumpland,” said one current agent. 
This atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House. 
The currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is “the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,” and that “the reason why they’re leaking is they’re pro-Trump.” 
The agent called the bureau “Trumplandia”, with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party’s national security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected. 
At the same time, other sources dispute the depth of support for Trump within the bureau, though they uniformly stated that Clinton is viewed highly unfavorably. 
“There are lots of people who don’t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it’s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,” said a former FBI official. 
Sources who disputed the depth of Trump’s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory. Justice department officials – another current target of FBI dissatisfaction – have said the bureau disregarded longstanding rules against perceived or actual electoral interference when Comey wrote to Congress to say it was reviewing newly discovered emails relating to Clinton’s personal server.

4471,Judge Orders Written Testimony From Hillary Clinton on Emails - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge on Friday ordered Hillary Clinton to provide written testimony under oath about why she set up a private computer server to send and receive emails while secretary of state, ensuring that the issue will continue to dog her presidential campaign until the eve of the election. In a brief ruling issued on Friday afternoon, the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Washington, approved a motion by the conservative advocacy organization Judicial Watch to pursue its vigorous campaign to expose Mrs. Clinton’s use of the private server. In addition to requiring her testimony in writing, the judge allowed the group to depose a senior State Department aide who had warned two subordinates not to question her email practices. Only six weeks ago, the director of the F. B. I. James B. Comey Jr. declined to recommend prosecuting Mrs. Clinton, saying that while her actions had been careless, they did not amount to a crime. Yet the controversy refuses to dissipate. This week, the bureau turned over to Congress the documents it compiled in the case, including a     hour interview with Mrs. Clinton, even as Republicans in Congress pressed their public case for her to be charged with perjury. Judge Sullivan’s ruling opened another front in a fight Mrs. Clinton’s campaign certainly hoped to put behind her. Although he declined to order her to answer questions in person, his ruling underscored the legal complications that Mrs. Clinton faces even as she enters the homestretch of her campaign. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Brian Fallon, sharply criticized Judicial Watch’s legal campaign, saying it was “a   organization that has been attacking the Clintons since the 1990s. ” “This is just another lawsuit intended to try to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” he said. Judge Sullivan gave Judicial Watch until Oct. 14 to submit questions to Mrs. Clinton  —   three and a half weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8. Significantly, perhaps, he ordered Mrs. Clinton to submit her answers within 30 days of that deadline, meaning she could delay her answers until after the election. The deposition of the senior aide, however, will take place by Oct. 31. The aide, John Bentel, a career foreign service officer who has since retired, was one of the officials in the State Department who seemed to be aware of Mrs. Clinton’s use of the server. At the time, he headed the part of her executive staff in charge of information management, including the preservation of emails and other records. According to the department’s inspector general, he rebuffed concerns raised in 2010 by two officials in the   division about whether her emails were being preserved for the record, instructing them “never to speak of the secretary’s personal email system again. ” Mr. Bentel has declined several requests through his lawyer to comment, but he will now be compelled to testify in person and under oath. Judicial Watch, which dogged Bill Clinton during his presidency, has brought several lawsuits seeking records from the State Department under the Freedom of Information of Act about various aspects of Mrs. Clinton’s tenure, including the employment status of her close aide Huma Abedin. Judge Sullivan, who has at times appeared sympathetic to the group’s demands for information, has compelled testimony from a number of department officials, including Ms. Abedin and Mrs. Clinton’s former chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills. The group’s president, Tom Fitton, expressed pleasure at the latest successful challenge, although the order fell short of the personal interview he may have wanted. “The decision is a reminder that Hillary Clinton is not above the law,” he said in a statement.",0

In December, King tweeted that he would no longer tweet about Trump. “That anyone in America would even CONSIDER voting for this rabid coyote leaves me speechless,” he wrote then. In May, the Carrie author joined hundreds of other prominent authors in signing an open letter “unequivocally” condemning Trump’s candidacy. The following month, King told Rolling Stone that he was “disappointed in the country” after Trump claimed the Republican nomination. “I think that he’s sort of the last stand of a sort of American male who feels like women have gotten out of their place and they’re letting in all these people that have the wrong skin colors. He speaks to those people,” he told the magazine. “Trump is extremely popular because people would like to have a world where you just didn’t question that the white American was at the top of the pecking order,” he added.

4473,Should Third Parties Support ‘Vote Pacts’ To Avoid ‘Spoiling’ Elections?,"Videos Should Third Parties Support ‘Vote Pacts’ To Avoid ‘Spoiling’ Elections? Unlike other vote swapping schemes which pair a voter in a swing state with a voter in a ‘safe’ state, a vote pact pairs voters across party lines who each promise to cast their ballots for a third-party candidate instead.   Green party presidential candidate Jill Stein, foreground, meets her supporters during a campaign stop at Humanist Hall in Oakland, Calif. on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016. 
AUSTIN, Texas — Third-party candidates are often accused of acting as “spoilers” by siphoning votes from the two major parties’ nominees and potentially tipping the balance in an election. 
Perhaps the most notable example of this is Ralph Nader. The former Green Party candidate is frequently accused of helping George W. Bush win the 2000 presidential election by diverting votes which otherwise would have gone to Democratic nominee Al Gore, although this theory has been disproven many times . 
“A lot of people have basically grown to depend on the confines of the two-party system and have a hard time getting their brain around a constructive, strategic path out of it,” Sam Husseini, a political activist, told MintPress News. 
Husseini proposed an alternative strategy in which voters form “voting pacts” across party lines. For example, a Democrat and a Republican might each agree to vote for a third-party candidate of their choice, rather than the two major parties’ candidates. The strategy reduces the potential for “spoiling” votes, as long as voting pacts don’t cross state lines, because each of the major candidates loses voters equally. 
Husseini operates the website VotePact.org to encourage this method of vote sharing or vote pairing. Letter in Wash Post: “VotePact Offers Voters a Sensible Alternative” — how #NeverTrump & #NeverHillary can pair up: https://t.co/HB3CtnGGdi 
— votepact (@votepact) August 30, 2016 
“It has the potential for being a catalyst for genuine realignment and perhaps even for a victory for a so-called third party or independent candidate creative enough to use such a strategy,” Husseini said. 
Third-party candidates frequently urge voters to follow their conscience rather opt for one of the “lesser of two evils” selected by the two-party system. As Green Party nominee Dr. Jill Stein frequently says , “We need to stand up and fight for the greater good like our lives depend on it.” 
Husseini said he’d like to see third-party candidates embrace vote pacts instead of dismissing spoiler claims. He suggested they should also urge their supporters to form vote pacts as a way to safely support third-party movement building. Here’s how Husseini imagines the idea being pitched by a candidate: “There’s a way out of this. You feel like you gotta vote for Clinton because you hate Trump. I get that. Lots of people are like that and lots of people are on the other side. Well, they should pair up and both vote for me.” 
He continued: “I’ve never seen any third-party candidate do that, which is why I think they’re going to remain in single digits” in the popular vote. 
Other forms of “vote swapping” have been proposed during this and previous elections, usually seeking to pair a voter from a swing state with a voter from a state “red” or “blue” state. The voter in the so-called “safe state” agrees to vote for a third-party candidate in return for securing a vote for their preferred candidate in a state where the election is in play. 
This “safe state” strategy was especially popular in 2000, when voters sought to trade Nader and Gore votes. That election prompted a court case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that that vote swapping is “clearly protected by the First Amendment.” 
Last month, Husseini told Bustle’s Amée Latour that the “safe state” strategy just “kicks the can down the road.” Third parties often hope to secure 5 percent of the popular vote in presidential races, which would unlock millions in additional federal funding for future elections, but Husseini thinks by embracing vote pacts they could potentially win elections outright. 
“The other so-called ‘strategies’ are basically a way of minimizing the so-called ‘damage’ of third-party runs,” he told MintPress. 
While Husseini said he hopes alternative candidates will someday make vote pacts a key part of their campaign strategy, he also stressed that it isn’t too late for voters to embrace the idea in the 2016 election. Vote pacts require mutual trust between political opponents, so he recommends forming them with family members, close friends, and coworkers across party lines. 
He also said voting pacts could spur political change by encouraging people to engage in challenging political conversations across party lines rather than simply shutting out opposing views.

4474,Inhabitants of Maldives Atoll Fear a Flood of Saudi Money - The New York Times,"MAGOODHOO, Maldives  —   As long as anyone can remember, life on the island of Magoodhoo in the Maldives has revolved around fishing in the crystal clear waters that wash the coral reefs, and kicking back under palm trees on deck chairs made from coir rope. “This is a very fun, happy life,” said Islam Ahmed, 24, a tall, lean man chewing on areca nuts and betel leaves at one of two cafes on the less than    island. It is one of nearly 1, 200 islands that make up the Republic of Maldives, a nation southwest of India in the Indian Ocean. But Mr. Ahmed and others here are bracing for a life change they fear could be catastrophic, after the Maldivian president’s announcement in January that leaders of Saudi Arabia were planning a $10 billion investment in the group of islands where Mr. Ahmed lives, known as Faafu Atoll. Most alarming to the residents were reports that the government was breaking with a longstanding policy of leasing the islands that are home to some of the world’s premier resorts and selling the atoll outright to the Saudis. The inhabitants fear they might be moved off the islands. “It is worrying that we may be taken from here and put in tiny apartment boxes,” said Sobira Aboobukaru, 58, near the farm where she grows chilies and cucumbers. “It would be hard beyond our imaginations. ” The Maldivian president, Abdulla Yameen, has denied that the atoll will be sold, and the Saudi embassy said it had no intention “of investing in a megaproject or buying an island or atoll in the Maldives. ” But the fact that Mr. Yameen pushed to change the Constitution in 2015 to allow the sale of property to foreign entities has continued to fuel rumors of a potential sale. All of this has left Mr. Ahmed and the approximately 4, 000 residents of the 19 coral islands in Faafu Atoll guessing about what the future holds. It has also underscored how new allies and investors have gained a foothold in this strategic archipelago. The country has pivoted from its traditional partners  —   India and the European Union  —   amid growing international pressure over accusations of human rights abuses by Mr. Yameen. Saudi Arabia has for decades spread its conservative strand of Islam in the Maldives by sending religious leaders, building mosques and giving scholarships to students to attend its universities. The Saudis are building a new airport terminal, and have pledged tens of millions of dollars in loans and grants for infrastructure and housing on an artificial island near the capital, Malé. Similarly, China, which sees the Maldives as a strategic outpost in its quest for regional dominance, has underwritten hundreds of millions of dollars in loans for a new airport runway and a   bridge connecting the airport to the capital. The $10 billion Saudi investment seemed to be a crowning achievement for Mr. Yameen, but now the Saudis seem put off by the negative publicity, and the deal may be unraveling. King Salman of Saudi Arabia was expected to visit the Maldives last week, but canceled at the last minute, citing a flu epidemic on the islands. It was widely assumed here that he wanted to avoid inflaming the dispute or facing protests. The Saudi interest in Faafu Atoll began with a 2014 visit by King Salman, then the crown prince, and his son Mohammed bin Salman, now the deputy crown prince. A year later, Prince Mohammed returned to host a week of parties. He and his entourage took over two resorts, said a person familiar with the plans. That person said guests had flown in night after night on private jets to attend the parties, which featured famous entertainers including the rapper Pitbull and the South Korean singer Psy. Mohamed Maleeh Jamal, formerly a member of Mr. Yameen’s economic and youth council, said that he had attended the signing of a memorandum of understanding between representatives of the Saudi royal family and the Maldives two years ago. He said he had been told that it involved selling the atoll, although he was not privy to the details. The precise plans remain a secret, but Mr. Yameen has said the Saudis envision   developments similar to the French Riviera. A million people would be drawn to the atoll, on which airports, resorts and   housing would be built, he said. For centuries, life in Magoodhoo has revolved around fishing. The   populated of the Maldives’ 20 administrative atolls, Faafu is steeped in history. The   mosque on the Maldives, built more than 800 years ago, lies on island of Nilandhoo, which is the atoll capital. The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl said in his 1986 book, “The Maldive Mystery,” that he had found ruins of ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples on the same island. About half of the men in Magoodhoo, including Mr. Ahmed, spend much of their lives at sea. Six yellowfin tuna fishing boats operate from here, each with a crew of at least 16 men. Their wives and children stay behind on the island, an oval nub of silver sand rising out of the ocean with a clump of coconut and breadfruit trees in the center. In small,   concrete buildings in the center of town stand a school, a police station, a health center and an island council office. Residents live in small houses built with coral limestone along the several roads that crisscross the center of town. The streets are not paved but covered in sand and kept passable by women who sweep them several times a day. By the beachside, many women spend their days cutting palm leaves and weaving thatch, a valued commodity for resorts. With its tiny population spread over hundreds of such islands, the government has struggled to meet its people’s demands for fresh water, sanitation and education. It has a history of pushing people off the smaller islands onto the larger ones, where it can provide centralized services, further fueling the fears of the people of Magoodhoo. Not everyone dreads the potential Saudi embrace. Many are hopeful that Saudi investment will bring jobs and development, even as they worry they could be forced to move off the island. More than a third of the Maldives population of nearly 350, 000 is crowded onto the capital island, Malé, on just 2. 2 square miles of land that is a      speedboat ride northeast of Faafu Atoll. Even Mr. Ahmed said he was willing to move off the island, under the right circumstances. “Anyone who has a bit of wealth is going to Malé to educate their kids,” he said. “If I get enough money, I, too, will go to give my kid an education. ” But with the prospective Saudi development, he worries that he and his family could be forced to move whether they want to or not. Many residents fear they may be moved to apartments the government is building on an artificial island near Malé, financed in part by an $80 million loan from the Saudi Fund for Development. When Mr. Yameen visited Magoodhoo island in late January, he tried to assuage such fears. The president came to announce that King Salman had donated a new mosque to the people of Magoodhoo. But much more Saudi development would be coming, Mr. Yameen promised. “They have planned a huge project for Faafu Atoll,” he said. “All the charts and drawings have been completed. ”",0
4475,Steve Bannon Named Senior Counselor Signals Nationalist White House,"President-elect Donald Trump has named Steve Bannon as his senior counselor and chief strategist. Reince Priebus will be the White House chief of staff.
The uproar came when the press release announced that the two would be equal partners in the White House, thus making Bannon one of the most powerful people in the Executive Mansion. It has been stated that the most effective way to influence the White House is to be named the president’s most important advisor.
Bannon’s place in the Trump administration is of significance in American politics. It is also one of controversy. The president-elect’s choice for his top aide was criticized by the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League, and multiple Democratic leaders. Harry Reid stated, “President-elect Trump’s choice of Steve Bannon as his top aide signals that White Supremacists will be represented at the highest levels in Trump’s White House.”
John Weaver, a Republican consultant to Governor John Kasich, sent a tweet stating “a racist, anti-Semite” was named an equal to Trump’s chief of staff and warned the nation to stay vigilant.
Bannon was a significant part of the creation and growth of the nationalist right, or alt-right movement, which welcomes those who are openly anti-Semites and racist. The Washington Post printed a similar comment when he became chairman of the Trump campaign, stating: “it was the latest sign for white nationalists, once dismissed as fringe, that their worldview was gaining popularity and that the old Republican Party was coming to an end.”
The Bannon Climb to the White House A former spokesman for Breitbart News, Kurt Bardella, told The New Yorker that Bannon attempts to ride the coattails of anyone who could grant him political power. He supported Sarah Palin, then the Tea Party, on to Ted Cruz, jumped to Ben Carson, and so on.
From 2008 to 2016, he studied Sarah Palin and political figures that held a right-wing status. He even made documentaries about these people, creating a kind of epicenter for the nationalist right, or alt-right, movement.
After President Barack Obama was re-elected, Republican leaders, the GOP business wing, and consultants decided their focus needed to be on immigration. Priebus was the chairman of the Republican National Committee and submitted a report stating that passing legislation for immigration reform was a necessary means for the survival of the party. This situation became Bannon’s window of opportunity.
He was open about his disdain for Fox News and believed Rupert Murdoch was a globalist. He thought of Priebus, Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders as enemies. Bannon made Breitbart a rebellious hub, resisting all efforts to immigration reform. He developed a friendship of support with Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of the Senate opposition.
This divide created an opening for an unnoticed group of conservatives, who had been marginalized. They shared an idea to “promote the restoration of white culture.” Bannon provided Breitbart as an outlet to further the alt-right movement and bring it into mainstream conversation.
Journalists were sent to the Mexican border to interview Americans who believed they were victims of immigration. The writers used anti-Semitic terms in their articles while criticizing globalists and international bankers. Weeks before Bannon became chairman of the Trump campaign, he told a reporter for Mother Jones, “We’re the platform for the alt-right,” referring to the Breitbart News site.
The nationalist-right website encouraged any outsider who was a threat to Republican leadership. Ted Cruz was a key element of the government shut-down, in 2013. The news site celebrated the accomplishment. It supported David Brad when he defeated Cantor, in a primary, by verbally assaulting his Wall Street connections. The site even assisted in instigating the uprising against Speaker of the House John Boehner.
During the 2015 Republican primaries, Breitbart shredded the reputations of Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. By the fall, Breitbart was the “Trump propaganda machine or Trumpbart News,” as referred to by critics.
When Breitbart News reporter, Michelle Fields, was grabbed by Corey Lewandowski for approaching Trump, Bannon took the side of the presidential campaign. He did not protect his own reporter while the campaign denied the incident.
In August 2016, he found the Golden Ticket. Trump asked Bannon to chair his presidential campaign.
Under the Wing of Trump The presidential candidate had already received criticism for using the vocabulary of white nationalists and anti-Semitic radicals. This, combined with his approval from the Ku Klux Klan made Trump an even more favorable ally. Allegedly, Bannon inserted anti-Semitic and racist rhetoric in Trump’s written campaign speeches and television ads. When asked about these invocations, Bannon stated that he supported “nationalism, not white nationalism.” He believes the European movements focus on the identity of the people as a nation, not racial identity.
He stated the approval of white working-class Americans could win Trump electoral votes from Michigan and Wisconsin, in the presidential election. These states have voted Democrat since the ‘80s. He did not believe Hillary Clinton had the same Hispanic and African-American support Obama had garnered in 2012. This would cause her to lose the Florida electoral votes. Bannon was right.
The alt-right nationalist has nurtured his connections with like-minded people in France, the U.K., Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. The first foreign national the president-elect met with was Nigel Farage, a friend of Bannon.
He has stated multiple times that American capitalism was constructed on “Judeo-Christian values.” He believes that when capitalism was most beneficial, the strongest leaders were also faithful Judeo-Christians. They were either active in the Christian or Jewish faith and it was manifested in their accomplishments. Would the Founding Fathers considered white supremacists?
Senior Council The senior counselor position has been held by David Axelrod and Karl Rove, most recently. The role is a high-level function in the Oval Office that involves communication with national and foreign governments. It could involve writing speeches for the president on any occasion.
Appointing Bannon to this position tells the nation that the philosophy of the alt-right voters will integrate into American policy. Indeed, it is the plan, of the president-elect, to deport millions of immigrants after his Inauguration Ceremony. Could this begin a new Holocaust?

4476,Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows: We Need Tax Reform By August,"House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows ( ) says that if Congress fails to introduce a tax reform package by the end of July, leadership in the House and Senate should call off the August recess. [Chairman Meadows told attendees at a Heritage Foundation tax event, “We need to get tax reform done sooner (rather) than later and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July. ”  Meadows said that we need to have an agreement on tax reform in the next 3 or 4 weeks and that negotiations will fare much better once Congress moves past the idea of a border adjustment tax. “There is no consensus for the border adjustment tax. The sooner we acknowledge that and get on with a plan that actually works and actually can build consensus, the better off we will be,” the North Carolina congressman added. Meadows negotiated with former Tuesday   Tom MacArthur ( ) to craft the MacArthur amendment. The amendment galvanized enough support for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to pass through the House. Now, Meadows wants to negotiate a tax reform deal, even if that means getting rid of Congress’s vacation in August. Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) the former Freedom Caucus chair, also dispelled the notion of a border adjustment tax. A border adjustment tax (BAT) would tax imports at 20 percent while exempting exports from the tax. Jordan said that lawmakers need to eliminate the idea of revenue neutrality for tax reform, which he argues does not amount to a real tax cut for Americans. “Letting families keep more of their money is not a cost to government —  it’s called freedom,” Jordan said. The Ohio congressman chided the current talks of the House budget negotiations. Jordan said, “Right now a budget cannot pass in the House. ” Congressman Dave Brat ( ) explained that this is a “one in a century opportunity” to create economic growth through tax reform. Jack Spencer, the vice president for the Institute for Economic Freedom at Heritage, asked the Freedom Caucus panel how the Senate might jeopardize the reconciliation and budget process by retaining Obamacare’s taxes in the Senate health care bill. Jordan chided, “It certainly doesn’t help it. That’s the Senate’s job. ” Congressman Warren Davidson ( ) another Freedom Caucus member, reiterated Jordan’s emphasis on real tax cuts for American families. “We can’t tweak around the edges, we need to go big,” Davidson said.",0
4477,"Mildred Dresselhaus, the Queen of Carbon, Dies at 86 - The New York Times","Mildred Dresselhaus, a professor emerita at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose research into the fundamental properties of carbon helped transform it into the superstar of modern materials science and the nanotechnology industry, died on Monday in Cambridge, Mass. She was 86. Her death, at Mount Auburn Hospital, was confirmed by her granddaughter Leora Cooper. No cause was given. Nicknamed the Queen of Carbon in scientific circles, Dr. Dresselhaus was renowned for her efforts to promote the cause of women in science. She was the first woman to secure a full professorship at M. I. T. in 1968, and she worked vigorously to ensure that she would not be the last. In 1971, she and a colleague organized the first Women’s Forum at M. I. T. to explore the roles of women in science. Two years later she won a Carnegie Foundation grant to further that cause. “I met Millie on my interview for a faculty job in 1984,” said Lorna Gibson, now a professor of materials science and engineering. “M. I. T. was quite intimidating then for a new female, but Millie made it all seem possible, even effortless. I knew it wouldn’t be, but she was such an approachable intellectual powerhouse, she made it seem that way. ” Today, women make up about 22 percent of M. I. T. ’s faculty. “Millie was very straightforward, no frilly stuff, and I loved that about her,” said Jacqueline K. Barton, a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. “She was always warm and supportive to me, but I also had the feeling it was important to let her know about my last good experiment. ” Dr. Dresselhaus’s own story was one of struggle and perseverance. The daughter of impoverished Jewish immigrants from Poland, she grew up humbly in the Bronx, sometimes on public assistance, but excelled in school  —   winning scholarships, finding a mentor in a future Nobel laureate and earning advanced degrees at leading universities. This month, Dr. Dresselhaus found a measure of popular culture fame at the center of a General Electric TV commercial that boasts of a corporate commitment to hiring more women. In the ad, little girls play with Millie Dresselhaus dolls and dress up in Millie Dresselhaus wigs and sweaters. Parents name their newborn girls Millie, and journalists breathlessly seek the next Dresselhaus sighting. Dr. Dresselhaus appears in the commercial as well. “What if we treated great female scientists like they were stars?” the narrator says. “What if Millie Dresselhaus were as famous as any celebrity?” For its part, carbon is as capricious as any celebrity. It is the graphite of a pencil, worn down by a simple doodle. Arrayed in a   crystal, it is a diamond, the hardest substance known. Dr. Dresselhaus used resonant magnetic fields and lasers to map out the electronic energy structure of carbon. She investigated the traits that emerge when carbon is interwoven with other materials: Stitch in some alkali metals, for example, and carbon can become a superconductor, in which an electric current meets virtually no resistance. Dr. Dresselhaus was a pioneer in research on fullerenes, also called buckyballs:    cages of carbon atoms that can be used as drug delivery devices, lubricants, filters and catalysts. She conceived the idea of rolling a   sheet of carbon atoms into a hollow tube, a notion eventually realized as the nanotube  —   a versatile structure with the strength of steel but just one   the width of a human hair. She worked on carbon ribbons, semiconductors, nonplanar monolayers of molybdenum sulfide, and the scattering and vibrational effects of tiny particles introduced into ultrathin wires. She published more than 1, 700 scientific papers,   eight books and gathered a stack of accolades as fat as a nanotube is fine. Dr. Dresselhaus was awarded the National Medal of Science, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (bestowed by President Barack Obama) the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience, the Enrico Fermi prize and dozens of honorary doctorates. She also served as president of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science and worked in the Department of Energy in the Clinton administration. “Every morning she’d leave the house at 5:30, the first car in the parking lot every day, and everyone she collaborated with she viewed as family,” said Ms. Cooper, Dr. Dresselhaus’s granddaughter, who is a graduate student at M. I. T. “Her life and her science were intertwined. ” She was born Mildred Spiewak on Nov. 11, 1930, in Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx, the daughter of the former Ethel Teichtheil and Meyer Spiewak. “My early years were spent in a dangerous, multiracial,   neighborhood,” she wrote in a biographical sketch. “My early elementary school memories up through ninth grade are of teachers struggling to maintain class discipline with occasional coverage of academics. ” For all the family’s financial hardships, Mildred and her older brother, Irving, became gifted violinists who won scholarships to music schools. From age 6 on, Mildred took the subway long distances on her own, burdened, as she recalled, with books and musical instruments as she stumbled down steps. When somebody told her about Hunter High School, the highly selective public school in Manhattan, she wrote away for old entry exams, studied them and then aced the test. There, her predilections were clear: “In math and science,” the yearbook declared, Mildred Spiewak is “second to none. ” After graduating she enrolled at Hunter College, where she intended to become a schoolteacher until she took an elementary physics class with Rosalyn Yalow, a future Nobel laureate, who urged her to consider a career in science. “She was a very domineering person,” Dr. Dresselhaus said in an interview in 2012. “She had definite ideas about everything. ” Dr. Yalow, she wrote in the biographical sketch, “became a lifelong mentor. ” Dr. Dresselhaus earned a master’s degree from Radcliffe College and a Ph. D. from the University of Chicago, where she studied under the celebrated physicist Enrico Fermi. She lived in his neighborhood, and every morning they would walk to the university together talking science. The conversations were thrilling, she said, and they kept her going through a grueling program from which 75 percent of the students dropped out. At Chicago she met Gene Dresselhaus, a fellow physicist, and married him. He survives her, as do her four children, Marianne, Carl, Paul and Eliot and, besides Ms. Cooper, four other grandchildren, M. I. T. said. Dr. Dresselhaus and her husband both ended up at M. I. T. in 1960, one of the few places willing to hire    scientists. There she worked at Lincoln Laboratory, a defense research center, where she was one of two women on a scientific staff of 1, 000. “We were pretty much invisible,” she later recalled. One reason Dr. Dresselhaus said she chose to study carbon was its relative unpopularity. “I was happy to work on a project that most people thought was hard and not that interesting,” she said. “If one day I had to be at home with a sick child, it wouldn’t be the end of the world. ”",0
4478,"Hillary Releases Attack Dogs On Rule Of Law, FBI, Comey- Silent Coup d’etat?","in: Government Corruption , US News It’s been almost a week since FBI director announced the reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s illegal use of her state department emails and this story is only getting bigger with every passing day. Hillary’s fully controlled liberal left mainstream media and her attack dog politicians and authority figure minions are doing things that some may argue resemble a silent coup d’etat. Yes, I’m talking about an American coup d’etat. I believe in many ways we are witnessing a slow motion coup d’etat that if it succeeds it will mark the permanent end to the rule of law, any resemblance of justice and the end of America itself. Let’s begin by first looking at the definition of coup d’etat : a sudden and decisive action in politics, especially one resulting in a change of government illegally or by force Recently reopened by the FBI, the investigation of Hillary’s criminality is very real and under any normal circumstances would or should guarantee not only her removal as presidential candidate regardless of how close we are to the elections, but also a warrant for her arrest. The Hillary crime team is not about to lay down for this incredible moment in US history however. Hillary has unleashed her attackers on the FBI and its director James Comey, who of course has been one of Hillary’s very controlled minions all along until now perhaps. To counter the application of the rule of law (remember, Hillary broke the law), to preserve her road to presidency and to block her road to jail Hillary’s attack dogs have been released on the justice system itself, something historically unusual and alone worthy of top news status. Attack dog number one, Senator Harry Reid recently threatened FBI director Comey stating the following in a letter to him: I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act… Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. Historically and astonishingly Reid is attempting to put the elections before the rule of law itself. This is apparently a common theme and strategy in the Hillary criminal camp. So much so that they are attempting to make this about James Comey instead of the actual criminal who broke the law, Hillary Clinton. Attorney General Loretta Lynch also jumped in on this pro-Hillary, screw-the-rule-of-law narrative now being perpetuated by the pro-Hillary minions and attack dogs when it was reported that she “advised Comey not to send a letter to Congress informing them of the discovery of new emails”. The New Yorker put out anonymous quotes designed to attack Comey saying (anonymity emphasized in bold) “You don’t do this,” one former senior Justice Department official exclaimed . “It’s aberrational. It violates decades of practice.” The reason, according to the former official, who asked not to be identified because of ongoing cases involving the department, “is because it impugns the integrity and reputation of the candidate, even though there’s no finding by a court, or in this instance even an indictment.” In fact, according to the Washington Post James Comey’s critics are “ growing by the hour “. All of this is a continuation of what we’ve been seeing throughout this US presidential election campaign. Ignore the suspect on trial and attack the investigator instead. Ignore the details of the videos and emails being revealed and question the source or blame it on Russia. In the case of Hillary, this craziness is what we’ve been seeing for decades. Hillary (like Bill) is above the law and any attempt to bring her to justice will be fought and resisted by her army. They know that they are close to taking over the presidency (very likely via voting fraud ) that they don’t have to answer to the rule of law. The process of getting Hillary in, which we call election day, is therefore more important than the application of the law itself and justice. According to the pro-Hillary resistance (to the rule of law and justice), removing a potential criminal candidate who has repeatedly lied and murdered her enemies is apparently only of secondary importance to election day itself. The idea, the deep rooted delusional belief that Hillary really is actually above the law seems to be believed by her followers, supporters and attack dogs. Thus by perpetuating this belief they (the Hillary attack dogs) are trying to WILL their way into a Hillary presidential victory while completely ignoring the possibility and prospects that Hillary is in fact a criminal. It’s incredible how times have changed. It’s like we are watching the Watergate scandal in reverse. Imagine if AFTER the Watergate scandals of the 1970’s THEN Richard Nixon would have ran for president instead of the other way around. This, my friends, is what we are seeing with Hillary. The logic sequence goes like this: 1. Hillary criminality revealed and exposed to the world via leaks, witnesses, emails etc. 2. Hillary body count rises, many of her enemies coincidentally end up dead. The world watches this. 3. Hillary’s fully revealed criminality not allowed to be investigated because pursuing justice is seen as “interfering” with an election. 4. Known criminal Hillary Clinton becomes president and assumes power with the aid of George Soros and a mass criminal operation of voter fraud. 5. Hillary assumes power to go after all her enemies who tried to hold her to the law. Again, this is their (the pro-Hillary insiders) desired sequence and this is how they want to see things unfold. Adding to the recent attacks from the Clinton attack dogs Democratic Strategist James Carville recently stated: “This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. “It’s unprecedented… the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. Yes, the KGB apparently is behind the recent application of the rule of law as it pertains to Hillary’s lies and criminality now further revealed in her personal assistant’s ( Huma Abedin ) emails discovered by the FBI. The emails that offer further hard evidence to the Hillary criminal accusations. According to the NEW rule of law, especially the rule of law that Hillary will bring with her regime, none of this apparently matters any more. What most Americans don’t see is how closely all of this resembles a coup d’etat. Taking over the rule of law and declaring your own version of the law is a takeover any which way you cut it. The arrogance seen in Hillary Clinton in one hearing after another which she has sat for is mind boggling. At no point in any of these hearings (including the Benghazi hearings) has Hillary ever admitted doing anything wrong. She has just the right arrogance to take over the criminal Obama regime and push the West’s global order plans forward. She has just the right arrogance and criminal mindset to push the world into world war 3 and destroy whatever is left of America and individual freedom. Everything we are watching resembles an American coup d’etat from a legal point of view if you ask me. And the Hillary attack dogs at every level are riding out the final storm before (they hope) they insert their leader on election day. The criminals ignoring the rule of law surely have a stake in what they hope will be the next regime. Submit your review",0
4479,"’Quantico’ Showrunner: Trump Voters Probably Won’t Watch Our Show, It’s About ’Inclusion’","Josh Safran, showrunner for ABC’s Quantico, says the struggling drama series will continue to push political plots that parallel the Trump White House, even if it causes supporters of the president to change the channel. [Safran told The Hollywood Reporter this week that the remaining episodes of Season 2 see the show becoming “a little bit of a West Wing junior,” and will soon tackle fake news.  THR reports: “In coming weeks, the show’s version of Trump, which Safran describes as a parallel   but not a mirror image, will make his entrance, bringing with him more    versions of Steve Bannon, Paul Ryan and other members of Trump’s inner circle. And Hunter Parrish (Weeds, Good Girls Revolt) has joined the series as first son Clayton Haas, a political strategist whom Safran likens to former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau. ” Quantico, which previously took a swipe at Trump in its first season, has seen a steep drop in ratings  —   nearly 50 percent  —   since its Season 2 opener on September 25. Ratings improved, but only slightly, after ABC moved the series from Sunday to Monday. The most recent episode drew a paltry 0.  in the ratings and 3. 31 million total viewers, well behind NBC’s Taken and CBS’s Scorpion in the same  . But Safran insists that he’s not preoccupied by ratings or if Quantico will be renewed for a third season. Instead, Safran is working to make the show as good as possible. Upcoming episodes will reportedly include storylines about fake news and a debate over a Muslim registry. “Regardless, the show will either come back or it won’t,” he said. “I highly doubt we’re going to double in the ratings and I also highly doubt we’re going to lose half of our audience. I’m blissfully ignorant and just keeping my head down trying to make the show as strong as possible. ” Safran also told THR he thinks it is “probably unlikely” that Trump supporters are watching the show. “It’s a show about inclusion and where the women have what would have been typically male roles. It’s all about people of color working together to do what’s right,” he explained. “We believe in women in power and everyone’s equal and freedom for all. We don’t exactly stand for Trumpian instincts by our very nature. ” “You’ll probably find that 24: Legacy and partially Designated Survivor, which takes more of a bipartisan look at things, have more of a viewership that voted for Trump or who are   than us,” he added.

4483,"In Dropping Health Vote, Trump Swallowed Need for a Showdown - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   When Speaker Paul D. Ryan arrived at the White House on Friday to inform President Trump that the health care bill he had made his first major legislative push could not pass, Mr. Trump had one reaction: He wanted revenge. Furious at rebellious Republicans who refused to back the measure, Mr. Trump demanded that defectors cast “no” votes for all to see  —   even if it meant the measure’s   defeat, broadcast live on television. But over a lunch of chicken, brussels sprouts and   potatoes in the Oval Office, Mr. Ryan pleaded with Mr. Trump to reconsider. A loss could do lasting political damage to Republicans who supported the contentious bill, Mr. Ryan argued, especially those in competitive districts who were vulnerable to primary challenges. It would do nothing to isolate or punish the Freedom Caucus, the conservative faction that had resisted the measure all along, he added. And it could alienate    Republicans needed to push through other challenging initiatives in the weeks to come, including an increase in the debt ceiling, a sweeping tax cut and the president’s promised $1 trillion infrastructure package. Mr. Trump remained unconvinced, but by midafternoon, armed with vote counts showing that the measure lacked a majority to pass, the president called the speaker to agree: You should pull the bill. The collapse of the measure dealt Mr. Trump  —   a professed master dealmaker who campaigned as an agent of change  —   a remarkable setback in his young presidency, threatening to sap his influence and imperil his ambitious agenda. It also highlighted the importance of a pairing that will shape the Trump era: a president inexperienced in the complexities of politics and uninterested in the nuance of policy, paired with a vulnerable speaker struggling to corral competing coalitions within the Republican Party. With repeal and replace now a hollow vow, Mr. Trump’s anger at the defiant members of the Freedom Caucus was undiminished. But trying to put the best possible face on a major defeat late Friday afternoon, he confined his public criticism to Democrats. “When you get zero from the other side  —   they let us down because they’re hurting the people,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview shortly after he had agreed to pull the measure. Asked whether he was worried the loss would hurt Republicans, he said, “I’ll let you know in a year. ” The demise of the American Health Care Act played out in a tense 24 hours that White House and congressional officials said proved a political education for Mr. Trump and his top advisers on the promise and peril of governing, even with unified Republican control. This account is based on government officials who were present during the   negotiations and who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We all learned a lot,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday afternoon. “We learned a lot about loyalty, and we learned a lot about the   process. ” “Certainly for me, it was a very interesting experience,” he added. Mr. Trump, who initially had little involvement in crafting the health care bill, became more deeply engaged in recent weeks, promoting it at rallies outside Washington and holding meetings in the West Wing with conservative and moderate coalitions whose support was crucial to its passage. But he made little secret of his ambivalence about addressing the issue  —   “I would have loved to have put it first, I’ll be honest,” Mr. Trump said of tax reform in Nashville last week  —   yet he told aides he believed the measure could not pass without a push from him. By Thursday afternoon, just hours before a scheduled vote, it had become clear that his efforts  —   along with those of Vice President Mike Pence and other senior White House officials  —   had fallen short. At a meeting in Mr. Ryan’s office in the Capitol with members of the recalcitrant Freedom Caucus, top White House officials laid out the changes they had made at the group’s behest, including stripping it of federal standards for benefits that must be provided in health insurance policies, including maternity and wellness care. Caucus members began outlining still more changes they needed to see before they could support the bill, angering Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump’s aides. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, and Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, told the group that the White House was finished negotiating and that the president wanted to know its position on the bill  —   yes or no. Called on in turn to state their positions, several members refused. As tensions rose, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina said that he spoke for the group and that they were not ready to commit. That meant the votes would not be there. Mr. Ryan postponed the vote and called an evening meeting of House Republicans in the basement of the Capitol. Lawmakers munched on    takeout as Mr. Mulvaney delivered the president’s ultimatum on the health measure: Fall in line behind it or accept that former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act would be the law of the land. The speaker emerged and told reporters there would be a vote in the morning, rushing away from the news cameras as he was asked if Republicans had the votes. In a   telephone call Thursday evening between Mr. Trump and Mr. Ryan, the two commiserated over the demands of the caucus and strategized over the prospects for a vote on Friday. Even as the two spoke, some of Mr. Trump’s advisers were privately expressing frustration with Mr. Ryan, arguing that he had badly misjudged the situation and misled the president into tackling health care before a tax overhaul. The meeting with the Freedom Caucus had prompted a realization by Mr. Trump and his inner circle about how the group operated, and that offering it policy concessions would not win its support. By Friday, Mr. Trump was out for blood, eager to call the bluff of the Freedom Caucus and savage it if the health bill went down in defeat. Mr. Bannon and Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s legislative affairs director, both favored holding the vote. But Mr. Ryan, reluctant to suffer an embarrassing loss or to ask his fellow Republicans to take what could be a politically perilous vote on a measure that had little chance of passing, argued vigorously against it. White House officials still believed as much as half of the   Freedom Caucus could be pressured into supporting the bill, and Mr. Bannon demanded to see a confidential   list that demonstrated otherwise. The numbers were grim, and Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan to acquiesce into calling off the vote. “I don’t blame him for a thing, I really don’t,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Ryan in the interview on Friday. “Look, he tried. He tried very hard. ” But one close adviser said that Mr. Trump, who hates looking weak or any form of embarrassment in public, was stewing. One ally of the president, however, said that he had learned from the process. Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Mr. Trump, said he thought it was a “blessing in disguise” that the bill had died. “This bill was a political bullet aimed at the president and congressional Republicans running for office next year,” he said. “On future legislation, he won’t make the same mistakes. ” As Mr. Trump reflected on the health care debacle, the president who had predicted during the campaign that he would win so often that people would become “sick of winning” insisted that he was at peace with the day’s results. “I’m not disappointed,” he said in the interview. “If I were, I wouldn’t be calling you. ” He said that he was moving on to overhauling the tax system and trade, describing the experience with the health bill as not that different from some of his negotiations as a   developer. But he acknowledged that he was pleased to have it all behind him. “It’s enough already,” he said.",0
4484,Where Burning Effigies (Not Just Guy Fawkes’s) Is Part of the Fun - The New York Times,"LEWES, England  —   Though it is never flattering to be burned in effigy, Donald J. Trump was in good company on Saturday when his image went up in flames not far from those of the British prime minister, Theresa May, and of a   pope. In the streets, firecrackers exploded, blazing crosses were carried and the air filled with smoke as the people of Lewes, in southeast England, paraded in a dazzling array of costumes on Nov. 5, the anniversary of a failed plot to blow up Parliament in London in 1605. More than four centuries later, many throughout Britain still commemorate the event  —   known as Bonfire Night, or Guy Fawkes Night (after one of the plotters)  —   though its distinctiveness is being usurped as it sometimes merges with Halloween, a relatively recent import here, or the Hindu festival of Diwali. But not in Lewes. “It is the only thing in the whole year which marks us out from everyone else,” said Graham Mayhew, the mayor and a historian. “People are very proud of it and determined to protect it,” he said, adding that residents “love the fact that nobody else does this. ” On a field on the outskirts of the town, giant bonfires burned and fireworks exploded from the head of one of at least two effigies of Mr. Trump  —   this one suspended below a model of a wall adorned with Mexican flags. The spectacles are organized by the town’s seven bonfire societies, some of them more than 160 years old. Mr. Mayhew, interviewed before the event, said the subjects should not take their immolation personally. “You are not to take it seriously. It’s a statement of people’s reaction to the news,” he said. “It is not meant as an incitement. It’s like a political cartoon  —   it is exposing certain things to ridicule. ” Lewes (pronounced  ) has several claims to historical fame, being at one time the home of Thomas Paine, the radical American author of “Common Sense,” who is memorialized with a plaque on the town’s White Hart Hotel marking the place where he “expounded his revolutionary politics. ” But it is best known now as the unofficial center of Britain’s Bonfire Night tradition, commemorating a moment of deliverance for Protestant England: the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, a plan by Roman Catholics to blow up Westminster Palace and everyone in it, including King James I. Guido, or Guy, Fawkes and his fellow conspirators were captured and suffered gruesome executions. Four centuries later, Lewes celebrates the event in a night carnival with strange, sometimes sectarian, undertones. Through the streets pass those dressed as smugglers, Zulu warriors, Native Americans, Vikings and regimental English soldiers, carrying flags with symbols such as the skull and crossbones. Then there is the effigy of Pope Paul V (the pontiff in 1605) alongside banners reading “no popery” and flaming crosses. Lewes also commemorates the killing of 17 Protestant martyrs who met their horrific deaths in the town well before the Gunpowder Plot. They were victims of the   Marian Persecutions of the 16th century, which took place when Queen Mary (or “Bloody Mary”) sought to stamp out Protestantism. There is also an act of remembrance for those who died in the major wars of the 20th century. Mr. Mayhew conceded that there was “a bit of a hangover from the strong religious feeling of the 19th century,” when   was rife, though he added that “most people would be horrified by the idea that they would have religious prejudice. ” Local Roman Catholics “tolerate it,” he said. “Sometimes feathers get ruffled. Some of the local priests have taken it more to heart. But everybody recognizes it is part of tradition. ” “It’s not right wing. It’s not left wing. It is a great celebration of ” he added. The town has a long history of Nonconformism, a form of Protestantism that dissents from the established Church of England, but   Lewes seems more attached to the trappings of sectarianism than its reality. In the book “Burn Holy Fire,” Jeremy Goring recounts an episode in 1981 when Ian Paisley, a   Protestant lawmaker from Northern Ireland, came to Lewes on Bonfire Night “and tried to fan the flames of conflict by distributing   leaflets. ” “His intervention backfired badly, for the following year he himself was burned in effigy,” Mr. Goring wrote. The giant crosses ignited to remember the Lewes martyrs appear to be a   innovation. According to Jim Etherington, a local historian and the author of “Lewes Bonfire Night,” their prominence increased in recent decades mainly because the police objected on safety grounds to fireworks in the parade, but seemed more relaxed about fiery crosses. The first recorded reference to November celebrations in Lewes dates from 1697, and over the next century and a half the “Bonfire boys” became increasingly unruly. In 1806, 18 were arrested, and there was a Bonfire Night riot in 1829. By the   there was pressure for more orderly celebrations, leading to the creation of the first bonfire societies, which developed in idiosyncratic ways. Members of the Commercial Square Bonfire Society, for example, adopted American Indian costumes because a handful had spent time in America building railroads in the West. “During their time there, they observed the dreadful treatment of the Native American population,” the Lewes Bonfire Council  website says. Though not exactly secretive, the bonfire societies are not very communicative, either, and the choice of effigies is known only by a handful of people before the unveiling in November. Brian Pugh, another local author, ties the strength of the Bonfire Night tradition to an innate rebelliousness. It is captured by a local saying, “We don’t be druv,” which translates as “We won’t be pushed around and are a bit rebellious,” he said. Perhaps a bigger puzzle is the fact that the Gunpowder Plot  —   and the accompanying rhyme “Remember, remember the fifth of November”  —   is still commemorated in Britain more than four centuries after it failed. What is so strange about that, wrote James Shapiro in “1606: William Shakespeare and the Year of Lear,” is that “the fifth of November recalls a collective experience, a day of communal deliverance on which nothing actually happened. ” He added: “Nobody has fully explained the deep hold that ‘Remember, remember the fifth of November’ continues to have on the British psyche (though its grip seems to be slackening and the image of Guy Fawkes may soon be associated more with the visages on the masks worn by Anonymous protesters). ” It will, however, be some time before Lewes forgets, even if a lot of people here may be hazy about some of the things they are remembering, and perhaps have simpler motives. “What other opportunities do you have,” asked Mr. Etherington, “to dress up in weird and wonderful costumes, when the town has been cleared of traffic?”",0
4485,"Muslims mistake synagogue for mosque in Israeli airport, use prayer shawls as prayer mats - amazingly, nothing happens"," 31 UTC © Yossi Cohen / Facebook Muslim family mistakenly prays in airport synagogue Jews in Israeli Ben Gurion International Airport were quite taken aback after they saw several Turkish Muslims praying in the airport's synagogue, apparently mistaking it for a mosque. The footage was released by Facebook user Yossi Cohen on Monday. ""Today at the synagogue in Ben Gurion airport,"" he wrote under the video. They were all members of one Turkish family, according to Breaking Israeli news. They were apparently looking for a place to pray and found a synagogue which was empty. It was just before the holiday of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that marks the end of the annual cycle of public Torah readings and the beginning of a new cycle. Religious Jews do not usually travel on such days. The family used the available Jewish prayer shawls, also known as tallits, as prayer mats. Tallits are shawls traditionally worn over the clothes by religious Jews during prayers. But when the Muslim family realized that they were praying in the synagogue, they ""folded the shawls and explained that they'd just looked for a place to pray,"" a witness told NRG website. According to the Times of Israel , Ben Gurion Airport doesn't provide any facilities for believers of religions other than Judaism. Some Israelis welcomed the act of praying in the synagogue. According to Yehuda Glick, a member of the Knesset, he himself ""prayed in a mosque"" and he said he is ""happy that Muslims prayed in a synagogue."" ""Where is the embarrassment? I couldn't find any,"" he wrote on Facebook, as cited by Arutz Sheva network. His position was supported by Rabbi David Menachem, rabbi of the Mishkan Yosef synagogue in Jerusalem. ""A group of Muslims from Turkey innocently prayed in the airport synagogue in Ben-Gurion. Innocently and in honor of God,"" he wrote on Facebook. Comment: What a refreshing reaction. Facebook commenter David Auman added (automatic translation): Why is there really no place for Muslims to pray ben gurion airport? At the airport in turkey. They set a place for Jews to pray. (leave it were an issue in one small room with a partition in the middle, one half is for Christians and Jews and the other half... but at least they thought of us )",0
4486,Hurray for the Riff Raff’s Alynda Segarra Finds Herself in a Concept Album - The New York Times,"Alynda Segarra knows what it’s like to live between cultures. As a lonely teenager in the Bronx, she would regularly escape downtown, soaking up Latin poetry slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and hanging out with crusty punks in Tompkins Square Park. “I always remember punk kids saying to me, ‘You’re not Puerto Rican, you’re white,’” Ms. Segarra said. “And the Puerto Rican kids would say: ‘Who dresses like you? Who are you really? ’” The question stung because Ms. Segarra herself didn’t know the answer. “I hadn’t internalized my heritage,” she said. “I was still finding most of my heroes in white men, feeling like they’re the ones who make history. I believed what was shoved down my throat. ” The art she made reflected that view. Even deep into her 20s, as Ms. Segarra rose as a critically admired   on three albums released under the band name Hurray for the Riff Raff, she kept her lineage at bay. Instead, her music explored the blues and folk roots of Americana. Only last year, as she approached her 30th birthday, did Ms. Segarra confront her internalized cultural exile with the intent to reconcile the disparate strands of her identity. The results can be heard on her ambitious new work with the band due on Friday, “The Navigator,” a    concept album that traces the wanderings of a character named Navita Milagros Negrón. Ms. Segarra fashioned the story as an imaginary Off Broadway play “starring” the musicians, “directed by” its producer and featuring a faux Playbill to guide listeners through. The music uses her contradictions to her advantage, mixing rock guitars with bomba rhythms, while melding original lyrics with some verse from the Puerto Rican poet Pedro Pietri. The songs connect the dots in a long history of Latin influences in popular music, from the   harmonies of   to Brill Building hits like “Save the Last Dance for Me,” to the   of Mink DeVille. On a recent winter afternoon, Ms. Segarra returned to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe to discuss her early alienation, framing it, in part, as a product of assimilation. When she was growing up, her mother, Ninfa Segarra, had a thriving career as an educator and a politician, rising to become the deputy mayor of New York under Rudolph W. Giuliani. Her father was a vice principal and a music teacher in the Bronx, where he taught the singer and actor Marc Anthony as a youth. The couple split when Ms. Segarra was a child, and she was reared mainly by her   aunt and uncle in Marble Hill. Ms. Segarra’s father introduced her to the clave rhythms of   music, yet she gravitated more toward the videos of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra beloved by her aunt and uncle. Puberty ignited in her a rebellious side, which found reflection in punk bands like the Dead Kennedys and Bikini Kill. “I started to feel very angry about my place in the world as a girl,” Ms. Segarra said. “I wanted to go wherever I wanted without fear of danger, to be treated the same as my brother. ” In high school, she formed an acoustic punk group with other young women, modeled on the music of the   singer Kimya Dawson. She also began to spend more time in the East Village, identifying with women who shaved their heads but not their armpits. Failing in school and feeling like a drain on her family, Ms. Segarra ran away from home to squat on the Lower East Side. “I was really scared  —   and really hungry,” she said. “But I was determined to live the life of an artist that everyone said was impossible. ” Aching for experience and escape, Ms. Segarra took to the road, hopping trains until she finally ended up settling in New Orleans by her 18th birthday. There, she found street kids she connected with more deeply. Together, they began performing songs by Woody Guthrie, whose wanderings Ms. Segarra’s own had echoed. She lived by busking, getting good enough at her craft to make home recordings that earned some buzz, starting with “It Don’t Mean I Don’t Love You” (2008). In 2014, Ms. Segarra was signed to ATO Records for “Small Town Heroes,” which proved a critical breakthrough. Yet she felt unsatisfied in her work. To focus, she moved to Nashville, where she didn’t know anyone. “I began to ask myself, ‘Who am I when everyone I know is gone? ’” she said. The answer manifested itself in “The Navigator. ” Ms. Segarra felt   to simply mimic Latin rhythms for the album. “‘Ziggy Stardust’ was a eureka moment,” she said, referring to the intergalactic David Bowie album and alter ego. “I learned I could create a character, the Navigator, who would stand at the intersection of all these identities and weave in and out. And I related to being the alien. I began to take that as a badge of honor. ” For musical role models, Ms. Segarra looked to earlier Latin artists heavily influenced by rock, like the Ghetto Brothers, a politically active Puerto Rican street gang turned band that recorded one album in 1971. She also looked to Rodriguez, whom she discovered from the documentary “Searching for Sugarman. ” The album’s lyrics conform to rock rather than to theatrical music, favoring poetic abstractions over clear narrative. Themes of gentrification and cultural appropriation center the work, all boldly delivered by Ms. Segarra’s billowing vibrato. Along the way, she gives a nod to the Young Lords, the Puerto Rican activist group of the ’60s and ’70s. In turn, Ms. Segarra finally took full ownership of her heritage. “Before, when I heard Latin sounds in popular music, I thought: That music belongs to everyone. Now I think: Oh, that’s the sound of where I came from. Look what we brought to the culture. Listen to what we added. ”",0

What could be better than waking up in time to witness the last few minutes of the historic race between the Champion of Deplorables and the Best Friend of Banksters, and to see Trump emerging victorious! Thank you, Lord, for allowing me to see these scenes at all and especially in sunny Jerusalem where I am now, and thank you, our American friends, for achieving this victory. You were not scared when they called you “racist rednecks”, you did not despair when the CNN said (yesterday) that Clinton had a 96% chance of winning. You did not sat down with a bottle of beer, you still went to the booths and voted, God bless you. 
And thank you those who voted against Trump. Ex-Pres. Bush said he did not vote for Trump – why, this news made my day! I am so happy that we do not owe anything, not a single vote in the victory, to the warring Bushmen. It would be embarrassing to find oneself in the same camp as the Butcher of Iraq. John McCain tried to knife Trump, didn’t endorse him – this is also good news. The FBI boss submitted to pressure and supported Clinton instead of adhering to the law: good riddance! 
God bless you, my colleagues and editors of the truly great independent American media, Ron Unz of Unz.com, Jeffrey St Clair of Counterpunch, Justin Raimondo of Antiwar.com! By attacking the corrupted mainstream media, you preserved the dignity and the meaning of our profession, you delivered analysis and opinions to the thinking working men of America. 
God bless you, Julian Assange of Wikileaks, in the windowless room in the Ecuadorian embassy in London! You did so much by publishing the documents nobody dared to touch. Without you, the American people would not know of the evil stratagems in the DNC, of the Podesta plots. You unmasked their plans. These discoveries will provide much material to tomorrow’s media. Let President Donald Trump pardon Julian, for all he did, he did for us, in the great battle against the evil globalizers. And while he’s at it, let him pardon Edward Snowden and Bradley Manning, let them go home in honour. 
Today, mankind has avoided a great danger. We peered into the abyss of Armageddon and quickly moved away. Now the world can fix its many problems. The Middle East wars will soon be over. With defeat of the Daesh Queen Hillary, the fanatic rebels will leave Aleppo for their bases in the Arabian desert and allow Syrians to rebuild their beautiful land. Let Saudis feed and house the ISIS gangs, perhaps they will be useful camel riders. There is enough space in Saudi Arabia for all the jihadis, let them go there and stay there. 
Friendship with Russia will disarm the other source of danger, Eastern Europe. The NATO warmongers will retire to cultivate cucumbers. Estonia will be safe, actually, safer without American tanks. The world does not need so many weapons of mass destruction; the funds can be spent on something better, like affordable medical care for the average Americans. Or indeed infrastructure, as Trump mentioned. 
Minority politics did not work. The women, the white women of America gave their votes to Trump, despite being ordered to march with the sisterhood of Madeleine Albright. US citizens of Mexican origin knew they are being used by people who do not care for them: and they did not bother to go and vote for Clinton. 
What about the Jews? I’ll surprise you: despite many dark hints to the contrary, Israelis were happy with Trump’s victory. The US citizens living in Israel voted for Trump. Religious Jews (in Israel and in the US) voted for Trump. There was a hysterical scream in the Jewish liberal camp, among the gay parade Jews, or among financial Jews, but this is a small though voluble part of Jewish population. 
Indeed Hillary propaganda warriors claimed that all the Jews support Clinton and are afraid of Trump. But not every Jewish woman is called Janet Yellen; not every Jewish man is George Soros (who is very unpopular in Israel) or the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein. Conservative and observant Jews did not like the push against gender normalcy that seems to be the favorite topic for Clinton camp. 
Trump’s idea of a border wall is already a success in Israel: such a wall has been built between Israel and Egypt’s Sinai. Before the wall was built, tens of thousands of African job-seekers flooded Israel; since the wall has been completed about one hundred plucky persons made it. The liberals in Israel demanded to provide full rights to the refugees from Eritrea and Sudan, who were housed in the poor Jewish neighborhoods. There was a lot of aggravation, and the wall solved it all. 
In short, the claim for “all the Jews” has been as false as the claim for “all the women”. One can expect that the Jews will produce a new community leadership instead of the old one that had been tainted with hatred to working class whites and to the Christian church. It is possible: Jews are very flexible, and they usually know the difference between what they want and what they can get. 
The Palestinians I meet these days in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah do not regret the Fall of the House of Clinton. They have gotten nothing from the Democratic Presidents. They were obedient to AIPAC and quick to veto every pro-Palestinian resolution. Is there a possible solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Yes, this is called One State Solution. Let Israel absorb all Palestinian territories and populations, give them equal rights, as the Americans did to their minorities. Provided the equal rights campaign in the US had been very popular with American Jews, surely they will love to repeat it in Israel, too. ORDER IT NOW 
Palestinian Christians, a big native community, are especially happy with defeat of Clinton who was partial to radical Muslims of the Middle East. They hope the US and Russia will help to rebuild the community and will protect them from the extreme Zionists and Wahhabis’ rage. 
The Russians are flabbergasted with Trump’s victory. Yes, many of them hoped and prayed for Trump, but practically all Russians I know of were damn sure that Clinton would win despite the popular vote. After being manipulated for years, the Russians had lost their belief in democratic process. They were certain that the banks, the Pentagon, the Supreme Court and the media will force Clinton’s election through. My friends in the Russian pro-Kremlin media did not believe that in the US, people’s will may prevail over the Masters of Discourse. Ye of small faith, I told them, everything can happen if we want it. Now they learned that not everything is “sxvacheno” (agreed and decided in advance). 
Trump’s victory is the great triumph of democracy, the next after the Brexit. Twice within one year, the people of England and America proved they can achieve what they want, even if the globalizing elites of bankers and media will stand against them. We can hope that the elections in Europe will follow this new pattern of true democracy, instead of the fake one practiced recently. France may be first to get her Trump, Marine Le Pen. 
If Clinton had won, there would be more transgender toilets, more immigrants and more wars. Not much fun. Now we are entering the whole new world of new ideas and deeds. There are hundreds of suggestions ripe to be implemented. Donald Trump can borrow a leaf from Kennedy’s book and immediately start a nation-wide discussion of what can be done. Trump can harness the energy of the masses like has not been done for a century. And yesterday’s betrayed Sandernistas can take a prominent place in this transformation. 
The interesting – and dangerous – part begins right now, after the election. The New York Times has already proposed: “Trump can be a good president. He just needs to forget most of what he said on the campaign trail.” What is good for the New York Times is bad for Trump’s voters and supporters. We hope Trump will avoid the danger of being co-opted by the people who besmirched him yesterday. Let him implement his ideas. And let us help him to lead us into a better and newer world.

4489,America's Trump supporters may be lured to Florida and walled in by US government to maintain peaceful transfer of power after election.,"Search  America's Trump supporters may be lured to Florida and walled in by US government to maintain peaceful transfer of power after election. Topics: Donald Trump , 2016 Presidential Election , presidential politics Wednesday, 26 October 2016 
A leaked transcript of a White house meeting reveals plans to lure the country's Trump Voters to Florida on election day and wall them in to help ensure the peaceful transfer of power. 
Voice #1: ""The traditional peaceful transfer of power after a presidential election, fundamental to our democracy, is in jeopardy. What happens if Trump somehow wins? Will Barrack and Hilary say they were just kidding about him being a truly dangerous unfit con artist and no hard feelings about that 5 year long race baiting Birther movement as US military leaders walk over to Trump with the nuclear codes?"" 
Voice #2: ""Trump will probably lose. Still, that doesn't guarantee a peaceful transition. Trump's already convinced a majority of his supporters the election is illegitimate if he loses. He's recruiting voting station vigilantes. Trump supporter sheriff David Clarke from Milwaukee said its time for 'pitch forks and torches. How many of Trump's gun loving hard core base might do something violent?"" 
Voice #1: ""I'm just thinking out loud, but what if we announce that to offset the rigged election, Trump negotiated a deal in which anyone that casts a Trump vote in Florida will have it counted as two votes from their home state. Then, we announce the greatest Trump rally of all time on election day in Florida; the largest NASCAR event; the largest Harley Davidson motorcycle convention, free assault rifles handed out as they cross the border..."" 
Voice #2: ""Where are you going with this?"" 
Voice #1: ""We lure hard core Trump voters in to Florida; get them packed in there; and then quickly unfurl a razor wire fence along the state's north border stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. Then, we start construction of the real wall right next to it. That's a wall Mexico might be willing to pay for."" 
Voice #2: ""What about the Hillary supporters in Florida?"" 
Voice #1: ""We'd have to get them out somehow. Give them incentives to vote in South Carolina, or airlift them out of Florida after the election."" 
Voice #2: ""If it worked, it would get crowded down there in Florida."" 
Voice # 1: ""We could promise Trump supporters free housing."" 
Voice #4: ""Yes. We can put them in tent cities modeled after Syrian refugee camps."" 
Voice #1: ""I'm trying to be serious."" 
Voice #4: ""The Red Cross might pay for that tent city; just tell them we're quarantining people to stop the spread of a resurgent xenophobe epidemic."" 
Voice #2: ""What about after the election? It's not like we can just let them back in after the peaceful transfer of power. They're going to be upset for a while."" 
Voice #4: ""We could let a few of them back in every year. They'd have to go through 'extreme vetting'. As immigrants re-entering the upper 49, we'd need assurances they'd developed American values like tolerance for different religions and ethnicities."" 
Voice #1: ""We'll worry about what to do with them later. First we have to lure them down there."" 
Voice #4: ""What about appealing to Trump voter anti-elitism? We could tell them Florida universities will be shut down and demolished."" 
Voice #1: ""Not fair. A lot of Trump supporters want to send their kids to college."" 
Voice #4: ""They can go to Trump University."" 
Voice #2: ""Trump University doesn't have real academics."" 
Voice #4: ""We'll create some. We'll appoint Trump surrogate Katrina Pierson as chair of the 'Revisionist History Department.' Scholarly emphasis will be on how Obama and then secretary of state Hilary got us in to Afghanistan and Iraq and founded ISIS. Scottie Nell Hughes will head up the 'Ethics in Media' department. Rudy Giuliani can head the 'Institute for study of Giuliani's heroic role after the 9/11 attacks."" 
Voice #1: ""If you don't have anything practical to..."" 
Voice #4: ""We could say Trump supporters wearing T-shirts saying ""Hillary sucks, but not as good as Monica"", or ""Trump that Bitch,"" will get preferential seating at the rally. If they also claim to hate Muslim societies because of how awful they treat their women, they also get to meet Trump backstage."" 
Voice #2: ""One thing. If we actually do this, Marco Rubio is not getting out of Florida. And he thought that his little cowardly Trump endorsement video at the GOP convention wasn't going to haunt him."" 
Voice #1: ""What about Healthcare in post-election day Florida? People with MD degrees are mostly Hilary supporters. There won't be many doctors down there."" 
Voice #2: ""They'll have Ben Carson."" 
Voice #4: ""We could also send in Harold Bornstein, that doctor who wrote the fake Trump medical statement in 5 minutes. Bornstein can claim that everyone's health in Florida is astonishingly excellent; the best he's ever seen'. That way, nobody has to get any treatments."" 
Voice #1: ""Seriously, what about emergencies like gunshot wounds, heart attacks..."" 
Voice #4: ""Dr. Oz could hang out in emergency rooms and sell DVDs of his show."" 
Voice #2: ""How would post-election Florida be governed?"" 
Voice #4: ""Offer Vladimir Putin a governorship. Tell him he can put a few short range nuclear missals in Cuba; like ones that could only reach Tallahassee; as long as Governor Putin agrees to act with stronger leadership than the weak soft president Obama. 
And since Trump thinks the American media is so awful, Putin could help him reform Florida laws on journalists and free speech."" 
Voice #2: ""Would Florida get any federal money?"" 
Voice #4: ""Definitely would need some kind of Florida 'Trump tax'. This extra money would be used to offset the lack of taxes paid by Trump himself. The rest of the money would go to Trump's charity to fund any Trump purchases of autographed football helmets of evangelical athletes, or portraits of himself."" 
Voice #2: ""We could lure Trump voters to Florida with promises of VA reforms."" 
Voice #4: ""Yes. Then when they're walled in, we announce that POW military pensions will be cut in half because they let the country down by getting caught. We'll name it the 'Pathetic John McCain Endorsement of Trump VA Penalty."" 
Voice #2: ""Stop. What kind of real changes would draw Trump voters to Florida?"" 
Voice #1: ""We could tell them Florida will have the strictest bathroom laws; that correct gender will be checked by DNA analysis before anyone's allowed in a public bathroom."" 
Voice #4: ""Then, once their walled in, we'll project holograms of naked transsexuals standing next to every urinal and toilet."" 
Voice #1: ""We could lure them by saying how great the Florida beaches are."" 
Voice #4: ""Yes. Then, when in there we mandate a statewide program; a photo of every woman who puts on a bathing suit will be posted online with a video of Trump critiquing her body."" 
Voice #1: ""How do we get evangelical Trump supporters down there?"" 
Voice #4: ""We could say we're converting all Florida planned parenthood operations in to 'defense of marriage clinics' where homosexuals can be sent for conversion therapy. Anyone caught performing or having an abortion would be subject to the death penalty. Then, on Sundays as families enter churches, we'll play a looped audio tape of Trump bragging he can grab any woman's pussy he wants. 
Weigh stations will be set up at random pedestrian intersections. All females will be weighed. A database tracking weight gain will be publicly available. Biggest weekly gainers will be forced to exercise at a televised press conference as Trump mocks them while eating a McDonald's hamburger. 
Any Trump tweets between the hours of 3 and 5 AM will set off warning alarms in every Florida cell phone. The tweet will then be read by the phones voice robot until the user takes the battery out. 
On a 24 video channel, every Trump female voter in Florida cheated on by a male partner must explain why she enabled his infidelity. Then she must apologize to the women her partner cheated with, in case they were made to feel insulted or uncomfortable. 
I don't think it would hurt to build some David Duke statues in Florida. 1. They might increase Trump white supremacist voter presence. 2. They might remind Trump who David Duke is; in case somebody on TV asks him if he would denounce David Duke or the KKK. Ben Carson and Pastor Mark Burns can unveil the David Duke statues. 
On every female Florida drivers license, there will be a section filled in by Trump marked either 'yes' or 'no' indicating whether Trump thinks the woman is attractive enough to be groped sexually without consent. 
A memorial will be built at the site of the Orlando nightclub massacre. We'll erect a large lit up plastic trump face smiling next to a sign that reads 'Thanks for all your congratulations on me predicting this mass shooting by Obama backed Islamic radicals..."" 
Voice #1: ""I'm not sure if your kidding or not."" Make Keith Vosseller's  ",0
4490,Trump Condemns ’Evil Losers’ Behind Manchester Concert Massacre,"JERUSALEM  —   Speaking at a joint press conference today with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, U. S. President Donald Trump condemned the “evil losers” who carried out last night’s bombing of a pop concert in Manchester in which at least 22 people were murdered. [“I extend my deepest condolences to those terribly injured in this terrorist attack, and to the many killed, and the families, so many families, of the victims,” Trump said. “We stand in absolute solidarity with the people in the United Kingdom. So many young innocent people living and enjoying their lives, murdered by evil losers in life. ”  “I won’t call them monsters, because they would like that term,” he continued. “They would think that’s a great name. I will call them from now on losers, because that’s what they are, they’re losers. and we’ll have more of them, but they’re losers. Just remember that. ” “This is what I’ve spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas,” Trump said, referring to combatting terrorism. “Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed. We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people. ” “The terrorists and extremists and those who give them aid and comfort must be driven out from our society forever,” Trump added. “This wicked ideology must be obliterated, and I mean completely obliterated, and innocent life must be protected. All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace. ”",0
4491,India’s Air Pollution Rivals China’s as World’s Deadliest - The New York Times,"NEW DELHI  —   India’s rapidly worsening air pollution is causing about 1. 1 million people to die prematurely each year and is now surpassing China’s as the deadliest in the world, a new study of global air pollution shows. The number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous air particles, known as PM2. 5, has stabilized globally in recent years but has risen sharply in India, according to the report, issued jointly on Tuesday by the Health Effects Institute, a Boston research institute focused on the health impacts of air pollution, and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a population health research center in Seattle. India has registered an alarming increase of nearly 50 percent in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015, the report says. “You can almost think of this as the perfect storm for India,” said Michael Brauer, a professor of environment and health relationships at the University of British Columbia and an author of the study, in a telephone interview. He cited the confluence of rapid industrialization, population growth and an aging populace in India that is more susceptible to air pollution. Pollution levels are worsening in India as it tries to industrialize, but “the idea that policy making should be led by government is lacking,” Bhargav Krishna, manager for environmental health at the Public Health Foundation of India, a health policy research center in New Delhi, said in an interview. As air pollution worsened in parts of the world, including South Asia, it improved in the United States and Europe, the report said, crediting policies to curb emissions, among other things. The report’s website that provides    data on pollution levels and the health and mortality effects. Environmental regulations in the United States and actions by the European Commission have led to substantial progress in reducing fine particulate pollution since 1990, the report said. The United States has experienced a reduction of about 27 percent in the average annual exposure to fine particulate matter, with smaller declines in Europe. Yet, some 88, 000 Americans and 258, 000 Europeans still face increased risks of premature death because of particulate levels today, the report said. A fraction of the width of a human hair, these particles can be released from vehicles, particularly those with diesel engines, and by industry, as well as from natural sources like dust. They enter the bloodstream through the lungs, worsening cardiac disease and increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure, in addition to causing severe respiratory problems, like asthma and pneumonia. The report offers good news globally, in some ways. Although deaths caused by air pollution grew to 4. 2 million in 2015 from 3. 5 million in 1990, the rate of increase of about 20 percent was slower than the rate of the population rise during that time. That’s because of improved health care in many parts of the world, as well as public policy initiatives undertaken in the United States, Europe and other regions that reduced emissions from industrialization, the authors of the study said in telephone interviews. China also offers an encouraging sign. Premature deaths from particulate matter each year have stabilized at around 1. 1 million since 2005, the report said. Still, that is an increase of 17 percent since 1990, when it was a little more than 945, 000. The health effects of the ultrafine particles are still being studied and the full effects are only beginning to be understood, said Majid Ezzati, a global environmental health professor at the Imperial College, London. “These studies are hard to do, and isolating the effects of air pollution is hard,” Dr. Ezzati said. “The numbers are still dynamic and nobody should claim an exact number of deaths is known. ” But if he were an Indian citizen, he said, “I’d say, ‘Let’s not sit there and do nothing about it. Let’s not be exposed to it today as more research is being done. ’” Although few studies of the health problems brought by air pollution are based in India, Dr. Ezzati said, “it’s hard to imagine air pollution that is bad for people in London is not bad for people in India. ” Neither India’s environment minister nor its environment secretary could be reached for comment Monday evening. Robert O’Keefe, vice president at the Health Effects Institute, said China’s trajectory on deaths from air pollution had stabilized as a result of the country’s efforts to reduce air pollution. India, on the other hand, had yet to undertake sustained public policy initiatives to reduce pollution, said Gopal Sankaranarayanan, an advocate at the Supreme Court of India who successfully petitioned it to ban licenses to sell fireworks in the New Delhi metropolitan area last year. Fireworks during the festival of Diwali contributed to hazardous levels of air pollution late last year. Weak environmental regulation in India, he said, leaves India’s citizens with few alternatives other than to petition the courts to take action to protect the public’s health. But the courts often lack the power or mechanisms to enforce their actions, he said. India’s environmental court, the National Green Tribunal, ordered farmers to stop burning their crops in the region around New Delhi in 2015, but the practice still continued last year. Smoke from the farm fires contributed about one quarter of the levels of the most dangerous air pollution in the Indian capital, environmental experts said. “If you can’t enforce the directives of the courts  —   it becomes a problem,” Mr. Sankaranarayanan said. “We need practical solutions to save lives here in India. ”",0
4492,Anthony Weiner Says His Wife Never Agreed to That Documentary - The New York Times,"Caged mongoose that he is, Anthony Weiner is not easily contained. Neither was my interview with the former congressman, mayoral candidate and apparent sexting recidivist, which appears in this weekend’s Talk feature of the magazine. I spoke to Weiner for about 90 minutes on the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last month. Because of the early deadlines and long lead times of our print edition, almost three weeks elapsed between our discussion and publication  —   during which The New York Post reported (last weekend) that Weiner seemed to be engaging in more of the kinds of online dalliances that ended his career in Congress in 2011 and blew up his campaign to become mayor of New York in 2013. This time, according to The Post, Weiner was apparently flirting with a college student posing as a female named “Nikki. ” (Weiner reportedly boasted to Nikki that he was “deceptively strong . . . like a mongoose. ”) When I asked Weiner in Philadelphia whether he was still engaging in the activities that got him in trouble, he waved me off. “I’m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that,” he said. (He demurred again when I contacted him this week following the Post report.) O. K. fine. But Weiner was eager to engage on all manner of other matters. What follows is a bonus rendering of our encounter. We convened in the lobby bar of the Logan Hotel a few hours before Hillary Clinton would be giving her acceptance speech to the convention that night. Weiner had recently been in a heavy exposure phase, in a more traditional sense. He had appeared that week as a guest on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and “Real Time With Bill Maher. ’’ He was also engaging in spirited political arguments across many platforms. “I get pleasure  —   I don’t think it’s perverse pleasure, but good, honest, wholesome pleasure  —   by infuriating these Trump trolls,” Weiner told me. “That’s a hornet’s nest I don’t mind kicking at all. ” Weiner was in the news a day earlier: Donald Trump had called Clinton a security risk, citing among other things her close relationship with Weiner’s wife, Huma Abedin, a top adviser. Abedin, Trump said, is “married to Anthony Weiner, who’s a sleazeball and pervert. . . . I don’t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets. ” I asked Weiner what it has been like to have Huma dragged into these   . “” he told me. “I’ve never seen a staffer targeted like that. I don’t engage on that at all. ” After about 20 minutes in the hotel bar, Weiner was summoned by an aide, and we boarded a van that would shuttle us to the Wells Fargo Arena. We pulled out of the hotel driveway and promptly plowed into a parked limousine  —   with a loud crunching sound. No one was injured, though Weiner’s volunteer driver for the D. N. C. a local college student named Tim, was clearly shaken and upset. Weiner, who had been talking to his    son, Jordan, over a speakerphone, jumped out of the van to direct traffic around the mishap. He evinced the   demeanor of a man who was accustomed to handling things, someone very much in his element amid chaos. Weiner comforted both drivers and oversaw the exchange of insurance information. At one point, he instructed Tim to back up the van, which nearly resulted in a second collision, this time with a police car. “Now, Tim, if you would have gone into reverse, and hit that guy, which you almost did, that would be a legitimate lifelong   story,” Weiner told Tim as the nervous volunteer maneuvered the     van toward the arena. One subject I was interested in discussing with Weiner was “Weiner,” the critically lauded documentary about his disastrous mayoral campaign. Weiner’s campaign melted down following reports of countless instances of the candidate’s tweeting dirty pictures of himself  —   the fallout from which was captured by the filmmakers in excruciating    detail. Weiner said neither he nor his wife had seen the film and had no plans to. When he agreed to participate, he obviously envisioned a movie that would have a much happier ending, ideally starring Mayor Weiner and First Lady Huma. And his comeback triumph would be immortalized on screens much bigger than the   ones that brought him down. For what it’s worth, Weiner’s   made for a much better movie, at least for viewers. But I was still curious: Why, after the scandal broke, given the personal and embarrassing nature of it, didn’t Weiner just stop allowing access to the “Weiner” cameras? Weiner mentioned that one of the filmmakers, Josh Kriegman, was a friend and former aide, and he felt a degree of loyalty to him. “I generally wasn’t going to pull the plug,” he said. I asked Weiner whether his wife got a vote on this. “Um, so here’s the thing,” Weiner said. “I haven’t told  —   I haven’t gone here yet with anybody. So, they violated the agreement not to use her. ” The filmmakers had told Weiner that they would not include Abedin in the film without her permission, he said. “They didn’t have a release,” he told me. “She had to grant permission, which she didn’t. ” Kriegman is traveling on vacation and could not be reached. Lisa Califf, spokeswoman and counsel for the film, disputed that any agreement had been breached. “As is clear in the film, the filmmakers had consent from everyone who appears in the film, including Anthony and Huma,” said Califf via email. Weiner said Kriegman had assured him verbally and in emails that he would not use Abedin in the film without her consent. Both Weiner and Abedin were infuriated when they learned the film would go forward, and prominently feature    footage of Abedin. (In a   phone conversation, Califf said she could not discuss details relating to any discussions that took place between Kriegman and Weiner.) I asked Weiner if he had any plans to sue the filmmakers. “I mean, who knows what happens in the future,” he said. Is Kriegman still his friend? “Look, I like him,” Weiner said. “I just think this was a venal thing by someone who’s not venal. I mean, maybe I’ll get over it, maybe I won’t. ” Weiner said he and Abedin are rarely in the same place these days. She is off traveling with Clinton much of the time, and he is spending the bulk of his in New York, often taking care of Jordan. He said he had been back to Washington only twice since leaving Congress five years ago. He does not miss it, but allowed that there’s a good chance his wife could wind up back in D. C. if Clinton wins. “We haven’t figured that out yet,” Weiner said of his plans for after the election. “I mean, talking to Huma about it is like talking to a pitcher in the sixth inning while he’s pitching a  . You don’t want to jinx anything. ” As Weiner’s dented van wound through traffic and security checkpoints, we pulled up to a side entrance of the Wells Fargo arena as scores of dignitaries were arriving. Representative Steny Hoyer, the House Democratic whip, emerged from the S. U. V. in front of ours. Weiner approached his former colleague to say hello. “Hi, I’m Anthony Weiner,” he said, extending his hand. “I used to be somebody. ”",0
4493,"Hillary Clinton, Zika, Syria: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton’s diagnosis of pneumonia has grounded her for a few days and shifted the focus of the presidential race to the candidates’ health. Mrs. Clinton, 68, and Donald Trump, 70, have promised to release more detailed information from their doctors. The issue isn’t just their state of vigor but whether they operate with more insularity than transparency. Mr. Trump also demanded that Mrs. Clinton apologize for calling some of his supporters “deplorables” and released an ad showcasing the remarks on national cable and in four battleground states. _____ 2. President Obama will veto a bill that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, the White House said. Since both the House and Senate passed the legislation with majorities, the president could face the first veto override of his presidency. He also met with congressional leaders, above, to discuss measures needed to finance the government after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, since lawmakers have not agreed on a budget. _____ 3. The U. N. secretary general, Ban   is racing to get the Paris climate agreement into effect  —   possibly even before the U. S. election. The pact goes into force when 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally sign on, conditions that are more than halfway met. The world’s three largest emitters  —   the U. S. China, above and Brazil  —   are on board. This year is shaping up to be the third consecutive hottest on record, and some scientists warn that the oceans’ ability to absorb excess heat has masked the scale of the problem. These graphics lay out the issues. _____ 4. The N. C. A.

The N. B. A. already moved next February’s   Game from Charlotte, and stars like Bruce Springsteen and Itzhak Perlman have canceled concerts in the state. _____ 5. Florida’s offer of free Zika testing for pregnant women has increased rather than decreased their anxieties. That’s because so many responded that state labs are overwhelmed, and the wait for results can stretch to six weeks, complicating already difficult decisions about possibly terminating pregnancies.

4495,"After a Crime, the Price of a Second Chance - The New York Times","During the tough financial times of 2011, Marcy Willis, a single mother who raised five children in Atlanta, used her credit card to rent a car for an acquaintance in exchange for cash. But the man  —   and the car  —   disappeared, she said. Four months later, when Ms. Willis finally recovered the car and returned it, she was charged with felony theft. As a   offender, Ms. Willis, 52, qualified for a big break: a program called pretrial intervention, also known as diversion. If she took 12 weeks of classes, performed 24 hours of community service and stayed out of trouble, her case would be dismissed and her arrest could be expunged, leaving her record clean. Diversion is not uncommon. Last year, Rebecca Horting, a    nurse in Topeka, Kan. was offered a similar deal for an offense that caused far greater harm. She was charged with reckless battery and texting while driving after she hit a girl on a bicycle, causing brain damage and the loss of a leg. Both women did what was required of them, yet their cases took different paths. The reason: money. Ms. Horting was able to pay $1, 138 in fees and is on track to have her case dismissed. Ms. Willis, who owed $690, had a harder time. When she paid all but $240, her case was sent back to court for prosecution. By that time, the arrest had already led to her losing her job, and then her apartment. At a homeless shelter, she was robbed. Accustomed to earning a living, she began to despair. “I felt like I was in a grave or a hole and instead of digging the dirt out, it was piling up,” Ms. Willis said. “I lost the respect of my kids, my family, and I was too embarrassed to reach out to friends  —   so what do you do?” Though few people have heard of diversion, the practice is increasingly being embraced as a way for the criminal justice system to save people from itself. Diversion is intended to relieve overburdened courts and crowded jails, and to spare   offenders from the devastating consequences of a criminal record. It mostly applies to nonviolent cases that make up the vast majority of crimes  —   offenses like shoplifting, drug possession and theft. There are now diversion programs in almost every state. But an examination by The New York Times found that in many places, only people with money could afford a second chance. Though diversion was introduced as a   reform, some jurisdictions quickly turned it into a source of revenue. Prosecutors exert almost total control over diversion, deciding who deserves mercy and at what price, The Times found. The prosecutors who grant diversion often benefit directly from the fees, which vary widely from town to town and can reach $5, 000 for a single offense. In a country where 27 million households make less than $25, 000 a year, even $500 can be prohibitive. Diversion, interviews and case records show, can be revoked for failure to pay, or never even offered to defendants deemed too poor to afford it. A prosecutor in Ohio said he rejected applicants if he thought they wouldn’t be able to pay restitution within a time limit  —   one that he imposed. “To tell somebody that if you can pay for this, you can get your charges dismissed, but if you are poor you are going to go through the system? That’s completely unfair,” said Mark Kammerer, who runs diversion programs for the Cook County state’s attorney in Chicago, where defendants are not charged a fee. The Times examination focused on adult diversion programs run by prosecutors, as opposed to drug courts or mental health courts where a judge is in charge. The Times gathered information, statutes and fee schedules on 225 diversion programs in 37 states and interviewed more than 150 prosecutors, defense lawyers, defendants and experts. Because prosecutors have wide latitude to design the programs, different jurisdictions have different rules, resulting in substantial inequities for defendants, records and interviews show. Tennesseans cannot get diversion for drunken driving, but in Oregon it is common. In Saline County, Kan. diversion is not offered for drug offenses three counties south, it is. In Toms River, N. J. a school district official accused of a $141 fraud was rejected by the prosecutor, who argued that she had violated the public trust. But near   N. C. a prosecutor accused of offering $20, 000 to fix an election was allowed to enter pretrial diversion. Because diversion is considered a privilege, not a right, the district attorney’s decision is almost always final and those who are rejected have no way to appeal. Yet even defendants who are granted diversion can discover that the central promise of the program  —   avoiding prosecution and a criminal record  —   can be an empty one. Dismissed cases can still show up as a black mark in a background check. And many district attorneys impose rules that undermine the benefits of diversion, such as requiring defendants to enter a guilty plea that can later be used against them. Some defendants find themselves saddled with strict requirements, like hundreds of hours of community service, five years of probation or even a month in jail, that are indistinguishable from punishment. Because prosecutors are usually not required to report on their programs and many diversion agreements are not filed in court, there is little quantifiable data on fees, success rates, recidivism or even who is rejected. A few studies, including a recent Department of Justice examination of the Memphis juvenile court system, suggest that whites are far more likely to get diversion than blacks. Almost 200 defense lawyers across the country answered a Times questionnaire about diversion.   of them said fees were a barrier for their clients. In Atlanta, Ms. Willis’s diversion was overseen by a private company that said about one in four of its cases was returned to court, often for failure to pay. Because of a court backlog, Ms. Willis’s case remained pending, and on her record, for more than four years. Finally, in January, she scraped together the remaining $240 and, with the help of the Georgia Justice Project, got the case dismissed. Now, her record has been approved for expungement  —   as soon as she can pay the $25 fee. In the aging rust belt towns of Lorain County, Ohio, diversion operates under the sole authority of Dennis Will, the prosecuting attorney. Mr. Will allows arresting officers and victims to block diversion. Defendants who enter the program pay only a modest fee but must plead guilty and pay off all restitution within a year. Though state law allows diversion for violent offenders in certain circumstances, Mr. Will does not. Lawyers there said diversion applicants had been denied because of unrelated prior offenses like driving with a suspended license or drunken driving. “It was very difficult to get anybody in diversion,” said one local lawyer, Kenneth Ortner. “It was a joke among defense attorneys. ” A national panel had something else in mind when it drew up standards in 2008 for pretrial diversion. The programs had been around for decades, but fell out of favor during the war on drugs. With the tide turning against incarceration, the idea was to reintroduce diversion as an alternative, said Spurgeon Kennedy, the vice president of the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies, which drafted the standards. Diversion is intended to address the root causes of crime by connecting defendants to counseling, job training and, in the case of a Philadelphia man caught with painkillers, medical benefits to cover a   root canal. It also gives prosecutors a   way to avoid absurd outcomes. A Georgia college student who hacked into the online calendar of the school’s football rival and left a prank message faced up to 15 years in prison. He got diversion instead. Brendan Kelly, a prosecutor in Illinois, started offering diversion four years ago after seeing marijuana arrests having “tremendous impact” on the future of young   men. “You’re branding them with a scarlet F” for felon, Mr. Kelly said. “You’re making them a permanent problem for law enforcement. ” But diversion is not without political risk, and it requires officials to balance questions of culpability, justice and mercy. In Chattanooga, Tenn. there was a public outcry when a speeding teenager was given diversion after a fatal crash. In San Antonio, on the other hand, a district attorney reluctant to use diversion was unseated. In Lorain County, Mr. Will said, voters have the ultimate say. “If people don’t like the decisions I make, then they have a way to deal with that. ” Frustrated by Mr. Will’s rules, county judges decided to take the matter into their own hands. In 2010, they started a competing program. James Burge, a judge at the time, said the legislature had intended for many more defendants to get diversion. “You find a credit card on the ground and you use it. That’s an automatic felony. You come in to Judge Burge and you plead guilty. You’re going to be on probation for at least 18 months and you’re going to have a felony conviction,” Mr. Burge said. “You have to wait another three years to get that record sealed. That’s four to five years as a young adult with a felony record. Try to buy a car, get a job, get a loan  —   it’s not happening. ” The judges’ diversion program gave a second chance to some defendants who had been rejected by Mr. Will. Among them was Wayne Dopart, who had been indicted on theft and Medicaid fraud charges. Mr. Will did not believe that Mr. Dopart could pay the thousands of dollars he owed in the case within a year, his lawyer recalled. But when Mr. Dopart was admitted to the judges’ program, he paid on time. Brenda   who was charged with theft, was denied diversion because her arresting officer objected, according to court records. Corey Earl, a former police officer accused of cashing a $400 stolen check shortly after retiring from the force, was also deemed ineligible. Both Ms.   and Mr. Earl successfully completed the judges’ diversion program. Of the 21 defendants listed in one court filing who had been granted diversion by the judges, only two had subsequent charges in Lorain County. But defendants like Ms.   and Mr. Earl were not in the clear. Instead, they found themselves ensnared in a legal battle between the judges and the prosecutor. Mr. Will argued repeatedly to the appeals court that only prosecutors had the power to grant diversion. Several of the judges’ completed diversion cases were overturned and the defendants were forced to return to court. Ms.   pleaded guilty and now has a felony record. Mr. Earl’s diversion was upheld, but he has been unable to get the case expunged from his record so he can find work. Mr. Will argued that because Mr. Earl was a police officer, “it is important for the public to maintain a public record of when this public figure admitted to violating that trust. ” Early last year,    Caleb Moore was arrested in Troy, Ala. on charges of possessing Xanax and marijuana. Mr. Moore is the son of Roy Moore, at the time the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Despite having three prior   arrests, Caleb Moore was granted pretrial diversion, paying $900. After he promised to enter drug rehab, his case was dismissed. But not every defendant is the son of a prominent jurist. The vast majority are poor people for whom $900 is well out of reach. Yet in many jurisdictions, they are required to pay the same fees as   defendants. Diversion programs have complex fee structures, and it is impossible to come up with an average cost. To begin with, some defendants must pay just to find out whether they are eligible The Times found nonrefundable application fees as high as $250. If accepted, defendants almost always pay a program fee, typically a few hundred dollars but in some places far higher. Drunken driving diversion is often the most expensive in the city of Dothan, Ala. it costs up to $5, 000. The list of additional charges can be long: counseling, classes, drug tests, monthly supervision, charitable contributions, court costs, prosecution costs and compensation for the arresting agency. The Times found cases where defendants who were not being prosecuted paid a $400 drug lab fee, a $50 Crime Stoppers fee or $2, 000 for the services of an indigent defense lawyer. District attorneys are sometimes willing to adjust their diversion policies for the right price. In Shawnee County, Kan. defendants who might not normally be considered eligible can get diversion if they agree to pay more than the usual fee  —   sometimes thousands of dollars more  —   said Matt Patterson, the district attorney’s chief of staff. Asked if the fees are ever waived for the poor, Mr. Patterson gave a long sigh. “Not really, to be honest with you,” he said. The same is true in many places. “Pretrial diversion is a voluntary program,” reads the prosecutor’s website in Florida’s 18th judicial circuit, in all capital letters. “Fees are not eligible for reduction or waiver. ” While some jurisdictions do make allowances for the poor, The Times found sliding scales that exist largely in theory. In South Carolina, state lawmakers capped the diversion fee at $350 and said it might be waived for indigent defendants. But waivers remain an afterthought at best. In a review of diversion guidelines issued by 13 of the state’s 16 prosecutors, only two mentioned the possibility of a waiver. In interviews, several prosecutors seemed to have given little consideration to whether the costs exclude defendants. “I guess you’re right,” said Ron Dixon, a longtime prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga. when asked if fees kept people out of the program. Scott Colom, who last year was elected district attorney in eastern Mississippi with help from the liberal billionaire George Soros, said he ran on a platform of expanding diversion but kept the fee the same as his predecessor, assuming it was cheap compared with other places. It is $1, 320. That fee does cover services that cost extra in other jurisdictions, like drug testing and counseling. It can also be paid over time, which makes diversion more accessible. It is impossible to determine how many defendants are barred from diversion for lack of money, but one jurisdiction offers a hint. The diversion program in New Orleans once cost as much as $1, 200 and had about 300 participants. In 2009, when a new district attorney lowered the cost to $200, participation more than tripled. But some jurisdictions have come to rely on diversion revenue. In 2015, Wichita, Kan. brought in almost $1. 2 million, an increase of 49 percent over 2010. Diversion fees have received little scrutiny: They are rarely challenged in court, and district attorneys are seldom required to give a detailed account of how they spend the money. With so few checks and balances, the money can easily become a source of temptation. In 2013, a Nebraska prosecutor pleaded guilty to donating diversion money to a trapshooting team. In 2009, the district attorney in Shawnee County was found to have paid himself more than $300, 000 from the pretrial diversion and forfeiture funds. The county attorney in Brown County, Tex. is under investigation for accepting what he called donations of as much as $2, 500  —   the state maximum diversion fee is $500  —   in exchange for diversion. Some critics say diversion fees do not pass the smell test no matter how the money is used. “It’s almost like you’re paying for a dismissal,” said Lynn Pride Richardson, the chief public defender in Dallas. “And that is illegal. ” Some prosecutors said fees were necessary to cover programs’ costs. In other cases, defendants were used as piggy banks. Scott Anderson, who worked in the Topeka city prosecutor’s office, said the city’s fee structure had pure revenue “built in,” even though the program saved the city money. “The way we explained it to defendants  —   this is going to sound terrible  —   it was the benefit of the bargain for us: what the city was getting for not prosecuting you,” said Mr. Anderson, who has since become a public defender in Wichita. “When I was a prosecutor, it didn’t present a problem to me. But I’ve been a defense attorney now for 11 months, and it’s been an ” Mr. Anderson said. “I didn’t realize how many people we were actually disenfranchising from participating. ” By title, Amrith Aakre is an assistant prosecutor in Cook County, which encompasses Chicago. But what she really does is save people from prosecution. One morning in June, she sorted paperwork from the previous night’s arrests into two stacks: eligible for diversion, or probably not. A sheaf of paperwork from a huge drug bust went into the “no” pile. But on other cases, Ms. Aakre paused to take a closer look. She picked up one case, a car  . “You see   damage like shattering windows, a violent component,” she said. “We’re looking at the public safety risk. This happened across the street from a school at 12 o’clock, when all the kids were outside at recess. ” Next, she checked the defendant’s history. “We’re looking for a pattern  —   is this a   thing or is there a long pattern of violence? If it’s a   thing, this may be the gateway. There is a saying, ‘The more you do it, the more you do it.’ And this is our opportunity to catch them at an early stage and give them the services to cope with whatever they’re dealing with. ” Cook County’s diversion programs, recognized as a national model, handle about 5, 000 defendants a year. The emphasis is on inclusion: A team of prosecutors like Ms. Aakre is dedicated to scouting potential cases, and eligibility has steadily expanded. Defendants do not have to plead guilty if they fail, they are either returned for traditional prosecution with no penalty or moved to a more intensive program. Diversion can be completed quickly, in as little as three months for the most minor offenses. Victims must give consent, but they rarely refuse, prosecutors said. Defendants pay no fee  —   in fact, the notion strikes prosecutors as absurd. “That would be a complete failure here in Cook County,” said Robert Groebner Jr. a felony prosecutor. “These defendants, they don’t have $50 in their pocket. ” The wide range of diversion programs is based on a medical model: Use the least invasive treatment that has a chance of success. Misdemeanor defendants may be required to do nothing more than attend two counseling sessions, while those charged with felonies can be sent to Branch 9, a yearlong program overseen by a singing,     judge. Community service is assigned only if the defendant cannot find a job. In part because relapse is often part of recovery from addiction, the programs are forgiving: Defendants can repeat drug school, a defensive   class for   drug offenders, if they have been   for three years, and can undergo a more intensive drug diversion program up to three times. Participants may be asked to get a substance abuse evaluation, but treatment is not mandatory. “These are not people who are acutely symptomatic,” said Mark Kammerer, who runs the programs. “These are people who we want to think about whether there’s something deeper going on with them. ” More complex cases are referred to drug court or mental health court, where defendants can be required to get treatment. By Mr. Kammerer’s measure, the programs are highly successful. A year after finishing felony diversion, 97 percent of graduates have no new felony arrests, and 86 percent have no new arrests of any kind. Drug school alone saves the county an estimated $1. 5 million a year. One afternoon in felony court, Debra Kreatsoulas anxiously awaited the appearance of her husband, Carlos Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez had gone to work drunk, Ms. Kreatsoulas said, and had gotten into an argument with a fellow school custodian. Mr. Ramirez left, saying he was going to get a gun and shoot the other man, according to the police report. It was the day after a mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla. nightclub that killed 49 people. The school was placed on lockdown the story made the evening news. Mr. Ramirez might have faced up to three years in prison. But when prosecutors reviewed the facts  —   he had no criminal record and no gun was found  —   they decided that diversion was more appropriate. The victim at first refused to allow diversion, saying that Mr. Ramirez had used a racial slur. But he relented when he learned that Mr. Ramirez had already spent more than two weeks in jail. Ms. Kreatsoulas, a teacher’s aide who could not afford to bail her husband out, was optimistic. She said his drinking had become worse since he lost a   job a year before. “This might force him to get the help that he needs,” she said. “He has a family that he needs to stand up and start supporting. ” Mr. Ramirez accepted Branch 9 diversion and, hours later, was released from jail, which he described as a dangerous place where inmates fought over bread and soap. “I’m not coming back here to the jungle,” he said. Branch 9 connects defendants to services like classes for a high school equivalency diploma, substance abuse evaluations and health insurance. Spurgeon Kennedy, the diversion expert, said recent research contradicted the assumption that punitive rules and negative consequences, rather than immediate benefits, keep defendants in line. “Defendants don’t think that way,” he said. “Most people are participating because they see a value. ” So far, Mr. Kammerer said, Mr. Ramirez has met all of his diversion requirements and is once again working full time. Ten years ago, Issa Kona tried to steal an $80 battery charger from a Home Depot in Cleveland. The prosecutor’s office charged him with robbery, as opposed to shoplifting, because store employees said that when they asked for the merchandise, Mr. Kona resisted and had to be handcuffed. Still, it was his first arrest. Mr. Kona’s case was dismissed after he agreed to plead guilty and enter pretrial diversion. He came to regret it. Mr. Kona, a Palestinian stonecutter, has been in the United States legally since 2002. His three daughters are in college. He had applied to become a United States citizen. But when immigration lawyers discovered his robbery case, they warned him that the fact that he had pleaded guilty meant he could be deported. “We don’t want to go back,” Mr. Kona said. “We don’t know a thing back there. ” Diversion’s big promise is to spare defendants a criminal record. But that central goal is being undermined by prosecutors across the country who, for the sake of expediency, are requiring defendants like Mr. Kona to plead guilty. If a defendant fails to complete diversion and is sent back to court, prosecutors must mount a case from scratch, locating evidence and witnesses months or years after the fact. “You didn’t just go to a sentencing hearing, you went to square zero,” said Joshua Marquis, an Oregon district attorney who serves on the board of the National District Attorneys Association. “So many D. A. s were like, ‘Why are we doing this? ’” Guilty pleas solve the problem, ensuring conviction without the effort of a trial. But for defendants, the pleas make things more difficult, coming back to haunt them years after completing diversion. Pleas have been used as evidence to deny professional licenses, citizenship and employment. The 2008 diversion guidelines issued by the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies said that defendants should not be required to plead guilty. Other common practices make it harder for defendants to succeed. Though prosecutors can dismiss a case when diversion starts, clearing it from the docket with the option of reopening it later, many prefer to leave the case open. A pending charge, though, can stymie defendants’ efforts to find work and housing, or even win custody of their children. The guidelines also stressed that dismissal is not enough  —   after diversion, cases should be sealed or expunged from the public record. But expungement is rarely automatic, and many defendants do not realize that it requires filing paperwork and paying an additional fee. In El Paso, the district attorney bans expungement altogether. In interviews, several defendants said they had trouble landing a job because their case appeared in background checks. Employers, they said, did not differentiate between a dismissal and a conviction. In some cases, even expungement may not be enough. Though state laws usually specify that sealed records do not have to be disclosed on applications, The Times found job, college and housing forms that ask applicants whether they have ever had a case diverted. The application for St. Mary’s University School of Law in San Antonio requires people to disclose any criminal case, “even if you were granted any type of pretrial diversion. ” It adds, “Disclosure is required even if you have been told by any source that you do not have to disclose any such instance. ” Stephen M. Sheppard, dean of the law school, said diversion would not disqualify an applicant. The point, he said, was evoking candor and making sure that students did not have unacknowledged problems like substance abuse that would hinder them from representing future clients. In Cleveland, Mr. Kona tried to undo his diversion and guilty plea to clear his path to citizenship. Had the case gone to trial, Mr. Kona’s lawyer said, it would most likely have been downgraded to the less serious charge of shoplifting, which would not set off deportation. So Mr. Kona took the unusual step of asking the state Supreme Court to allow him to be prosecuted. During oral arguments 18 months ago, Justice William O’Neill did not bother to suppress his incredulity. “In order to get into that diversion program, you must admit to committing a crime?” he asked. “What happened to the Fifth Amendment?” Last month, the court finally ruled, in Mr. Kona’s favor. The local prosecutor announced that he would not retry the case.",0
4496,AI System That Has Accurately Predicted Last 3 Elections Just Made Its Pick... and Wow,"Getty - Justin Sullivan 
The artificial intelligence system that has accurately predicted the outcomes of every U.S. presidential election since it was created in 2004 is forecasting a Donald Trump victory. 
Using various data, including engagement on Facebook and Twitter, the AI system found that Trump is outpacing Barack Obama’s peak engagement numbers during his historic 2008 campaign by 25 percent. 
CNBC has more details : 
MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, the founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. 
The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democrat and Republican Primaries. Image Credit: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images 
“If Trump loses, it will defy the data trend for the first time in the last 12 years since Internet engagement began in full earnest,” Rai wrote in a report, according to CNBC . 
However, before Trump supporters get too excited about the AI prediction, even Rai admits the social media-focused data model isn’t perfect. Even if Trump is getting more social engagement than Obama in 2008, that certainly doesn’t mean all those social media users will be voting for him. He explained it to CNBC like this: 
Rai said that his system would be improved by more granular data. He said that If Google was to give him access to the unique internet addresses assigned to each digital device, then he could collect data on exactly what people were thinking. For example, Rai said if someone was searching for a YouTube video on how to vote, then looked for a video on how to vote for Trump, this could give the AI a good idea of the voter's intention. He added that there would be no privacy concerns as these internet addresses would be anonymized. 
That being said, Rai advised the Clinton campaign not to get complacent in light of the AI's prediction. ",0
4497,"Candles May Have Caused Fire That Gutted Serbian Church, Officials Say - The New York Times","Candles that had not been properly extinguished after an Easter service probably caused the fire that swept through the historic  Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava in Manhattan on Sunday, officials from the New York Fire Department said on Tuesday. “There’s no reason at this point to label it suspicious,” said Francis X. Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman, “and what the fire marshals are looking at is the use of candles in the rear of the church that may not have been completely extinguished. ” Mr. Gribbon said it was likely that a caretaker thought he had extinguished several hundred candles after a luncheon that followed a celebration attended by some 700 congregants. The caretaker told fire marshals that he stowed the candles in a cardboard box under a piece of wooden furniture in a rear corner of the    church, on 25th Street between Broadway and Avenue of the Americas in the Flatiron district. The future of the building, a New York City landmark, is uncertain depending on how much the fire damaged the   stone structure. For decades, the church has been the spiritual pillar of the Serbian community in the region. As part of the ceremony on Sunday, several hundred candles were lit and placed in a long metal tray containing sand to safely hold them. After the luncheon ended around 3 p. m. the caretaker thought he had put out the burning candles in the sand. Fire Department officials now believe one or more candles may not have been fully extinguished, and may have started a fire that gutted the church’s old wooden interior after the church had closed, Mr. Gribbon said. Even the crowds at the flea market in the parking lot next to the church did not report any signs of fire, he said. When the fire became evident, around 7 p. m. firefighters entered the church to find it fully engulfed in flames, Mr. Gribbon said. The caretaker also entered through another door, and the incoming oxygen fed the already mounting blaze. Mr. Gribbon said portions of the interior  —   most notably the choir loft  —   had collapsed, another indication that the fire had been burning for a while. “You don’t get a fire like that in 10 minutes,” he said. The caretaker was ushered out. Finding no one else inside, officials ordered the firefighters out, fearing other areas would collapse, Mr. Gribbon said. Buildings Department officials said that the church was in no immediate danger of collapsing, but that inspectors were still monitoring the structure. Church officials did not return calls on Tuesday. But many churchgoers had questions as to whether the damage was severe enough to prohibit rebuilding the church with its original structure, Bob Stopanjac, founder of the Serbian Association of New York, said. Mr. Stopanjac said he doubted the fire was caused by the candles. He said candles had been part of the church’s celebrations for decades with no fires. He said some Serbs in the community were concerned about news media reports that said St. Sava was among a group of four Christian Orthodox churches that caught fire on Sunday. “I have no answers,” Mr. Stopanjac said.",0

DES MOINES, Iowa — Des Moines police have charged a woman with election misconduct, a Class D felony, after officials reported she voted twice. 
Des Moines police Sgt. Paul Parizek says officers charged 55-year-old Terri Rote with first-degree election misconduct on Thursday after being notified by elections officials that she had submitted two absentee ballots. 
According to an Iowa Public Radio report, Rote voted two times for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. 
“I wasn’t planning on doing it twice, it was spur of the moment,” Rote said in an interview with the radio station before she added an oft-repeated line on the Trump campaign trail: “The polls are rigged.” 
She was booked into the Polk County Jail and released after posting a $5,000 bond.",0
4499,Sumner Redstone Moves to Replace Ousted Trust Members - The New York Times,"The names put forward to replace the executives who were suddenly ousted from the trust and board that will determine the fate of Sumner M. Redstone’s $40 billion media empire have close connections to his   recently reconciled daughter, Shari Redstone, according to three people briefed on the matter. The developments are likely to be cited by Viacom executives as evidence of Ms. Redstone’s role in the contentious   over the weekend of the   succession plans for her father’s companies. On Friday, two longtime confidants of Mr. Redstone, 92, were unexpectedly removed from their positions on the trust that will control Mr. Redstone’s companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. They were also separated from the board of National Amusements, the private theater chain company through which Mr. Redstone controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS, two of the world’s largest entertainment companies. One person expected to be named to the trust is Thaddeus Jankowski, the senior vice president and general counsel of National Amusements, according to people with knowledge of the development, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are private. Ms. Redstone is a director and president of National Amusements, where she holds a position of authority over Mr. Jankowski. Viacom executives and directors on Saturday questioned Mr. Redstone’s competency in making the sudden changes and asserted that he had been manipulated by his daughter. On Sunday evening, Mr. Redstone released a statement through a spokesman in which he attested to being independent and “engaged, attentive and as opinionated as ever. ” He also disputed claims made over the weekend by Viacom directors and executives that company directors had been denied access to him. According to the statement, Mr. Redstone is opposed to the plans underway by Viacom leadership to sell a stake in Paramount Pictures, the film and television studio. Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, has said that a deal should be reached by the end of June. “Mr. Redstone regrets that Mr. Dauman has diverted resources to these baseless attacks and misrepresentations, rather than focusing on the continuing challenges that are faced by Viacom,” the spokesman, Mike Lawrence, said in the statement. In a later statement, Carl Folta, a Viacom spokesman, said that the company was “deeply troubled and saddened by this state of affairs. ” He outlined how Viacom directors addressed company issues, including the sale of a stake in Paramount, during 12 hours of meetings last week that Mr. Redstone attended by phone. Upon Mr. Redstone’s death or upon him being declared incompetent, his control of the voting stock in Viacom and CBS is to pass to the    trust, with his five grandchildren as the beneficiaries. Ms. Redstone is vice chairwoman of Viacom and CBS and one of the seven members of the trust. Mr. Dauman was unexpectedly dismissed from the trust and removed from the board of National Amusements on Friday. George Abrams, a Viacom director, a representative of Mr. Redstone’s for 50 years and an ally of Mr. Dauman, was also removed from both positions that day. Their swift removal was seen as a major victory for Ms. Redstone in her quest to dictate the future of her father’s media empire. She has publicly opposed Mr. Dauman’s leadership of Viacom. In addition to Mr. Jankowski, the other person expected to be appointed to the trust is an undisclosed friend of Ms. Redstone, two of the people briefed on the matter said. Ms. Redstone’s daughter, Kimberlee Ostheimer, was also put forth to serve on the board of National Amusements, the three people said. Mr. Jankowski and Ms. Ostheimer also could not be reached for comment. The weekend’s developments prompted immediate questions about whether or not Mr. Redstone, who is in poor health, was competent to make those decisions and what role Ms. Redstone might have played in influencing her father. In a statement on Saturday, Ms. Redstone said, “I fully support my father’s decisions and respect his authority to make them. ” Mr. Dauman called the moves “invalid and illegal” and said Mr. Redstone had lacked the capacity to have taken such steps. Mr. Lawrence disputed that Viacom directors had been restricted from seeing Mr. Redstone. In his statement on Sunday, he detailed how Mr. Redstone sent a letter through a lawyer to Mr. Dauman, Mr. Abrams and Frederic Salerno, another Viacom director, on May 16 to ask for details about Viacom’s business and share price, which has declined 40 percent over the past year, but received no response. Mr. Folta, the Viacom spokesman, said that two directors have “still been unable to meet with Mr. Redstone. ” “The Sumner Redstone we knew would never refuse a meeting about his businesses and he certainly would not want advisers to stand in for him,” Mr. Folta said. Mr. Lawrence attested to Mr. Redstone’s vitality. He said that over the past several days Mr. Redstone had hosted family and friends at his home and also met with lawyers and an executive from National Amusements. Mr. Redstone was also “looking forward to celebrating his birthday with family later this week,” Mr. Lawrence said.",0

4501,Jeff Sessions: I Will Recuse Myself From Future Hillary Clinton Investigations - Breitbart,"Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions stated Tuesday he will recuse himself from investigations concerning failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton if confirmed as Attorney General. [Asked by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley how he planned to address concerns about his possible handling of an investigation involving Clinton, Sessions said: “Mr. Chairman, it was a highly contentious campaign. I, like a lot of people, made comments about the issues in that campaign with regard to Secretary Clinton. And some of the comments I made, I do believe that could place my objectivity in question. ”  “I’ve given that thought. I believe the proper thing to do would be to recuse myself from any questions involving those kind of investigations that involved Secretary Clinton and that were raised during the campaign, or could be otherwise connected to it,” he said. “To be very clear, you intend to recuse yourself from both the Clinton email investigation and any matters involving the Clinton Foundation if there are any?” Grassley asked. “Yes,” Sessions said firmly. “Let me follow up again, because it’s important. When you say you’ll recuse, you mean you’ll actually recuse, and the decision will therefore fall to I assume a deputy attorney general?” Grassley asked. “I ask because after Attorney General Lynch met with President Clinton in Phoenix, she said she would ‘defer’ to the FBI, but she never officially recused. ” “No, she did not officially recuse and there’s a procedure for that I would follow. And I believe that would be the best approach for the country, because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute, in any way that would suggest anything other than absolute objectivity,” Sessions said. “This country does not punish its political enemies, but this country ensures no one is above the law. ”",0
4502,“Stop watching RT and other Russian-biased sources.” A Tale of Two Cities,"November 1, 2016 -  
By Tom Winter exclusively for Fort Russ -  

Screen capture from In the Now video A TALE OF TWO CITIES “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times” The best of times — that’s Mosul. The liberation of the city from ISIS is going apace, with the US Air Force assisting Iraq. Yes, the resistance is fierce, and there will be door-to-door fighting, but the day of deliverance is coming -- a summary of NPR this morning. 
No war crimes, not even any mention of civilian casualties under the euphemism of “collateral damage."" And Mosul is never called ""a city under siege""! 
The worst of times — that’s Aleppo, ""a city under siege."" This is where Dictator Assad and the Russians are deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure under the condemnation of the western world for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Thus speak the parrots, with one voice, following Mark C. Toner's press briefings. And NPR is there to remind us that Kerry wants Russian war crimes investigated [' Russia's bombing of civilians in Syria ""beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes.""']  and to remind us that Russia is bombing hospitals . 
Never a mention of the besieged being ISIS!  
Listening to CNN and NPR (National PR), no one would ever guess that it’s the same struggle in each city, a struggle to liberate innocent civilians from the headchoppers of ISIS. But in Mosul, NPR acknowledges that the innocent civilians are forced to stay and serve as human shields for ISIS. 
Your retired Latin prof translator/commentator keeps up with the help of Facebook friends in 35 countries. Comparing the international posts and comments with the American ones points out the irony. One of them, in Romania, has been advised to “Stop watching RT and other Russian-biased sources.”  
But in Romania, there is no access to Fox, CNN, or even to NPR. So what is the poor Rumanian to do?  And in another bingo for Godwin’s law, the one advising against trusting RT calls Trump “another Hitler.” 
In the following response to a report of 300 civilians killed in a US airstrike,  
there is a mix of the rational, yet it is still written through the lens of CNN and the rest of western MSM: “I am a little defensive that some of these stories have come from RT (not this one) when Russia is deliberately targeting civilians and basically you could argue we need to try harder to avoid them.  It is an area with a high damned if you do (potentially causing collateral deaths) and damned if you don't (thus allowing ISIS to spread and kill civilians directly) quotient.”  To which the only possible reply:  
look at what you wrote! OUR airstrikes cause ""collateral damage;"" Russian airstrikes ""deliberately target civilians."" The collusion of the western press with the Washington Blob took a month or two to take hold: There was a time, early in 2014, when talking heads were saying stuff like “Ukraine should just make the best deal they can with Russia.” One retired French politician noted there is no sense getting involved in matters of what used to be internal boundaries of the Soviet Union. CNN as late as September of 2014 once acknowledged that the Kiev government was bombing civilians .   

But not any more! All the non-Russia-biased media have long since gotten the memo. 

And to avoid intellectual discomfort from exposure to views and news that do not jibe with the US State Department and CNN, don't watch RT or any Russia-biased sources!

4503,Developer DICE Moving on from ’Star Wars Battlefront’ to Sequel - Breitbart,"It seems DICE is done with their inaugural entry in the Star Wars Battlefront series, and is now putting all of its focus on the 2017 sequel. [“DICE isn’t done with Star Wars,” the developer posted on EA’s official Battlefront blog, but the team behind 2015’s reboot of the cult classic multiplayer games has “shifted its focus” toward “the next great Star Wars game. ” This is, of course, the inevitable Battlefront 2.  DICE isn’t hogging all the credit  —   or blame, depending on your opinion of 2015’s Battlefront. They’ve called their next release a “collaborative effort” between themselves and the teams at developers Criterion and Motive. According to Motive’s Jade Raymond: A new installment of Star Wars Battlefront is currently in development at DICE, in collaboration with Motive Studios in Montreal. Our team at Motive team is growing quickly, and making great progress in building out a significant new addition to the game. While we’re not ready to get into specifics right now, we have started development of this game by listening to all of the feedback we received, while also innovating in new areas I think you’re all going to be excited about. While DICE’s announcement means that we won’t see any further content added to the offline Skirmish mode introduced to Battlefront last year, 2017’s   will feature a full single player campaign that spans “multiple Star Wars eras,” according to EA CEO Andrew Wilson himself during an earnings call on January 31: Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new   campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. Star Wars Battlefront was a hopeful first attempt, a   to the sights and sounds of the iconic series. Unfortunately, even CFO Blake Jorgensen was forced to admit that it didn’t have enough depth to hold on to many of its most hardcore players. It was a game as praised as it was maligned, prioritizing atmosphere and accessibility over longevity. Despite its many criticisms, fans devoured it. It sold upwards of 14 million copies. The next game is doubling down on scope and depth alike, and EA is devoting those three studios to make sure it succeeds. Wilson said that they “have every reason to believe” that they’ll be able to deliver “exactly what fans are asking for. ” Star Wars Battlefront 2 will release some time in late 2017, probably in the vicinity of Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi’s theatrical premier in December.

4504,Low-Priority Immigrants Still Swept Up in Net of Deportation - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Three agents knocked on the door of a modest duplex in a Wisconsin town just after dawn. The Mexican immigrant living on the ground floor stuck his head out They asked his name and he gave it. Within minutes José Cervantes Amaral was in handcuffs as his wife, also from Mexico, silently watched. After 18 years working and living quietly in the United States, Mr. Cervantes, who did not have legal papers, rode away in the back seat, heading for deportation. It is a routine that continues daily. The Supreme Court on Thursday effectively ended initiatives by President Obama that would have given protection from deportation to more than four million immigrants in the country illegally, most of them parents of American citizens. Mr. Obama showed his frustration with the decision, saying his goal was to help immigrants who had raised families here and helped the country with their work. The president said immigrants who might have qualified for the programs would still be safe from deportation. Still, deportations continue, thousands every week. In November 2014 when Mr. Obama first announced the protection programs, he also set new priorities for enforcement. Since then, immigration authorities say, their focus is on removing convicted criminals and foreigners who pose national security threats. But the administration’s priorities also include deporting migrants from Central America, including children, who came in an influx since 2014. And immigrants who committed minor offenses  —   or none at all  —   are often swept up in the operations. After Thursday’s Supreme Court decision, the president’s protections are gone, but the enforcement plan remains in effect. It is part of a particularly edgy moment for immigrants and their supporters framed by the Supreme Court ruling, Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign and Britain’s surprise vote, influenced in part by   sentiments, to leave the European Union. Last year, immigration authorities deported 235, 413 people, according to official figures. Of those, 59 percent were convicted criminals, and 98 percent fit within the administration’s priorities, Department of Homeland Security officials said. The top priority includes foreigners who pose a threat to national or border security or to public safety. Other priorities are for people with serious criminal records, but they also include any migrant caught entering the country illegally after Jan. 1, 2014. Homeland Security officials said Friday that the Supreme Court decision would have no effect on the pace or strategy of enforcement. “Our limited enforcement resources will not be focused on the removal of those who have committed no serious crimes, have been in this country for years and have families here,” said Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the department. “Under this policy, these people are not priorities for removal, nor should they be. ” Mr. Obama has carried out many more deportations than previous presidents, setting a record of more than 2. 4 million formal removals. But Republican lawmakers point to a sharp decrease in deportations  —   down 43 percent in 2015 from 409, 849 in 2012  —   to say that Mr. Obama has all but stopped enforcing immigration law. “When will the Obama administration end its reckless policies that wreak havoc on our communities?” asked Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. But what is not enough enforcement for some is too much for others. This week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is known as ICE, said it had arrested 331 immigrants in May and June in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Kansas and Missouri. The operations were its “latest effort to arrest and remove convicted criminal aliens,” said Ricardo Wong, the director of the agency’s office in Chicago. “By focusing our resources on the most egregious offenders,” Mr. Wong said, “we ensure the very best use of our resources while immediately improving public safety. ” One of those arrested was Mr. Cervantes. In 2006, Mr. Cervantes said in an interview by telephone on Friday, he was caught up in an immigration raid at a factory near his workplace. Local police who assisted in the raid arrested him, finding  —   mistakenly, he says  —   that he was working with documents under a false name. Mr. Cervantes, a construction worker, pleaded guilty to an identity theft offense, a   felony. A decade later, after he and his wife raised two daughters in Genoa City, Wis. immigration agents came to his door to deport him. “The shock for my wife was very strong,” Mr. Cervantes said. She has been in treatment at local hospitals for kidney cancer, he said. “If we have to go back to Mexico, I won’t have her for long. ” He has been released while he fights his immigration case. “The administration is continuing to deport people who should not be a priority,” said Christine   executive director of Voces de la Frontera, an organization that assisted Mr. Cervantes. Mr. Obama, she said, “can do much more to prevent the unnecessary breakup of families. ” Some clearly are in the priority group. On Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it had arrested 45 foreigners who had been listed by Interpol as wanted for serious crimes, including three men from El Salvador sought in connection with gang killings. Immigration agents have conducted many roundups of drug traffickers and human smugglers. At the same time, a    migrant from Honduras, Wildin Acosta, was still being held in an immigration detention center in Lumpkin, Ga. five months after he was arrested when he was heading to high school in Durham, N. C. In 2014, Mr. Acosta crossed the border illegally and turned himself in to border agents, asking for asylum. Since he was 17 at the time and traveling without his parents, he was held under special protections for unaccompanied minors. He was sent to live with his parents, who had settled years before in Durham. He started going to high school, made friends who helped him learn English and joined a local soccer league. He presented a formal request for asylum in the United States, saying in legal papers that he fled Honduras after two close relatives were murdered. But he missed a date in immigration court and a judge ordered him deported. Mr. Acosta also turned 19, making him too old, immigration officials said, to be given deference as a minor. Mr. Acosta was among dozens of teenagers as well as mothers and smaller children from Central America who were arrested in an operation by immigration agents over one weekend in late January. Homeland Security Department officials said that because of his recent border crossing, Mr. Acosta was among the highest priorities for deportation. The arrests caused panic in immigrant communities in Durham. Teachers, lawmakers and community leaders mobilized to protest. Mr. Acosta’s lawyer, Evelyn Smallwood, has forestalled his deportation but has not secured his release. “He is a good kid, and he is doing everything he can to keep his sanity,” she said. “The administration has said it is as important to remove Wildin as it is to remove a drug trafficker or a terrorist. ”",0

4507,Prisons Run by C.E.O.s? Privatization Under Trump Could Carry a Heavy Price - The New York Times,"Last summer, the Justice Department decided to start winding down its use of private prisons. Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates noted in a memo that while private prisons were useful when public prisons were overflowing, they made little sense now that the prison population was falling. They didn’t save much on costs. Nor did they provide the kind of rehabilitation programs proved to reduce recidivism. And they are particularly dangerous. A recent report by the department’s inspector general found that prisoners in private facilities, which house some 12 percent of federal inmates, were much more likely to have weapons. Private prisons had many more assaults on inmates and prison workers than those run by the Bureau of Prisons. And they went into lockdown to respond to disturbances 10 times as often. But on Nov. 9, the day after Donald J. Trump was elected president, the stocks of correctional conglomerates were among the best performing on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in Corrections Corporation of America, now CoreCivic, gained an astonishing 43 percent on the day. The reason? Privatization is back at the top of the government’s agenda. While this is being applauded in executive suites across corporate America, the cost for the rest of society is likely to be high. “With prisons I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons,” Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail last year. “It seems to work a lot better. ” Mr. Trump’s pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, is a staunch supporter of the approach, having invited private prisons into his state as its attorney general more than 20 years ago. But privatization is likely to sweep through not only prisons. The   wants to privatize health services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He wants to privatize public infrastructure  —   drawing private sector companies to fix, build and manage bridges and roads, water supplies and airports. He is selling privatization as a surefire winner that will deliver better services for less public money. “There’s a magical thinking among business executives that something about the profit motive makes everything run better,” noted Raymond Fisman, a professor of economics at Boston University. “What is government going to be like when it is run by billionaire C. E. O.s that see the private sector as a solution to all the world’s problems?” A serious body of economics, not to mention reams of evidence from decades of privatizations around the world, suggests this belief is false. Consider, for instance, what the profit motive has done for higher education.   colleges absorb a full quarter of federal aid for higher education. Not all are fraudulent diploma mills set up to milk federal aid dollars from   students. Still, on average they are much more expensive than public institutions, while their degrees are much less valuable. There are abundant similar examples in the health care industry. Hospices run for profit are less likely to admit patients with shorter,   expected lengths of stay.   hospitals have been found to fib more to Medicare than nonprofits do  —   tweaking their diagnoses to get higher reimbursements. And they have been found to bolster profits at the expense of patient safety. A study at the RAND Corporation found that hospitals that switched from nonprofit to   operation saw a sharp rise in profits but also a jump in mortality rates one to two years after their conversion. Then there is a study by Bonnie Svarstad and Chester Bond of the School of Pharmacy at the University of   more than three decades ago: They found that patients in   nursing homes got heavier doses of sedatives than those in nonprofits got. Explaining the pattern, the economist Burton Weisbrod wrote that sedatives were “less expensive than, say, giving special attention to more active patients who need to be kept busy. ” Of course, the government can also do a horrible job of running things. And private corporations do many things well. They tend to be much faster to innovate. In competitive markets, the profit motive makes for a powerful incentive to deliver all kinds of goods and services, from widgets to telephone calls, efficiently and effectively. A study found that opening nursing homes in Sweden to private providers actually improved patients’ mortality rates. But it is critical to understand how profit seeking can go awry, giving companies a motivation to skimp on quality to bolster margins. When a private provider faces little or no competition, or when quality of service is difficult to track properly  —   think of the   of patients in a nursing home, or the health of prison inmates  —   there will be nothing to stop it from pursuing higher profits at society’s expense. “The private sector is good at cutting costs and finding ways to save money,” Oliver Hart, a professor of economics at Harvard, told me. “Some are socially desirable some are not. ” The critical issue is whether a contract can be written that reduces the space for socially undesirable tactics to a minimum. Negotiating the   is not always obvious. For instance, the privatization of the water supply of Buenos Aires led to a reduction in infant deaths from infectious and parasitic disease. But it also increased water bills, so the unpopular concession to a private company was ultimately canceled. Professor Hart, as it happens, won the Nobel  in economic sciences last year for his work in studying precisely these sorts of contracts: When are they more likely to work? How should they be structured? Crucial tasks with many dimensions  —   waging war, policing the streets of a city  —   are often best left to the public sector, he points out. By contrast, a private provider could do a better job when the desired output is more straightforward and can be measured properly, like collecting trash. He is not at all opposed to privatization. Indeed, he argues that determining whether a service should be privately or publicly provided should not be an ideological issue. The decision should be based on “what mode of organization achieves the social goal in the best way. ” Unfortunately, he noted, it seems unlikely Mr. Trump’s team will take the thoughtful path. Indeed, one of Professor Hart’s seminal papers, produced together with Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny nearly 20 years ago, suggested that while things like garbage collection or weapons production were quite suitable for private provision, the government would probably do a better job tackling tasks like foreign policy, the police and   …     prisons.",0
4508,"Treasury Imposes Sanctions on North Korea, Cutting Access to Banks - The New York Times","With private cybersecurity firms linking North Korea to recent computer attacks that absconded with at least $81 million, the Treasury Department moved on Wednesday to choke off Pyongyang’s remaining access to the global financial system, designating the country a “primary” money launderer. The Treasury, employing sanctions techniques that helped pressure Iran to give up much of its nuclear program, said it would seek to impose what are known as secondary sanctions against the reclusive communist country. That means that it could cut off from the American financial system any bank or company that conducts banking transactions with Pyongyang. As a practical matter, that would largely affect Chinese banks, which facilitate North Korea’s financial transactions with Beijing, its largest trading partner. It could also affect some institutions in the nominally autonomous Chinese regions of Macau and Hong Kong, as well as in Singapore, where Pyongyang has often gone to hide the true nature of its banking activities, and to pay for missiles, nuclear fuel and the huge infrastructure it has built around those programs. The designation, officials said, was in the works long before evidence emerged linking the country’s aggressive hackers to the bank thefts, which involved stealing the credentials that banks use to access the Swift system, a global network that thousands of financial firms use to authorize payments from one account to another. In interviews, administration officials said they were still sorting through the evidence that North Korea was involved, and left open the possibility that the thieves deliberately left evidence implicating the country to throw investigators off their trail. It could be months, the officials said, before they reach any conclusions, and in the end the perpetrators of the attack may not be definitively known. Only once  —   in the case of North Korea’s attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, which was promoting a movie depicting the assassination of Kim   the country’s unpredictable young leader  —   has President Obama publicly accused another country of using computer code to wreak havoc in the United States. In this case, the sanctions were proposed most immediately because of a Treasury investigation that concluded North Korea uses hard currency to finance its nuclear and missile programs. The department invoked a section of the Patriot Act to ban banks from processing any banking transaction that runs through North Korea. It is hard to assess how much the action will hurt North Korea. Such sanctions against financial institutions doing business with Iran proved effective because Tehran had billions of dollars in monthly oil and other energy exports that could be choked off North Korea has none. Oftentimes Pyongyang deals in cash. Until a few years ago it was one of the largest counterfeiters of $100 bills. But that   fraud was largely cut off by the redesign of the $100 bill. The key test will be the reaction of the Chinese. American officials will have a chance to find out next week: Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew are traveling to Beijing for the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, where the isolation of North Korea will be a major subject of discussion. China voted for the latest United Nations sanctions, but Beijing’s fears of provoking a collapse of North Korea’s government still outweigh its desire to rein in Mr. Kim’s government. Underlying the financial action was the United States’ desire to respond to North Korea’s third nuclear weapons test, conducted in January, which the country said was its first test of a hydrogen bomb. (There is no evidence that it was, in fact, a hydrogen weapon, which increases the magnitude of the blast.) More recently Pyongyang has attempted, and failed, to launch a Musudan   missile. It is based on an early Soviet model, which was launched from a submarine, but the repeated failures have embarrassed Mr. Kim and undermined his effort to convince the world that his nuclear missile program is steaming ahead quickly. The bigger mystery is whether Mr. Kim is also trying to show that he can undermine the global financial system, his best way of getting back at the West and his Asian neighbors for their support of sanctions. Two cybersecurity firms identified Pyongyang as the culprit behind a series of cyberattacks against Asian banks, including the theft that spirited $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Private security researchers analyzing those thefts say that unique digital fingerprints in the attackers’ code match those of the code used in cyberattacks against Sony in 2014 and South Korean banks and broadcasting companies in 2013. The Sony hack destroyed 70 percent of the firm’s computers. South Korea has blamed North Korea for the attacks on its firms. Elements of the code in those attacks closely track some of the code found in the more recent bank thefts. Banks in the United States are already prohibited from doing business with financial institutions in North Korea. But the recommended rules would require them to perform additional due diligence to ensure they are not inadvertently transacting with North Korean financial institutions or the Pyongyang government through shell companies or other fictitious entities. The rules are the result of a monthslong effort by the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to determine whether North Korea is a haven for money laundering. With that designation established, the Treasury secretary is able to take aggressive measures to cut off the country’s access to the United States financial system. Other countries have also been stepping up efforts to isolate North Korea. In March, the United Nations Security Council said its members had 90 days to sever banking relationships with North Korean financial institutions. The recent attacks on Asian banks exposed new vulnerabilities in the way banks move money around the world. North Korea’s possible involvement in those cyberattacks has raised alarms about Pyongyang’s ability to exploit Swift, the global bank messaging network. But the attack did not go to the core of the Swift system instead, it was analogous to stealing a credit card number to post a phony transaction in the Visa or MasterCard system.",0
4509,2016 Already Shows Record Global Temperatures - The New York Times,"This year is off to a   start for global temperatures. It has been the hottest year to date, with January, February and March each passing marks set in 2015, according to new data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. March was also the 11th consecutive month to set a record high for temperatures, which agencies started tracking in the 1800s. With the release on Tuesday of its global climate report, NOAA is the third independent agency  —   along with NASA and the Japan Meteorological Association  —   to reach similar findings, each using slightly different methods. The reports add a sense of urgency at the United Nations, where world diplomats are gathered this week to sign the climate accord reached late last year in Paris, when 195 nations committed to lower greenhouse gas emissions and to stave off the worst effects of climate change. Since the initial agreement was reached, other global anomalies have been reported that punctuate the threat of climate change, including troubling trends on Arctic sea ice, floods, drought and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Some of these  —   warm temperatures and heavy rains in particular  —   can be explained in part by this year’s El Niño phenomenon, which scientists predicted would release large amounts of heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere, causing irregular weather patterns across the globe. But the effects of the current El Niño have been exacerbated by global warming, a result of emissions of greenhouse gases by humans, said Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with NOAA and lead author of the report. El Niño is on its way out, and ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific peaked in November, said Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. But the heat the ocean had stored had to go somewhere: “It’s come out and been distributed around the world,” which helps explain record warm temperatures and wildfires in the Southern Hemisphere, Mr. Trenberth said. To get an idea of how much of the record heat is caused by El Niño and how much by global warming, Dr. Blunden said that scientists at NOAA compared this El Niño to the last strong one, in   which was also   for its warmth. This one has pushed past those records by raising global temperatures an additional 0. 8 degree or so, Dr. Blunden said. The high temperatures in March probably signaled the last gasp of El Niño, and surface temperatures across the globe are likely to begin to fall this year. Often, El Niños are followed by La Niña storm systems, which can usher in cooler periods, Dr. Blunden said. But after more than two   hot years  —   2014 and 2015 and an extremely warm few months in 2016  —   many of the devastating effects of the   punch of global warming and El Niño may be inescapable, setting the world on a course for an extended period of rapid global warming, after a period of relatively slow warming that began in 1998 and lasted for about a decade. Dr. Blunden said that the Arctic was seeing some of the most abnormal weather on earth, with temperatures about 6 degrees warmer than the average over all. These highs could lead to record melting of Arctic sea ice this summer the ice cover is at its lowest since measurements began to be taken in the late 1970s. Dr. Trenberth said that these conditions did not represent “a new normal” and that it was difficult to determine the   consequences of this El Niño on both global temperatures and Arctic sea ice cover. He is not sure if 2016 will prove to be as warm as 2015  —   “I’m betting it’s a tossup,” he said  —   but added that it’s not the record heat that comes as a shock. The magnitude of the jump “is indeed surprising,” Dr. Trenberth said. A central feature of the Paris climate agreement was to hold the increase in the global average temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels, and to try to limit the increase to about 1. 5 degrees Celsius. As global temperatures are already nearing the 1.  threshold, and some months have been about 1 degree or more above average, this goal might be difficult to achieve, Dr. Trenberth said. “I don’t see at all how we’re going to not go through the 1. 5   in the next decade or so,” Dr. Trenberth added.",0
4510,Saudis and Extremism: ‘Both the Arsonists and the Firefighters’ - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump do not agree on much, but Saudi Arabia may be an exception. She has deplored Saudi Arabia’s support for “radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism. ” He has called the Saudis “the world’s biggest funders of terrorism. ” The first American diplomat to serve as envoy to Muslim communities around the world visited 80 countries and concluded that the Saudi influence was destroying tolerant Islamic traditions. “If the Saudis do not cease what they are doing,” the official, Farah Pandith, wrote last year, “there must be diplomatic, cultural and economic consequences. ” And hardly a week passes without a television pundit or a newspaper columnist blaming Saudi Arabia for jihadist violence. On HBO, Bill Maher calls Saudi teachings “medieval,” adding an epithet. In The Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria writes that the Saudis have “created a monster in the world of Islam. ” The idea has become a commonplace: that Saudi Arabia’s export of the rigid, bigoted, patriarchal, fundamentalist strain of Islam known as Wahhabism has fueled global extremism and contributed to terrorism. As the Islamic State projects its menacing calls for violence into the West, directing or inspiring terrorist attacks in country after country, an old debate over Saudi influence on Islam has taken on new relevance. Those questions are deeply contentious, partly because of the contradictory impulses of the Saudi state. In the realm of extremist Islam, the Saudis are “both the arsonists and the firefighters,” said William McCants, a Brookings Institution scholar. “They promote a very toxic form of Islam that draws sharp lines between a small number of true believers and everyone else, Muslim and ” he said, providing ideological fodder for violent jihadists. Yet at the same time, “they’re our partners in counterterrorism,” said Mr. McCants, one of three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries interviewed for this article. Saudi leaders seek good relations with the West and see jihadist violence as a menace that could endanger their rule, especially now that the Islamic State is staging attacks in the kingdom  —   25 in the last eight months, by the government’s count. But they are also driven by their rivalry with Iran, and they depend for legitimacy on a clerical establishment dedicated to a reactionary set of beliefs. Those conflicting goals can play out in a bafflingly inconsistent manner. Thomas Hegghammer, a Norwegian terrorism expert who has advised the United States government, said the most important effect of Saudi proselytizing might have been to slow the evolution of Islam, blocking its natural accommodation to a diverse and globalized world. “If there was going to be an Islamic reformation in the 20th century, the Saudis probably prevented it by pumping out literalism,” he said. The reach of the Saudis has been stunning, touching nearly every country with a Muslim population, from the Gothenburg Mosque in Sweden to the King Faisal Mosque in Chad, from the King Fahad Mosque in Los Angeles to the Seoul Central Mosque in South Korea. Support has come from the Saudi government the royal family Saudi charities and   organizations including the World Muslim League, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth and the International Islamic Relief Organization, providing the hardware of impressive edifices and the software of preaching and teaching. There is a broad consensus that the Saudi ideological juggernaut has disrupted local Islamic traditions in dozens of countries  —   the result of lavish spending on religious outreach for half a century, estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. The result has been amplified by guest workers, many from South Asia, who spend years in Saudi Arabia and bring Saudi ways home with them. In many countries, Wahhabist preaching has encouraged a harshly judgmental religion, contributing to majority support in some polls in Egypt, Pakistan and other countries for stoning for adultery and execution for anyone trying to leave Islam. But exactly how Saudi influence plays out seems to depend greatly on local conditions. In parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, for instance, Saudi teachings have shifted the religious culture in a markedly conservative direction, most visibly in the decision of more women to cover their hair or of men to grow beards. Among Muslim immigrant communities in Europe, the Saudi influence seems to be just one factor driving radicalization, and not the most significant. In divided countries like Pakistan and Nigeria, the flood of Saudi money, and the ideology it promotes, have exacerbated divisions over religion that regularly prove lethal. And for a small minority in many countries, the exclusionary Saudi version of Sunni Islam, with its denigration of Jews and Christians, as well as of Muslims of Shiite, Sufi and other traditions, may have made some people vulnerable to the lure of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other violent jihadist groups. “There’s only so much dehumanizing of the other that you can be exposed to  —   and exposed to as the word of God  —   without becoming susceptible to recruitment,” said David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington who tracks Saudi influence. Exhibit A may be Saudi Arabia itself, which produced not only Osama bin Laden, but also 15 of the 19 hijackers of Sept. 11, 2001 sent more suicide bombers than any other country to Iraq after the 2003 invasion and has supplied more foreign fighters to the Islamic State, 2, 500, than any country other than Tunisia. Mehmet Gormez, the senior Islamic cleric in Turkey, said that while he was meeting with Saudi clerics in Riyadh in January, the Saudi authorities had executed 47 people in a single day on terrorism charges, 45 of them Saudi citizens. “I said: ‘These people studied Islam for 10 or 15 years in your country. Is there a problem with the educational system?’ ” Mr. Gormez said in an interview. He argued that Wahhabi teaching was undermining the pluralism, tolerance and openness to science and learning that had long characterized Islam. “Sadly,” he said, the changes have taken place “in almost all of the Islamic world. ” In a huge embarrassment to the Saudi authorities, the Islamic State adopted official Saudi textbooks for its schools until the extremist group could publish its own books in 2015. Out of 12 works by Muslim scholars republished by the Islamic State, seven are by Muhammad ibn Abd   the   founder of the Saudi school of Islam, said Jacob Olidort, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. A former imam of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Sheikh Adil   declared with regret in a television interview in January that the Islamic State leaders “draw their ideas from what is written in our own books, our own principles. ” Small details of Saudi practice can cause outsize trouble. For at least two decades, the kingdom has distributed an English translation of the Quran that in the first surah, or chapter, adds parenthetical references to Jews and Christians in addressing Allah: “those who earned Your Anger (such as the Jews) nor of those who went astray (such as the Christians). ” Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a professor of Islamic studies at George Washington University and the editor in chief of the new Study Quran, an annotated English version, said the additions were “a complete heresy, with no basis in Islamic tradition. ” Accordingly, many American officials who have worked to counter extremism and terrorism have formed a dark view of the Saudi effect  —   even if, given the sensitivity of the relationship, they are often loath to discuss it publicly. The United States’ reliance on Saudi counterterrorism cooperation in recent years  —   for instance, the Saudi tip that foiled a 2010 Qaeda plot to blow up two American cargo planes  —   has often taken precedence over concerns about radical influence. And generous Saudi funding for professorships and research centers at American universities, including the most elite institutions, has deterred criticism and discouraged research on the effects of Wahhabi proselytizing, according to Mr. McCants  —   who is working on a book about the Saudi impact on global Islam  —   and other scholars. One American former official who has begun to speak out is Ms. Pandith, the State Department’s first special representative to Muslim communities worldwide. From 2009 to 2014, she visited Muslims in 80 countries and concluded that Saudi influence was pernicious and universal. “In each place I visited, the Wahhabi influence was an insidious presence,” she wrote in The New York Times last year. She said the United States should “disrupt the training of extremist imams,” “reject free Saudi textbooks and translations that are filled with hate,” and “prevent the Saudis from demolishing local Muslim religious and cultural sites that are evidence of the diversity of Islam. ” Yet some scholars on Islam and extremism, including experts on radicalization in many countries, push back against the notion that Saudi Arabia bears predominant responsibility for the current wave of extremism and jihadist violence. They point to multiple sources for the rise and spread of Islamist terrorism, including repressive secular governments in the Middle East, local injustices and divisions, the hijacking of the internet for terrorist propaganda, and American interventions in the Muslim world from the   war in Afghanistan to the invasion of Iraq. The   ideologues most influential with modern jihadists, like Sayyid Qutb of Egypt and Abul Ala Maududi of Pakistan, reached their extreme,   views without much Saudi input. Al Qaeda and the Islamic State despise Saudi rulers, whom they consider the worst of hypocrites. “Americans like to have someone to blame  —   a person, a political party or country,” said Robert S. Ford, a former United States ambassador to Syria and Algeria. “But it’s a lot more complicated than that. I’d be careful about blaming the Saudis. ” While Saudi religious influence may be disruptive, he and others say, its effect is not monolithic. A major tenet of official Saudi Islamic teaching is obedience to rulers  —   hardly a precept that encourages terrorism intended to break nations. Many Saudi and   clerics are quietist, characterized by a devotion to scripture and prayer and a shunning of politics, let alone political violence. And especially since 2003, when Qaeda attacks in the kingdom awoke the monarchy to the danger it faced from militancy, Saudi Arabia has acted more aggressively to curtail preachers who call for violence, cut off terrorist financing and cooperate with Western intelligence to foil terrorist plots. From 2004 to 2012, 3, 500 imams were fired for refusing to renounce extremist views, and another 20, 000 went through retraining, according to the Ministry of Islamic Affairs  —   though the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom expressed skepticism that the training was really “instilling tolerance. ” An American scholar with long experience in Saudi Arabia  —   who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve his ability to travel to the kingdom for research  —   said he believed that Saudi influence had often been exaggerated in American political discourse. But he compared it to climate change. Just as a   increase in temperature can ultimately result in drastic effects around the globe, with glaciers melting and species dying off, so Saudi teaching is playing out in many countries in ways that are hard to predict and difficult to trace but often profound, the scholar said. Saudi proselytizing can result in a “recalibrating of the religious center of gravity” for young people, the scholar said, which makes it “easier for them to swallow or make sense of the ISIS religious narrative when it does arrive. It doesn’t seem quite as foreign as it might have, had that Saudi religious influence not been there. ” Why does Saudi Arabia find it so difficult to let go of an ideology that much of the world finds repugnant? The key to the Saudi dilemma dates back nearly three centuries to the origin of the alliance that still undergirds the Saudi state. In 1744, Muhammad ibn Abd   a reformist cleric, sought the protection of Muhammad bin Saud, a powerful tribal leader in the harsh desert of the Arabian Peninsula. The alliance was mutually beneficial: Wahhab received military protection for his movement, which sought to return Muslims to what he believed were the values of the early years of Islam in the seventh century, when the Prophet Muhammad was alive. (His beliefs were a variant of Salafism, the conservative school of Islam that teaches that the salaf, or pious ancestors, had the correct ways and beliefs and should be emulated.) In return, the Saud family earned the endorsement of an Islamic cleric  —   a puritanical enforcer known for insisting on the death by stoning of a woman for adultery. Wahhab’s particular version of Islam was the first of two historical accidents that would define Saudi religious influence centuries later. What came to be known as Wahhabism was “a tribal, desert Islam,” said Akbar Ahmed, the chairman of Islamic studies at American University in Washington. It was shaped by the austere environment  —   xenophobic, fiercely opposed to shrines and tombs, disapproving of art and music, and hugely different from the cosmopolitan Islam of diverse trading cities like Baghdad and Cairo. The second historical accident came in 1938, when American prospectors discovered the largest oil reserves on earth in Saudi Arabia. Oil revenue generated by the   Oil Company, or Aramco, created fabulous wealth. But it also froze in place a rigid social and economic system and gave the conservative religious establishment an extravagant budget for the export of its severe strain of Islam. “One day you find oil, and the world is coming to you,” Professor Ahmed said. “God has given you the ability to take your version of Islam to the world. ” In 1964, when King Faisal ascended the throne, he embraced the obligation of spreading Islam. A modernizer in many respects, with close ties to the West, he nonetheless could not overhaul the Wahhabi doctrine that became the face of Saudi generosity in many countries. Over the next four decades, in    countries alone, Saudi Arabia would build 1, 359 mosques, 210 Islamic centers, 202 colleges and 2, 000 schools. Saudi money helped finance 16 American mosques four in Canada and others in London, Madrid, Brussels and Geneva, according to a report in an official Saudi weekly, Ain  . The total spending, including supplying or training imams and teachers, was “many billions” of Saudi riyals (at a rate of about four to a dollar) the report said. Saudi religious teaching had particular force because it came from the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad, the land of Islam’s two holiest places, Mecca and Medina. When Saudi imams arrived in Muslim countries in Asia or Africa, or in Muslim communities in Europe or the Americas, wearing traditional Arabian robes, speaking the language of the Quran  —   and carrying a generous checkbook  —   they had automatic credibility. As the 20th century progressed and people of different nationalities and faiths mixed routinely, the puritanical, exclusionary nature of Wahhab’s teachings would become more and more dysfunctional. But the Saudi government would find it extraordinarily difficult to shed or soften its ideology, especially after the landmark year of 1979. In Tehran that year, the Iranian revolution brought to power a radical Shiite government, symbolically challenging Saudi Arabia, the leader of Sunnism, for leadership of global Islam. The declaration of an Islamic Republic escalated the competition between the two major branches of Islam, spurring the Saudis to redouble their efforts to counter Iran and spread Wahhabism around the world. Then, in a stunning strike, a band of 500 Saudi extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca for two weeks, publicly calling Saudi rulers puppets of the West and traitors to true Islam. The rebels were defeated, but leading clerics agreed to back the government only after assurances of support for a crackdown on immodest ways in the kingdom and a more aggressive export of Wahhabism abroad. Finally, at year’s end, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and seized power to prop up a Communist government. It soon faced an insurgent movement of mujahedeen, or holy warriors battling for Islam, which drew fighters from around the world for a   battle to expel the occupiers. Throughout the 1980s, Saudi Arabia and the United States worked together to finance the mujahedeen in this great Afghan war, which would revive the notion of noble armed jihad for Muslims worldwide. President Ronald Reagan famously welcomed to the Oval Office a delegation of bearded “Afghan freedom fighters” whose social and theological views were hardly distinguishable from those later embraced by the Taliban. In fact, the United States spent $50 million from 1986 to 1992 on what was called a “jihad literacy” project  —   printing books for Afghan children and adults to encourage violence against   “infidels” like Soviet troops. A   language textbook for Pashto speakers, for example, according to a study by Dana Burde, an associate professor at New York University, used “Mujahid,” or fighter of jihad, as the illustration: “My brother is a Mujahid. Afghan Muslims are Mujahedeen. I do jihad together with them. Doing jihad against infidels is our duty. ” One day in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks, Robert W. Jordan, the United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was driving in the kingdom with the longtime Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan. The prince pointed to a mosque and said, “I just fired the imam there. ” The man’s preaching had been too militant, he said. Mr. Jordan, a Texas lawyer, said that after the Qaeda attacks, he had stepped up pressure on the Saudi government over its spread of extremism. “I told them: ‘What you teach in your schools and preach in your mosques now is not an internal matter. It affects our national security,’” he said. After years of encouraging and financing a harsh Islam in support of the   jihad, the United States had reversed course  —   gradually during the 1990s and then dramatically after the Sept. 11 attacks. But in pressuring Saudi Arabia, American officials would tread lightly, acutely aware of American dependence on Saudi oil and intelligence cooperation. Saudi reform would move at an excruciatingly slow pace. Twelve years after Sept. 11, after years of quiet American complaints about Saudi teachings, a State Department contractor, the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy, completed a study of official Saudi textbooks. It reported some progress in cutting back on bigoted and violent content but found that plenty of objectionable material remained. Officials never released the 2013 study, for fear of angering the Saudis. The New York Times obtained it under the Freedom of Information Act. Seventh graders were being taught that “fighting the infidels to elevate the words of Allah” was among the deeds Allah loved the most, the report found, among dozens of passages it found troubling. Tenth graders learned that Muslims who abandoned Islam should be jailed for three days and, if they did not change their minds, “killed for walking away from their true religion. ” Fourth graders read that   had been “shown the truth but abandoned it, like the Jews,” or had replaced truth with “ignorance and delusion, like the Christians. ” Some of the books, prepared and distributed by the government, propagated views that were hostile to science, modernity and women’s rights, not to say downright quirky  —   advocating, for instance, execution for sorcerers and warning against the dangers of the Rotary Club and the Lions Club. (The groups’ intent, said a   textbook, “is to achieve the goals of the Zionist movement. ”) The textbooks, or other Saudi teaching materials with similar content, had been distributed in scores of countries, the study found. Textbook reform has continued since the 2013 study, and Saudi officials say they are trying to replace older books distributed overseas. But as the study noted, the schoolbooks were only a modest part of the Saudis’ lavishly funded global export of Wahhabism. In many places, the study said, the largess includes “a   school with a Wahhabist faculty (educated in a   Wahhabist University) attached to a mosque with a Wahhabist imam, and ultimately controlled by an international Wahhabist educational body. ” This ideological steamroller has landed in diverse places where Muslims of different sects had spent centuries learning to accommodate one another. Sayyed Shah, a Pakistani journalist working on a doctorate in the United States, described the devastating effect on his town, not far from the Afghan border, of the arrival some years ago of a young Pakistani preacher trained in a   seminary. Village residents had long held a mélange of Muslim beliefs, he said. “We were Sunni, but our culture, our traditions were a mixture of Shia and Barelvi and Deobandi,” Mr. Shah said, referring to Muslim sects. His family would visit the large Barelvi shrine, and watch their Shiite neighbors as they lashed themselves in a public religious ritual. “We wouldn’t do that ourselves, but we’d hand out sweets and water,” he said. The new preacher, he said, denounced the Barelvi and Shiite beliefs as false and heretical, dividing the community and setting off years of bitter argument. By 2010, Mr. Shah said, “everything had changed. ” Women who had used shawls to cover their hair and face began wearing full burqas. Militants began attacking kiosks where merchants sold secular music CDs. Twice, terrorists used explosives to try to destroy the village’s locally famous shrine. Now, Mr. Shah said, families are divided his cousin, he said, “just wants Saudi religion. ” He said an entire generation had been “indoctrinated” with a rigid, unforgiving creed. “It’s so difficult these days,” he said. “Initially we were on a single path. We just had economic problems, but we were culturally sound. ” He added, “But now it’s very difficult, because some people want Saudi culture to be our culture, and others are opposing that. ” C. Christine Fair, a specialist on Pakistan at Georgetown University, said Mr. Shah’s account was credible. But like many scholars describing the Saudi impact on religion, she said that militancy in Pakistan also had local causes. While Saudi money and teaching have unquestionably been “accelerants,” Pakistan’s sectarian troubles and jihadist violence have deep roots dating to the country’s origins in the partition of India in 1947. “The idea that without the Saudis Pakistan would be Switzerland is ridiculous,” she said. That is the disputed question, of course: how the world would be different without decades of   shaping of Islam. Though there is a widespread belief that Saudi influence has contributed to the growth of terrorism, it is rare to find a direct case of cause and effect. For example, in Brussels, the Grand Mosque was built with Saudi money and staffed with Saudi imams. In 2012, according to Saudi diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, one Saudi preacher was removed after Belgian complaints that he was a “true Salafi” who did not accept other schools of Islam. And Brussels’ immigrant neighborhoods, notably Molenbeek, have long been the home of storefront mosques teaching   Salafi views. After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November and in Brussels in March were tied to an Islamic State cell in Belgium, the Saudi history was the subject of several news media reports. Yet it was difficult to find any direct link between the bombers and the Saudi legacy in the Belgian capital. Several suspects had petty criminal backgrounds their knowledge of Islam was described by friends as superficial they did not appear to be regulars at any mosque. Though the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blasts, resentment of the treatment of North African immigrant families in Belgium and exposure to Islamic State propaganda, in person or via the internet and social media, appeared to be the major factors motivating the attacks. If there was a Saudi connection, it was highly indirect, perhaps playing out over a generation or longer. Hind Fraihi, a   journalist who went underground in the Brussels immigrant neighborhood of Molenbeek in 2005 and wrote a book about it, met   imams and found lots of extremist literature written in Saudi Arabia that encouraged “polarization, the sentiment of us against them, the glorification of jihad. ” The recent attackers, Ms. Fraihi said, were motivated by “lots of factors  —   economic frustration, racism, a generation that feels it has no future. ” But Saudi teaching, she said, “is part of the cocktail. ” Without the Saudi presence over the decades, might a more progressive and accommodating Islam, reflecting immigrants’ Moroccan roots, have taken hold in Brussels? Would young Muslims raised in Belgium have been less susceptible to the stark, violent call of the Islamic State? Conceivably, but the case is impossible to prove. Or consider an utterly different cultural milieu  —   the world’s most populous Muslim country, Indonesia. The Saudis have sent money for   books and teachers for decades, said Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta. “Over time,” said Ms. Jones, who has visited or lived in Indonesia since the 1970s, the Saudi influence “has contributed to a more conservative, more intolerant atmosphere. ” (President Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a boy, has remarked on the same phenomenon.) She said she believed money from private Saudi donors and foundations was behind campaigns in Indonesia against Shiite and Ahmadi Islam, considered heretical by Wahhabi teaching. Some   Indonesian religious vigilantes are   she said. But when Ms. Jones studied the approximately 1, 000 people arrested in Indonesia on terrorism charges since 2002, she found only a few  —   “literally four or five”  —   with ties to Wahhabi or Salafi institutions. When it comes to violence, she concluded, the Saudi connection is “mostly a red herring. ” In fact, she said, there is a gulf between Indonesian jihadists and Indonesian Salafis who look to Saudi or Yemeni scholars for guidance. The jihadists accuse the Salafis of failing to act on their convictions the Salafis scorn the jihadists as extremists. Whatever the global effects of decades of Saudi proselytizing, it is under greater scrutiny than ever, from outside and inside the kingdom. Saudi leaders’ ideological reform efforts, encompassing textbooks and preaching, amount to a tacit recognition that its religious exports have sometimes backfired. And the kingdom has stepped up an aggressive public relations campaign in the West, hiring American publicists to counter critical news media reports and fashion a reformist image for Saudi leaders. But neither the publicists nor their clients can renounce the strain of Islam on which the Saudi state was built, and old habits sometimes prove difficult to suppress. A prominent cleric, Saad bin Nasser   had been stripped of a leadership position by the previous king, Abdullah, for condemning coeducation. King Salman restored Mr. Shethri to the job last year, not long after the cleric had joined the chorus of official voices criticizing the Islamic State. But Mr. Shethri’s reasoning for denouncing the Islamic State suggested the difficulty of change. The group was, he said, “more infidel than Jews and Christians. ”",0
4511,"Malia Obama Rebels, Sort of, by Choosing Harvard - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   So much for President Obama’s fatherly advice on college. Malia Obama, his older daughter and perhaps the nation’s most scrutinized and   college applicant, has opted to attend Harvard University beginning in the fall of 2017, apparently disregarding her parents’ counsel that she need not choose a school with a big name and reputation. The White House announced Malia’s choice, and her decision to take a gap year, on Sunday in a short statement from the first lady’s office, ending a season of speculation and surveillance on her college search process. She will become the latest in a long line of presidential children to attend the highly ranked Ivy League university. The president suggested that, with his own daughter, he had weighed into the national angst over the increasing difficulty of getting into prestigious colleges, and said that he had made it clear there were other options for Malia, whom he has described as a capable, conscientious student who is ready to make her way independently in the world. Last fall, the president said he had told his daughter “not to stress too much” about being accepted to a particular school, adding, “Just because it’s not some   famous, fancy school doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get a great education there. ” But in the end, Malia, 17, a daughter of two academic overachievers who both attended law school at Harvard, gravitated to an institution with not only a   name, but also plenty of experience hosting  —   and, to some degree, protecting  —   the children of some of the world’s most powerful people. “The challenge of being a first child is to be normal within the context of all the scrutiny, and the challenge of everybody around them is to pretend like they’re normal and nothing’s out of the ordinary, which puts an enormous amount of stress on both the kid and the school,” said Gil Troy, a presidential historian at McGill University and the author of “The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s. ” “The larger the institutional ego of the place, the more comfortable you can feel about the ability to cope with that and still have as close to a normal experience as possible. ” Harvard has long been a destination for the children of American and foreign leaders as well as those of celebrities and the ultrawealthy its police force even has a   dignitary protection unit. By deferring her start date until 2017, Malia may be maximizing her chances of having an ordinary freshman year, removed from the kind of news media attention and social media chatter her parents have worked to fend off for their daughters throughout Mr. Obama’s time in office. Malia had a taste of what life outside the White House might be like during a college tour last fall, when students posted photographs of her at a Brown University party. “The degree to which every presidential child is half a millisecond away or a snapshot away or an Instagram away from scandal  —   it’s really kind of unfair,” Mr. Troy said. Once the parent has left office, he added, “the kids can get to at least some level of irrelevance that they absolutely cannot get when they’re still in the White House. ” The gap year will also allow the Obamas to avoid the type of spectacle that heralded the arrival of Chelsea Clinton for her freshman year at Stanford University in 1997. Bill and Hillary Clinton arrived on campus to drop her off with more than 200 reporters in tow. Dozens of Secret Service agents swarmed the scene, investigating parked vehicles and trying unsuccessfully to blend in. When it came time for President George W. Bush’s twin daughters to attend college  —   Barbara at Yale University and Jenna at the University of Texas at Austin  —   things were much more   recalled Anita McBride, a former chief of staff to Laura Bush. “It was a different time, and there was not this constant    focus on where these girls were and what they were doing,” Ms. McBride said. With Malia, she added, “We’ve watched her grow up to a certain degree in the public eye, and people feel it’s their business to know. ” Both the White House and the   colleges said to be Malia’s favorites had been barraged with questions in recent days about where she would choose to go. When she accompanied her father on a trip to California last month, speculation raged about whether Malia had tagged along to give Stanford University a final look before committing to go there. Conjecture only grew after a photograph surfaced late Saturday night of Malia wearing a crimson Harvard 2020  . Harvard said little on Sunday beyond confirming that Malia had accepted an offer of admission and had deferred enrollment for a year. But on campus, where students were studying Sunday for final exams, the news was greeted by many with rivalrous pride. Harvard accepted just 5. 2 percent of applicants this year, making it the   selective college in the country after Stanford. It is also one of the most expensive, costing more than $60, 000 a year for tuition, room, board and other fees. Sidwell Friends School, the elite Washington prep school where Malia is a senior, typically sends a handful of students to Harvard each year. The list of presidential children who have attended Harvard includes John Quincy Adams and his son, John Adams II Abraham Lincoln’s son Robert the sons of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy and George W. Bush, who went to business school there. Malia will quickly be put in touch with that history when she arrives on campus. Freshmen typically live in Harvard Yard, the university’s historic center, and take their meals in Annenberg Hall, a grand Victorian cafeteria lined with portraits and busts of early American leaders. White House officials would not comment on Sunday on how Malia would spend the year until she enrolls. She has spent parts of the past two summers working on television sets in New York and Los Angeles, a path she could continue. First, though, is graduation, which Sidwell holds in early June. Mr. Obama has made it very clear that the speaker at the ceremony will not be him. “Malia is more than ready to leave, but I’m not ready for her to leave,” he said on the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” in February. “And I was asked if I would speak at her graduation, and I said, ‘Absolutely not,’ because I’m going to be sitting there with dark glasses, sobbing. ”",0

Hillary Clinton criticized Donald Trump for his derogatory comments on women and minorities in her first major speech as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The venue, a Planned Parenthood event, underscored her current focus on rallying the Democratic base rather than appealing to the center. She followed up on two big endorsements, meeting with Senator Elizabeth Warren and having aides begin setting up President Obama’s campaign appearances. _____ 2. Mr. Trump lashed back at Mrs. Clinton and sought to rally evangelical Christians, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s “Road to Majority” conference. Protesters disrupted the proceedings. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, offered an unexpectedly blunt view of Mr. Trump’s failings and left open the possibility of rescinding his endorsement. _____ 3. Gawker Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. The company faces a $140 million legal judgment from an    lawsuit brought by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan, with the financial backing of the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. Gawker still plans to appeal. Above, its founder, Nick Denton, after the initial verdict. _____ 4. Thousands of people turned out in Louisville, Ky. for a joyous celebration of the life of Muhammad Ali, the boxing legend and civil rights icon honored around the world. Bill Clinton, Billy Crystal, Bryant Gumbel and Ali’s wife, Lonnie, eulogized him. People in the street chanted “Ali” and threw flowers at his funeral cortege, slapping hands with members of the Ali family and the actor Will Smith. “He dared to love black people at a time when black people had a problem loving themselves,” a minister said. _____ 5. Hockey fans also lost an icon. Gordie Howe, the Detroit Red Wings player who loved the sport so much that he was a grandfather by the time he retired, died Friday at the age of 88. The consummate tough guy, he was beloved in Detroit, where he spent most of his 32 professional seasons. Scotty Bowman, one of hockey’s most successful coaches, once said, “In my estimation, he was the best ever. ” _____ 6. Three officers who served in New York City’s Correction Department were the latest to be convicted in the brutal beating of an inmate, a case that brought to light the pervasive culture of violence on Rikers Island. The district attorney said the convictions “send a clear message that a uniform and a badge do not absolve anyone from committing a crime, and that even an inmate deserves to be treated like a human being. ” _____ 7. Malia Obama graduated from the prestigious Sidwell Friends high school in Washington. But social media appeared to pay more attention to two graduates in Texas, one of them above. The young women were met with support and outrage for declaring themselves to be undocumented immigrants as they left their Texas high schools.

4513,BREAKING: Trump Set to Break 50-Year-Old Record With Black Voters,"— Ted Carroll (@mediainvestors) October 25, 2016 
These numbers must have Democrat rival Hillary Clinton worried sicker than she already is. Advertisement - story continues below 
The mainstream media would love to have everyone believing that all black Americans hate Trump, but that’s just not true . 
Trump has gained the support of many who understand that Democrats have never actually followed through on their promises. They have little to show for supporting liberals but more strife and tension from a black president who promised hope and change. 
Moreover, President Barack Obama has done more to increase racial tension in this country than anyone could have guessed. Many black voters understand that, and they do not see Clinton as someone they can trust to change it. 
Trump has suggested that Democrats have done nothing to help black communities and has pointed out that they often suffer the most from a breakdown of law and order. He has challenged all Americans to think outside the box and vote for someone different — someone who might actually bring positive changes, such as jobs , to their neighborhoods.

4514,US Officials Try to Scare Voters With Terror Threat,"US Intelligence Sees Attacks Likely Ahead of Tuesday Vote by Jason Ditz, November 04, 2016 Share This 
US intelligence officials have reportedly warned law enforcement around the country of the potential for multiple al-Qaeda terrorist attacks on Monday, aimed to coincide with the day before the US election. The reports were described as “ possibly legitimate and concerning. ” 
Details are still scant, but the intelligence has singled out New York, Virginia, and Texas as the mostly likely targets. Even then, they offered no details on potential locations, saying al-Qaeda and its affiliates are eager to regain their relevance. 
A NYPD spokesman briefed on the matter said that the threats “ lack specificity ,” however local police around the country were said to have been warned that polling places are considered “attractive targets” for both organized and homegrown terror attacks. 
Of course, saying that any upcoming event is a potential “attractive target” is not unusual these days, and hardly a significant holiday goes by in the US where warnings and briefings about potential attacks are not heavily publicized. 
The Monday warning offers some unusual details, however, as generally one would think the day of the election itself would be the target, when more people are queuing up for the vote. An attack the day before the election would, however, cast a rather dramatic pall over the entire matter. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
4515,"The Divorce Diet? Losing a Spouse and Some Pounds, Too - The New York Times","Wedding season is here, and many brides and grooms will find themselves in the best shape of their lives. Through a combination of adrenaline, dieting and   exercise, they will walk the aisle as slim and buff as they will most likely ever be. That is, some say, unless they get divorced. For a lot of people, the divorce process seems to kick up stress hormones and motivations quite similar to those swirling around the body and psyche when a marriage ceremony draws near. “It goes to your guts, literally,” said Julie Worden, a yoga teacher in Brooklyn who divorced in 2015. “It’s almost the same feeling as falling in love. It’s the butterflies. ” Ms. Worden, 43, a former dancer, lost 15 pounds during her divorce. “The body goes through this emotional stress, higher levels of cortisol,” she said. “There were times I couldn’t eat because I couldn’t break food down. ” Something similar happened to Astrid Swan, 34, a fitness expert in Los Angeles. “One day I put on a pair of jeggings and they were baggy,” she said. At first she was thrilled, she recalled, because as a former model who was always being told to lose weight, she could “now walk the runways in Milan. ” But as a trainer, she knew that her low weight, and the pain involved with how she achieved it, was unsustainable. “I took some time to celebrate, and then the next month I was like, ‘O. K. this is a problem. ’” Alison Rona, 53, an interior designer and architectural consultant who lives in Brooklyn, also felt conflicted about her new figure. It pleased her, as a sort of “bonus,” she recalled, and yet she felt uninspired to do anything about it, like buy new clothes or date. “It felt a little false, that inside I was still hurting so much. Physically I had a body to show off but I didn’t have the confidence, because I was still so distraught by what had happened. ” Often called “the divorce diet,” which most recently got a celebrity   by the country singer Blake Shelton, who slimmed down after he split from the singer Miranda Lambert, the   regimen is really nothing more than stress, rage, sadness, and (for some) a need to control any part of their lives  —   through diet, exercise, or both  —   that hasn’t fallen into complete chaos. Rachel Sussman, a relationship expert and author of “The Breakup Bible,” said she sees upward of 70 percent of people going through divorce or breakups growing extremely thin. “Then when they start feeling better, at least 50 percent of those people want to keep that weight off,” she said. James J. Sexton, a divorce lawyer in Manhattan and Rockland County, N. Y. estimated that about 80 percent of his clients have lost weight,   of them through exercise, and the others because they weren’t eating or were depressed. When Mr. Sexton went through his own divorce at age 36, he turned to intense exercise, practicing Bikram yoga six days a week. “It became something that stabilized me,” he said. “When the ground has fallen out from beneath you, where you sleep, your children are gone, where you live, exercise is a form of religion, there’s a routine and predictability to it,” he said. “In a scary world and in a scary time of your life, it’s wonderful to have it. ” “You can drink and you can take Xanax or you can join SoulCycle,” he said. Those with compromised metabolisms or who eat their feelings may not have much sympathy for skinnier people under divorce duress, but losing one’s appetite can turn into something serious. Ms. Sussman warns of the divorce diet becoming a gateway to eating disorders, and that those going through divorce need calories and protein to keep their cognitive abilities functioning when they are negotiating important legal issues. Ms. Swan, the fitness expert, said she was so disoriented by her divorce that she had to force herself to eat. “I had to remind myself, ‘You’re going to go and you’re going to get that sandwich,’” she said. But she also believes that exercise, even for those who are underweight or who have lost their appetites, is the best cure. “After a workout, you are craving a replenishment, your muscles know you need it,” she said, “not to mention endorphins, your time, your focus. ” Ms. Worden, the dancer, got certified in Kundalini yoga to get her strength back and to improve her   she said. She now teachers a class specifically for divorced women called Sustaining the Groove to “clear out the nervous system of the yucks,” she said. Already thin, Ms. Worden gained back the 15 pounds she had lost within a year. But she said that many of her students had lost weight in her class and were happy to keep it off. “You’re so concerned with clearing out the rage that it happens without you even knowing it,” she said. Mark Fisher, who owns a gym in midtown Manhattan, agrees that exercise is crucial during “this time of disruption,” but warns against exercising too hard, which can compound the stress even further. “Most people would benefit from having movement that the body doesn’t perceive as a wartime scenario,” like yoga, he said. “We tend to like these workouts that take us to the limit, but these other softer workouts calm the body, the nervous system. ” Going through a divorce, like getting married, is often about entering a new life phase. And many women, said Cynthia Sass, a nutritionist and author in Manhattan, take that idea and run with it. “In many marriages, spouses become each other’s partners in crime by eating unhealthily together, including patterns like splitting pizzas, sharing pints of ice cream, snacking while watching TV,” she said. Ms. Sass said that many of her clients have told her that they have no desire to return to their old, unhealthy ways once they are single again. “Divorce can be a real opportunity for positive, healthy transformation,” she said. Jessica Rojas, a    buyer for Estée Lauder, certainly sees it that way. After a rocky divorce in 2013 (“I would rather lose a limb than go through that again”) Ms. Rojas started Snatched in Six Weeks, an exercise and nutrition program at Mr. Fisher’s gym. “I could barely do a   on my knees,” she said about her   state. Mr. Fisher’s   community of “misfits, nerds, outcasts, and Broadway geeks” cheered her on, she said, and after Snatched ended, she continued to work out there, enjoying the positive energy at the gym. Within a few months, she said, she went from a “flabby size 8 with a corporate commuter look” to a size 2. “That was the one thing I could have control over at that moment,” Ms. Rojas said. “I was in a fight for my life. ” “I’m going to get hot, I’m going to get the guy I want, I’m going to get the things I want out of life,” she recalled herself thinking. It worked. Last fall she locked eyes with Tim Kosakowski, 40, an old friend who works in wildlife management, at their 20th high school reunion in Easton, Pa. She fell for him immediately. On June 25, Ms. Rojas’s 40th birthday, she and Mr. Kosakowski were married under a gazebo at his home, which they now share, in Washington Township, N. J.",0

During an interview aired on Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Senate Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell ( ) said that whether or not he needs to use the nuclear option to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court “will depend on the Democrats. ”  When asked if he would have to use the nuclear option to get Gorsuch confirmed, McConnell answered, “That will depend on the Democrats. ” He’ll be confirmed. the issue for your audience, the issue you’re raising is, will we have to get cloture, in other words, 60 votes to advance the nomination?

4517,"Review: For Muhammad Ali, an Endless Round of Books - The New York Times","He said it best, of course: He was “the astronaut of boxing” who “handcuffed lightning,” threw “thunder in jail” the dazzling warrior “with iron fists and a beautiful tan” “the greatest fighter that ever will be” who could “run through a hurricane” and not get wet. But Muhammad Ali shook the world with more than his electrifying speed and power in the ring. He also shook the world with the power of his convictions: his determination to stand up to the rules of the Jim Crow South, and to assert his freedom to invent himself  —   “I don’t have to be what you want me to be. I’m free to be what I want. ” “I am America,” he proudly declared, decades before the Black Lives Matter movement. “I am the part you won’t recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky my name, not yours my religion, not yours my goals, my own get used to me. ” He stood with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for freedom and social justice. And he stood up against the Vietnam War, refusing to be drafted in 1967 on religious grounds as a conscientious objector  —   a decision that would cost him his boxing title,     years of his career at the peak of his powers, tens of millions of dollars in prize money and endorsements, and for many years, his popularity. These acts of conscience are part of the reason that older fans, including Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, who eulogized Ali, were so deeply affected by his death. As his wife, Lonnie, noted, he also died at a moment when “we face uncertainty in a world and divisions at home as to who we are as a people. ” It’s a moment when racism has infected the presidential race, when many politicians lack the courage to stand up for their own convictions, when radical jihadists have been trying to subvert the peaceful vision of Islam embraced by Ali. Ali’s willingness to speak truth to power outside the ring and his embodiment of many of the political and cultural changes that rocked America in the 1960s are also reasons so many fans spent the weeks after his death watching old videos and reading books about him, of which there are a multiplying number. Ali was a    novelistic figure: not only an incandescent athlete dancing under the lights but also a showman, poet, philosopher, performance artist, statesman and   pioneer, a man compared to Whitman, Robeson, Malcolm X, Ellington and Chaplin. Writers were magnetized by his contradictions: the G. O. A. T. (Greatest of All Time) who vanquished some of the baddest men on the planet but became one of the world’s most revered humanitarians a deeply religious man who loved practical jokes and practically invented trash talk “a radical even in a radical’s time,” as President Obama put it, who became so beloved by Americans across the political spectrum that he was featured in a DC Comics book in which he teamed up with Superman to save the world. He is best remembered today for his boastful doggerel (“Ali’s got a left, Ali’s got a   if he hits you once, you’re asleep for the night”) but he also wrote more serious verse: a poem about the Attica prison riots read, “Better far from all I   To die fighting to be   What more fitting end could be?” Over the years, Ali has also inspired an uncommon amount of stellar writing, from Norman Mailer’s classic account of the boxer’s stunning victory over George Foreman in Zaire in 1974 to David Remnick’s “King of the World,” a powerful account of Ali’s emergence as a transformative figure in American politics and culture. There are also a plethora of essays about Ali by such gifted writers as Joyce Carol Oates, George Plimpton, Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson and Roger Kahn, many of which can be found in a terrific anthology, “The Muhammad Ali Reader” (1998). The newest Ali books, recently rushed into print, hardly rise to the top of the stack. “Muhammad Ali: A Tribute to the Greatest” is a hodgepodge of Thomas Hauser’s many essays  —   lackluster in comparison with the author’s valuable 1991 oral history, “Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times. ” Tim Shanahan’s “Running With the Champ,” an old friend’s reminiscences, has its share of touching moments, but proves less revealing than the 2004 book (“The Soul of a Butterfly”) written by Ali with his daughter Hana Yasmeen Ali  —   an elliptical, collagelike memoir that offered a philosophical look back at his life. Both these books give glimpses of Ali’s dignified,   struggle with Parkinson’s, the disease that cruelly robbed him of the dazzling physical and verbal agility of his youth  —   a struggle that could not help but remind older readers of the passage of time and their own mortality, and boxing’s existential proximity to death (or what Ali once called “the near room” after his war of attrition with Joe Frazier in Manila in 1975). As for Sports Illustrated’s “Muhammad Ali, ” it’s a pretty souvenir of Ali’s life in the ring, with excerpts from that magazine’s voluminous archives and some of the most dramatic sports photos ever taken. They are photos that capture the boxer popping and smoking and throwing lightning bolts in the ring  —   testaments to what the fighter José Torres called “his prodigious magic. ” The archetypal photo of a victorious Ali, standing over the fallen body of Sonny Liston. A violent action shot of him catching George Foreman with a hard right in the Rumble in the Jungle. And one of him locked in a grim   with an exhausted Frazier in the “Thrilla in Manila. ” There are also images of a skinny,    Cassius Clay learning to box, and a solemn Ali, surrounded by reporters, explaining his opposition to the Vietnam War. These new books will help younger readers understand just what a long strange trip Ali’s life has been, and how much social and cultural landscape he traversed. “Muhammad Ali was America  —   he will always be America,” Mr. Obama wrote. “He was our most basic freedoms  —   religion, speech, spirit. He embodied our ability to invent ourselves. His life spoke to our original sin of slavery and discrimination, and the journey he traveled helped shock our conscience and lead us on a roundabout path toward salvation. ” These books also prompt us to remember that perseverance was one of the consistent melodies in Ali’s life: coming back after his   exile to reclaim the world championship in 1974 by toughing it out against Foreman in Zaire coming back to beat Frazier twice, after losing their first arduous matchup and coming back against Leon Spinks in 1978 to win the world heavyweight championship for a third time. As Ali once observed: “Champions aren’t made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them  —   a desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have   stamina, they have to be a little faster, they have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill. ” When Cassius Clay was growing up in Louisville, Ky. the town was segregated, and even when he returned home from the 1960 Olympics with a gold medal around his neck, he was turned away from a luncheonette when he walked in and ordered a glass of juice. He would return to the Olympics     decades later in Atlanta in 1996 as its final torchbearer. By then, he’d become one of the most revered men in the world  —   “a universal soldier for our common humanity,” in the words of Bill Clinton, who like many in the audience that day, wept watching Ali light the caldron, his hand trembling violently from Parkinson’s disease. This month, Louisville  —   where a young Cassius Clay heard calls of “nigger go home” if he ventured beyond his neighborhood  —   turned out to pay tribute to Ali, as his funeral motorcade made its way through the city. Mourners showered his car with flowers and rose petals and all along the route, The Louisville   reported, lawns had been mowed and driveways freshly swept  —   out of respect for the Greatest on his final journey.",0
4518,SNL Gets Real And Delivers The Most Important Message Of The Election Year (VIDEO),"on November 6, 2016 8:03 am · 
Saturday Night Live has helped bring quite a bit of levity to this otherwise horrific election year but in the final episode before the election, before we as a nation go to the polls and decide if we want to be extraordinary or “deplorable,” the cast of Saturday Night Live could not help but drop the act and get real with America. 
It began as it normally does, with Alec Baldwin’s masterful Donald Trump character and Kate McKinnon’s excellent portrayal of Hillary Clinton (if she spent all day every day mainlining a dangerous mixture of sugar and caffeine). 
“I never use emails,” Trump says in the cold opener. “I use a very private, very secure site where one can write whatever they want to and no one can read it It’s called Twitter.” 
After he is informed that everyone can see his tweets, “Trump” replies: 
“Really? And I’m still in this thing? America you must really hate this lady.” 
After a scathing rebuke of the media’s decision to ignore Trump’s cozy relationship with Putin, the KKK, and the FBI and instead focus on something as meaningless as Hillary Clinton’s emails, something magical happened: McKinnon and Baldwin dropped the facade and got serious. 
“I’m sorry, Kate. I just hate yelling all this stuff at you like this,” Baldwin says. “I just feel gross all the time about this. Don’t you all feel gross?” he added, addressing the audience. 
McKinnon agrees and the two embark on a “friendship montage” through the city before returning to the stage. Then they dropped perhaps the most important message you will hear this election year. “None of this would have mattered if you don’t vote,” Baldwin says. 
“We can’t tell you who to vote for, but on Tuesday we all get a chance to choose what kind of country we want to live in,” McKinnon finishes. 
They’re right.",0
4519,The Last-Second Shot: It’s This Tournament’s Buzzer-Beating Heart - The New York Times,"GREENVILLE, S. C.  —   Seton Hall guard Khadeen Carrington hit his first   when he was 11. It was in a gym on Paerdegat Avenue in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. It was a midrange jump shot. His team was down by 1 and won by 1 and, he said, it turned basketball into his duty, not just a game. “It set me up,” he said. “It puts some fuel in it for you where I took basketball more serious, and that’s what I want to do, play basketball. I remember that day going to the park and working on my game, and I kept working and working. ” How long did that feeling from his first   last? “I still have it,” Carrington said. The   is the heart of the N. C. A. A. tournament. It’s a hallmark play, and everyone has a favorite. Lorenzo Charles. Tate George. Tyus Edney. Christian Laettner. If the   shot takes down a favorite (Bryce Drew of Valparaiso, 1998) or delivers a championship (Kris Jenkins of Villanova last year) the celebration is a little louder, the memory a little more enduring. For players, though, draining a   is a benchmark, no matter how young they are. And the setting does not have to be the grand stage of the N. C. A. A. tournament. Arkansas guard Daryl Macon was 14, a freshman at Parkview High School in Little Rock, when he hit a   to send a game into triple overtime. He was not a starter, and he did not even play in that third overtime. But he said he leaned on that moment throughout his high school career. “I was just    as a freshman,” Macon said. “I had my doubts whether I was going to be a player or not. I made that shot and I remember thinking: Maybe I have something. Maybe I have what it takes. “That shot kept me going. Anytime I felt like giving up in high school because I wasn’t getting recruited, I remembered that  . ” Macon went to Holmes Community College and grew into a standout    guard, then joined the Razorbacks’ program this season. On Jan. 24, he had his own   moment when he made three free throws with 1. 6 seconds left to deliver a   win at Vanderbilt. “The floor was shaking under my feet because we were on the road,” Macon said. “I said: ‘Look at the goal, look at the goal. Find tunnel vision. ’” Not all   are the same, of course. Players interviewed here all insisted that the spontaneous dribble and shoot was easier than play stopping and emotions getting a chance to build ahead of   free throws. “It gives you too much time to think,” Carrington said. But the dogma of the   is pretty simple: Do not think, because that is when pressure replaces instinct. Seton Hall junior Desi Rodriguez had his   moment at age 12, while he was in middle school in the Bronx. He made a layup to give his team a   victory. “I started taking basketball more serious from there,” Rodriguez said. “I felt I was good at it. I felt I was getting better. A moment like that wakes you up a little. That was my only one. ” But what of the player who misses the  ? Princeton’s Devin Cannady had an open   that would have lifted the Tigers over Notre Dame in the first round on Thursday. The shot was similar to one he had once made to win a high school game. But this one clanged off the rim and the Irish won,  . “I didn’t think about a March Madness moment,” Cannady told reporters. “It was a good look. It’s a shot I’ve taken before. But the ball didn’t fall like I wanted it to. ” Duke’s Jayson Tatum also remembers a   that didn’t fall, during a playoff game when he was a high school sophomore. His team’s season ended with the miss. “That was a tough one to miss because you have to wait until the next year,” Tatum said. “But it’s just one game. It doesn’t define your career. You keep shooting. I was just 15. I have a lot of basketball to go. ” Sometimes the vanquished have to live with a   for a lot longer than that. It is well known that North Carolina guard Nate Britt lives in the same house in Upper Marlboro, Md. with Villanova’s Jenkins. Britt’s parents are Jenkins’s legal guardians. And it was Jenkins who took down Britt and North Carolina at the buzzer in last year’s national championship game in Houston. When he came home from school last summer, Britt found that his parents had commemorated the moment by putting up pictures of the winning shot near where the family eat their meals. “There is a picture on the wall of the shot,” Britt said. “I don’t eat at my table anymore, partially because of that. ”",0
4520,Woody Harrelson Quits Smoking Pot after 30 Years,"Actor Woody Harrelson is almost as famous for his outspoken advocacy of marijuana as he is for his movie roles, but now, after 30 years of advocacy, Harrelson is swearing off pot. [In a new interview, the Hunger Games star revealed that his pot smoking days are over. Harrelson, 55, told Vulture that he stopped smoking pot a year ago.  “I am a party animal,” the Oscar nominee said. “But on the other hand, I haven’t  …     I’m now extremely moderate, and  …     I actually stopped smoking pot almost a year ago. ” The interviewer noted that he, too, had “a problem” with pot saying that it “messed with his head” and made him “less productive. ” Harrelson agreed to a degree with that characterization, saying, “Yeah, that was a little bit of my issue. Just 30 solid years of just partying too f***ing hard. ” This might shock some of the actor’s   fans. After all, Harrelson has been a longtime fan of pot. So much so that he has publicly supported the marijuana organization NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) has served on the organization’s board, and even once applied to open a medical marijuana dispensary in Hawaii. Perhaps realizing he was bucking years of advocacy, Harrelson was quick to add that he is still a supporter of pot. “I don’t have a problem at all with smoking. I think it’s great. I think it’s a great drug, in terms of  …     Even cops say that the side effect is euphoria. Or the   …     what do you call it?  …     The effect of it is euphoria,” he said. “But when you’re doing it all the time, it just becomes   …     Well, you know. I feel like it was keeping me from being emotionally available. I really don’t want this interview to turn into a whole thing about that. ”   Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com.",0
4523,U.S. Near Bottom in Public ‘Confidence in Elections’ Only Mexico Scores Lower Among OECD Countries,"Poverty Rose in 96% of U.S. House Districts, During Obama’s Presidency & U.S. Near Bottom in Public ‘Confidence in Elections’ Only Mexico Scores Lower Among OECD Countries Poverty Rose in 96% of U.S. House Districts, During Obama’s Presidency O n November 3rd, Morning Consult’s Jon Reid bannered, “Poverty on the Rise in Nearly All House Districts” and he reported that, “A Brookings Institution study , released less than a week before the election, shows that the number of people living in poverty has increased in 96 percent of congressional districts between 2000 and 2010-2014.” 
COVER IMAGE: The Great American Dream. A Vision common in the 1950s propaganda. That finding fits along with others, such as that the economic ‘recovery’ after Barack Obama came into the White House in 2009, went virtually entirely to the very rich. .. According to the top experts on wealth-inequality in the United States, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, American wealth-inequality soared faster during 2003-2013 than ever since the period 1923-1928, right before the Great Crash of 1929. Their study “Wealth Inequality in the United States Since 1913” , published in the May 2016 Quarterly Journal of Economics , reported that ever since the remilitarization of the U.S. from the 2003 invasion of Iraq onward (and continuing under Obama, with boosts to NATO, and invasions such as of Libya in 2011), the percentage of total wealth owned by the richest .1% of American families (those families whose net worth was $111 million or higher) rose from 15% of the total in 2003, to 22% of the total in 2013, and this means that the percentage going to the lower 99.9% declined from 85% down to 78% during that time. .. America’s soaring inequality during the George W. Bush Presidency continued unaffected by the 2009 change of Presidential Administrations. 
.. The dream is now a cruel joke for most Americans, all due to their political ignorance, a treacherous media, and the runaway criminality they have allowed in their political and corporate classes. In fact: whereas Bush’s stock-market plunge in 2006-2008 hit the richest the hardest, Obama’s coming into office restored their lost wealth rapidly, while the wealth of the bottom 90% of the U.S. population flatlined throughout his Presidency. The Obama economic recovery was no recovery at all for the bottom 90% of Americans. Not just wealth but personal income also soared for the super-rich under Obama. The “Share of income earned by top 0.1% wealth holders” soared throughout Obama’s Presidency, at least up through 2012, which is the latest figure shown there for that. So: at least the bottom 90% of U.S. families have experienced none of the Obama economic recovery; what ‘recovery’ from the ‘recession’ there is, went only to the very rich. .. Findings such as those are consistent with, and might help to explain, the finding in the new Brookings study, that 96% of House districts have experienced increased poverty under Obama. The nation’s poor have gotten political rhetoric, but not much else, and the middle class also have received no net benefit, under Obama. U.S. Near Bottom in Public ‘Confidence in Elections’ Only Mexico Scores Lower Among OECD Countries Here are the figures, as emailed by Gallup on November 2nd, and soon to be published as part of the “Gallup World Poll 2016”: Confidence in Elections Among OECD Countries Finland 89%",0
4524,Virginia Governor Restores Voting Rights to Felons - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia used his executive power on Friday to restore voting rights to more than 200, 000 convicted felons, circumventing the   legislature. The action effectively overturns a Civil   provision in the state’s Constitution aimed, he said, at disenfranchising  . The sweeping order, in a swing state that could play a role in deciding the November presidential election, will enable all felons who have served their prison time and finished parole or probation to register to vote. Nearly half are   a core constituency of Democrats, Mr. McAuliffe’s political party. Amid intensifying national attention over harsh sentencing policies that have disproportionately affected   governors and legislatures around the nation have been debating  —   and often fighting over  —   moves to restore voting rights for convicted felons. Virginia imposes especially harsh restrictions, barring felons from voting for life. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, a newly elected Republican, recently overturned an order enacted by his Democratic predecessor that was similar to the one Mr. McAuliffe signed Friday. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, vetoed a measure to restore voting rights to convicted felons, but Democrats in the state legislature overrode him in February and an estimated 44, 000 former prisoners who are on probation can now register to vote. “There’s no question that we’ve had a horrible history in voting rights as relates to    —   we should remedy it,” Mr. McAuliffe said in an interview Thursday, previewing the announcement he made on the steps of Virginia’s Capitol, just yards from where President Abraham Lincoln once addressed freed slaves. “We should do it as soon as we possibly can. ” Republicans in the Virginia Legislature have resisted measures to expand voting rights for convicted felons, and Mr. McAuliffe’s action, which he said was justified under an expansive legal interpretation of his executive clemency authority, provoked an immediate backlash. Virginia Republicans issued a statement Friday accusing the governor of “political opportunism” and “a transparent effort to win votes. ” “Those who have paid their debts to society should be allowed full participation in society,” said the statement from the party chairman, John Whitbeck. “But there are limits. ” He said Mr. McAuliffe was wrong to issue a blanket restoration of rights, even to those who “committed heinous acts of violence. ” The order includes those convicted of violent crimes, including murder and rape. There is no way to know how many of the newly eligible voters in Virginia will register. “My message is going to be that I have now done my part,” Mr. McAuliffe said. Nationally, an estimated 5. 85 million Americans are denied the right to vote because of felony convictions, according to The Sentencing Project, a Washington research organizations, which says one in five   in Virginia cannot vote. Only two states, Maine and Vermont, have no voting restrictions on felons Virginia is among four  —   the others are Kentucky, Florida and Iowa  —   that have the harshest restrictions. Friday’s shift in Virginia is part of a national trend toward restoring voter rights to felons, based in part on the hope that it will aid former prisoners’   into society. Over the last two decades about 20 states have acted to ease their restrictions, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. In Kentucky, Mr. Bevin, who took office in November, promptly overturned an executive order issued by his predecessor, Steven L. Beshear, just before he left office. Then, last week, Mr. Bevin signed into law a less expansive measure, allowing felons to petition judges to vacate their convictions, which would enable them to vote. Previous governors in Florida and Iowa took executive action to ease their lifetime bans, but in each case, a subsequent governor restored the tough rules. Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project, said Mr. McAuliffe’s decision would have lasting consequences because it will remain in effect at least until January 2018, when the governor leaves office. “This will be the single most significant action on disenfranchisement that we’ve ever seen from a governor,” Mr. Mauer said, “and it’s noteworthy that it’s coming in the middle of this term, not the day before he leaves office. So there may be some political heat but clearly he’s willing to take that on, which is quite admirable. ” Myrna Pérez, director of a voting rights project at the Brennan Center, said Mr. McAuliffe’s move was particularly important because Virginia has had such restrictive laws on voting by felons. Still, she said,“Compared to the rest of the country, this is a very middle of the road policy. ’’ Ms. Pérez said a number of states already had less restrictive policies than the one announced by Mr. McAuliffe. Fourteen states allow felons to vote after their prison terms are completed even while they remain on parole or probation. Advocates who have been working with the Virginia governor say they are planning to fan out into Richmond communities Friday to start registering people. Experts say with the stroke of his pen, Mr. McAuliffe has allowed convicted felons to begin registering to vote, and that their voting rights cannot be revoked  —   even if a new governor rescinds the order for future released prisoners. But the move led to accusations that the governor was playing politics he is a longtime friend of  —   and   for  —   Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee for president, and former President Bill Clinton. In the interview, Mr. McAuliffe said that he was not acting for political reasons, and that few people outside his immediate staff knew of his plan. He said he did not consult with Mrs. Clinton or her campaign before making the decision. The executive order builds on steps the governor had already taken to restore voting rights to 18, 000 Virginians since the beginning of his term, and he said he believed his authority to issue the decision was “ironclad. ” Prof. A. E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia School of Law, the principal draftsman of a revised Constitution adopted by Virginia in 1971, agreed, and said the governor had “ample authority. ” But Professor Howard, who advised Mr. McAuliffe on the issue, said the move might well be challenged in court. The most likely argument, he said, is that the governor cannot restore voting rights to an entire class of people all at once. Virginia’s Constitution has prohibited felons from voting since the Civil War the restrictions were expanded in 1902, as part of a package that included poll taxes and literacy tests. In researching the provisions, advisers to the governor turned up a 1906 report that quoted Carter Glass, a Virginia state senator, as saying they would “eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this State in less than five years, so that in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government. ” Mr. McAuliffe, who took office in 2014 and campaigned to restore voting rights to felons, said that he viewed disenfranchisement as “a remnant of the poll tax” and that he had been “trying to figure out what more I can possibly do. ” The governor’s action Friday will not apply to felons released in the future his aides say Mr. McAuliffe intends to issue similar orders on a monthly basis to cover people as they are released. “People have served their time and done their probation,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “I want you back in society. I want you feeling good about yourself. I want you voting, getting a job, paying taxes. ’’",0
4525,Prey: The Reason Turtles First Came Out of Their Shells - The New York Times,"If you are reading this hunched over your desk or smartphone, take this moment to loosen up your neck. Move it up and down. Now side to side. Roll it around clockwise and counterclockwise. Now retract it into your shell. Oh wait, you can’t do that  —   you are not a turtle. But have you ever wondered how these reptiles evolved to have such an interesting trick? Scientists have, and now after studying the cervical bones of a     turtle fossil, a team of researchers thinks that most turtles developed the ability first as a way to spring their head forward quickly to snatch prey, rather than as a means of protection, as was previously thought. The ability further evolved in some turtles to become a crucial part of their defenses. The researchers published their study Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The earliest known turtle ancestors were unable to retract their necks, but today’s modern species can. To understand turtle necks, however, you must first understand the two main types of turtles: cryptodires and pleurodires. Both turtle groups can retract their necks, but they do it differently. Cryptodires include tortoises as well as most turtles: box turtles, sea turtles and alligator snapping turtles. They retract their necks straight back into their shells by folding the muscles vertically. Pleurodires include species that are mostly found in South America, Australia and Africa, like the matamata and   turtles. They bend their muscles horizontally to pull their necks back to the side and tuck it next to their shoulder. Jérémy Anquetin, a paleontologist from the Jurassica Museum in Switzerland and the lead author, and his colleagues studied a     turtle fossil that had some strange characteristics. The turtle, known as Platychelys oberndorferi, was from the Late Jurassic period and lived in what is today Germany and Switzerland. From its shell and skeleton the team could clearly tell that it belonged to the pleurodira group. But the shape of its two cervical bones suggested that it pulled its neck back vertically as cryptodires do, not horizontally. The neck also appeared to be unable to fully fold into the shell. “Why did it have this neck retraction mechanism? This turtle is very peculiar,” Dr. Anquetin said. “Our fossil cannot retract it completely. It brings no value for protection, so we had to find an explanation for that. ” The team homed in on the creature’s other features for clues. Its appearance was similar to modern   turtles, suggesting that it was an ambush predator like the matamata turtle or the common snapping turtle. The two modern species are distantly related, but they hunt using similar tactics. They both lurk among the plants that shroud the floors of ponds, swamps and shallow lakes. Once an unsuspecting fish gets close enough, they strike. “We can expect that our turtle was behaving the same way,” Dr. Anquetin said. He and his team report that the neck mechanisms seen in their extinct turtle and in   cryptodires is an example of convergent evolution, meaning that both P. oberndorferi and   cryptodires evolved the ability independently of each other because of the evolutionary advantages that it offered them in their environments. The method of retracting their necks straight back allowed them to rapidly shoot out their heads and catch darting prey more easily. The researchers acknowledge that their hypothesis needs further testing and that it does not offer an explanation for why pleurodira turtles evolved to pull their necks in sideways. James Parham, an assistant professor of geological sciences at California State University, Fullerton, who has done research on turtles and lizards but was not involved in the study, said in an email the paper showed that the evolution of neck retraction in early turtles was more complex than the binary of folding the neck to the side versus bending it in vertically that we have ascribed to the reptiles today. He added that the team did a good job showing the similarities between the fossil turtle and   ambush turtles, but he agreed that the authors’ hypothesis needed further study. “They set the stage for some interesting new studies and force us to look at the evolution of these fossils in an entirely new light,” he said.",0

4527,Exclusive-Navy SEAL Rep. Scott Taylor: Trump’s Navy SEAL Widow Tribute ’One of the Most Powerful Things I Have Ever Seen’ - Breitbart,"The sole Navy SEAL veteran congressman told Breitbart News the special warfare community prefers not to discuss operations  —   such as the raid in which Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens was killed  —   but President Donald Trump’s salute to his widow Carryn Owens was an important event for the community and the nation. [“It was one of the most powerful things I have ever seen,” said Rep. Scott Taylor (R. .) who, with the   of former congressman Ryan Zinke as the Interior Secretary, becomes the only Navy SEAL veteran serving in Congress.  “I was just blown away,” he said. “She was obviously very strong, and obviously, my community is very proud of her. ” In his first address to a joint session of Congress, Trump singled out Owens as she sat next to the president’s older daughter Ivanka Trump. “Ryan died as he lived,” the president said as the standing ovation from the House floor and the packed galleries crescendoed for two minutes and the widow dressed in black alternated between looking to the president and the crowd and then up to Heaven. “Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. ” Taylor said what Americans witnessed in the House of Representatives Tuesday evening was just a sample of the cost paid by less than one percent of the population. “That’s a family that was committed, and they believed in what they were doing,” he said. “It’s a horrible thing, but it is also good for the nation to see that, because most of the nation has not joined into the sacrifice,” he said. The congressman said he was with the president at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, for the Feb. 1 ceremonial receiving of the remains of the fallen SEAL. “Everybody was quiet,” he said. “The president was right behind me, and I heard him say to himself: ‘Man, this is really tough.’ That’s so important. Not just that he was there, but that he understands the costs as well, because of his decisions to send people into harm’s way. ” Political opponents of the president have called the Yemen raid a “botched raid” and used it as an example of Trump’s failure as the   . “Our community would prefer for it not to be a political football,” Taylor said. “I think it’s a shame —  honestly —  that some folks are trying to use it politically,” he said. “It is bad for the legacy of Ryan and his family. ” Taylor said he traveled in and out of Yemen after his Navy career ended, and it is a troubled and complicated part of the world. Because of the terrorists, such as Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, as well as criminal elements in Yemen, it is worthy of select missions, but he would oppose a       invasion. The congressman said he has no issues with negative statements made in the press by the fallen SEAL’s father, Bill Owens. Gold Star parents and Gold Star family members have the right to say whatever they want to say, given the price they paid, he said. Taylor spoke to Breitbart News moments after the president finished. It was the best speech he has heard the president give, he said. “He discussed unity, not only within the nation but within the parties,” he added. It was excellent the way Trump called people to come together to do big things, he said. “That is why I am here, and that’s what my Democratic peers in my freshman class want to do, too. I just hope the Democratic leadership wants the same thing. ”",0
4528,"Stephen Colbert Reboots ‘The Late Show,’ Fixing It on the Fly - The New York Times","At 10:45 p. m. on Monday night, in a   office above the Ed Sullivan Theater, Stephen Colbert was talking so rapidly that he might as well have been speaking in tongues. Gazing at a monitor, this host of “The Late Show” on CBS was rapidly reading through dozens of jokes that his writers had been composing throughout the first presidential debate between Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton. The goal: to trim     minutes from a monologue Mr. Colbert would be performing live in less than an hour. In phrases that may have sounded like requests but were really demands, Mr. Colbert called out to his team of producers: Could he get a video package of all the times Mr. Trump said “wrong”? Could they cut the word “terror” from the phrase “panic and   terror”? Could they shelve a   joke about “Interrupting Donald Trump” for another night? There was no time to   Mr. Colbert. “Unless there’s a clean hit they think is undeniable, the playground is closed,” he announced to the room at 10:48 p. m. Mr. Colbert and his colleagues were hoping to capitalize on the debate’s colossal viewership and help reverse the fortunes of “The Late Show,” which after a year on the air still trails Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” on NBC and has sometimes finished third behind ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” The “Late Show” team was also trying to sustain the momentum from its live episodes during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in July. In those two weeks, Mr. Colbert and his program showed a nimbleness and bite that he often exhibited on Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report”  —   an improvement on his lumbering, uncertain first months on “The Late Show. ” Among other course corrections, Mr. Colbert has brought in a dedicated showrunner and he has addressed a longstanding identity crisis by reconciling with his   conservative   character from “The Colbert Report,” a version of whom he has dusted off and resumed playing. Now he has to imbue “The Late Show,” on any other night of the week when the future of the Republic is not hanging in the balance, with the same sense of immediacy that has propelled him in his live broadcasts. And he must still find the harmony between his trademark brand of pointed political commentary and the broader demands of a mainstream   talk show. When he started at CBS, Mr. Colbert said in an interview last week: “People were watching me learn to play a new instrument in public. Now I really don’t care and it’s so much more fun. “If I do things that are like the old show,” he continued, “it was a good show. ” Yet the   host is capable of doing something his famously arrogant alter ego never would: admit mistakes. He believes he has identified what he did wrong: cutting himself off from the persona, tone and formats that he established on Comedy Central, for fear that they would overshadow the authentic self that he wanted his CBS viewers to see. As Mr. Colbert said, riffing on a favorite Elvis Costello lyric, “I tried so hard to be myself that I kept on fading away. ” His realization is that he can embrace elements of “The Colbert Report” and still be himself. “It is all me,” he said. “Of course it’s me. I thought of the character. It’s my humor. ” He remains a highly   host, to judge from a Monday evening rehearsal at the Ed Sullivan Theater. As he ran through monologue jokes while bobbing back and forth on a   scooter, Mr. Colbert asked for    changes to graphics of Gennifer Flowers and the debate stage, and called out his bandleader, Jon Batiste, for    munching on veggie chips at his piano. (“Is there a glacier toppling into the Arctic Ocean?” Mr. Colbert asked.) Any time Mr. Colbert hit a line he wasn’t fond of, he would call out to the writers and producers in the theater, “Let’s beat that. ” If, a year ago, the assumption was that Mr. Colbert would simply glide into the time slot and theater last occupied by David Letterman and dominate the   landscape, that did not happen. For months, his “Late Show” never shook off its   jitters, nor established a breakout recurring comedy bit. Though his ratings saw a small spike, to about 2. 5 million viewers a night during the live convention episodes, they generally lag well below “The Tonight Show,” the category leader, which averages more than 3. 6 million. (According to preliminary ratings information on Tuesday, the   “Late Show” was Mr. Colbert’s strongest performance with      viewers since   and tied “The Tonight Show” in overnight metered markets.) Mr. Colbert acknowledged in the interview that he had taken on too much. Was it  —   “Hubris?” Mr. Colbert said before the question was finished. “Yeah. A little bit. You think you know what you’re doing, until you do something different. ” In April, “The Late Show” brought in Chris Licht, an executive producer of “CBS This Morning,” as a showrunner, a role that did not exist at that program. As Mr. Licht explained in an interview, his principal task is to “systematically remove things from Stephen’s plate. ” “Anything that doesn’t involve him thinking creatively and enjoying his performance  —   anything that gets in the way of that, I take,” he added. Mr. Licht has a vision, too, for “The Late Show” to stand out in a crowded field  —   “It’s us versus the Jimmys,” he said  —   and to make topical humor one of its defining features. “The Late Show” will do two more live episodes on Oct. 4 and Oct. 19, following the   and third presidential debates. That path became a little clearer over the summer, when Mr. Colbert’s postconvention episodes were lifted by comedy segments that went viral, like a sketch starring Laura Benanti as a pouting, plagiarizing Melania Trump and a blistering monologue from Jon Stewart, Mr. Colbert’s former boss at “The Daily Show,” criticizing the Fox News host Sean Hannity. (Mr. Stewart is also an executive producer of “The Late Show. ”) Mr. Colbert revived his old “Stephen Colbert” character, in a way (he says the original character is dead, and he is now playing that man’s identical twin cousin) and added a recurring segment called “Werd,” which is awfully similar to “The Word,” a segment on his previous show. (When asked what Comedy Central thought about him using material originally created for that network, Mr. Colbert said, “I have been advised not to answer your question. ” He smiled and added, “It’s funny ’cause it’s true. ” Comedy Central declined to comment.) There is no certain formula for sustaining this adrenaline from night to night, but Mr. Colbert said the solution rested on his being his   self, by “being gobsmacked by the news and walking out and going, ‘Can you”  —   here he restrained himself from saying a naughty word  —   “believe what this person just said? ’” At a time when Mr. Fallon has been widely criticized for his chummy treatment of Mr. Trump, Mr. Colbert’s unvarnished political perspective could prove crucial in distinguishing himself from his network competitors. Without commenting directly on Mr. Fallon’s program, Mr. Colbert said, “I’ve surrendered to my natural instincts, and to how I actually feel on a daily basis. ” Besides, Mr. Colbert felt sufficiently regretful about his own interview with Mr. Trump, at the start of his tenure on “The Late Show” in September 2015. “I tried being gracious and pointed at the same time, and got almost nothing out of him,” Mr. Colbert said. “It was actually boring, because he wouldn’t even look me in the eye. Being nice to a guy who isn’t nice to other people, it doesn’t serve you that much. ” Mr. Licht said that topical comedy should be the “bread and butter” of “The Late Show. ” But growing its audience means the show must reach beyond the   crowd that already tunes in for Mr. Colbert’s political satire, and that remains a work in progress. “You have to be as funny, as relevant and as entertaining on a night when there’s no news, as when you’re in the middle of the biggest story of the day,” Mr. Licht said. “That’s what we’re striving for. ” What Mr. Colbert said he had learned from his live shows is not to be precious about his material, and to favor timely responses instead of stale, overthought takes. “Leave nothing on the table,” he said. “Talk about it immediately. If it happens at 5 o’clock and the show tapes at 5:30, we will have it on the show. ” Mr. Colbert’s opening monologue on Monday was mostly cleansed of the jokes in the rehearsal, replaced with bits about Mr. Trump’s persistent sniffles and his frequent invocations of “law and order” and Mrs. Clinton’s state of readiness. (“My new nickname for her is Preparation H,” Mr. Colbert said. “It’s a compliment. ”) There was only one other topical comedy segment, a prepared sketch in which Mr. Colbert interviewed Rob Lowe, who played the character of an undecided voter. Still, Mr. Colbert indicated that he had learned some lessons about being open to future possibilities. As he said, only   about his approach to this broadcast, “I will do anything as long as I have enough time to read it through once. ”",0
4529,Trump Says Alec Baldwin’s Impression Of Him Is Unfair: ‘He’s Portraying Someone Mean And Nasty’ (VIDEO),"Trump Mistakes Ex-Marine Black Supporter For Protester, Calls Him A ‘Thug’ (TWEET/VIDEO) ‹ › Trump Says Alec Baldwin’s Impression Of Him Is Unfair: ‘He’s Portraying Someone Mean And Nasty’ (VIDEO) By Andrew Bradford on October 29, 2016 Subscribe 
Donald Trump doesn’t have a sense of humor. While he may smile from time to time, it always seems forced, as if he’s afraid his face will crack if he smiles too broadly. And now he’s whining yet again about Alec Baldwin’s brilliant portrayal of him on Saturday Night Live. 
As part of an interview with AJ Calloway of Extra , Trump had this to say about the way Baldwin plays him: “Well, I think I’m a much nicer guy than he’s portraying. He’s portraying someone who’s very mean and nasty, and I’m not mean and nasty. I think I’m a much nicer person than he’s portraying, so I think it’s an inaccurate portrayal of me.” 
Clearly, in addition to Trump not having a sense of humor, he also is deficient in the self-awareness department. 
Would the Donald ever do SNL again? Not a chance, he declared: “They want me to go back. No, I’m not interested in going back…They’re making me out to be a very mean, bad kind of a guy and that’s not me.” 
Trump was also asked about the fact that NBC had fired Billy Bush due to the leaked videotape in which Trump said he likes to grab women “by the pussy” and kiss them against their will. The GOP nominee cryptically responded that “they did it to him,” but would not elaborate on who “they” might be. He then added : “I have always liked Billy, but I have not [spoken to him]…but I always found Billy to be a good guy.” 
Yeah, a good guy who laughed when you brazenly talked about how you get off on sexually assaulting women because you happen to be wealthy and famous. 
Face it, Donald, you’re a pig. And to make matters worse, you can’t even laugh at yourself.

4530,"The Hunger Strike, the Protest Tactic of Gandhi, is Vexing Iran’s Penal Overseers - The New York Times","TEHRAN  —   The hunger strike, a pressure tactic of   used by political protesters around the world, is forcing Iran’s powerful judiciary to reconsider the conditions of at least one of its inmates after several started fasts that are leading to widespread support on social media. The exact number of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons is unclear, but according to human rights organizations and reports in local media outlets, seven inmates, sentenced for crimes against the state, have refused to eat for intervals ranging from several weeks to more than two months. Their backgrounds vary, but they include an antigovernment protester, a children’s rights activist, an ayatollah, a spiritual leader and a Lebanese computer technology specialist convicted of espionage. It is not possible to verify their conditions because of restrictions preventing foreign reporters from visiting Iranian prisons without permission. While some members of Iran’s Parliament have said on their social media accounts that they are investigating the reports, other officials have dismissed the hunger strikes as plots organized by foreign opposition groups. Conservative critics further argue that the extensive support for the hunger strikers seen on social media networks is an exaggeration created by automated messages. One of the inmates, Arash Sadeghi, stopped his strike last Tuesday, after the judiciary met his demand to temporarily release his imprisoned wife. She was transferred back to prison on Saturday, said the couple’s lawyer, Amir Raeesian. Refusing to eat to protest conditions in prison is illegal in Iran, but is not uncommon. However, the number of inmates now simultaneously fasting, in combination with a large social media campaign, is unusual in the country. It also providing a publicity platform for those in prison, Iranian analysts say. “The success is clearly motivating others to join,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist close to the reformist factions in Iran. Two of the hunger strikers, Mr. Sadeghi and Ali Shariati, have been convicted of crimes against the state  —   charges that by Western standards would make them political prisoners. They went for nearly 70 days without food, advocates say, surviving on water and salts. Mr. Sadeghi received a   sentence last year for offenses like “provoking protest gatherings,” “conniving with counterrevolutionaries against the system,” “making propaganda against the system,” “insulting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei” and “insulting the sharia,” his lawyer, Mr. Raeesian, said. The “system” is an Iranian ideological term for the country’s political establishment: a coterie of clerics, commanders and revolutionary comrades. Mr. Sadeghi’s sentence is lengthy even by Iranian standards, and reflects what rights activists regard as a new trend in which relatively unknown offenders receive long sentences, often as a warning to others. He began his fast on Oct. 24 after his wife, Golrokh   started serving a   prison term for an unpublished story found on her private computer about a woman watching a film about a stoning and burning a Quran in anger afterward. She was convicted on blasphemy charges. Mr. Shariati, 30, is serving a   sentence for his involvement in a 2014 protest supporting the female victims of acid attacks. He is demanding to be released. Their ordeals have galvanized supporters to highlight the hunger strikes on messaging platforms, using hashtags like #savearash and #sosali. Both became worldwide trending topics on Twitter. The use of the hunger strike in Iran has in some ways put the government in an embarrassing position, as it exalted the Northern Ireland hunger strikers who once vexed the British. The embassy of Britain in Tehran is on Bobby Sands Street, renamed for the Provisional I. R. A. member who was imprisoned in Northern Ireland and died in 1981 after refusing to eat for 66 days. An Iranian journalist, Reza Dehaki, a supporter of his country’s hunger strikes, noted that incongruity. “In the regulations for Iranian prisons, hunger strike is against the law, but we have a street named after #Bobby_Sands the most renowned person who went on hunger strike! #contradiction #savearash,” Mr. Dehaki wrote on his Twitter account. Last Monday, a group of around 50 activists, ignoring the dangers that come with organizing unauthorized protests in Iran, gathered in front of Tehran’s Evin prison, where Mr. Sadeghi and Mrs.   are being held, and called for their release. A day later, Iran’s judiciary capitulated to a crucial demand of Mr. Sadeghi. Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Tehran’s prosecutor, announced that Mrs.   would be given a leave from prison. Mr. Sadeghi ended his fast, after 72 days. “He was brought to a hospital Saturday, after four days,” said his lawyer, Mr. Raeesian. The judiciary, dominated by Iran’s   is engaged in a barely veiled battle with the government of President Hassan Rouhani, which is seeking to limit its powers. Some   say the hunger strikes have been organized with Mr. Rouhani’s tacit support to embarrass the judiciary. Last month Mr. Rouhani released what he called a citizenship rights charter that outlined the personal freedoms of Iranians. “The government, by giving out such charters, is adding fuel to the fire of the hunger strikes,” said Hamidreza Taraghi, a   political analyst. “These are all opportunities for outsiders to apply new pressure on Iran. ” The other hunger strikers are in prisons scattered across the country. Information on their conditions is leaking out through   human rights organizations and local opposition websites. One of the inmates, Ayatollah Mohammad Reza Nekounam, was reported to have been hospitalized on Saturday after 15 days of fasting, according to his website. He is accused of having relations with “spirits,” but supporters say he has been critical of the religious establishment. A children’s rights activist, Saeed Shirzad, 27, has vowed not to eat for at least a month and supporters say he had his lips sewn closed. An open letter with his name on it, published on a Kurdish website, said he was protesting the lack of basic rights for prisoners. Mehdi Kukhian and Karim Chaichian, imprisoned for “spreading propaganda” over the internet, have been on hunger strike for the last three weeks, according to Oyan News, a website promoting the Azari language that the Iranian authorities have sought to block. Another hunger striker, a spiritual healer named Mohammad Ali Taheri, is accused of leading a cult, his supporters say. The Lebanese man sentenced to 10 years for spying, Nizar Zakka, started a hunger strike on Dec. 8, according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, a group based in New York. For inmates, refusing to eat is sometimes the only way to be heard, one prominent Iranian human rights lawyer said. “To do a hunger strike is a last resort for inmates and political prisoners, who are arrested at midnight, interrogated in unknown jails, under horrible pressures, while their families witnessing the ordeals from afar, what can they do but go on hunger strike?” said the lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was imprisoned herself for several years. “It is incredibly hard, but in some cases it leads to success. ” In 2012, while serving a   sentence, Mrs. Sotoudeh went on a hunger strike for 49 days after authorities refused to allow her    daughter to leave the country. She fell into fragile health, drinking only water mixed with salts and sugar. Her weight dropped to 95 pounds. It was the second time that Ms. Sotoudeh had stopped eating. She declared her first hunger strike in 2010, after her family was forbidden to visit or make phone calls. In that showdown, the authorities capitulated after four weeks, allowing her husband and two children to visit weekly. Mrs. Sotoudeh, who was given the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament in 2012, said she was haunted by the deprivations of those protests, even though she prevailed. “I am over 50 years old and I have sustained several diseases, suffered pains for different reasons physically,” she said. “But I should say the hunger strike was the most painful experience which I have suffered in my life and I will never forget it. ”",0
4531,Trump Celebrates American Manufacturing Survey Showing Highest Level of Optimism in 20 Years - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump welcomed a group of American manufacturing companies to the White House on Friday, announcing the results a new survey from the National Association of Manufacturers. [The survey showed that 93 percent of manufacturers had a positive outlook of the future of their industry up from 56 percent in the previous year. The survey includes 13, 000 manufacturing members of the association,  The news marked a   record high for the survey, prompting Trump to claim a “new surge of optimism” for more jobs in the United States, thanks to many of his policies. Jay Timmons, of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that the optimism centered on Trump’s focus on lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and investing in infrastructure. The survey also showed a jump from 26 percent of members saying that the country was on the right track before the inauguration to over 60 percent in the new survey. “We appreciate your committment to investment and job creation in manufacturing and we’re going to deliver,” Timmons said. Several leaders of American manufacturers joined Trump for the event, highlighting the jobs they had created in the United States. “We’re removing   regulations and lifting the burdens on American industry, like I would say have never been lifted before,” Trump said. He noted that a lot of manufacturing jobs had been moved to places like Mexico and China. Trump previewed his upcoming meeting with the President of China at his estate in   . “It’s going to be something, I think, very important, very special, I look very much forward to meeting him and the delegation and we’ll see what happens,” he said.",0
4533,Trump Supporters Get Last Laugh After Hillary Disrespects Them On Radio Show,"Trump Supporters Get Last Laugh After Hillary Disrespects Them On Radio Show Posted on October 27, 2016 by Rebecca Diserio in Politics Share This 
Hillary Clinton is once again pandering to the black community as she’s often done, changing who she is depending on who she is talking to. However, just yesterday, she made a wrong move, hitting Donald Trump’s supporters as she told a hip-hop radio show that Trump and his supporters need to do one thing. Unfortunately for her, she quickly learned that she can’t talk trash and get away with it anymore. 
Hillary showed up on some hip-hop radio station in New York yesterday, and the interview was pure propaganda as she tried to pander to the black community. Hillary even agreed that she gets her fashion look from Death Row Records’ Suge Knight and Snoop Dogg. 
Wherever she gets it, that look is hideous and horrible. Not to mention, Death Row Records was made famous by a song titled “F*ck The Police.” That seems rather fitting since Hillary doesn’t care about cops. She just needs black voters to show up on election day. Hillary agreed with a black radio host that she gets her look from Death Row records, a known cop-hating label that produced the song “F*ck The Police.” 
After talking about her failed fashion sense, she had to get her jab in on Donald Trump, but she took it further than she should have. The Breakfast Club radio host told Hillary that the whole country is divided and that she has to bring it back together. This sparked Hillary to launch her attack, saying: 
“ What Trump has done is to make it possible for people who have racist and sexist and all kinds of prejudices and bigotry to put them right out there ,” Hillary said. “But what he’s done really [is] unleashed a lot of darkness and divisiveness.” 
We all know the only game Hillary’s got going is this thinly veiled narrative that Trump supporters are racist, sexist, and violent. We are “deplorables,” a remark she purposefully made to describe Trump supporters because it is her campaign plan. 
Unfortunately for her, Trump supporters aren’t stupid, and those who are very active on social media fought back at her false rhetoric. For hours after her comments on that radio show, the hashtag # HillarysBullies was trending worldwide. 
Trump supporters made a mockery out of Hillary , sending a truth bomb straight at her. It’s Hillary who is purposely dividing the country with her rhetoric. It’s Hillary who hired paid thugs to beat up Trump supporters. Even Mike Pence got into the act, and below is his tweet to Hillary: ""I'm Hillary Clinton & I approve this message."" #HillarysBullies were bought & paid for. pic.twitter.com/onahYVpGlw 
— Deplorable VP (@MikePenceVP) October 27, 2016 
Hillary is losing this election. Every indication outside the mainstream press shows that there’s little to no enthusiasm for her campaign. Record-breaking numbers of Trump supporters have been seen across the country where early voting is allowed, and even today, Hillary needed Michelle Obama to beg North Carolinians to bring out people to vote. 
With only days left, Trump supporters slapped Hillary hard on social media, and all she’s got is a weak campaign slogan and the lie that Trump’s a racist and so are his deplorable supporters. From her small rally sizes, it’s clear, Americans smell her bullcrap and no one really wants to hear that screeching voice or see her win.",0
4534,Hillary Personally Ordered ‘Donald Duck’ Troll Campaign,"Email 

Hillary Clinton personally ordered a consultant to use a nonprofit group to troll the Trump campaign with a ‘Donald Duck’ mascot, according to the Democratic operatives who say they arranged it with a nonprofit organization. 
When Breitbart News’ Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, confronted Mook about Creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate, Mook claimed: “They’ve never worked for our campaign.” When asked if Clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with Creamer directly, Mook replied: “I don’t think so.” 
Now, however, O’Keefe and Project Veritas have released video of Creamer claiming that Clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans — an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a Donald Duck costume and sending that activist into Trump events, emphasizing the argument that Trump was “ducking” releasing his tax returns. 
The action, if true, would be a black-letter violation of federal election law, which prohibits presidential campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups that can collect unlimited ‘dark money’ from contributors – and don’t pay taxes on what they collect. 
Project Veritas Action video footage shows Robert Creamer, a convicted felon who was forced out of his executive role at the liberal consultancy Democracy Partners, saying Clinton chose the duck stunt. 
‘In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground. So by God we would get ducks on the ground,’ Creamer says in the video.",0
4535,Dallas Democrats Fret over Threat of ‘Voter Fraud’,"Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a   concern: voter fraud. [Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (  100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni   after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.  “According to reports, dozens of voters received   ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections. ” As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West   pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires. “It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of. ” Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson. “I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork. In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections: What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters. Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward: Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go   …     You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other   identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family. Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit     political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning the form with   candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U. S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well. Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore   to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each   ballot in Dallas. ” Rawlings Johnson Re Mail Ballots by BreitbartTexas on Scribd,  Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

4536,Comment on Leaked Soros Memo Reveals Potential Plan to Use Black Lives Matter to Federalize US Police by fungirl91,"Home / Badge Abuse / Leaked Soros Memo Reveals Potential Plan to Use Black Lives Matter to Federalize US Police Leaked Soros Memo Reveals Potential Plan to Use Black Lives Matter to Federalize US Police Matt Agorist August 31, 2016 97 Comments 
Memos and documents published by DCLeaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist George Soros and his progressive organization, Open Society Foundations (OSF). Due to their poor digital curation, however, the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out. The latest of the documents reveals the billionaire’s attempt to organize a “national movement” to create a federalized police force. 
The document shows that OSF saw the killings of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Freddie Gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines. OSF, according to the documents, then held a meeting titled, “Police Reform: How to Take Advantage of the Crisis of the Moment and Drive Long-Term Institutional Change in Police-Community Practice.” 
The memo further documents that Soros-financed groups and personalities influenced a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, created by President Obama. Last may, the task force released a final report consisting of 60 recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices. 
The information is from a 61-page report of an Open Society U.S. Programs Board Meeting that took place in New York City in May of last year. 
States the board meeting document: 
The federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives. In addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the Presidential Taskforce, the White House recently launched the Policing Data Initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust, voice, and solutions to improve community policing. The Department of Justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice, which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice, reduce implicit bias, and support racial reconciliation. 
We are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best USP can use this moment to create a national movement. We have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform, including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work, and opportunities for collaboration. As we proceed, we will engage the funder network we helped to establish, the Executive Alliance on Men and Boys of Color, which now includes forty foundations. 
U.S. Programs (USP) is a part of OSF with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic, economic, and political life. 
According to the above excerpt, USP was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to ‘create a national movement’ to implement their agenda. 
The think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible ‘grassroots’ organizations, such as Black Lives Matter, to achieve USP goals. 
The events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities, including a variety of advocacy efforts, to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change. For example, organized under the banner of the Civil Rights Coalition on Police Reform, organizations like the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law, LCCHR, and LDF are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and, as noted above, 35 effecting federal funding streams. A variety of other national advocacy organizations, including grantees Advancement Project, PolicyLink, the Center for Popular Democracy and the ACLU are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts. Locally based groups such as the Ohio Student Association, the Organization for Black Struggle, the Asian Law Caucus, and the ACLU of New Jersey, to name a few, are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels. Another layer of grassroots and youth-oriented groups like Freedom Side, Ferguson Action, Black Lives Matter and Million Hoodies Movement for Justice are also advocating for specific reforms. The range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity, the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives, among others, which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting. 
While the intentions of reforming police in America seem noble, the very idea of a Soros-led initiative is chilling. 
Another memo, leaked earlier this month, showed the billionaire was potentially funding the Black Lives Matter movement , to the tune of $650,000. Now, as today’s memo shows, we know why. 
As the Free Thought Project has pointed out many times before, Soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world. 
Earlier this month, in an email found within the WikiLeaks’ Hillary Clinton archive, with the subject ‘Unrest in Albania,’ Soros makes clear to Clinton that “two things need to be done urgently.” He then directs the Secretary of State to “bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha” and “appoint a senior European official as mediator.” Revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, Soros then provides Secretary of State Clinton with three names from which to choose. Unsurprisingly, Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by Soros — Miroslav Lajcak. 
This is standard operating procedure for Soros. Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980s, will know that his supposedly philanthropic “democracy-building” projects in Poland, Russia, or Ukraine in the 1990s allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth, according to the New Eastern Outlook . 
Soros-affiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions, such as the Arab Spring, and a number of other uprisings across the world. They have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in Ukraine, and subsequent ratcheting up of Cold War tensions with Russia. 
As these leaked memos and emails prove, the United States is nothing more than one of Soros’ pawns.

I think its time to end local policing for profit. The police force should exist to protect and serve, not to fill the county coffers. We need direct oversight of the police, the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government. The downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets. We can count on them to institute a public facing, qualifications search for candidates. Randy Pitts

As a black woman, here’s what I want to know…with all that money that BLM receives….what the heck do they do?!?! anna miller 
George Soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time. His crimes are well-documented. He is the billonaire who “broke the British pound” in 1992. He is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in Ukraine, toppling a democratically elected president and moving NATO closer to Russian borders. And funding NGO’s who were not really charities, but subversive infiltrators. He is an evil man. Have you noticed how many billonaire Jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes, and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon (both sides of the fence)government positions although they only make up 2% of the populace? Why hasn’t this criminal been arrested? His aim is to deliberately stir up a race war. The police are attacking people of all colors and ages. Yet BLM seems to defend black men who were in truth, guilty. At least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent. Why doesn”t Black Lives Matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks, which is usually the case. Or don’t those black lives matter? And how about the 72% of black children born to single mothers, with NO father in the home? Often to siblings from multiple fathers. These children often grow up to be street thugs. The facts bear this out. Blacks do commit most of the crime in the U.S, and commit more crimes against whites as well. The issue should be on the increasing police brutality on ALL citizens, not only focused on black lives. The police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime. Does the truth enter this equation? BLM detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together, on increased police brutality against the public at large. For Soros, and those who want to increase anti-white sentiment and race tensions, BLM is: mission accomplished. The bastard Soros should have been arrested a long time ago, and imprisoned, and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either. And one can only wonder who is really running this nation, when Soros remains unfettered. Dan 
maybe, just maybe Hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see…. (or simply refuses to see) AZ Patriot 
What are you saying, all Jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that Soros wouldnt be around ? Dan 
oh right, your one of “those” kinds of people huh.. next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh? AZ Patriot 
If I were you, I wouldnt continue to show your ignorance, insensitivity and anti Jew sentiment. Go away Dan 
im ignorant? bwahahah. heres an easy one for ya, whats 6 minus 3 ? Carolyn 
Idiot must run in your family Carolyn 
Dan, you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that Hitler did not slaughter millions of Jews. Go to the Holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the Nazi’s used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the American soldiers when they entered into the prisons. So go into a Hellnory site and w her with your crap. Dan 
so, explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the 90’s from claiming 4 million died there to only just over 1 million? and its now believed that its not even 1 million that died there? 
and you dare to call me the idiot? keep googling, im sure you can find it… Carolyn 
I did not call you an idiot but I should have. Auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps. You check it out. Dan 
wow, you have shown your level of stupid on 2 levels in the one post, good work.. but i digress, ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument… 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww2 with the greatest population compared to all other camps, it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population. how do they just “lose” 3 million deaths from that camp? if auschwitz could not accomodate 4 million deaths but only closer to 1 million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz? 
now, here is hte real kicker, from back in 1901 jews were already claiming the 6 million 4 decades into the future… its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself… 
care to explain how that happened? jew magic i guess? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ef1a9d677260b8a4a2ae4d4d3fe66946ef9deedfffe439b92a51c9f1774787bf.jpg Carolyn 
Dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles? Evidently not. 6M was quoted to show that Russia and other countries had that many Jews. Nothing about death. These prior years to 1938 were expressing the plight of how the Jewish people were being treated. Now Auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered Jews. Now does that sign specifically say that Auschwitz deaths were just Auschwitz murders? Your ‘damn newspapers’ need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing. Dan 
wow, your brain really is broken huh? you cant see the connection between claiming the magical 6 million prophecy (which is actually about claiming the heartland) in 1900 and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww2? the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews? 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying (just like the lampshades and soap myths), once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the 80’s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that 4 million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to “about” 1.5 million. are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here? 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics. 
fun fact: anne frank never wrote anne franks diary, otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter. there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author. fun times. Carolyn 
Oh I see your pattern. Believe that crap instead of what the pictures, written accounts by the liberation armies, and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say 6M Jews died. Did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story? I would bet you did not. You are a typical atheist, Marxist, Democrat. You can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the Democraps started the KKK group and were the biggest slave owners. You people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up. Kind of like your loving candidate Hellnory. Dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews? or even of the gas chambers themselves? or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body? or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day, like in the video i linked above, have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying? 
as for the liberating armies, you do recall that all the “gas chambers” were in ruins when they came through? and there was zero evidence, besides the lamp shades and soap, of any jew holocaust? that account you mean? 
and of course it dosnt say that 6 million died yet, only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence? you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the 6 million at the end of ww2 do you? go find out where that number came from.. the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally. 
“You are a typical atheist, Marxist, Democrat.” and in the face of clear defeat, out with the mindless ad hominem once again. a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth… you are incorrect on all 3 counts, once again. do you ever get anything right? 
“were the biggest slave owners.” guess who the biggest slave owners were? fucking jews!!! hahaha. they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade. 
“Kind of like your loving candidate Hellnory.” and thats the funniest, go find my twitter feed, its full of anti hillary sentiment, in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media (once again, mostly jew owned) for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself… 
ill give you this tho, you certainly are persistent in your stupidity. its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world. Dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j30sWIOMIak Carolyn 
You really have a real talent referencing things. Dan 
yea, this is how you learn things. you take a fairytale, lets use santa as an example, and you work out (when your like 6 years old)… how can there be 12 santas in the same place? why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before “santa” apparently brings them to you a week later? and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy. 
or you know, you can just blindly have “faith” that there is still a santa, you know, like you do… even in the face of such a mountain of evidence… Carolyn 
You need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about. 1.1M Jews killed in all of the Auschwitz camps. Did you know that there were 3 large camps with 4 large crematoriums? No you did not. That is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered, experimented on, starved, gased, and shooting of Jews. 426K Hungary, 300K Poland, 69K France, 60K Netherlands, 55K Greece, 46K Boheman & Moravia, 27K Slovakia, 25K Belgium, 10K Yugoslavia, 8K Itally, 690 Norway, and 34K from other countries. 960K Jews, 74K Poles, 21K Gypsies, 15K Soviet prisoners, 15K Czecks, Yugoslavs, French, Germans. Did you know that Hitler had built 40,000 camps. Death camps, concentration camps, holding camps, gas camp vans, labor camps and detention camps. Many Jews died in ghettos, on trains, during the death march to evade the oncoming of the Russian Army and US forces. These camps were set up in France, Russia, Germany, Poland, and Austria. One of the camps, Berkenau, killed 6 thousand Jews per day. In total 2.7M Jews killed in killing centers and 3.3 Jews shot, gased, experimented on. Now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals? Dan 
of course i knew, i obviously know more about the subject than you do. like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the “facts” i was taught and the advent of the internet and “survivors” videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the “truth” about ww2 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between 300k and i think its 700k (it might be 800k) died in all of auschwitz. while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting (america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time) the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the “allies” were bombing supply lines constantly (yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not “death camps”) in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank, if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus? 
and yes of course many PEOPLE died, many of them jews. thats what happens when you have wars. none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews, stupid. 
but my final question is, how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars? specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary (IE the lampshades, soap, diesel gassing vans, eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc) specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys “rescue”? Carolyn 
Of course you did not know any of the information I wrote. If you profess that you know how many died, then go on the Holocaust Site and you will see that after they checked the records that the Germans kept, you do know they tattooed the Jews, to make sure what numbers were dead or alive. How would I know why they kept Anne Franks till she died of typhus. They very cruel people. The Jews were at war with the Nazi Germans. What the hell are you talking about. If you go on the Site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories. What the hell else do you want. Why don’t you go to Auschwitz and see for yourself? You are so bigoted and I believe you are a lousy Democrap. Despicable REM1875 ✓certified

Los agentes elegidos para el caso, en colaboración con el Centro Nacional de Inteligencia, tratarán de esclarecer este hecho a base de realizar seguimientos, interrogatorios y pruebas psicológicas. 
“Tal y como actúan determinados ciudadanos, parece que se creen que la Policía es tonta. Hay que despejar la duda”, argumentan desde Asuntos Internos. 
“Que la Policía ve una colilla en el suelo y dice: ‘Eh, aquí han fumao'”, ha insistido Ignacio Cosidó, director general de la Policía, que está convencido de que la Policía Nacional “de tonta no tiene un pelo” pese a que no se opone a que el tema se investigue. “Quizá no todos los agentes, pero al menos el 40% de ellos sí son capaces de deducir este tipo de cosas si ven una colilla”, ha matizado. 
“Tonto es el que hace tonterías y esta será la base de toda la operación”, ha asegurado un responsable de Asuntos Internos. “Estamos accediendo a numerosos certificados de nacimiento de policías para constatar que no hayan nacido ayer”, agrega. “Y también hacemos seguimientos para asegurarnos de que ningún agente se chupa el dedo”, promete el jefe de la unidad.",0

4539,"Salah Abdeslam, Suspect in Paris Attacks, Is Extradited to France - The New York Times","PARIS  —   Salah Abdeslam, thought to be the only direct participant in November’s Paris attacks to have survived, was handed over to France by Belgium on Wednesday, prosecutors in both countries said. He was later charged in a French court with murder connected to terrorism, participation in a terrorist conspiracy and possession of weapons and explosives, the Paris prosecutor’s office announced. Mr. Abdeslam, who is also believed to be connected to the attacks in Brussels last month, was the subject of a European arrest warrant, which simplified the extradition between the two European Union countries. “Within the framework of the Paris attacks of the 13th of November 2015, Salah Abdeslam has been surrendered to the French authorities this morning,” the Belgian federal prosecutor’s office said in a statement. The Paris prosecutor’s office said Mr. Abdeslam arrived in French territory at 9:05 a. m. Frank Berton, Mr. Abdeslam’s French lawyer, said he had been brought to France under heavy escort by a helicopter from the   prison where he was being detained, in Beveren, Belgium. The French justice minister,   Urvoas, said after a cabinet meeting that Mr. Abdeslam would be held in isolation in a prison in the Paris region. Mr. Abdeslam, 26, is believed to have been part of a team of 10 Islamic State operatives who carried out a series of shootings and suicide bombings in Paris, and in the northern suburb of St.  on the evening of Nov. 13, killing 130 people and wounding more than 400. A French citizen of Moroccan ancestry who lived in Belgium, Mr. Abdeslam fled Paris for Brussels in the early hours of Nov. 14. He was the target of a   international manhunt before he was arrested on March 18 in the Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels, his hometown. Mr. Abdeslam ran a bar there with his brother Ibrahim, who detonated a suicide vest in the Comptoir Voltaire cafe in central Paris on Nov. 13. French and Belgian investigators have found evidence suggesting that Mr. Abdeslam was heavily involved in preparations for the Paris attacks. He rented cars and at least one safe house, bought material used in explosives and drove across Europe to pick up other suspects. But Mr. Abdeslam’s exact role on the night of the attacks is still unclear. Experts have questioned how valuable he will be to investigators in France, though the French authorities and families of the victims have expressed relief that a surviving participant in the attacks will stand trial. He is suspected of driving three suicide bombers to the Stade de France soccer stadium in St.  and investigators are still trying to establish whether he had intended to carry out another attack. Shortly after his arrest, Mr. Abdeslam told investigators that he had “backed out” of carrying out a suicide bombing against the Stade de France. Mr. Berton said Tuesday said that Mr. Abdeslam had to be judged “for what he has done and not for what he represents, because he is the last survivor and some would blame him for deeds and actions that are not his. ” In an interview with the French newspaper Libération, Sven Mary, Mr. Abdeslam’s lawyer in Belgium, was more disparaging, characterizing his client as a “little jerk from Molenbeek” and as a petty criminal.",0
4540,"Top Hillary Clinton Adviser Said Despite Mistakes, Campaign Faced ’A Perfect Storm’ of Problems - Breitbart","Top Hillary Clinton adviser Karen Finney said on CNN Sunday that Clinton’s campaign faced “a perfect storm” of problems that cost her the election, the Daily Mail reported. [“Look, there are any number of things that you could point to to say that it was a mistake that we made that probably has some merit to it, because it was such a perfect storm of a lot of different things,” Finney told Jake Tapper, sitting on a panel of Democrats on CNN’s State of the Union.  Finney said there was no “magic bullet” that could have changed the direction of the doomed campaign. Even though she said the campaign was doomed, she also said that it was a close race. “Particularly when you look at the fact that in those Rust Belt states   …     that gap is about 70, 000 votes that we’re talking about,” she continued. “A majority of those people agreed with [Clinton] on the economy, thought she’d be better on the economy,’ Finney said. ‘And she’s won 2. 8 million more in the popular vote. ” Finney suggested to Tapper that outreach could be better, like former DNC chairman Howard Dean’s “  strategy” that helped Obama get elected. “I think we need to learn some of the lessons coming out of this election, no question, in terms of how we talk to working families, whether they are black, white, brown and where those families are located, how we talk to them about the issues they care about,” Finney said. “But I don’t think that this is an example of, you know, there are one or two things that was just flip a switch and everything will be perfect,” she said. In November, Finney blamed the election loss on everything but Clinton, saying she lost because of sexism, James Comey, and the media, among other reasons, the Washington Free Beacon reported.",0
4541,"MILO: President Trump, Here’s Why You Must Cut Federal Funding From UC Berkeley - Breitbart","In 1969, Governor Ronald Reagan of California was met with a problem that will sound familiar to those who were following my college tour last week: batshit crazy leftists rioting at UC Berkeley. [Reagan’s answer was to send in the National Guard, armed with buckshot and batons. Contrast this with Berkeley’s more recent approach, which was to give professor and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich a platform to spew a hysterical conspiracy theory in which Breitbart and I hired domestic terrorists to beat up my own fans and the residents of Berkeley and smash up Bank of America ATMs, Starbucks and trashcans.  But back to Reagan. He then gave a news conference, where, in Daddyesque fashion, he slapped down members of the media for encouraging the lawlessness. GOAT. Reagan knew how to handle lawless rioters. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic. twitter.   —   Rita Panahi (@RitaPanahi) November 12, 2016,  The good news for President Trump and others interested in maintaining law and order in the face of leftist anarchy is that police   has advanced since the 1960s, and there is no need to send in the National Guard with shotguns, as Reagan did, which ended up killing one student. In the   century, pepper spray and foam cannons can accomplish the same job without fatalities. And there’s even better news. There’s a way to defeat protests without buckshot, foam cannons, or pepper spray. A way to beat them before they even begin. It’s simple: defund UC Berkeley, and any other campus that encourages the mad, radical politics that is now causing violence on America’s streets on a daily basis. The Department of Education largely controls the   of American colleges. At UC Berkeley last year, federal funding came to $370 million  —   more than half the university’s budget. Colleges fear the withdrawal of federal funds so much that when the Obama administration merely hinted at doing so in 2011 over the largely fabricated “campus rape epidemic,” it led to one of the greatest outbreaks of panic and miscarriages of justice in American history, as colleges set up kangaroo courts which frequently expelled students for sexual assault based on threadbare evidence. The left are well aware of the existential threat they face. That’s why it’s Betsy DeVos  —   and not, say, Jeff Sessions  —   who is facing the toughest confirmation hearing. Jeff Sessions is important, of course, and will no doubt do extraordinary work in foiling the mad globalist dream of open borders, but it’s what Trump might do in education that really strikes terror into the hearts of the left. Higher education is their ideological breeding ground the mad leftist displays that you see in Hollywood and Silicon Valley start on college campuses. Sessions is a problem for the left on a number of fronts, notably law and order and immigration. But if DeVos is bold and aggressive enough, she could tear out the beating heart of leftist power  —   college ideological indoctrination. If colleges were effectively   by DeVos, the left would take generations to recover. At this point, some libertarians  —   like the American party’s cretinous chairman  —   will be clutching their pearls at the thought of using the federal government to influence colleges. Once again (and this is why the right and why libertarians so often lose) they fail to grasp the cultural libertarian argument  —   libertarian ideals will come to nothing in a culture that doesn’t respect liberty. This is what the ‘do what you want, just leave me in peace to mine bitcoin and smoke weed’ faction of libertarianism  —   I. e. most libertarians  —   don’t understand. A similar argument obtains when talking about protecting the first amendment from sources of hostility to free speech, such as Islam, feminism and most of the media. And where are cultural values incubated? Colleges, of course! As long as campuses are churning out students who hate free speech and free markets, what hope is there for libertarian policy priorities? If libertarians want to live in a free society, they’d better get ready to tread on their opponents. At my UC Berkeley show last week,   set college property on fire, smashed up bank windows and ATMs, jumped on people’s cars, and looted downtown stores, including the   liberal Starbucks. They also assaulted dozens of my fans, who were falsely accused of being “Nazis. ” The San Francisco Chronicle reports that   rioters caused around $600, 000 in damages that night, with the riot starting at the college before spreading to downtown Berkeley. $600, 000. That’s an awful lot of money for a communist tantrum. The day after, my tour bus was tracked and my hotel location was leaked online.   Berkeley activists took out the remainder of their frustration on the bus, which was vandalized with spray paint. Following the chaos, only one suspect was arrested, and celebrities, the mainstream media, the Mayor of Berkeley, and UC Berkeley administrators blamed the damage on me —   a homosexual conservative who was unable to deliver a speech because students, brainwashed by their Marxist professors, decided to set their campus on fire. For decades, the university campus has been a hotbed of dogma, brainwashing generation after generation in the most fashionable and foolhardy leftist ideas of the day. From professors offering extra credit to attend   rallies to courses on “The Problem of Whiteness,” leftists on campus are teaching younger generations how to hate. Is it any wonder that they then go around smashing windows and punching people in the face? And if that isn’t bad enough, these thugs are absolutely terrible at identifying their ideological enemies  —   according to the account of Malini Ramaiyer in the New York Times, one person called a “Nazi” and assaulted was a Syrian Muslim student. Oops! Who could have predicted training young people to attack instead of argue could turn out badly? And by the way, if you’re a NYT or Buzzfeed or CNN journalist ‎reading this, you’re to blame too, for creating an environment in which it’s okay to call conservatives Nazis and white supremacists. What did you think was going to happen? The current atmosphere is also terrible for college students themselves. They’re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend what are effectively progressive madrasas, turning them into little more than brainwashed street fighters. Today, a gender studies graduate seems more likely to end up in jail for destruction of property than in a stable job. Perhaps that is part of the plan  —   striking fear into the patriarchy one load of prison laundry at a time. It can end, and it must end, or America will face eight years of violence on its streets, and who knows what state the country will be in after that? all because public universities refuse to honor their first amendment responsibilities. It starts with Berkeley. President Daddy, tear down their funding. DANGEROUS is available to   now via Amazon, in hardcover and Kindle editions.

4542,Sweden’s Anti-Mass Migration Leader in Wall Street Journal: ’Trump Is Right’,"The leader of the     migration Sweden Democrats (SD) party Jimmie Åkesson has written an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal strongly criticising those who dismissed out of hand President Trump’s remarks on the dire security and migration situation. [Lamenting the rise in violence and   that has accompanied the migrant wave that saw Sweden take more migrants per captia than any other European nation, Mr Åkesson remarked that sex crimes in the country had doubled in a year. Reeling off a list of damages done to Sweden by mass migration in the opinion piece   with fellow SD politician Mattias Karlsson, Mr Åkesson urged America to take heed and not repeat the same mistakes of immigration and cultural capitulation made in Europe.  Mr Åkesson wrote: When President Trump last week raised Sweden’s problematic experience with   immigration, skeptics were quick to dismiss his claims. Two days later an immigrant suburb of Stockholm was racked by another riot. No one was seriously injured, though the crowd burned cars and hurled stones at police officers. Mr. Trump did not exaggerate Sweden’s current problems. If anything, he understated them. Sweden took in about 275, 000   from   —  more per capita than any other European country. Eighty percent of those who came in 2015 lacked passports and identification, but a majority come from Muslim nations. Islam has become Sweden’s   religion. In Malmö, our   city, Mohamed is the most common name for baby boys. The effects are palpable, starting with national security. An estimated 300 Swedish citizens with immigrant backgrounds have traveled to the Middle East to fight for Islamic State. Many are now returning to Sweden and are being welcomed back with open arms by our socialist government. In December 2010 we had our first suicide attack on Swedish soil, when an Islamic terrorist tried to blow up hundreds of civilians in central Stockholm while they were shopping for Christmas presents. Thankfully the bomber killed only himself. Read more at the Wall Street Journal. Mr Åkesson’s Sweden Democrats are presently riding high in the polls, with the next general election expected in September 2018. While the governing Social Democrat party has held the lead position in polls for much of the past year, the Sweden Democrats, buoyed by their unique position as opponents of the mass migration that has so rapidly transformed Swedish society have often enjoyed a close second place. The position could be crucial after the 2018 election if the SD are able to enter into coalition with other   parties and freeze the left out of power, even if Prime Minister Löfven’s Social Democrats are able to command fractionally more support.

4543,How to Survive Being an Airbnb Host - The New York Times,"After my first Airbnb guests checked out of our garage apartment last February, I eagerly called up their online review.

When they arrived for the   stay in my home southwest of Austin, I met them cheerily with a basket of muffins and walked them through the apartment, which my husband and I used to rent out   until we decided to jump on the Airbnb gravy train. If all went well, we figured we could make the $650 we used to get per month in six nights. As a travel writer, I’ve reviewed scores of hotels and was quite sure I knew what I was doing. We bought a sumptuous pillowtop mattress, luscious sheets and towels and an array of pillow styles. I left coffee, tea and real    (no powdered creamer for my guests!) as well as bubble bath for the tub. As I arranged the vintage patio furniture on the balcony and looked out over our 15 acres of rolling Texas Hill Country terrain, I thought, Who wouldn’t love this? Well, as they say, pride goes before a fall. “Very little supplies in the kitchen,” was just one of the gripes the Oregon women left in their review. They gave me three out of five stars  —   a rating handed out in fewer than six percent of stays, according to a subsequent   note from Airbnb. Thanks to my faceplant out of the gate, I was told my search placement would be impacted. For months to come, my cumulative star rating remained less than nearby hosts. I was devastated, especially since I had sung the guests’ praises in my review of them (reviews are published simultaneously so I didn’t see theirs in advance). I felt the same pangs of rejection and inadequacy that go with unrequited high school friendships. And so I discovered how little I knew about hospitality in the brave new sharing economy. Airbnb offers pages of advice on how to meet its hosting standards in areas such as communication (“respond to reservation requests within 24 hours,” for instance) and pricing (“a very high price may lead travelers to assume your listing is extra luxurious  —   they shouldn’t be expecting a castle when they arrive at a cottage”). The site also lets you know what will happen if you consistently fail to measure up. “Travelers   …     tell us that getting rejected can be discouraging, so if you decline an excess number of reservation requests, your listing may be temporarily deactivated. ” (The company, which says it has removed hosts for apparent discrimination, is attempting to get even more stringent with this type of penalty in order to address recent reports of some hosts not accepting requests from minorities.) But in all those pages of practical information, here’s what Airbnb doesn’t tell you. Honest reviews of both hosts and guests are what keep the whole Airbnb system in check. Without them, people could go on     benders with no consequences. Or hosts could get away with horrors like leaving hair doilies in the shower drain. But even if you’re used to people throwing darts at you in your professional life, it’s something else to have strangers judging your home and your way of living. And doing it publicly. I’d told the Oregon women they were my first guests and to let me know how I could improve, but they never mentioned any problems and seemed happy enough. Being called out online is like asking someone if you have food in your teeth and having that person proceed to announce that yes, in fact you do, over a loud speaker. That first review started well enough  —   beautiful setting and décor kind, gracious host. Then came “although” and the first salvo: “There was no drinking water,” as if I was a stingy   guarding my oasis spring, when I regularly had our well water tested and it was just fine. (The true outrage, I wanted to tell them, is when $   hotels charge $10 for a bottle of water.) The women also complained that the jets didn’t work on my whirlpool tub, even though I had told them that’s why I hadn’t advertised the feature on my listing. The personal sting of such   is compounded by the potential financial one, since negative comments affect future bookings. I had been told by experienced Airbnb hosts to price my property low initially to get reservations, which would lead to reviews that would attract other guests. Then I could raise my rates. But they didn’t say what would happen if you got a big raspberry. Luckily, I already had more bookings lined up. Even the things you can’t control. My worst sin in that first review turned out to be location, location, location. They claimed I was at least an hour from downtown (not 30 minutes as I said truthfully in my listing). Their low rating on my accuracy was, in the Airbnb webosphere, the equivalent of yelling, “Liar, liar. ” My listing included a map that showed exactly where I was in relation to Austin. When they arrived, the Oregon women told me their GPS took them the wrong way, and they did make the trip during rush hour hence the   drive time. No matter. Their travel issues became my issue. I wanted to respond to their review with an apology for not clearing the highways out of Austin for them, but I had the sense to know snark would not win me future bookings. Instead I immediately put a disclaimer on my listing that “your driving time may vary because of traffic. ” “Duh” implied. Once you’ve gotten a    review, you start looking at every possible defect as a potential online skewer. One day, when the wind blew one of the sheets off the clothesline and onto the ground (I had some romantic notion that people would appreciate the smell of    bedding) I imagined the review I’d get if our next guests suffered a spider bite in bed. Another time I noticed the bathroom sink was leaking in my head I saw, “Could not sleep because of the drip, drip, drip. ” The emergency plumber bill was about half as much as my imminently arriving guests were paying for the whole stay. At that moment, the $650 a month from    tenants seemed like a bargain. When I bemoaned my bad review to a friend, she mentioned that she always gives wine to her guests. Aha, I thought. That’s what I was missing. So in addition to a basket of muffins, I began leaving a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc. “How much are you spending on each guest?” my husband asked when he saw me carting the   swag to the apartment. To be honest, I didn’t really care. My pride was at stake and anyway, it seems to have worked. All my reviews were glowing after the addition of alcohol. You may start your Airbnb career imagining you’ll be a magnanimous,      kind of host. But at some point you’ll have guests who’ll make you want to hide under your bed until they’ve gone out for the day. We had a perfectly nice couple who could not master the thermostat and would call or text every time the temperature was not to their liking. They’d also frequently update us on their struggles with the icemaker, the washer’s spin cycle, the ceiling fan switch. On one occasion, when I ran into the couple in the driveway, they informed me that they’d found an insect they suspected was a “kissing bug” (which they claimed was poisonous though I’d never heard of it in my 20 years in the Texas Hill Country). They were thinking of sending it off for testing, and oh, by the way, the wife had some weird bite on her arm. I think my eyes spontaneously crossed. Later, after they’d checked out and given me five stars (wine for me after that one) I got a text from them saying that the agricultural extension agency confirmed the insect was indeed a kissing bug. It was with great joy that I deleted it and thanked the patron saint of innkeepers, St. Martin of Tours  —   who according to some sources also serves that role for alcoholics, appropriately enough  —   that they hadn’t included that little tidbit in their review. Even at a Motel 6. I’m no longer hosting for Airbnb  —   not because I got my    Egyptian cotton sheets in a wad, but because we sold our house five months into my gig. We made a bit of money from our stint as guesthouse hosts  —   maybe not as much as my husband hoped with the wine and all. Plus, because of that first blot on my record, I never felt I could raise my rates. However, I gained something else in the process: a new empathy for those I’ve scrutinized in my other life as a hotel reviewer. Cleaning toilets in between guests will do that for you. These days I avoid using a hotel towel to wipe off my eye makeup because I know firsthand that mascara is nearly impossible to get out. I lose the     tone when I call the front desk over a temperamental   connection. I was just a hobbyist, but I’ll think twice about   with Airbnb in our new home though we have the space. The hospitality business is one long, grinning,    tap dance, more easily disparaged than done.",0

By www.foxnews.com 
Veterans may be more likely to commit suicide during the first year after they leave the military than after more time passes, a U.S. study suggests. 
Compared with people still on active duty in the military, veterans out of the service for up to three months were 2.5 times more likely to commit suicide, the study found. Veterans who had left the service from three to 12 months earlier had almost triple the suicide odds of current members of the military. 
“Family members and community can be proactive to reach out to veterans if they recently experienced stressful events – not just limited to the stressful events we can capture in the data such as divorce or separation from the military,” said lead study author Yu-Chu Shen, a researcher at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.

4545,"As fixes for Obamacare begin, meet the hopelessly confusing ‘all-payer model’","Print 
While Donald Trump talks of repealing and replacing Obamacare and Hillary Clinton talks of reopening the conversation about the public option , the state of Vermont has begun dealing its own personal health care crisis by invoking something called the “all-payer model.” 
The Green Mountain Care Board on Wednesday voted to approve this methodology for paying for health care, but understanding what that means requires reading the fine print of the agreement. 
By approving the all-payer model agreement, Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin seeks to align incentives across Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance so health care providers are paid for keeping patients healthy, not for providing individual services and procedures. 
The board’s approval makes Vermont the first state to pursue an all-payer model statewide. 
In a statement sent from the governor’s office, Shumlin thanked President Barack Obama and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell for negotiating the agreement with the state, and he said the model would control health care costs and reward doctors for a more preventive approach to care. 
“Vermont will now become the first state in America to ensure that your doctor can focus on keeping you healthy, rather than running tests or procedures,” Shumlin said, adding: 
By shifting the focus away from the current fee-for-service system to one that rewards primary care and prevention, we will help Vermonters lead healthier lives and more effectively manage chronic diseases, allow doctors to better treat their patients and identify health issues before they become severe, and reduce costs in a health care system that, if left unchecked, will bankrupt our state and Vermont families. 
Green Mountain Care Board Chair Al Gobeille called the event “an important next step in provider-led health care reform,” adding that the program will save Vermont $10 billion over the next decade. 
However, the board’s action did little to address concerns raised by the Joint Fiscal Office. In a report released Friday , the JFO weighed the supposed benefits of the new system against a list of critiques and uncertainties. Among the uncertainties are the administrative costs of the program, as well as where funding will come from. 
The JFO report also notes that the next governor could refuse to go forward with the program. Republican gubernatorial candidate Phil Scott has said he does not support the program. 
In a statement sent to local media, State House Minority Leader Rep. Don Turner, criticized the plan. 
“The proposal raises many important, but unanswered, questions regarding the ability to cap healthcare cost growth, the use of the ACO model … and the competency of the Shumlin Administration to successfully run another complex regulatory system given its dismal record with Vermont Health Connect,” he said. 
Darcie Johnston, director of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, said she was shocked at the speed with which the board approved the draft. “Our legislators made a huge mistake in giving the GMCB so much power — the power to enter into contracts to further destroy our health care system.” 
Amy Cooper, executive director of HealthFirst, an independent practice association representing over 250 medical professionals, told Vermont Watchdog she believes “the concept could be a good one” but nevertheless is “nervous about the State’s ability to implement it, especially with such a short timeline of reviewing the details that were only released a month ago.” 
Shumlin will sign the revised draft document at 2 p.m. Thursday in his ceremonial office in Montpelier. 
Over the past month, health care officials held public forums to explain Vermont’s 44-page draft agreement with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Still, many doctors and patients feel unsure of what the “all-payer model” will mean for them, in part because of the program’s many complexities. 
For starters, despite the administration’s talk of an “all-payer waiver,” the draft document contains a waiver only for Medicare, not Medicaid or commercial insurance — the other two “payers” in Vermont’s health care system. Instead, the document gives state health care officials permission to operate accountable care organizations, or ACOs, under a restructured payment system. 
For health care providers, the new payment system will start to replace current fee-for-service payments with a state-run global budget, the goal of which is to reward positive outcomes and overall population health. 
Once the agreement is finalized, Vermont will start using its state-approved ACO, called the Vermont Care Organization. That network of health care providers is comprised of representatives from existing ACOs, including OneCare, HealthFirst and Community Health Accountable Care. 
The smaller ACOs have not yet committed to being managed by the Vermont Care Organization. They have until 2018 to decide whether to remain as fee-for-service operators or transition to global budgeting within the Vermont Care Organization, as overseen by the Green Mountain Care Board. 
Dr. Paul Reiss, chief medical officer at HealthFirst, told Watchdog his ACO is not recommending that physicians sign on with the Vermont Care Organization until details of the offer are known. 
“There’s no proposal to change the way physicians are paid under Medicare in 2017,” Reiss said. “We’ll recommend signing on when there are actually offers on the table.” 
At recent public forums, both Gov. Peter Shumlin and Al Gobeille, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said the Vermont Care Organization would be “risk bearing.” That means the umbrella ACO network, not individual providers, will absorb losses if providers exceed their budget for the year. 
While the risk-bearing stipulation may allay providers’ worries about going over budget, page 8 of the agreement states that the ACO is responsible for “at minimum 30 percent” of shared losses. Put another way, providers in some cases will be responsible for paying up to 70 percent of the cost of exceeding the state-determined budget. 
Delivering care under a global budget worries some doctors, who may not be able to survive under a budget cap and offer effective care at the same time. 
When an audience member at the Norwich public forum asked what impact failing practices might have on the system, Shumlin replied, “You cannot be refused care. … It’s the ACO’s problem to deal with the bankruptcy. … It would not affect care in any way. It might not be the same provider, because they would be out of business theoretically, but someone would have an interest in caring for you.” 
Gobeille agreed that private practices might face bankruptcy “because they couldn’t make it work in the independent practice world.” He added that such practices could be absorbed into the hospital system. 
Since the draft agreement was announced , some physicians have criticized the plan on the grounds that hospitals may continue getting reimbursed for services at a higher rate, because of their bargaining advantage with insurance companies and the Green Mountain Care Board. 
While it’s generally expected that the all-payer model will fix the payment reimbursement differential between Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurers, Reiss said he’s skeptical. 
“There are no [plans] currently diagrammed on any drawing board to make that happen,” Reiss told Watchdog. 
In fact, the draft agreement doesn’t fix the reimbursement differential. Instead, it says by 2020 the state must deliver “a report on options to narrow the Payer Differential between payers.” 
The long delay could disappoint independent physicians, who have been told they don’t have to join the state-run ACO if they don’t want. That freedom of choice may be illusory at best, since financial pressure cited in the agreement could coerce doctors to join the network or face financial consequences. 
Specifically, the draft agreement says the state will “encourage” providers and beneficiaries to participate. One “encouragement” includes a potential Medicare payment reduction for practices that remain outside of the ACO. 
However, in an Oct.19 email exchange obtained by Vermont Watchdog, state Sen. Tim Ashe, told Burlington psychiatrist Robert Emmons that he contacted Ena Backus, health policy chief at the Green Mountain Care Board, and the financial penalty is now removed from the updated agreement. 
Funding to help Vermont abandon a fee-for-service model includes a one-time payment of $9.5 million dollars from Medicare. The state also has a verbal agreement with Medicaid for $200 million — likely $110 million in federal money and $90 million in state funds. 
It’s unclear where this money, and the administrative expense of Vermont Care Organization, will come from. 
On Tuesday, Johnston unsuccessfully called for the board to delay its vote until outstanding questions are answered. 
“We believe that doctors and patients have significant concerns, and that the delivery of health care to Vermonters could be significantly impacted. We are concerned about the rationing of care,” the Vermonters for Healthcare Freedom director said in a statement. “…There are too many questions that deserve answers before the Green Mountain Care Board should agree to support such a risky venture.” 
Other concerns of Johnston’s include a lack of transparency and the model’s impact on Vermont’s doctor shortage. 
A timeline of key events reveals the long road ahead for the all-payer health care model.",0
4546,All Eyes on China as U.S. Signals New Tack on North Korea - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson signaled on Friday that the Trump administration was prepared to scrap nearly a decade of United States policy toward North Korea in favor of a more aggressive effort to eliminate the country’s nuclear weapons program. Whether that means   action, which he warned was “on the table,” will depend a great deal on how China responds. North Korea relies on Chinese trade and aid to keep its economy afloat, and China has long been unwilling to withdraw that support. Up to 40 percent of the North’s foreign currency  —   essential for buying goods abroad  —   comes from a network of about 600 Chinese companies, according to a recent study by Sayari Analytics, a Washington financial intelligence firm. Mr. Tillerson went to China on Saturday, a day after saying in Seoul, South Korea, that the United States would not negotiate with North Korea on freezing its nuclear and missile programs. His interactions with his hosts in Beijing, and whether he takes a hard line with China over its support for North Korea, will be closely watched  —   as will be China’s response. A sign of the administration’s stance came on Friday as President Trump criticized both North Korea and the Chinese government. “North Korea is behaving very badly,” he said on Twitter. “They have been ‘playing’ the United States for years. China has done little to help!” The Chinese leadership is likely to bristle at such criticism, but it may be reviewing its options, given the collision course that North Korea and the United States seem to be on. Last month, Beijing showed a new willingness to punish its longtime ally when it suspended imports of North Korean coal, saying it had reached the annual limit allowed under United Nations sanctions. Customs figures later showed that China had in fact imported only about 30 percent of the quota for 2017. Yang Xiyu, a veteran Chinese diplomat involved with North Korea, said Mr. Tillerson may be able to persuade Chinese leaders to do more when he meets with them in Beijing this weekend, particularly against Chinese companies that do business with the North. Mr. Yang cited as a potential model the case that United States officials built last year against a Chinese executive accused of selling North Korea a chemical that can be used in   centrifuges. While Beijing was not happy about the case, it eventually accepted it. “It wasn’t easy, but it was the right way to push the issue to a solution,” he said. When the United States filed criminal charges against the businesswoman, Ma Xiaohong, the owner of the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company, other Chinese companies conducting similar transactions were apparently left untouched. But Mr. Yang, who was a top negotiator for China during   talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2009, suggested that those companies may now be vulnerable. If the United States continues to present evidence of illegal activities that contravene China’s responsibilities under United Nations sanctions, “there is a great deal of room for cooperation,” he said. He noted that China had published five executive orders, totaling more than 900 pages, listing items banned from export to North Korea. “Such activities violate China’s adherence to those orders,” he said. Mr. Yang added: “The United States should say, ‘Let’s extend our cooperation to implementation of the United Nations resolutions on sanctions.’ They should say, ‘Starting with the Hongxiang case, let’s move forward. ’” In Beijing, Mr. Tillerson met with China’s top foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and the foreign minister, Wang Yi, on Saturday. He will see President Xi Jinping on Sunday. “We have committed ourselves to do everything we can to prevent a conflict from breaking out,” Mr Tillerson said at a press conference after meeting Mr. Wang. The secretary said China and the United States “will work together” to see if they could make North Korea take “a course correction and move away from nuclear weapons. ” Mr. Tillerson declined to specify the “number of steps” that would be taken to achieve that goal. Over the past   the Chinese government has been unwilling to cripple the North Korean economy, fearing a refugee crisis or a destabilizing conflict on its border. North Korea imports virtually all of its oil from China, and cutting off the spigot could severely undermine the North Korean economy. Doing so, however, would almost certainly cause chaos in North Korea, something China fears. Round after round of economic sanctions have failed to persuade North Korea’s leaders to abandon their nuclear ambitions. China has long justified its support for North Korea on humanitarian grounds, and rejected accusations that it has been unwilling to get tough on Pyongyang. But with North Korea closing in on its goal of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States, and the Trump administration deploying a missile defense system to South Korea that China considers a threat to its security, the Chinese leadership’s calculus may be shifting. “It is not a foregone conclusion that China’s leaders will shelter North Korea,” Anthony Ruggiero, a former United States Treasury official involved in sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang, told a congressional panel last month. Mr. Ruggiero said the United States would be likeliest to achieve Chinese cooperation from a position of strength. In 2013, he noted, when the Treasury blacklisted North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank for contributing to the proliferation of nuclear materials, the Bank of China, one of China’s major commercial banks, immediately closed its account with the North Korean outfit. Now, no major Chinese banks deal with North Korea for fear of being penalized by the United States, though smaller ones do, along with front companies operating along the North Korean border with few links to the United States financial system, according to American sanctions experts. “This is a good example of China acting to cut off North Korea’s activities inside China when those actions threaten China’s economic interests,” Mr. Ruggierio said of the Bank of China’s severance of its North Korea connections. A more recent episode that could serve as a model came last week, when the United States Department of Commerce fined ZTE, one of China’s biggest technology companies, $1. 19 billion for breaking sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea. “This is what the U. S. should be doing, but finding it out ain’t easy,” said Stephan Haggard, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which is based in Washington. “I think that Commerce pretty much had a gun to ZTE’s head. ” Officials in the Trump administration have discussed putting pressure on Chinese banks through “secondary sanctions,” which would make it hard for any bank that did business with the North to also deal in American dollars. That technique worked against Iran, helping to force it to the negotiating table over its own nuclear program. But such measures are likely to have much less impact in North Korea, which is already isolated, than they did in Iran, a major trading nation, sanctions experts said. “North Korea has one of the smallest international trade profiles on earth,” said Joseph M. DeThomas, a former American ambassador who served as a State Department adviser on Iran and North Korea sanctions. “North Korea often has to   the entire financial system to move money. They do things the   way: sending guys on airplanes with suitcases full of money. ” In an opinion article this week in The New York Times, a former United States deputy secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said the Obama administration had quietly pressed countries to eject North Korean workers whose remittances help fund the country’s military. He did not say how successful that effort had been. Tens of thousands of such workers are employed in China’s northeastern cities like Dandong and Hunchun, along the North Korean border. But Marcus Noland, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said he believed the organized export of labor earned the North Korean government less than has often been reported  —   hundreds of millions of dollars per year, probably less than half a billion, he said. “The next time you hear the claim of $2 billion annual earnings from the organized export of labor, remember not to believe everything you hear,” he said. Far more has been contributed in foreign currency by Chinese companies doing trade across the border, said Jessica Knight, director of analysis at Sayari Analytics. “Customs data indicates more than $8 billion in   trade between China and North Korea since 2013, much of it in commodities like coal and steel,” she said. Whether any sanctions at all will deter the North from its nuclear pursuits is far from clear. The former United States defense secretary William J. Perry, who dealt with the North Korean problem during the Clinton administration, said on Friday in Beijing that he doubted they would. “We have sanctioned them a hundred times, and it didn’t stop developing nuclear weapons,” he said. “They seem to be prepared to suffer economic deprivation for the people so they can achieve the preservation of the regime, which they think that nuclear weapons is going to do for them. ”",0
4547,US Military Hackers Claim Penetration of Russia,"US Military Hackers Claim Penetration of Russia 11/07/2016 
SPUTNIK NEWS 
US military hackers have penetrated Russia’s electric grid, telecommunications networks and Kremlin’s command systems, making them vulnerable to attack by secret American cyber weapons, according to a series of reports by a major US television network. 
NBC News disclosed the penetration in a series of reports, explaining that US efforts parallel claims, also by US officials, that Russia, China and other nations have placed hidden malware on parts of US critical infrastructure. 
The penetration by all sides appears to be in preparation for an all-out war in cyberspace, according to NBC News, which said it was briefed by a US intelligence official and given an opportunity to review highly classified documents. 
At the same time, the network downplayed the prospect of a cyber war, making it appear as if the leak was intended as a warning to US adversaries. 
NBC News then attempted to link its explosive report to Tuesday’s US presidential election, citing concerns of mischief by Russian hackers that would fall far short of the Armageddon-like scenario that the report implied. 
Instead, the network explained US election-related concerns as “cyber mischief,” which could involve releasing fake documents or creating bogus social media accounts to spread misinformation. 
The Obama administration has created a public, but unconfirmed narrative, that hackers controlled by the Russian government have stolen emails from the Democratic Party headquarters, a private computer used by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton while serving as secretary of State and computers used by Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta. 
According to the narrative, Russia stole the emails and gave the messages to WikiLeaks, which has flooded the internet with the material on a daily basis leading up to Tuesday’s election. 
Russia has denied any responsibility for the Clinton-related hacks and links between WikiLeaks and Russian intelligence have never been substantiated. 
Moreover, recent media reports in the United States indicate that Clinton’s private server she used for official business during her tenure as secretary of state had been penetrated by at least five foreign intelligence services. 
The emails have proved especially embarrassing for the Clinton campaign by disclosing decisions in the Clinton State Department that favored large donors to the Clinton Foundation in what appear to be “pay-for-play” schemes of selling access and influence. 
Moreover, the activity appears to coincide with lucrative speaking engagements for former President Bill Clinton.",0
4548,"Pyrotechnic Party of Legend, Killed Off by Social Media - The New York Times","On Sept. 29, 1973, Peter Schjeldahl and Brooke Alderson, who had met the previous spring at an opening at the Whitney Museum, moved into an apartment on the top floor of a   at 53 St. Marks Place. It was the day W. H. Auden died, a fact that seemed to portend the lush bohemian life that followed. Mr. Schjeldahl, a poet and art critic, would go on to write for The Village Voice and for The New Yorker, where he has remained for two decades Ms. Alderson was an actress and comic. They had a daughter, Ada Calhoun, who grew up to be a writer herself. She dedicated her recent book, “St. Marks Is Dead,” a history of the street where she grew up, to them: “To my parents, who looked at the apocalyptic 1970s East Village and thought, What a great place to raise a kid. ” That chaos found counterbalance in a rural idyll. In the 1980s, Mr. Schjeldahl and his wife purchased many acres of mountainous land in the town of Bovina, a little more than three hours north of Midtown Manhattan. For more than a   the property served as the site of a Fourth of July celebration that has maintained a singular place in New York’s social history, drawing friends, and friends of friends, from the city  —   artists, writers, musicians, academics, gallery owners, movie stars  —   and a considerable segment of the surrounding population of Delaware County. At its most constrained, the event attracted as many as 300 people, who gathered not only for the kind of ecumenical fellowship rarely found in the modern world outside an A. A. meeting, but, above all, to experience Mr. Schjeldahl’s mythic, untamed fireworks. “We were strictly illegal, until the end,” Mr. Schjeldahl told me recently. “The cops and firemen brought their families. This is libertarian country. ” Last year, the pyrotechnics hewed more closely to legitimacy  —   a technical supervisor was even on the premises  —   but that party turned out to be the last, after approximately 2, 000 people showed up, word of it having reached a vast universe of Brooklyn millennials via social media, a means of communication Mr. Schjeldahl and his wife have never employed. “It was 300 hipsters from Bushwick coming down the driveway, and I nearly died,” Ms. Alderson said. Last year, guests, most of them not known to their hosts, could be overheard arguing about whether the property was a state park or a municipal park. One generation’s utopia had encroached upon another’s. Ominous signs began to present themselves a few years ago. Ms. Calhoun recalls entering a bedroom at the Bovina house to find a young woman she had never seen before changing into a bathing suit. On another occasion, her husband and young son were at a florist in Williamsburg where they learned that the young saleswoman behind the counter had become a regular at the party, even though she had no idea who actually held it. Even back in its more tightly circumscribed days, the party was so enormous that its hosts were hardly able to speak to everyone. One year, Mr. Schjeldahl received a warm note of thanks from Louis Menand, the literary critic and Harvard professor, who described the party as a spectacular aesthetic experience. The men had never met, not at The New Yorker, where they are colleagues, nor at the Fourth of July event. Over the years, the artists Brice and Helen Marden came, as did Steve Martin, the poet Susan Wheeler and Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys, who eventually brought Ben Stiller. The year Mr. Stiller came, he was assigned to the “front line,” an assemblage of guests tasked with lighting fireworks by hand. Carmine Covelli, the drummer for a band called the Julie Ruin, was dispatched to watch over him. Mr. Stiller looked terrified, Mr. Covelli said he noted that the actor never returned. Mesmerized by Mr. Schjeldahl’s obsession  —   one year, he said, he strapped explosives to trees because he’d seen fireworks shot horizontally from the Eiffel Tower, and grew jealous of French ingenuity  —   Mr. Covelli and Mr. Horovitz began filming a documentary about the annual event. The food was the other hallmark of the party. Everyone brought something. There were maybe a hundred pies once a hunter brought bear meat. Another distinctive element was an exercise in making uptight urban parents nervous. During the day, a huge basket of bottle rockets was made available to the children who were old enough to shoot away. “I know what I want when I grow up,” one little boy announced to his parents as they were leaving the party, Mr. Schjeldahl recounted. “A lighter. ” With the money they saved by calling off the party this year, Mr. Schjeldahl and Ms. Alderson went to Rome in the spring. They had a good time. This weekend, they will have two people posted on their front porch telling anyone who might not have heard that the era has ended. When Ms. Alderson realized she would need something to fill the time that months of party planning had consumed, she decided to build a miniature golf course with a Rip Van Winkle theme, a work still in progress. This weekend the couple will eat out, and they will mourn what was lost  —   a sense of inclusion and ultimately a tent that just got too big.    ",0
4549,Alexander Rossi Wins the 100th Indianapolis 500 - The New York Times,"INDIANAPOLIS  —   Alexander Rossi, a    American rookie, stretched his fuel mileage to the absolute limit and won the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, in the 100th edition of the storied race. “I’m out of fuel, guys,” Rossi told his crew over the radio moments after taking the checkered flag at the chaotic finish. His   IndyCar had to be topped up with fuel for the postrace celebration. The race’s   Carlos Munoz, 24, was leading with three laps to go and said he thought his car had enough fuel to win. But his crew ordered him to the pits, telling him he would otherwise come up half a lap short. “One day, I will win this race,” said a dejected Munoz, who rebounded to finish 4. 49 seconds behind Rossi. Just behind him was Josef Newgarden, 26, who also had to make a late stop after running among the leaders for the whole race. “We had the car to win today,” he said. “But at the end, it didn’t fall our way. ” Tony Kanaan came in fourth, followed by Charlie Kimball. “I have no idea how we pulled that off,” an emotional Rossi said as he sipped from a quart bottle of 2 percent milk, the traditional drink of Indy winners. “At one point, we were 33rd. But we just rolled the dice and went for it. ” Rossi, who had started 11th in the   field, did indeed fall to last in the early going. But his team gambled on an    pit strategy. He saved fuel the whole race. He patiently worked his way back through the field and into the top 10. In outlasting speedier competitors, he completely crossed up the conventional wisdom that says that to win Indy, a driver needs to stay among the leaders and out of trouble all day. Rossi, who turned to IndyCar racing this season after being snubbed for a seat at the new United   Haas Formula One team, had landed an   ride in the series with the car owner Bryan Herta and Andretti Autosport. “Bryan pulled off a tremendous strategy once again,” Rossi said. Herta had won the Indy 500 in 2011, with Dan Wheldon, using a similar strategy. After what turned out to be his final pit stop, Rossi managed to squeeze 36 laps out of his tank, while the best anyone else could do in the   race was 32. Rossi, who had never finished better than 10th in five previous IndyCar series starts this season, said he had succeeded by being conservative at times, tactical in traffic and resisting the urge to dice with those challenging him for position. After the veteran Kanaan, the 2013 Indy winner, had to surrender the lead and head to the pit for fuel with seven laps left, the final circuits around the      Indianapolis Motor Speedway racetrack seemed to come down to a shootout between two other young drivers, Munoz and Newgarden. They traded the lead until there were three laps to go, when they joined the mad scramble into the pits among other   drivers. That was when the lead was taken over for good by the dark horse Rossi. In 2005, he had been identified as an    prospect after beating 2, 000 other drivers in a talent contest sponsored by an   maker. But he found little opportunity to work as a driver in the United States, so he went to Europe. While Rossi found his biggest success Sunday by staying out of the pits, that was where the perennial favorites found failure. The   winner Helio Castroneves, who initially could not get his car to fire on the grid, was leading with less than 100 miles to go, but his car also needed a late splash of fuel while running third. He had also escaped damage in one pit road entanglement, but he needed to pit again for a new left rear fender late in the race after being hit from behind by J. R. Hildebrand. Will Power, another leader, was penalized by being sent to the rear of the field after he collided on pit road with Kanaan. Later, Simon Pagenaud was handed the same penalty when he bumped into Mikhail Aleshin while leaving his pit. The defending Indy 500 champion, Juan Pablo Montoya, a Penske teammate of Castroneves, Power and Pagenaud, escaped injury when he crashed out just after the   mark. The chances of the early leaders James Hinchcliffe the 2014 Indy winner, Ryan   and Townsend Bell were dinged by pit road incidents of their own.   and Bell tangled with Castroneves, who had the right of way and escaped they, however, ended up sideways and needed repairs. Hinchcliffe lost time for a fuel hose malfunction. Over all, the raucous,   event seemed like a solid return to form for the famed race and its glorious past. Over the last 20 years, the race and the sport have experienced declining attendance and fan interest. But the huge turnout this year seemed to suggest that the sport’s glory days might be back. The Indianapolis 500, first run in 1911 but suspended during the two World Wars, enjoyed nearly perfect blue skies for its celebration, with a sellout crowd estimated at more than 400, 000. Organizers have said the race attracts the largest   attendance of any sports event in the world.",0

4553,Liked ‘Serial’? Here’s Why the True-Crime Podcast ‘S-Town’ Is Better - The New York Times,"In 2014, the   podcast “Serial” began like this: A tipster asked a radio journalist to investigate a murder. “” the new narrative podcast from the creators of “Serial,” kicks off in a similar fashion. This time, the tipster is John B. McLemore, an eccentric antique clock restorer from Woodstock, Ala. The journalist is Brian Reed, a longtime producer for “This American Life. ” When Mr. McLemore tells Mr. Reed that a Woodstock rich boy got away with murder and has been bragging about it ever since, Mr. Reed agrees to head down from New York to check it out. But it soon becomes clear that the homicide story is a bit of a red herring. It’s the hook to get Mr. Reed on the line. Mr. Reed has used a similar tactic to draw his podcast audience into the story, with a teaser for the series that emphasizes the murder. Some “Serial” fans may be disappointed to learn that the crew’s latest offering is not a straightforward whodunit. They shouldn’t be. “ ” turns out to be much more interesting than that. “ ” is not another tale of a journalist trying to solve a murder with just a microphone and a little elbow grease, and thank God. Instead, “ ” transcends the podcast procedural with a destabilizing narrative structure in which one   mystery leads to another, all surrounding Mr. McLemore and his acquaintances. There is that murder, but also a treasure hunt, a land grab and a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Reed’s investigation turns psychological and emotional  —   into how people come to be branded as bad, and the hidden relationships among men in the rural South. “ ”  —   which is executive produced by Mr. Reed and the “Serial” producer Julie Snyder, with editorial input from the “Serial” host, Sarah Koenig, and the host of “This American Life,” Ira Glass  —   is not “Serial” Season 3. It’s kind of a podcast spinoff, and it unfolds more like a novel than a   procedural. Mr. McLemore is its beguiling principal character. He’s got a backyard labyrinth, gold buried in an undisclosed location and a literary flair that turns   life into big drama. He’s the peppiest pessimist south of the   line. The “S” in “ ” is shorthand for a   word  —   Mr. McLemore’s preferred nickname for his hometown. He has a talent for profane rants about civilization’s downfall that he delivers in an Alabama drawl. In one diatribe, he rails against a nation of people who are “whiny, fat, flabby, out of shape,  ’ damn   peekin’ out the windows and snoopin’ around, listening on the cellphones and spyin’ in the peephole and peepin’ in the crack of the goddamn door, listenin’ in the [expletive] Sheetrock. ” Mr. McLemore takes a breath. “I gotta have me some tea. ” The chief innovation of “Serial” in its first season, which set out to reinvestigate the 1999 murder of a Baltimore high school student, was in the exposure of the inner workings of a journalistic criminal investigation as it happened. (The podcast’s underwhelming second season, which dug into the already   case of the American G. I. Bowe Bergdahl’s desertion, benefited less from that    aspect.) In “” Mr. Reed illuminates a different kind of reportorial experience. Almost every journalist has met people like Mr. McLemore, sources who email you under pseudonyms with tips a little too good to be true. Often they seem to mostly want someone to talk to, and to have their experiences validated by a journalist, whose job, after all, is to decide what’s important and true. Most reporters would stop taking those calls when the story ideas don’t bear fruit, but not Mr. Reed. He finds Mr. McLemore’s life important in and of itself, and a whole world opens up to him. A disappointment of the first season of “Serial” was that so many of its central players refused to talk  —   an understandable response to a journalist’s digging up of a    tragedy already decided upon by the courts. That often made for uncomfortable listening, as these actual people were posited as possible murder suspects on the basis of   claims. Accusations, criminal and otherwise, fly in “” too, but Mr. Reed manages to speak with just about all of the pivotal characters in the story, deftly interviewing them in a way that generates sympathy for their perspectives and illuminates their charms. Meeting these people provides delightful little surprises throughout the narrative: Among them is Uncle Jimmy, who communicates exclusively through shouted affirmations, and a man who divides his life into two eras: before and after the 2005 release of “Brokeback Mountain. ” Also, “ ” mercifully departs from “Serial” by releasing all of its seven episodes at once. The         style of “Serial” and stylistic offshoots like “Missing Richard Simmons” holds an addictive appeal, but it’s also a risky gambit that rarely pays off. The inevitable   frenzy to help crowdsource the mystery quickly turns the whole exercise into a dehumanizing game. It doesn’t work. Such podcasts often raise high expectations  —   let’s solve a murder, or at least flush out a reclusive celebrity  —   only to end in shrugs. Assembling the whole story before its release frees Mr. Reed to pace out a real narrative, including an emotional twist at the end of the second episode that turns the whole thing upside down. You should probably start listening now before somebody spoils the twist. But then, take your time with the story  —   “ ” is so much more than its central mystery.",0
4554,Megyn Kelly Spox: Fox News Exit ‘Still Being Negotiated’ - Breitbart,"Megyn Kelly’s jump from Fox News to NBC seems like it has hit a rough patch. [Kelly announced in early January she was leaving Fox News after 12 years and going to NBC to headline her own weekday news program and a Sunday night, 60   show, and to appear on panels during big events.  However, according to a story in The Wall Street Journal, NBC still has not announced a definitive start date for Kelly, and neither of her shows seems to be coming together with any urgency. One proposal is for Kelly to anchor a 10 a. m. show in front of a live audience, but no producer has been named for the show and NBC won’t even confirm the plan. The Sunday evening show, which would need to be ready by early summer because Sunday Night Football will replace it in the fall, is even less far along, the Journal reported. It is not even clear she has departed Fox News. She has not appeared on the network since Jan. 5, when she signed off from The Kelly File. Fox News announced on Mar. 9 it had released Kelly from her contract nearly four months before it was to run out, so she could begin her work at NBC. Yet Kelly’s spokesperson, Leslee Dart, told the Journal, “The terms of the termination are still being negotiated. ” Kelly seemed ready to leave late last year. She batted down talk that she had been the subject of a bidding war among NBC, CBS, and ABC. She turned down a reported $20 million offer to stay at Fox News and accepted an offer similar to her Fox News salary of about $15 million to go to NBC because, she said, she wanted to have dinner with her children at night and put them to bed. NBC needs to make progress on this because it must present its list of new shows to advertisers in May, and she would be a major asset for the network in ad rate negotiations, the Journal reported, It is highly unlikely Kelly would return to the Fox News airwaves. Her questioning of Donald Trump during the campaign  —   on his treatment of women, whether he would support the Republican nominee and other issues  —   raised hackles among the network’s viewers and led to an eventual reconciliation with the president. In her memoir Settle for More, released last year, Kelly accused Fox News chief Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her  —   a charge, also leveled by other women at the network, which led to Ailes’ departure. This also led to a spat with Bill O’Reilly, another Fox News star, who said in November, “If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that person or company allegiance. ” O’Reilly later backtracked and called Kelly a “very smart, talented woman,” and Kelly put it down to competitive juices. “We’re both Irish. We’re both Catholic. And we’re both very competitive,” she told Hollywood Reporter last November. “So the dynamic has changed. But I really will always be grateful to Bill. ” Then there are the     coworkers who told Breitbart News exclusively in December they were ready for the drama to end. “Everybody in the building is sick of it,” the source said. “We absolutely can’t stand it anymore. ”",0

4556,"Regaining Chicken Salad’s Dignity, Any Time of Day - The New York Times","The first time I was served a Southern luncheon plate, my mind froze, unable to make sense of what was in front of me. Why was a mound of chicken salad next to a mound of red  ? What was their relationship to the dollop of mayonnaise and the celery sticks? How did the cheese straws fit in? I was in the presence of a new and wonderful meal: luncheon. Today, most Americans eat lunch, if anything, at midday, and that is as likely to be a green juice or a protein bar as a meal. Still, in certain circles at certain times  —   most notably, a gathering of women in the American South  —   nothing but a   luncheon will do. And the inevitable centerpiece of a luncheon is, was and forever shall be chicken salad. “What else could you possibly serve to ladies?” said Nathalie Dupree, the author of “Mastering the Art of Southern Cooking,” only partly joking. Chicken salad  —   now most often a   deli special, best hidden between slices of bread  —   has a proud history when served elegantly: in an iced,   coupe molded into a ring or scooped into a thin, crisp toast cup, as it has been since 1965 at the Swan Coach House in Atlanta. It was often the centerpiece of a   meal when Ms. Dupree was a little girl, she said, reserved for Sundays, socials and summer parties. “Summer was when the hens stopped laying and had to be killed off,” she said. There is everyday Southern lunch chicken salad, mixed very smooth with pickle relish, to eat on crackers or in a sandwich. And there is luncheon chicken salad, chunky and complicated with things like slivered almonds or minced pineapple or mango chutney or scallions. (Recipes for Bridesmaid’s Chicken Salad, popular in Junior League cookbooks, have all of the above.) This recipe is the best of both. Whether eaten with a fork or in a sandwich, when made with care and good ingredients, chicken salad has a delicious dignity. The base for good chicken salad is, of course, good chicken. Many recipes suggest starting with a rotisserie chicken. I suggest that a rotisserie chicken is a recipe for disaster. Unless perfectly cooked and freshly shredded, roast chicken is almost always too dry and stringy for salad. And in any case, dark meat has no place in the dish. A whole breast left over from a really nicely roasted chicken is fine. What lifts chicken salad up is the pure, clean texture of breast meat  —   one of the very few really good uses for this almost entirely flavorless cut. Poaching it is the only way to get the right texture. But poaching is not as easy as it should be. On today’s  . T. U. stoves, it is often impossible to keep a pot of water at a low simmer  —   and if the water boils, the meat contracts and stiffens and is ruined. To counter this, some years ago I adopted a Chinese method for poaching that is foolproof, low maintenance and ideal for summer cooking. All it requires is a heavy pot  —   enameled or plain   is ideal  —   and a bit of nerve. This is because you do not cook the chicken. Instead, you slip it into boiling water, turn off the heat and then walk away for at least two hours. (This part is best done in the relative cool of the morning kitchen.) Over time, the gentle but steady residual heat cooks the chicken through, giving it a texture the California chef and interpreter of Chinese cuisine Barbara Tropp called “plush”  —   perfect for chicken salad. (It turns out that the   doyenne Edna Lewis poached her chicken in much the same way.) Other cooks build plushiness in other ways. Ms. Dupree, and many other Southern cooks, hold that the meat should be   from the bone, and never touched by a knife. Kenny Shopsin of Shopsin’s on the Lower East Side, a purist who puts nothing but chicken and mayonnaise in chicken salad, says that the   chunks should be   “until they are frayed on the edges and semisoft in the center,” the better to absorb more mayonnaise. Neat and firm cubes are not preferred the chicken should have a natural feel. Mayonnaise and summer were long considered incompatible because traditional homemade mayonnaise contains raw egg yolk, a hospitable environment for bacteria like salmonella and E. coli. But commercial mayonnaise, because it lacks raw egg and is spiked with acidic ingredients like vinegar and citric acid, actually slows the growth of bacteria. (This was widely reported after a 2008 study and confirmed by the F. D. A. in 2014.) In addition to acid, if there are preservatives in the mayonnaise, so much the better for the buffet. But preservatives and acids are not better for the taste of your chicken salad. The dish is infinitely improved with homemade mayonnaise, easy to make with a food processor and even easier to make with a hand blender. For safety, always serve chicken salad with homemade mayonnaise well chilled it (and any other   salad) tastes better that way anyway. Duke’s mayonnaise, which is free of sweeteners and tangier than most factory versions, is my favorite, but it is available only in stores in the Southern states. (It can also be ordered online.) I like to add crème fraîche or sour cream for chicken salad, which fluffs the texture of the dressing mayonnaise alone can be greasy. There is almost no ingredient that has not been stirred into chicken salad by some adventurous cook. Many people like a sweet element, like fresh grapes or dried fruit some lean toward sour, with chopped pickles and mustard. All these variations can be spun on the basic combination of poached chicken and creamy dressing. To me, celery, black pepper and onion (or scallion) are nonnegotiable. Nuts, toasted and coarsely chopped, provide crunch and flavor. Herbs are not traditional, but tarragon, a natural partner for chicken, makes it fresh and elegant. (If you are suspicious of fresh tarragon, trust the authors of the Silver Palate cookbooks and Ina Garten, who taught me to put it in chicken salad.) This chicken salad makes a very fine sandwich for lunch. But scooped into a lettuce leaf on a chilled plate on a hot summer day, with sliced tomatoes and radishes on the side, it makes a perfect luncheon. Even if it happens to be served at dinnertime. Recipe: Best Chicken Salad And to Drink . .. This chicken salad calls for a white wine with enough acidity to stand up to the creamy dressing, and with tart flavors that will integrate with the dish. A good sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley, like a Sancerre or   would be an excellent match. You could also try a top albariño from Galicia in Spain. Chardonnay would pair well, too, and this is one of the few dishes with which you need not fear oakiness. A good restrained chardonnay from Oregon or California, or a   would be delicious. A dry Vouvray, with flavors of apples and flowers, would be interesting, while a dry Austrian riesling could go very well. Another thought: If you can find a good pinot blanc, you will not be unhappy. ERIC ASIMOV",0
4557,"Afropunk: Feeling Black Activism’s Joy, and Its Pain - The New York Times","As Black History Month commemorations start to wind down, one festival is just gearing up. Afropunk the Takeover  —   Harlem, running from Tuesday through Feb. 25, will celebrate black culture with music, art, film screenings, discussions and comedy.   by Harlem Stage and the Apollo Theater, this series is the latest offering from Afropunk, which hosts a music festival in Brooklyn. While music is an integral part of this Harlem festival, a couple of its more   events focus on activism  —   from art in response to current events to the expression of black joy  —   which is especially resonant in this moment of racial division and continued protests against the Trump administration. “Bearing Witness as Protest,” at the Studio Museum in Harlem on Thursday, will examine political dissent in art. The evening begins with a guided tour of two exhibitions: “The Window and the Breaking of the Window,” with art from the Black Lives Matter era, and “Circa 1970,” whose focus is on the sociopolitical and cultural issues of the ’70s. The shows further affirm that, in the age of the   news cycle and endless social media feeds, there’s no escape from news of horrific acts of hate, social injustices and inequalities. Works by Rudy Shepherd depict the nine parishioners killed in a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015, and others evoke the “hands up, don’t shoot” rallying cry for protesters in the aftermath of a fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo. “It’s a difficult show, and I think some people might be moved by some of the images,” Amanda Hunt, associate curator at the museum, said last week. “They might be saddened and I wanted to give space for all of that. ” Deborah Grant’s “56 Blows,” from her “Blackboard” series, initially looks simplistic  —   the outline of a camcorder drawn in white chalk on a black background underneath is the title rendered in block letters. The title is a haunting nod to the 56 blows inflicted on Rodney King by the Los Angeles police in 1991 the camcorder a reminder of the documentation of the violence. In “A Beautiful Ghetto,” Devin Allen’s    photographs chronicle the response of black residents in Baltimore to such violence  —   like Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Tying it all together are Kerry James Marshall’s prints echoing slogans that blacks have used to organize, resist and uplift (“by any means necessary,” “black is beautiful”)  —   reminders that the black experience is as much about having pride as exposing social inequities. The tour, starting at 6 p. m. will be followed by a discussion focusing on what it means to bear witness  —   to share traumatic experiences  —   and how the act itself might be a form of protest. The artist Oasa DuVerney and Jess Krug of Harlem CopWatch, a coalition documenting the police’s interactions with the public, will participate. While the Studio Museum will tackle activism through a creative lens, a discussion on Tuesday at the National Black Theater will ask panelists to look inward to ponder the emotional expressions of resistance. The aim of “Black Joy as an Expression of Resistance and Liberation” is to shine a light on the importance of cultivating and seeking out diverse narratives of black lives and opposing stereotypical depictions that pop up across the media. The panelists  —   including the actress Zoë Kravitz, Larry   of ARTNOIR and the Afropunk founder, Matthew Morgan  —   will also discuss the importance of caring for oneself as well as those in your circle of friends and family. “Black joy is really that pursuit of healing all of those wounds,” Sade Lythcott, chief executive of the National Black Theater and a panelist, said in a telephone interview. “When the pendulum swings so far to one side where there is this epidemic of trauma being displayed as entertainment,” she said of videos depicting interactions between the police and black people, “artists are always going to rise up” as a means of both documentation and catharsis. André D. Singleton, a   of the Very Black Project, which celebrates black culture through apparel among other things, and moderator of the “Black Joy” event, said in a phone interview that delving into “the places we don’t want to go, the stewing, actually allowing ourselves to feel,” is imperative to moving forward. “I grew up in the church, and I was taught that happiness is fleeting and joy is something the world can’t take away,” he said, reflecting on the Maze and Frankie Beverly song “Joy and Pain,” which perhaps describes the balance between the two. Here are a few events to check out:  FEB. 24 AT 6:30 P. M. A screening of “The Talk  —   Race in America” at the Cinema at the Maysles Documentary Center. FEB. 24 AT 7:30 P. M. “The Hair Tales,” a discussion about black hair culture, at Harlem Stage. FEB. 25 AT 7:30 P. M.

[From WikiLeaks’ press release:  As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. CIA meeting notes from 2014 show that the agency’s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB) was looking at “vehicle systems (e. g VSEP)” as a “potential mission area. ” This appears to have been part of a wider effort on the part of the CIA to take control of the “internet things”  —   a term used in the technology community to refer to the growing connectivity of physical devices through the internet. The meeting notes specifically notes “the internet of things” as another potential EDB mission area.

With his formal bearing, shiny helmet of white hair and carefully chosen, slowly delivered words, he is a throwback in his demeanor. With his deep social conservatism, public religiosity and aversion to negative campaigning, he is a throwback in his political style. He is so abstemious that he once declared that to avoid temptation, he would never appear anywhere alcohol was served unless his wife was with him. This has earned Mr. Pence, 57, both the admiration of Republican voters who identify with his homespun manner and the frustration of outsiders who see him as a dangerous anachronism. Leslie Lenkowsky, a former professor at Indiana University who has known Mr. Pence for 20 years, said that in an age of   governors who deliberately avoid touchy social issues, “Mike sees himself as a champion of a very culturally conservative set of values that represent   Middle America. ” “He sees his role,” Mr. Lenkowsky said, “as protecting them. ” In interviews, Mr. Pence describes himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order. ” Those animating forces were at the center of the most consequential  —   and controversial  —   decision Mr. Pence made as governor: signing a 2015 law that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay couples just as   marriage was spreading across the country. The national firestorm generated by the law was so fierce that sports leagues, trade groups and technology companies threatened to boycott Mr. Pence’s state, forcing him to revise the law in a compromise that infuriated both sides of the debate. For many Americans, it was a searing introduction to Mr. Pence. But for those who have closely tracked his career, it fit a longstanding pattern: the winds of change might blow, but Mr. Pence is slow to bend. By the time he was elected to Congress in 2000, after two failed tries, Mr. Pence had missed the Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich and his scrappy, fiscally conservative acolytes who stormed Washington in 1994. Nobody, it seemed, had told Mr. Pence that the rebellion was over. He arrived in the House determined to slash federal spending and shrink the role of government. It was not to be: House Republicans, led by President George W. Bush, created giant new programs like Medicare Part D and spent trillions bailing out Wall Street after the financial crisis. “I was like the frozen man,” Mr. Pence said of his poor timing in a 2004 speech. “Frozen before the revolution thawed after it was over. A minuteman who showed up 10 years too late. ” He left little mark on the institution: During his   congressional career, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions. None became law. Showing up late, by many accounts, was his fate as governor, too. By the time he was elected, his popular predecessor, Gov. Mitch Daniels, along with a Republican legislature, had checked off almost every box on the conservative wish list: shrunken budgets, privately managed health care for state workers, and a voucher program that allowed public students to attend private schools. “Mitch Daniels dominated Indiana politics for the better part of 10 years,” said Michael D. McDaniel, who was the Indiana Republican chairman from 1995 until 2002. “Mike Pence would be the first person to tell you that he knew that was going to be a tough act to follow. ” So far, he has struggled to carve out a national reputation beyond his polarizing pursuit of socially conservative causes. In an echo of his actions on gay rights, he signed a strict new law in March that bans abortions based solely on the fetus having a disability such as Down syndrome. The measure inflamed many women and   activists across the country and now faces a court challenge. “A society,” Mr. Pence said at the time, “can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable  —   the aged, the infirm, the disabled and the unborn. ” His conservatism, friends said, is firmly rooted in his Indiana childhood, a postcard from a tranquil Midwest of the 1960s. The son of a gas station manager, he was a quiet altar boy whose favorite childhood memory was playing in a neighborhood creek. In college, he gravitated from his family’s Catholicism to evangelical Christianity after a fraternity brother at Hanover College “challenged me to take seriously the claims of Christ,” Mr. Pence later recalled on the House floor. His     personality was the centerpiece of his early campaigns. In 1988, during his first run for Congress, he rode a   bicycle across 261 miles of his district to meet voters. He lost. But his feel for the local mood and mores allowed him to master a form of communication that proved pivotal to his political rise: talk radio. After he lost the 1988 campaign, and another in 1990, “The Mike Pence Show” became his tether to voters across Indiana and a springboard into the world of national conservatives. The show’s origins reveal much about its host. The head of a local station had sold Mr. Pence (and his mother, who attended the meeting) on the idea by reminding him that radio was Ronald Reagan’s ticket to stardom in the 1930s. “Our idea was just to keep his name out there,” said Sharon Disinger, who is a   of the station with her husband. The broadcast, an amiable   discussion of politics, weather and local life that ran from 1993 to 1999, was a hit. It eventually aired on 18 local stations. “It was pleasant radio, like a fireside type chat,” Ms. Disinger said. Mr. Pence described it this way: “Rush Limbaugh on decaf. ” And it paved the way for his eventual victory in a 2000 race for Congress. By then, Mr. Pence had made a declaration that could complicate his new political partnership with Mr. Trump, whose style leaves no rival unscathed. He swore off personal attacks on campaign opponents, saying he regretted his tactics against his   Democratic rival, Representative Phil Sharp. In one 1990 campaign commercial, Mr. Pence hired an actor to play an Arab, dressed in stereotypical garb, who theatrically thanked Mr. Sharp for American dependency on foreign oil. “Negative campaigning, I now know, is wrong,” Mr. Pence wrote in a contrite essay after he lost to Mr. Sharp. In it, he quoted from the Bible about Jesus and sin. “A campaign,” Mr. Pence posited, “ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate. ” Mr. Sharp, in an interview, seemed unmoved. “To me, neither he nor Trump are of presidential timber,” Mr. Sharp said. But friends said it was a sincere conversion. Curt Smith, the president of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative group, said Mr. Pence still talked about his regret over that poisonous campaign years later. “Mike talks about his mistakes,” Mr. Smith said. “He is coming from a place of conviction. ” Admission of error did not come as easily in the case of the religious exceptions law that Mr. Pence signed in 2015. After offending gays across the country, enduring a backlash from the state’s business community and undergoing a painfully awkward nationally televised interview in which he struggled to explain the law’s    impact, Mr. Pence acknowledged only that he could have better handled the TV encounter. Soon after, he accepted a revision to the law that he said would prevent businesses from denying services to gay couples, or anyone else. “It was badly mishandled,” said Mr. Lenkowsky, the former Indiana University professor. On that, even Mr. Pence’s conservative allies agree. The compromise Mr. Pence struck, said Mr. Smith, “turned out to be a dramatic unraveling, and I was very disappointed. ” Mr. Pence, however, seems unperturbed by the politically costly decision and the resulting cultural clash that has come to define his time in office. “I don’t think it’s something he regrets,” said Mr. Lenkowsky. “If that’s his identity, that’s his identity. He can live with it. ”",0
4560,Fatal Boat Crash That Shook Lake George’s Serenity Brings Homicide Charge - The New York Times,"LAKE GEORGE, N. Y.  —   It was the height of summer, the end of one of those spectacular July days in the Adirondacks when the blistering afternoons give way to cooler evenings and waters, luring boaters out for a twilight cruise. On July 25, the Enchanted Evening, a   antique wooden boat, was making its way along the shoreline of Lake George, headed for Cramer Point on the west side of the lake. On board, Charlotte McCue, 8, was with her mother in the middle of the boat as her grandfather piloted the vessel when, out of nowhere, a   fiberglass power boat slammed into its side. The smaller craft, according to court documents and witnesses, was going so fast that it became airborne, lifting out of the water and sailing over the middle of the wooden boat. As it soared through the air, the boat hit Charlotte and her mother, Courtney McCue. Witnesses at a nearby campground heard screams and profanities and a man yelling, “Oh, dear God, no!” In a scene of unimaginable horror, the boat’s propeller mangled the girl, killing her instantly. The smaller boat stalled, then started again and drove off. The next day, Alexander M. West, 24, the driver of the smaller boat, turned himself in at the Warren County sheriff’s office. He was initially charged with leaving the scene of an accident. After an investigation, a grand jury on Monday indicted him on 12 new charges, including manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, leaving the scene of an accident without reporting, boating while impaired by alcohol and drugs and criminal possession of a controlled substance, specifically cocaine. Mr. West could face up to 22 years in prison. At his arraignment here on Wednesday in a packed courtroom that included members of the girl’s family, Mr. West pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Afterward, Cheryl Coleman, Mr. West’s defense lawyer, told reporters she was eager to take the case to trial. But she added she might seek a change of venue because statements by the prosecutor and the sheriff, Ms. Coleman said, had poisoned the potential jury pool. She cited a news conference during which Bud York, the sheriff, had discussed results of her client’s toxicology report. Ms. Coleman also emphasized that so far, only part of the story had emerged. In her 30 years of legal experience, she said, “I’ve never seen a case that is more different when you get on the inside than it looks on the outside. ” For now, the way it looks on the outside is extremely damaging to her client. In court documents, witnesses, all of whose names were redacted, have said that on the day of the crash, Mr. West and his four passengers had been drinking at Log Bay Day, an annual celebration on the lake. It began decades ago as a way for Lake George’s youthful summer work force to let off steam, but over the years it has evolved into an     bacchanal. After they left the festivities, Mr. West and his friends stopped for dinner on the lake and headed home. Then, one of the passengers, Matthew J. Marry, told the police, “We hit something. ” “When I looked back, I realized it was a boat we hit,” Mr. Marry, 28, of Kingsbury, N. Y. told the police. “We waved to the boat and asked if they were O. K. They just looked at us and kept driving. ” A member of the McCue family who was aboard the wooden boat told the police what happened from the family’s perspective. “All of a sudden, there was a bow of another boat charging up the right side of our boat near Courtney and Charlotte,” he said. “The boat cleared ours and Courtney screamed, ‘We’re hurt. ’” Charlotte was “mangled badly,” her head and body cut. “I just screamed, ‘No, no, no,’” the family member said. “I knew she was hurt bad, she wasn’t saying anything, her eyes were a different color  —   to me they looked dead. ” He added: “I just tried to hold her to keep her together. She was cut so bad. ” Not wanting anyone else to see Charlotte this way, he covered her with a blanket. At 9:24 that night, witnesses at a nearby campground heard the collision and the screams. “I then heard a boat speeding off toward the south,” a witness at the campground said, adding that a man in the boat that was speeding away was uttering profanities. The authorities have said a nearby homeowner provided them with video of the crash from his home security system. Shortly after the crash, an   police officer saw a boat pull into a nearby dock with its lights off, according to court papers. The officer said he heard one of the female passengers tell the others “not to talk about this or text about this, not to discuss it with anybody. ” None of the occupants of the boat reported the collision. The   officer reported what he had seen and heard, which led the police to Mr. West’s parents. At an arraignment in July on the earlier charge against Mr. West, prosecutors said a text from Mr. West’s mother, Cassandra West, indicated she may have been helping her son and his friends evade the police. A few weeks ago, she was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, and so far Ms. West has not been charged in this case. The four passengers on the power boat were charged with misdemeanors. Blood samples taken when Mr. West turned himself in, more than 12 hours after the crash, showed no alcohol in his system, but toxicology reports showed he had ingested at least two illegal drugs. An investigator said in court papers that Mr. West was arrested because he had “cause to know that personal injury had been caused to another person by virtue of the force with which his boat hit the other boat, the screaming of the persons on board the boat he hit and the damage his boat sustained. ” The community here has been deeply shaken by the death and particularly the accusation that Mr. West left the scene. Several officials have called for ending the Log Bay Day celebration as well as for tighter boating regulations and increased lake patrols. Lake George has fewer boating restrictions than many other Adirondack lakes, and its   waters and the scenic backdrop of its mountains have long attracted tourists and recreationists. Although the lake is 32 miles long, sections of it are often crowded with boat traffic. At the arraignment in Warren County Court on Wednesday, Kate Hogan, the district attorney, asked Judge John S. Hall Jr. to increase Mr. West’s bail, saying he was a flight risk, but she did not specify an amount. Although he lives here with his family, he has a Colorado driver’s license, she said, and travels west in winter to ski. Ms. Hogan said the defendant had reason to flee because the evidence against him was so compelling. And, she added, the charges against him include leaving the scene of an accident. “The very nature of this charge is him not stopping and doing what he should have done under the law,” Ms. Hogan said. Judge Hall increased bail for Mr. West to $100, 000 in cash or a $300, 000 bail bond, up from $50, 000 in cash or a $100, 000 bail bond. Mr. West was led away in handcuffs. His lawyer said she expected to raise the necessary money to have him released from jail. The judge ordered the defense to file its next motions by Dec. 9. If the case goes to a trial, it could be held as soon as late April.",0
4561,"The City Where People Live Without Politics, No Religion And No Money","Share on Facebook Upon learning this, you will think that happened long ago, but no. There is still a place to live, and not say for its scenery, but for their ideals as a society who do not follow the standards to which we are accustomed. In this town there is no money, no religion, no politics. This is truly a paradise to live. Think only in a place where there are none of these factors, where you can finally live in peace. This place exists and is called “Auroville”! It was founded in 1968 and was hailed as an international city by UNESCO, as its inhabitants are over 50 nationalities and different cultures. They coexist without any problem, since they have a political system, have no religion, and on top, do not use money and getting all living through the system of exchanges. Auroville is located in South India, 150 kilometers from Chennai in Madras. In this epic city, the buildings are made based on an experimental architecture, as they are constantly changing. This is because these structures seek to optimize the use of renewable energies and their main objective: reuse and recycling. The person who designed and managed to found this wonderful city was: Mirra Alfassa, better known as “Mother”. ""There should be a place on Earth that no nation could claim as their own; where all human beings of good will who have a sincere aspiration could live freely as citizens of the world, obeying one single authority, that of the supreme truth. A place of peace, concord and harmony where all the fighting instinct in man were used exclusively to overcome the cause of their sufferings and miseries, to overcome their weaknesses and ignorance, and to triumph over their limitations and disabilities. A place where the needs of the spirit and interest of progress precedence over the satisfaction of desires and passions or the pursuit of pleasure and material enjoyment,"" was the idea of Alfassa. From this hypothesis, we now have this amazing international city. This city is positioning itself as a model of sustainable eco-city. It is a method developed by the multi-cropping, combining fruit trees, cornfields and orchards, organized into 15 farms, reaching an area of 160 hectares. In this way, they ensure much food, so supply the population. In these farms work 50 villagers and 300 neighbors, producing 2% of rice and cereals consumed and 50% of vegetables. Also, the village is also self-sufficient in milk and dairy products, and fruits in season. Despite not being the only city that takes this model itself is special for receiving protection by UNESCO, and is a clear example of how it will be our way of life in a few more years, when Earth begins to manifest the consequences our mistreatment of her. Definitely this city is an example, where one of its principles is healthy, both mentally and physical life. We have nothing more to congratulate and wish all follow that model of life. Would you be in agreement with this new style of society? Related:",0
4562,"On Sundays in Senegal, Surf’s Up for the Sheep - The New York Times","The rest of the week, the beaches of Senegal are a haven for swimmers, sunbathers or anyone in the mood to relax under a   umbrella with some grilled shrimp and an orange Fanta. A number of beaches around Dakar, the capital, have also become wildly popular with surfers, chasing the bliss of the perfect wave captured in the 1966 documentary “The Endless Summer,” which was shot partly in Senegal. But on Sunday, it’s the sheep and horses’ turn. The warm Atlantic becomes a bathtub for the animals every Sunday, as shepherds line up their flocks on the sand for a daylong cleansing ritual. It’s a spiritual exercise and a way to spruce up the livestock. Senegal is predominantly Muslim, and sheep are prized as sacrifices during religious festivals some people believe the cleaner the animal, the better the sacrifice. Spa day for the sheep begins with their being led, almost always by men, into the ocean to soak for several minutes. Next, it’s back out of the waves for a thorough scrubbing on the shore with soap and a brush. The sheep take another dip to rinse off, and then it’s manicure time: cleaning out the hooves with a stick and trimming them with scissors. Each animal is taken back into the water for a final swim, then is tied to a nearby tree or beached fishing boat to wait for the rest of the flock to bathe. It’s easy for them to  : Senegalese sheep look more like goats than like the fluffy, woolly breeds common to the West. The same waters are also used to bathe the draft animals that pull horse carts, the pickup trucks of Senegal. The horses are led into the water up to their necks and then scrubbed down, becoming regular interlopers in the Sunday surfing classes at Dakar’s wide and crowded Yoff Beach.",0

4564,Supreme Court Decision on Affirmative Action Cheered by College Admissions Experts - The New York Times,"College admissions experts breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday when the Supreme Court upheld a University of Texas admissions plan that allows race and ethnicity to be considered as one of many factors in admission. “I think there are going to be some parties tonight in high school counseling offices and in college admissions offices,” said Phil Trout, the president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling and a college counselor at Minnetonka High School outside Minneapolis. “‘Sigh of relief’ is not strong enough. ” In its ruling, the Supreme Court noted that the Texas plan  —   which automatically grants admission to roughly the top 10 percent of students across the state, then uses race as one of many factors in considering the rest  —   was unique and very much a product of Texas politics, law and demographics. But what was encouraging about the court decision, experts said, was that in affirming the value of diversity, including race and ethnicity, in higher education, the court recognized that there was not one, immutable way of defining and achieving it. “It’s a terrific outcome,” said Peter McDonough, the vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education. “I think today’s decision is about deference. It’s not about dictating. I think it’s about the continuing recognition that our country’s campuses are laboratories for experimentation, and that the formula for diversity does remain elusive. It changes over time, and it is impacted by context. ” Mr. McDonough echoed a critical part of the Supreme Court opinion that described public universities as “laboratories for experimentation” and called on the University of Texas at Austin “to scrutinize the fairness of its admissions program to assess whether changing demographics have undermined the need for a   policy and to identify the effects, both positive and negative, of the   measures it deems necessary. ” The decision was made on fairly narrow legal grounds and does not establish any bold new policy, said David Hawkins, the executive director for education content and policy of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. “I don’t expect to see a resounding clarion call for further investment in the use of race and ethnicity as an admissions tool,” he said. Mr. Hawkins said he expected colleges to react by heeding the court’s call to be introspective  —   to “engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection”  —   about how they achieved diversity. Several states  —   including Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and Washington  —   have banned affirmative action, and some education analysts wondered whether the court’s decision would lead to more such backlash. “Public opinion polling suggests that most Americans don’t like the idea of counting race in deciding who gets into universities,” said Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, who has argued for using poverty rather than race to achieve diversity and said he saw the decision as a setback for that cause. “Republicans have resisted pushing this issue because they fear that it will generate turnout among ” he said. “But all bets are off with Donald Trump. It will be interesting to see what he does. ” Affirmative action bans have led public universities like the University of Michigan to look for other ways to achieve diversity, like reaching out to minority students after they have been offered admission to persuade them to accept. Experts also said other affirmative action plans could still face challenges in state legislatures and in cases before lower courts challenging admissions policies at Harvard and at the University of North Carolina. The lawsuits argue that diversity can be achieved through   alternatives. The Harvard complaint also argues that affirmative action policies have the effect of discriminating against     applicants. “The lower courts will obviously have the Fisher precedent to apply while looking at those schools’ programs,” said Rachel Kleinman, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, referring to the name of the case, Fisher v. University of Texas, No.  . “I think that could be very helpful. ” Lee C. Bollinger, president of Columbia University, noted that Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in his dissent, said the Texas plan discriminated against  . “The points made in Justice Alito’s dissent about his view and the view of dissenters that this discriminates against   I think, is one of the themes that the opponents of affirmative action are pursuing,” Mr. Bollinger said. “I do not expect Fisher to be the end. ” On the campus of the University of Texas, Sergio Cavazos, 20, president of the Senate of College Councils, said he thought students overwhelmingly supported the admissions policy. Mr. Cavazos, a senior government major, is from Brownsville, at the southern tip of Texas on the border with Mexico. One of four children from a   Hispanic family, he graduated from high school in 2013 ranked 10th in his class of 350 and entered the university under its policy of admitting the top 10 percent of graduating high school seniors. He has a full academic scholarship. “We value diversity on this campus,” he said. “One of the key concerns for me  —   myself being a Hispanic student from Brownsville  —   was ensuring this campus remain diverse and representative of the population of this state. ” The court seemed skeptical of using poverty as a proxy for achieving racial diversity, as some have called for. The decision said that Texas had “tried, and failed, to increase diversity through enhanced consideration of socioeconomic and other factors. ” Some have argued that making large allowances for race could lead to admitting students who would flounder because they were “mismatched” to academic standards, a theory that Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to be thinking of during oral arguments in the case. The court said Thursday that “the Equal Protection Clause does not force universities to choose between a diverse student body and a reputation for academic excellence. ” Justice Scalia died in February before he could participate in the Fisher decision.",0

4566,Why Referendums Aren’t as Democratic as They Seem - The New York Times,"The voters of the world have had quite a year: They rejected Colombia’s peace deal split Britain from the European Union endorsed a Thai Constitution that curtails democracy and, in Hungary, backed the government’s plan to restrict refugees, but without the necessary turnout for a valid result. Each of these moves was determined by a national referendum. Though voters upended their governments’ plans, eroded their own rights and ignited political crises, they all accomplished one thing: They demonstrated why many political scientists consider referendums messy and dangerous. When asked whether referendums were a good idea, Michael Marsh, a political scientist at Trinity College Dublin, said, “The simple answer is almost never. ” “I’ve watched many of these in Ireland, and they really range from the pointless to the dangerous,” he added. Though such votes are portrayed as popular governance in its purest form, studies have found that they often subvert democracy rather than serve it. They tend to be volatile, turning not just on the merits of the decision but also on unrelated political swings or even, as may have happened in Colombia, on the weather. Voters must make their decisions with relatively little information, forcing them to rely on political messaging  —   which puts power in the hands of political elites rather than those of voters. “This is a tool that’s risky, but politicians keep using it because they think that they’ll win,” said Alexandra Cirone, a fellow at the London School of Economics. But often they do not win, and instead of resolving political problems, the referendums create new ones. Looking over the research on these votes, it becomes clear why many experts are skeptical. Voters face a problem in any referendum: They need to distill difficult policy choices down to a simple yes or no, and predict the outcome of decisions so complex that even experts might spend years struggling to understand them. Voters typically solve this problem by finding what the political scientists Arthur Lupia and Mathew D. McCubbins have termed “short cuts. ” The voters follow the guidance of trusted authority figures or fit the choice within a familiar narrative. When a referendum is put forward by the government, people often vote in support if they like the leadership and vote in opposition if they dislike it, according to research by Lawrence LeDuc, a political scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. “A vote that is supposed to be about an important public issue ends up instead being about the popularity or unpopularity of a particular party or leader, the record of the government, or some set of issues or events that are not related to the subject of the referendum,” Professor LeDuc wrote in a 2015 paper. In Colombia, for example, most regions that voted for President Juan Manuel Santos in 2014 also voted for the peace deal, and vice versa. Voters may also cope with complex issues by shoehorning them into existing ideological beliefs. This dynamic plays out in virtually every referendum  —   especially those with higher stakes. Politicians or other powerful actors will often reframe the referendum into simplistic, straightforward narratives. The result is that votes become less about the actual policy question than about contests between abstract values, or between which narrative voters find more appealing. In Britain’s debate over whether to leave the European Union, or “Brexit,” neither side emphasized the specifics of membership in the bloc, instead framing the vote as a choice about which values to emphasize. The “Remain” campaign presented membership as a matter of economic stability. The “Leave” campaign emphasized immigration. It worked. People who voted to remain expressed great concern about the economy, but not much about immigrants. People who voted to leave said they were very concerned about immigration, and less so about the economy. In Colombia, Mr. Santos presented the referendum as a vote on peace, but the opposition presented it as a decision on whether the country’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, was entitled to leniency. Neither narrative fully portrayed the question of whether the peace deal would be worthwhile. Colombia, Ms. Cirone said, also highlighted that “in contexts where the referendum addresses a historical political issue, it may be hard for voters to separate past experiences with what is best for the country in the future. ” In Thailand, the   government held a referendum in August to approve a new Constitution that would entrench its power and curtail elements of democracy. But the military also promised elections only after the Constitution passed, in effect selling an   document as the   choice. The measure passed. Though presented as putting power in the hands of the people, referendums are often intended to put a stamp of popular legitimacy on something leaders have already decided to do. “It doesn’t have a lot to do with whether this should be decided by the people,” Ms. Cirone said. “It has to do with whether a politician can gain an advantage from putting a question to the people. ” For example, David Cameron, until July the British prime minister, held the vote on whether to depart the European Union expecting that it would bolster his decision to stay in the bloc and would thus silence British politicians who wanted to leave. The Thai military restricted news coverage of the draft Constitution, ensuring that there was no counternarrative that might portray it as a threat to democracy. By giving the appearance of popular input, the military in fact dampened it. Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary most likely devised his country’s referendum  —   on whether to reject European Union requirements for accepting refugees  —   to   inevitable objections in the bloc to his   policies and to bolster his political standing at home. In both cases, it was about using the vote as an instrument to strengthen himself. This stamp of popular legitimacy, though, can sometimes be a good thing, settling contentious national disputes that might otherwise lead to political turmoil or even to armed conflict. But it is precisely because the stakes are so high that the risks are, as well. Northern Ireland’s Good Friday peace deal in 1998 was followed by two referendums, one in Northern Ireland and one in the Republic of Ireland. That gave communities a sense of having been included, and marginalized anyone who wanted to keep fighting, making a relapse into conflict less likely. This shows an important way referendums are different from regular elections: They succeed only when the nation perceives the vote as reflecting popular will. That works best if turnout is high and one side wins in a landslide, as happened in Northern Ireland’s 1998 vote. But in Colombia, turnout was just 38 percent, and the vote was split almost perfectly down the middle, meaning a few thousand people swung the outcome. Even if the referendum had passed, it would have failed to give the peace deal popular legitimacy. That problem can be solved by requiring high turnout and a landslide victory for a referendum to be binding, Ms. Cirone said. But in a puzzling decision, neither Colombia nor Britain required more than 50 percent of the vote for either side to win. A   close result like Colombia’s can risk deepening political disputes rather than bridging them. Leaders have to choose whether to accept a result that does not demonstrably reflect popular will, or reject the result and risk a political backlash or a constitutional crisis. National referendums can also be extremely volatile, driven by factors unrelated to the issue’s merits and outside anyone’s control. Opinion polls are often misleading because people do not form their opinions until immediately before the vote. Tellingly, they often abandon those views just as quickly. Professor Marsh of Trinity College Dublin said he had found, in some cases, that “most people can’t remember any arguments for  —   this is about a week later  —   they can’t remember any arguments against, and they’re not really quite sure why they voted yes or no. ” He added, “That doesn’t inspire me, really, with referendums. ” The ambient noise of politics can also distort popular will: Whether one party is up or down in the polls, whether intraparty infighting over the vote spills into public, and how the news media portrays related issues all play a role. Votes are also subject to random factors, including the weather. In Colombia, turnout for the referendum may have been depressed by a hurricane that hit the day before, forcing evacuations in some areas. “The idea that somehow any decision reached anytime by majority rule is necessarily ‘democratic’ is a perversion of the term,” Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard, wrote after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. “This isn’t democracy it is Russian roulette for republics,” he added.",0

Bill Maher finally got his interview with President Obama and it’s a must see! 
After hundreds of thousands of petition signatures and months of “begging” on his show, Bill Maher finally managed to get President Obama to agree to a sit-down interview, and it aired on Real Time Friday night. 
During the interview, the two discussed a wide variety of subjects based on questions Maher compiled from what he thought his viewers “would want to know,” including Socialism, global warming, the agriculture industry and the military. They also discussed elitism and religion. President Obama answered every question candidly and without hesitation. He even joked around with Maher when the subject of marijuana legalization came up. 
At the end of the interview, Maher brought up the election and the president had this to say to people who are still on the fence, or are choosing not to vote at all: 
“Anybody sitting on the sidelines right now, or deciding to engage in a protest vote — that’s a vote for Trump, and that would be badly damaging to this country, and very damaging to the world. “ 
Bill Maher may have scored one of the most in-depth interviews with President Obama ever, and you won’t want to miss it.

4568,5 Slain Dallas Officers Served Overseas and at Home - The New York Times,"DALLAS  —   On Thursday night, around the time the gunfire started, Kristy Villasenor, the wife of a Dallas police officer, posted a picture of herself and her toddler daughter on Facebook from a Texas Rangers baseball game at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Soon after, one of her friends commented anxiously on the photo: “Glad Pat is there and not in Dallas right now. ” Ms. Villasenor replied: “He’s not here. ” Pat  —   her husband, Officer Patrick Zamarripa  —   was in Dallas during the game, caught in the crosshairs of a sniper’s rifle that would eventually claim his life and those of four other officers. The news of the killings emerged almost in real time online. At 10:53 p. m. the Dallas Police Department posted a Twitter message announcing that 10 officers had been shot during a protest rally, three of them fatally. Twenty minutes later, a second message said that a fourth officer had been killed. Then, after midnight, there was a third: “It has been a devastating night. We are sad to report a fifth officer has died. ” By Friday afternoon, the full scope of the city’s losses was clear: At least two of the slain officers had served overseas in the military, only to die back home in Texas. A third had made his way to Dallas after working at a jail outside Detroit. A fourth was a large man  —   about     —   who had the semblance of a grizzly bear, according to a friend. The fifth was a standout on Dallas’s large, modern force: The local police association had named him the “Cops’ Cop” for February 2009. As condolences for the men poured in all day on Friday  —   from the governor to the secretary general of the United Nations  —   details of the officers’ lives started to emerge. “We’re hurting, our profession is hurting,” said David O. Brown, the Dallas police chief. The first officer to be identified was Brent Thompson, 43, who worked for the police force of Dallas Area Rapid Transit, which operates trains and buses in the region. Mr. Thompson, the first DART officer to die in the line of duty, joined the transit force in 2009 and patrolled the northwestern section of the transit system, according to his LinkedIn page. Before Dallas, he worked for DynCorp International as a police liaison officer and helped train fellow officers in Afghanistan and Iraq. He had also been a police academy instructor in Corsicana, Tex. southeast of Dallas, where he attended high school. He started in law enforcement in the Navarro County sheriff’s office, where he was assigned to the county jail, said Leslie A. Cotten Sr. the former sheriff. But like most young officers, Mr. Cotten said, “he wanted to get out on patrol and ride around in a patrol car and do a different job. ” Family members, writing on Facebook, were the first to publicly identify Mr. Zamarripa, a   veteran of the Dallas force who had spent time in the Navy and served tours in Iraq as a military policeman. His Navy records released on Friday showed that he enlisted in 2001 and had also been posted in Florida, Illinois, Texas, Virginia and Bahrain. When he finished his military service, Mr. Zamarripa, a fan of the Rangers and the Dallas Cowboys, returned to the Dallas area and joined the Police Department, said his uncle, Hector Zamarripa. He lived in the Fort Worth area with Ms. Villasenor and their    daughter, Lyncoln. He also had a stepson, his uncle said. On Friday afternoon, the National Latino Law Enforcement Organization  —   Mr. Zamarripa was a member  —   held a somber lunch for grieving supporters. “A good kid, man, a good young kid,” said Sgt. George Aranda, who runs the organization. “He loved his job. I talked to his mom last night, and even his mom said this was Patrick’s dream. This is what he wanted to be, a police officer. ” The third slain officer was Michael Krol, 40. Before moving to Dallas, Mr. Krol had served in the Wayne County, Mich. jail system from 2003 to 2007, said the county sheriff, Benny N. Napoleon. Two of Mr. Krol’s relatives declined to be interviewed on Friday. A fourth officer, Lorne Ahrens, was married to a Dallas police detective and regarded as a lawman devoted to the profession that he pursued in Dallas for more than a dozen years. “There are very few officers I’ve met who are more passionate about doing the job right than that man,” said Timothy S. Rodgers, a former prosecutor in Dallas County. “He was always calling me. He always had questions like, ‘What can I do better in this situation?’ ” Mr. Ahrens had worked in patrol and on property crimes. Mr. Rodgers recalled with a chuckle that his friend had a knack for finding criminals who would challenge him, despite his hefty size. The fifth slain officer was Michael J. Smith, who joined the Police Department in September 1989 after growing up in the southeastern corner of the state. In a publication acknowledging his Cops’ Cop award, the Police Association said that Mr. Smith held an array of posts: in personnel, on patrol and at the airport. The publication also said he had been injured on duty years ago when a gang member “lunged at his partner with an unknown object in his hand. ” At a news conference on Friday morning, Mayor Mike Rawlings stood beside Chief Brown and said: “To say that our police officers put their lives on the line every day is no hyperbole, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a reality. ” A few hours earlier, the department had posted yet another Twitter message: “Thank you to the members of our community for your show of support during this difficult time. ”",0
4569,300 US Marines Deployed To Norway Near Russian Border For First Time Since World War II,"By wmw_admin on October 29, 2016 US Preparing For War With Russia? Cristina Silva — IBT Oct 25, 2016 This 1997 aerial photograph shows the entrance to a cave facility the U.S. military uses in the Trondheim region of central Norway. Heavy armour, tanks, artillery and Armoured Personnel Carriers are pre-positioned in the cave complex ready for use by thousands of NATO troops who could be flown into Norway should conflict erupt with Russia.

More than 300 Marines will be deployed to Norway along the Russian border as tensions between Moscow and Washington over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria have provoked new threats of sanctions and military upgrades. The deployment marks the first time a foreign military will be on the ground in Norway since World War II, according to Reuters. 
The Marines will take part in training and manoeuvres in near Arctic conditions. They will be stationed at the Vaernes military base in central Norway about 600 miles from Russia and will “increase NATO’s ability to rapidly aggregate and employ forces in northern Europe,” Major General Niel Nelson, commander of U.S. Marines in Europe, said Monday. 
Norway typically maintains good relations with the Kremlin and the two nations share a 122-mile border in the Arctic. But the Russian military has raised concerns in recent months after ordering its troops to train along Norwegian airspace and expand remote border roads. Moscow’s recent military exercises near Sweden, Denmark and Finland, as well as the former Soviet Union states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, have also stroked fears of a miltary build-up. 
“This U.S. initiative is welcome and also fits well within ongoing processes in NATO to increase exercises, training and interoperability within the Alliance,” Norwegian Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide said in the statement. “The defence of Norway is dependent on allied reinforcements, and it is crucial for Norwegian security that our allies come here to gain knowledge of how to operate in Norway and with Norwegian forces.” 
NATO previously deployed four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic States to temper Russian agression, and U.S. tanks have been stationed in Europe. Norway has been a NATO member since 1949, but under a deal with Russia it had prevously said it would not allow foreign troops on its land. But Russia’s ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and Syria have drawn rebuke from Europe and the United States, including threats of further sanctions. Meanwhile, Moscow continues to spend big on defense . 
Former senior Norwegian army officer Jacob Borresen told broadcaster NRK the latest deployment “sends negative signals eastwards” that could incite a Cold War-style “confrontation zone.” 
Russia has already denounced the move . “Taking into account multiple statements made by Norwegian officials about the absence of threat from Russia to Norway, we would like to understand why Norway is so much willing to increase its military potential, in particular through the stationing of American forces in Vaernes, “embassy spokesman Maxime Gourov said in an email to Agence France-Presse.",0
4570,Why most conservative Christian Americans love law…as long as it’s not God’s.,"But God’s law ? 
Um…no thank you. 
Law apart from God is beautiful to most Americans. Law defined by God is abhorrent to most of the same people. 
Think about that and you’ll quickly get clarity as to why we are where we are in America. 
Just swap “law” for “God’s law” and the otherwise adored and championed concept as embraced and proclaimed throughout the land by gajillions of supposedly God-loving American people suddenly becomes something to fear, avoid, run away from, deny, ignore, work around and/or generally malign. 
Replace “law” with “God’s law” and you will find most “conservative Christian” types in America flipping like a switch in conversations about how government and law ought to be approached here in *ahem* God’s creation. 
Much like the concepts freedom, liberty, prosperity, success, and peace, the concept of law has been thoroughly separated from God in the minds of most politically active conservatives claiming the name of Christ in America. 
In short, it is self-described conservative Christians in America who have long modeled the open contempt for God’s Law that has led us to where we are now. 
Talk about the importance of generic law in America, and these people will cheer and champion your cause. 
Talk about the importance of God’s Law in America, and they’ll more often than not rail against the notion and turn on your personally for even bringing the idea into focus. 
“We the People” are God in practice , after all. 
“We the People” are free to define our own approach to reality based on our (ever-shifting) standards as we see fit, at least as far as most politically active professing Christian conservatives in the land are concerned. 
Don’t believe me? 
Just ask ’em what they think about “law.” 
Let them go on as long as they like in response. Ask obvious follow-up questions honestly and encourage them to give detailed answers. 
Then, after they’ve made their view of law and its role in America plain, ask ’em the same question about God’s Law and its binding authority over America and every other part of God’s creation.

4571,Andy Weir’s Best Seller ‘The Martian’ Gets a Classroom-Friendly Makeover - The New York Times,"There are more than 160 swear words in Andy Weir’s   thriller, “The Martian,” including two memorably deployed   in the novel’s first three sentences. The profanity did not strike Mr. Weir as excessive when he wrote the book nearly a decade ago. After all, the story’s narrator, an astronaut named Mark Watney, is stranded alone on Mars with a dwindling supply of food and a rescue mission that is four years away  —   circumstances that warrant constant cursing. But shortly after the book came out, Mr. Weir started hearing from a subset of readers who objected to the obscenities. “I got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, ‘Man I’d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there’s so much profanity in it that we can’t really do that,’” said Mr. Weir, 44, who is cheerful,   and casually profane, much like his protagonist. “It’s hard to get that by a school board. ” Apart from the   words, “The Martian” is a science teacher’s dream text. It’s a gripping survival story that hinges on the hero’s ability to solve a series of complex problems, using his knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy and math, in order to stay alive on a hostile planet. (The Washington Post called the novel “an advertisement for the importance of STEM education. ”) After getting dozens of inquiries from teachers, Mr. Weir, who describes himself as “a lifelong space nerd,” asked his publisher, Crown, if they could release a   edition of the book. The novel was pretty easy to amend, by simply replacing the foul language with tamer words like “screwed,” “jerk” and “crap” (Mr. Weir said there were “occasional squabbles” when he tried to lobby the censors to keep some of the less offensive swear words in.) A   version came out last year, and it is now being used to help teach science in classrooms around the country. At Synergy Quantum Academy, a public charter high school in South Los Angeles, students are conducting experiments based on the novel. In physics class, students will build miniature   cars, and during astronomy next month, they will try to grow potatoes as Watney did, using a chamber modeled on NASA’s Lunar Plant Growth Chamber. Eighth graders at Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, Calif. are following a yearlong curriculum based on “The Martian,” with lesson plans that use dramatic moments in the narrative to illustrate concepts like Newton’s laws of motion, chemical reactions and spacecraft engineering. In a science class at Northwestern High School in Mellette, S. D. sophomores are using the novel as a   point for some   experiments, like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. “It’s really exciting for them to see the connection between the novel and the science they’re learning,” said Denise Clemens, a science teacher at Northwestern. “Hopefully we’re not going to blow anything up. ” Her students seem happy to have an alternative to dry science textbooks. “It’s been a really good way to understand ionic compounds and bonds and all the things you can do with chemistry,” Jarret Haven, 16, said of studying “The Martian. ” “It’s really opened up my mind. ” For Mr. Weir and his publisher, getting the book into schools opens up a lucrative new market that could turn “The Martian,” which was already a blockbuster that sold several million copies, into a perennial best seller that guarantees a   audience every year. Mr. Weir did not set out to write a science textbook. A college dropout and former software engineer who is fascinated by space exploration, Mr. Weir started writing “The Martian” in 2009, mainly to entertain himself. The story grew out of a thought experiment, when Mr. Weir began imagining what a scientifically feasible manned mission to Mars would look like. The story took shape as Mr. Weir tried to work out what it would take to get to Mars, and how to keep a stranded astronaut alive on the planet (the creative use of duct tape is key). “Oftentimes, when I was   the math, I would discover problems that I hadn’t thought of that Watney would run into,” he said. He wrote computer software to work out what the constant thrust trajectories would be for the spaceship’s ion engine, and studied NASA satellite images to map out Watney’s treacherous   kilometer course across Mars in a rover. He also calculated how many calories Watney would need to stay alive, how much water he would need to grow potatoes, and how he could manufacture water out of oxygen and hydrazine, a compound used for rocket fuel. Mr. Weir had failed to sell an earlier attempt at a novel, so rather than trying to get “The Martian” published, he serialized it for free on his website. Some of his fans urged him to list it on Amazon, and he began selling it for 99 cents. He quickly sold 35, 000 copies, and started getting inquiries from publishers and agents. Crown bought the novel and published it in 2014. A feature film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon as Watney, came out the next year and grossed more than $630 million worldwide. The novel sold more than three million copies, and has racked up more than 29, 500 reviews on Amazon. Crown has printed nearly 30, 000 copies of the classroom edition, which comes with a teacher’s guide that lists discussion questions and activities and includes an interview with Mr. Weir about the science behind the story. Next month, Mr. Weir will address science teachers at the National Science Teachers Association’s conference in Los Angeles, and his publisher will give away around 500 copies of the classroom edition of the “The Martian. ” David Beck, a science teacher at Oak Middle School, was one of the teachers who lobbied Mr. Weir for a sanitized version of the story. After he first read “The Martian” two years ago, Mr. Beck immediately wanted to create a curriculum based on the novel. “I thought, I could teach all of my   physical science out of this book,” he said. He proposed using the novel in his class to the school’s principal, who loved the idea but thought the foul language could be a problem. They approached the district school board to see if they could assign the novel to students, and were turned down. (They even considered buying copies of the novel and redacting the swear words by hand with markers, but decided against it.) Mr. Beck then emailed Mr. Weir and later, his publisher, and asked if they had considered releasing a PG edition for students. At that point, similar requests were piling up. Crown wanted to wait until after the movie adaptation came out, to avoid confusing retailers and readers. When Broadway Books, a Crown imprint, published the school edition in 2016, Mr. Beck created a yearlong curriculum for the school’s 380 eighth graders, who each got a copy of the book. So far, the students have been enthusiastic, and many have finished the novel ahead of schedule. Some teachers are skeptical that students need to be shielded from the profanity in “The Martian. ” Marc Montalbano, an English teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, said he was using the original version of “The Martian” with his seniors, who are also drawing on the text for science research projects. Watney’s swearing makes him seem more relatable as a character and helps offset the heavy science, Mr. Montalbano said in an email. Nora Groft, a high school English teacher at Northwestern, said she taught the classroom edition of “The Martian,” but told her students that a version with more adult language was available, too, and that the curse words might be appropriate, given the context. “Imagine if you were stranded on Mars,” she said. “Do you think you’d say, ‘Goshdarnit’?”",0
4572,How to View a Richer Year for the Poor and Middle Class - The New York Times,"The income and poverty report released on Tuesday by the Census Bureau was such a blockbuster that you’d think the bureau had just issued Beyoncé’s next secret album the night before. Even for many traditionally pessimistic economic observers, this was a very welcome report. Real median incomes rose 5. 2 percent in 2015  —   phenomenal growth by economic standards. And 3. 5 million people moved out of poverty. But more important, 2015 was encouraging to economists because of where income growth was concentrated: the poor and middle class. We’re used to hearing about the sagging middle class, but in 2015, the middle class experienced its most income growth in nearly half a century. The income percentages of the middle class (the 40th, 50th and 60th deciles) all grew more than 5 percent. For the poor, 2015 was only slightly less impressive. The 10th and 20th percentiles posted their   growth numbers. The only other year when income grew faster was 1968. In fact, maybe things are getting as good as they used to be. The pattern of 2015 is similar to that seen in 1968:   growth among the middle class and poor, and moderate income growth among the rich. From the chart, you can see that in percentage terms, the poor tend to have wider ranges of growth and decline, reflecting the kind of financial instability that they face. But no matter how good 2015 seems to be, it cannot undo the years of decline since the recession. If you measure income growth from a longer horizon, 10 years, the picture changes drastically. In addition to greater variance in growth (because we’re taking a longer view) you see that the balance of growth tips toward the rich  —   and that 2015 does nothing to change that trend. It’s this long view that helps explain the economic anxiety that many people are experiencing. Also problematic is the divide in real income growth between households in rural and urban areas. Households outside of metro areas saw their incomes fall 2 percent (an update on this outlook can be found here) while households in cities saw their incomes grow 7. 3 percent. So while those who pay close attention to economic statistics may cheer about one good year, it’ll take more widespread growth to change how people actually feel.",0
4573,California Today: Cracking Down on Distracted Driving - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Jonah Engel Bromwich for today’s introduction. A California law that went into effect on Sunday barring drivers from holding phones while operating vehicles is among the most stringent in the nation. But experts say that it most likely won’t be enough to prevent accidents caused by distracted driving. Jennifer Ryan, AAA’s director of state relations, cautioned in a phone interview on Thursday that, “hands free is not risk free. ” Ms. Ryan said the California measure matched a larger trend of states bringing legislation    with contemporary phones. But while the state’s provisions were particularly broad, she said, it was important for motorists to take responsibility for themselves and pay attention. The law goes beyond what federal authorities recommend to prevent distracted driving, which remains a significant cause of traffic fatalities. The latest statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration show that more than 3, 400 people died in 2015 in crashes that involved a distracted driver. Of those, 272 were teenagers. And while the use of smartphones is certainly part of the problem, many are unconvinced that keeping them out of drivers’ hands will be a panacea. Some have speculated that the California law may encourage enthusiasm for   cars. When Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law in September, he approved of another bill that allowed for the first tests of autonomous driving vehicles on public roads. Steve Finnegan, the government affairs manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California, said that while the new legislation “is a step in the right direction,” it does not address “the complete issue of distracted driving. ” “One of the bigger issues is cognitive distraction,” Mr. Finnegan said. “It’s not what your hands are doing it’s what your brain is doing. ” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have metered paywalls.) • Senator Dianne Feinstein will be at the center of the debate over   Donald J.

While relaxing there with his guitar, he is thought to have sketched the lines: Later, the guitarist Steve Cropper helped to fill out the rest of the song and it was recorded in November. But Mr. Redding never heard the single. Just 18 days after the studio session, he died in a plane crash in Madison, Wis. on Dec. 10, 1967. He was 26. On Jan. 8, 1968, the “Dock of the Bay” album was released. The single rose to No. 1 on Billboard’s pop chart and stayed there for four weeks. It was the biggest hit of Mr. Redding’s career.

4574,A Victory for ‘White’ America,"A Victory for ‘White’ America November 12, 2016 
The narrow split in the U.S. electorate revealed by Donald Trump’s election as President ended with a victory of “white” America over “diverse” America with long-lasting consequences, says moral theologist Daniel C. Maguire. 
By Daniel C. Maguire 
My reaction four days out from the moral tragedy of Donald Trump’s election as President is this: we are two nations, not one nation. On Nov. 8, 2016, one nation, a very white, very gerrymandered nation, braced by feeble voter turnout, conquered the other. 
The conquest will continue for at least a generation since it includes control of the U.S. Supreme Court. Mid-term elections may bring minor relief (or possibly not because Senate Democrats have far more seats to defend than Republicans) but the conquering nation knows that the Supreme Court and other judges pipe the tune to which all must dance. President-elect Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence thank their supporters for the upset victory on Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo from donaldjtrump.com) 
In this new regimen, the environment loses, true democracy loses, unions lose, education loses, women lose, especially those with problem pregnancies, a free press loses, peace-makers lose, people of color lose, “illegal” immigrants lose, international alliances lose, the goal of basic health care for all loses, the regulations of corporate greed lose, occupied people like the Palestinians lose, sexual minorities lose, real religious freedom loses, the splintered Democratic party loses, and voter turnout continues to lose. And in all losses, the poor are the greatest losers. 
There is nothing new in this. The Exodus story in the Bible (when not misunderstood as history) is a metaphor for human societies. Properly interpreted, Exodus was saying that human social organization teeters between the Egyptian pyramidal model of one percent rule and the alternative Sinai model based on appropriate sharing where “there will be no poor among you” (Deut. 15:4) and where swords will gradually be beaten into plowshares. 
In the brief period after the Second World War, ending in the early 1970s, the United States getting closer to the Sinai sharing model. Even under Republican Dwight Eisenhower, the top marginal income tax rate was 90 percent. “Justice consists in sharing,” said Thomas Aquinas. 
During that brief moral interlude, there was sharing and a healthy middle class, along with the best-educated young in the world. We receded from that in subsequent decades, and on Nov. 8, 2016, we solemnly broke faith with humanity’s best hopes. 
The tragedy is terminal only if hope, the most revolutionary of emotions, also dies. The Deuteronomist said that we can choose life or we can choose death and then begged us, choose life for your children’s sake. That salient challenge remains in the wake of this debacle.

4575,"Pat Caddell: Trump White House ’Looks like Fort Apache Under Attack’ by Media, Political Class","Veteran political strategist Pat Caddell talked about the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and its possible effect on the 2018 midterm elections with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“All these smart people in Washington, who have not understood politics for some time, these are the same people who said, ‘Well, it wouldn’t hurt the Democrats. The country will love it,’” Caddell said of conventional media wisdom about Obamacare at the time of its passage.  LISTEN: “Then we had several elections, and now we’re saying, ‘Oh, of course, the Republicans are doomed,’” he continued, referring to predictions that as many as 20 House Republicans could be facing tougher   campaigns in 2018 because of the AHCA. “No, they’re not. It depends on what they do,” Caddell argued. “So far, I’ll tell you as a fairly competent person, I have no idea what’s in this bill. That’s because, other than the talking points, the headlines thrown out by Trump administration and congressional people, I have no clue what’s in it. I don’t know how it answers the problems that have been raised. ” “But at the same time, the failure of the Republicans and the White House and the entire operation to set a narrative, made important what had to be done  —   to have ceded all of that ground to their opponents on the basis of, ‘Well, you know preconditions are going to be hurt, are going to be cut out of this, and we’re going to destroy Medicaid,’ whatever. To have conceded that ground is to have conceded a lot,” he continued.  “But I’m not sure the next election is going to be about health care, one way or the other,” Caddell added. “It depends on whether or not they can get something fixed, and whether or not people perceive that Donald Trump has kept his word, or whether this is just seen as another partisan battle. So I’m not so sure. ”  “I don’t see any great movement in the polls, in terms of party support for either party, since they’ve been doing this for several months or raising this. I’m somewhat skeptical. I think the election in 2018 is going to be on much larger grounds than merely a healthcare revolt. It may or may not work to Donald Trump’s benefit  —   we will yet see  —   or detriment. I think that we’re going to see some other things raised. But the single most important thing is the economy and what happens to it,” he predicted.  “Let me just add another thing: whether or not Donald Trump starts representing, in this White House, the voters who put him over the top,” he said, criticizing the Trump team for “failing to show much interest or clarity” in using their 2016 election victory to shape a new political majority. Caddell agreed with Boyle that House Speaker Paul Ryan was a major force pushing Trump in that conventional Republican direction. He said Ryan was the paramount example of what he calls “the Chamber of Commerce Republican Establishment party,” which was “slaughtered in 2016. ” Caddell said those establishment Republicans “managed to spark an uprising after the victory of the Republicans in 2014 and their immediate decision in December to go into conference and sell out everything the Republican candidates had campaigned on. ” “This group of people has never wanted Donald Trump. They don’t want Donald Trump now. The longer he keeps letting them stab him in the back, which is what’s happening  —   whether it’s on this, it’s what’s happening at the FCC, on privacy rights,” he warned.  “And by the way, where is Donald Trump taking on the massive disaster of the airlines in this country?” Caddell asked. “Nowhere! They leave so much hanging. Partly it’s because I fear it’s because they failed to have an organizing principle of this White House. They are then susceptible to their quote ‘allies’  —   enemies!  —   who want to push their agenda, an agenda that the American people have never wanted. That is a real danger. ” Caddell faulted the Trump administration for failing to use “the bully pulpit of the White House” to influence America’s political culture, with the healthcare debate serving as an acute example. With a caveat about how polling has become unreliable because much of it is conducted by universities, and university polls can no longer be conducted in a truly unbiased manner, he said he doubted the level of energetic support for the House Obamacare replacement bill exceeded 25 percent. “How did they get in that fix? And most of all, how did they do it when, in fact, the market, I think, is collapsing?” he marveled. “Part of the problem is there is no place for ordinary people, or even sophisticated people, to go to find out what the truth is. All we’re getting is propaganda from MSNBC and CNN, the mainstream media. We don’t have enough places for people to go and sort the facts, and it certainly isn’t coming out of the House leadership. ” Boyle noted the White House could spend more time touting its successes, such as achieving the lowest unemployment figure last month in more than a decade. Caddell responded that he did not want to “start throwing around unemployment numbers” he was denouncing as “cooked, in the sense that they no longer reflect the real reality of what unemployment is” last year. “Those people who cannot get   work and whatever, that number is still higher, and we shouldn’t repeat the mistake the Obama people and the Bill Mahers of the world” made by overemphasizing the importance of the headline unemployment figure. “This is still not a good economy. It’s getting better,” he pronounced. “But it’s Trump’s opportunity. That, and standing up for people, and shaking Washington to its foundations. That’s why I said something like the airlines. The entire reason our airline industry is so much worse than Europe is because everyone in Washington has been bought off by these people, including those pathetic congressmen I saw question witnesses last week, who complain about their own trips but do nothing about it because they get too much money. ” “When he starts draining the swamp, rather than inviting the swamp to eat him, then he will begin to turn this,” Caddell advised. “But I have to stay it. It’s just a true statement: this White House has no strategy. They could have done   things in health care, gotten a bill passed with two things: how about dealing with drug prices, and also allowing interstate competition? Just laying a marker down would have been good. ” “Doing the same thing on tax reform by taking away the hedge fund money, proving he’s not going to be the pawn of these big billionaire rich people  —   I mean, Trump needs to take charge,” he continued. “They could get successes, but they won’t, as long as they allow themselves to be led by their enemy allies. ” Boyle suggested some of President Trump’s problems stemmed from the enormous permanent bureaucracy, which is prone to undermining dramatic reforms. He said there were some hopeful signs that Trump is beginning to make progress against this obstacle. “I agree with you, Matt. It’s not lost. It’s just got to be kind of frustrating because already, things should be happening,” said Caddell. “I’ll tell you, I don’t mean to be just critical because they have done good things,” he added. “And they are surrounded. Remember, they’re at war with an entire political class. The White House sometimes looks like Fort Apache under attack. I mean, the Indians are everywhere. ” “We have a national media that is literally proving itself to be the enemy of the American people, and it will not put out any news that is true or factual that will help Trump,” he said, accusing the media of banding together “in such negativity to undermine him. ”  “Then you have the political class itself, which are the lobbyists, lawyers, money of both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party  —   who are united because they so desperately need to go back to normal, to further their corruptions,” he added. “Trump needs to strike the high ground. This is the most unique challenge a president has ever had. He has got to figure the unique ways to do it. I think they’re capable of it, but so far, somebody needs to tell them they’re not doing it,” Caddell said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

4576,What Donald Trump and Anthony Weiner Have in Common - The New York Times,"A   trip to a country you mock. Or a screaming tirade from the floor of Congress. An angry   tweet to a foreign leader. Or a   selfie sent to a stranger. It is the kind of behavior we see in a particular variety of politician  —   most often, I’ll just say it, men. From New York. Who love social media. Any guesses? In the latest episode of The Run Up, we explore two forces that have endeared and alarmed us in political life this year: impulsiveness and narcissism. And we examine two men, Donald J. Trump and Anthony D. Weiner, who have at times embodied both qualities. Both have ridden those attributes to dizzying political highs but also found they take a toll, raising doubts about their judgment and fitness for public office. I spoke with two people who have studied both men for years: Frank Bruni, a columnist and former political reporter at The Times, and Maggie Haberman, a national campaign reporter whom I first met covering Mr. Weiner back in 2009. “To get to a certain level of success as a politician in the current context  —   with the cameras on you all the time, with social media, with all of this   attention  —   you have to be able to be a bit of a performer,” Mr. Bruni says. “That requires a certain amount of loving the crowd, a certain amount of narcissism. That’s the price of entry. ” Part of Mr. Trump’s strength as a performer is his mastery of reading the room. We saw that on display with the stark contrast between his performance in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon and in Phoenix that night, Ms. Haberman says. “Trump’s impulses are to please whatever crowd he is in front of and to meld to whatever audience he’s speaking to,” she says. She reminds us of what Mr. Trump told The Times’s editorial board: that when he feels the energy in the crowd flagging, he goes to his line about building a wall. “He’s coming up with what he says, and what then becomes his policy position, based on how to get the crowd to make him feel good. ” Mr. Bruni says. “This is narcissism as a governing philosophy. ” With both Mr. Trump and Mr. Weiner, Ms. Haberman says, “there’s a certain A. D. D. quality to how they go about their performance or performance art, depending on how you want to describe it. ” When there’s no crowd on hand to provide the dopamine hit, Twitter does the trick. “This need for that dopamine, that need for instant gratification, I think it raises enormous questions  —   disqualifying questions  —   about both of them as potential leaders or actual leaders,” Mr. Bruni says. “There’s a big difference between what is interesting to behold and what we want to be governed by. ” Please let us know what you think of The  .

4578,The Queen gets £1m reimbursement for Brexit despite the Treasury having a £16bn financial black hole,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:45 UTC © The Canary Leaked documents reveal that the Treasury now faces a £16bn financial black hole in our finances. But despite this, the government has promised to reimburse our super-rich Queen £1m for the money she'll lose out on when leaving the EU. The leaked documents A series of leaked documents , posted on the government's website in error , has revealed that the Treasury faces a black hole of up to £16bn this year. Due to a combination of poor economic decisions and increased levels of borrowing, this means that the UK's deficit is well behind the 27% forecasted reduction rate. With the uncertainty of the global financial market, this black hole is only likely to increase. As The Canary previously reported , many global banks are again stockpiling gold. This is to secure their assets and ensure their currency can be backed up in case of an emergency. During Gordon Brown's reign, however, the UK sold off the majority of its gold, meaning the UK's currency isn't supported by any assets. If a global financial crash were to come, this would prove devastating. The Queen Despite these dire circumstances, the government has promised to secure the Queen's wealth and reimburse her for any losses which may occur after Brexit. The Queen, like many other aristocrats, benefits from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy . Initially created in 1962 to help protect farmers against unstable crop prices, it has instead been helping the most wealthy and privileged. Every year, the UK's richest landowners receive payouts, with the Queen bagging over £1m a year . Sandringham Estate receives close to £700,000 a year, while Windsor Castle receives £300,000. Prince Charles also benefits from the EU's policy and gets £100,000 a year just for his estates. Since the announcement of the Brexit vote, the Conservative government has pledged [ paywall ] to pick up the subsidy bill at least until 2020. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Conservative defence minister who backed Brexit, said : What we all said during the Leave campaign was that all those currently in receipt of so-called EU money will continue to receive the same money because we will be saving £20bn every year. We must reassure the recipients - whether it's Her Majesty or farmers - that they will continue to benefit from the current arrangements. The Queen and the Treasury While money made from the Crown's estates feeds back into the Treasury, the Queen and her family still benefit from a large profit. These estates, known as the ""Sovereign's public estate"", are technically neither government property nor part of the monarch's private estate. But the government still pays the Queen. On top of the Brexit reimbursement, the monarch is set to receive £42.8m from the Treasury between 2016-2017. This figure is £12m more than that in 2012 and means an extra £2.7m will be taken from the taxpayers' pocket. So while the Treasury faces a black hole six times the size of the NHS deficit , the government is continuing to spend the taxpayers' money to provide for a super-wealthy aristocrat. While many people may still support the Queen, it cannot be denied that the monarchy is losing its appeal. In a recent review , it was discovered that Chester Zoo, Stonehenge, and the Roman Baths are more successful tourist attractions than Windsor Castle. Alongside this, more and more republicans are calling for a referendum on abolishing the monarchy after the Queen dies. If the government continues to prioritise her over the needs of the British public, support for this cause may well increase.",0
4579,"Sweden is recycling so much trash, it’s running out","Sweden is recycling so much trash, it's running out Nov 18, 2016 6 0 
( Minds ) Sweden has transformed its waste-infrastructure program to accommodate the burning of trash. They have taken a process that used to be heavily pollutant and modernized it to create incredible amounts of energy with a low waste output. They’ve even figured out how to turn a lot of that polluting gas into biofuel. 
Currently, the Swedish population recycles 1.5 billion bottles and cans annually, which is an amazing amount, relative to the population of about 9.6 million (in 2013). 
There are 32 of these amazing reconversion plants, dedicated to turning trash into energy, throughout the country and they are actually at a point where they need to import trash to keep them going. They continue to import trash from the UK, Italy, Norway, and Ireland. 
Burning it is, now, better for the environment than letting it sit there , says Swedish Waste Management communications director Anna-Carin Gripwell. “When waste sits in landfills, leaking methane gas and other greenhouse gasses, it is obviously not good for the environment.” 
“We feel that we have responsibility to act responsibly in this area and try to reduce our ecological footprint,” states Per Bolund, Swedish Finance and Consumption Minister. “The consumers are really showing that the want to make a difference and what we’re trying to do from the government’s side is to help them act, making it easier to behave in a sustainable way.” Vote Up",0
4580,"64 Percent of DEA Fugitives are from Mexico, Figures Show","A review of the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) wanted fugitive list revealed that less than 16 percent of DEA fugitives are from the United States. [The review of the DEA’s wanted fugitive list took place from April 18 to April 21, 2017, in which all 21 DEA divisions were analyzed.  The 21 DEA divisions that oversee the United States had a total of 902 listed fugitives. The    of 115 of the 902 fugitives is unknown. The remaining 787 fugitives are from a total of 38 countries with the overwhelming majority coming from Mexico. The top three countries that DEA fugitives come from are: (1) Mexico, 505 (2) United States, 124 and (3) Colombia, 21. Out of the 787 whose    is known, 70 percent are from south of the U. S.  border, 64 percent from Mexico alone. In an email to Breitbart Texas, the DEA Office of Congressional and Public Affairs said: Each division is responsible for updating their fugitive website and that is done as needed. So if there is someone that has been arrested and needs to come down they do it, however there are instances where some of them have been arrested outside of the United States so, in that instance, they would remain displayed on the fugitive website until they have been extradited to the United States. Each division does quarterly reviews of their websites to check the status the fugitives and update as needed. In the 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary, the DEA categorically states that Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) represent the largest drug threat to the United States: Mexican TCOs remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States no other group is currently positioned to challenge them. These TCOs maintain territorial influence over large regions in Mexico used for the cultivation, production, importation, and transportation of illicit drugs. By controlling lucrative smuggling corridors across the U. S. Southwest Border (SWB) Mexican TCOs are able to introduce   quantities of illicit drugs into the United States on a yearly basis. The   portfolio maintained by Mexican TCOs consists primarily of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana, and to a lesser extent, fentanyl. Once these drugs are smuggled across the Mexican border, they are delivered to consumer markets in the United States using transportation routes and distribution cells that Mexican TCOs oversee both directly and indirectly. The DEA lists the following six Mexican drug cartels as having the greatest drug trafficking impact on the U. S.: Sinaloa, Jalisco New Generation, Juarez, Gulf, Los Zetas, and the   Organization.  The most powerful of the Mexican drug cartels is the Sinaloa, which the DEA states it “maintains the most expansive international footprint amongst Mexican cartels. The Sinaloa Cartel exports and distributes wholesale amounts of methamphetamine, marijuana, cocaine, and heroin in the United States   …     Illicit drugs distributed by the Sinaloa Cartel are primarily smuggled into the United States through crossing points located along Mexico’s border with California, Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas. ” The entire U. S.  Border is broken down into sections or “turf” that is controlled by Mexican drug cartels. One of the reasons that the Mexican drug cartels have so much power is because they often bribe   politicians and law enforcement in Mexico which allows them to operate with impunity. Breitbart Texas is one of the only news organizations that reported on the connections between Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and the Mexican drug cartels.

4581,Baseball Is Practically a Water Sport to the Mets’ Curtis Granderson - The New York Times,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.  —   Even for 10 minutes, Curtis Granderson can’t restrain himself. On a recent morning here in spring training, before the start of his 12th full major league season, he was talking about how, at age 36, he will handle the rigors of chasing down balls in center field. As he talked, he asked for a brief timeout and reached for the   water bottle he had left on the floor beside his locker. This was his sixth bottle of the day, and it wasn’t yet noon. There would likely be another six before the day was done. “You always see him just crushing water,” said his fellow outfielder Michael Conforto, who is 12 years younger than Granderson. Granderson drinks by the sip. He values that over chugging because he believes it gives his body a constant flow of essential fluids. He is also a firm believer in   water, because he can’t drink as much when the water is cold. Thus, a   of   bottles is always adjacent to his locker. “There are always massive amounts of bottles of water everywhere,” said third baseman David Wright, whose spring training locker is next to Granderson’s. There’s also expansive territory to cover in center field. Granderson may not be ideal as the Mets’ primary player at that position, but he is the best option on a roster with numerous corner outfielders. And despite an uneven 2016 season, when he hit . 237, he clobbered 30 home runs, second only to Yoenis Cespedes on the Mets, and drew a   74 walks. Since signing a   $60 million deal with the Mets before the 2014 season, Granderson has primarily played in right. But with another right fielder, Jay Bruce, back for 2017 and Conforto in the mix, Granderson will be asked to man center  —   with some help from   outfielder Juan Lagares, who suffered a strained left oblique on Saturday. The last time Granderson played more than 100 games in center field was 2012, when he was with the Yankees. “He does keep himself in great shape, but the wear and tear of playing center field is going to be tough on his legs at times,” said the Mets’ manager, Terry Collins. Which is where the water comes in. Granderson’s recent track record is proof of how much care he puts into staying healthy. With the Mets, over the last three years, he has averaged 154 games a season  —   as many as he did in his   when he played center for the Detroit Tigers. “I’m the oldest guy here with the Mets,” he said. “I never thought I’d be saying that with any team I’d be on. ” He probably never thought he would be drinking as much water as he now does, either, although he maintains it isn’t water alone that has helped him stay on the field. With experience, he said, he has learned how to give his body a break. “Before, if I wasn’t starting, I felt like I needed to do something, whether it be lift or hit or do something,” he said. “Now, I can shut it down and get back to where I need to after. ” That mentality now applies to the   too. He had tried everything from boxing to Muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) for fitness in past winters, but eventually stopped because it wasn’t worth the risk of overtraining or injury. Instead, four years ago, Granderson added swimming to his   workouts, doing his sessions at his alma mater, the University of Illinois at Chicago. And while he still lifts weights, he has cut back because he didn’t think the extra lifting was necessary. In addition, although some athletes who are Granderson’s age significantly change their diets, Granderson has not done so  —   except for the water, that is. “When people ask me about my diet, it’s hard to explain because I’ll literally eat everything,” he said. “I like vegetables. I like fruits. I like fried stuff. I like sweets. So if you tell me to cut stuff out, that’s no problem because there’s so much other stuff I like. ” In the   his breakfasts are usually oatmeal, fruit and, well, you already know his drink of choice. Often busy with charity work, Granderson packs a lunch of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, nuts, fruit and chocolate milk. Dinner varies daily. “My biggest thing is to maintain weight,” he said. “If I don’t eat, I lose it by nature. ” During the season, Granderson always eats breakfast, checking what time the hotel or nearby restaurants will finish serving it so he can get there in time. During spring training, he often eats in the Mets’ clubhouse. He also loves napping, if only for 10 minutes, and he uses the many plane rides during the season to get still more sleep. “A lot of guys don’t like flying,” he said. “I’m like a baby in a car. ” But   or regular season, the common thread for Granderson is water, and then more water. A routine sight in the Mets’ clubhouse is Granderson stuffing water bottles into his glove, back pockets or backpack before practice or when leaving for the team hotel. “I always have it by me,” he said. Granderson changed how much water he consumed after a game on May 1, 2010, when he was 29 and playing for the Yankees. In the sixth inning against the Chicago White Sox, he was running from first base to third on a single when he felt a twinge in his groin area. He left the game and was placed on the   disabled list. He was already dealing with a sore throat and a fever, and the Yankees sent him to a hospital to get intravenous fluids. “There they told me: ‘Man, even your veins are dehydrated. You just haven’t been drinking that much water,’” Granderson said. He returned to the Yankees’ lineup after four weeks of rehabilitation, but he made a vow to drink more water. Since then, Granderson has not completely avoided injuries  —   he sustained a fractured right forearm and broken left pinkie after being hit by pitches in 2013 and has had minor calf ailments that have lasted a few days. But a lack of hydration has not been an issue. “It takes a while to get used to,” he said about all the water. “You wake up a lot a night to go to the bathroom when you first start. ” Granderson now has his water consumption down to a science. Before he arrives at the stadium during spring training, he has already consumed two   bottles. Then he has 12 ounces with breakfast. He carries three   bottles out to batting practice with him. He’ll have another one with lunch, often with electrolyte powder mixed in. His postgame protein shake is followed by another bottle of water on the way home, and then several more before he goes to sleep. Granderson also drinks decaffeinated tea but doesn’t consume soda, juice or coffee. Those were pushed aside when his water consumption shot up. Asked about Granderson’s water intake, Dr. Melissa Leber, an assistant professor of orthopedics at the Icahn School of Medicine medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York, put it in a larger context. The average sweat rate of an adult while running is about two liters an hour, she said. So an active adult in a warm climate should consume up to six liters of water a day. That is in the general vicinity of how much water Granderson takes in daily, although baseball can be a stationary sport at times, which means Granderson isn’t always running around. But he is always looking to take another sip, amazing his teammates in the process. “I’d just feel full all the time drinking that much,” said Conforto, who estimated he drank perhaps six bottles a day. “But it’s clearly working for him. ”",0
4582,Kathy Griffin ’Beheading’: Hollywood’s Feminist A-List Cashes In on Global Suffering of People of Color - Breitbart,"New Year’s Eve personality Kathy Griffin has a message for Donald Trump: she wants to hold his bloody severed head in her hands. [Griffin’s hyperviolent “art” photography holding the simulated Trump head will rightfully put a spotlight on the culture of violence leftists have cultivated in America follow the President’s electoral victory. But it should also serve as a reminder that Griffin is not alone on Hollywood’s female comedy   in feeling comfortable using the suffering of   people around the world to make money and generate headlines. Too many of Hollywood’s liberal white female comedians see their suffering as joke fodder for new movies, sketches, or   routines.  Griffin’s “beheading” photo plagiarizes an aesthetic popularized by the Islamic State, in which jihadis hold up photos of severed heads and smile into the camera, beaming with their trophies. Toddlers in terrorist training camps start off with dolls or teddy bears before graduating to human heads. The most aggressive jihadi teachers have their children holding up bloody heads before age 10. These children are taught that beheadings are proper punishment for kuffar (unbelievers) and Muslim traitors who do not adhere to the Islamic State’s version of Sunni Islam. Christians, Jews, Shiite Muslims, and anyone believed to have violated Sharia law, often on video as a threat to the rest of the world. The Islamic State has singled out President Donald Trump for such a fate, but most of its actual victims are not American. They are Syrian, Iraqi, Libyan, Jordanian, Afghan, Pakistani, Nigerian, Bengali, Filipino, and Kurdish of all nationalities  —   citizens of the countries where ISIS has established a presence. Whether Griffin meant to elicit laughs with her cultural appropriation of Islamic   beheading propaganda remains unclear. On Twitter Tuesday, she alleged she was attempting to “mock” Trump. What she clearly did not intend was to highlight the suffering of the victims of this sort of violence with any dignity, earning this episode a place in the greater narrative affirmed by the likes of Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer, and Tina Fey that the very real violence people of color face around the world is fertile ground for new material. Handler, for instance, has notched several offenses against Africans and black Americans under her belt. In a book and subsequent television special, titled Uganda Be Kidding Me, she jokes that she and a friend believed simply being in Africa would lead to her rape. The analysis of Uganda does not go much deeper than that  —   the modern history of the nation’s fight against the Lord’s Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, becomes a throwaway rape joke to sell to American audiences (no thanks to the American liberals who raised money off of his name, Uganda gave up its search for Kony in April despite the terrorist’s unknown whereabouts). During the promotional period for that special, Handler used slavery and rampant violence in eastern Africa to generate joke tweets insulting, among others, Angelina Jolie and Lupita N’yongo. While Handler has dismissed all criticism of her racial invective by claiming to be open to romantic relationships with black men, her tweets branded her a false liberal in the eyes of leftist outlets like Salon. Actors like Amy Schumer and Tina Fey have, in much more egregious fashion, rewritten the suffering of thousands as profitable comedies. In Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Fey took on the true story of journalist Kim Barker, on assigning in Afghanistan to cover the Taliban. Barker’s book The Taliban Shuffle, on which the film is based, is written with the suffering of the subjects in mind, while also acknowledging the dark humor of taking on as dangerous a job as a war correspondent in Pakistan and Afghanistan. As Barker herself notes in an interview, the film “Hollywoodizes” her story, adding a romantic side plot, and stripping it of the foreign policy depth her book provides (Barker says in the interview she was comfortable with this). As one review observes, the film rapidly gets glib: A joke about Afghan men thinking that Kim “would make a handsome boy. ” A joke about burqas. (Donning one for the first time, Kim exclaims, “It’s so pretty I don’t even want to vote! ”) A joke about the many challenges and ironies of a Western woman navigating a Muslim country. Another review identifies the film as outright racist, depending on “the buffoonery of Afghans” for many of its jokes. While Whiskey Tango Foxtrot at least boasted the endorsement of the book’s author and, one could argue, was an attempt at a heartfelt statement on the absurdities of war, Amy Schumer’s recent FARC parody Snatched clearly makes no attempt to identify with the hundreds of thousands of victims of South America’s most formidable terrorist organization, the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  —   guilty of innumerable kidnappings, rapes, forced abortions, and murders. In the film, Schumer convinces her worrywart mother, played by Goldie Hawn, to travel to Ecuador, where they are soon abducted by a guerrilla and whisked into the jungles of Colombia. Despite the liberal hero status Schumer brings to the film, critics pilloried it as racist, milking the outrageous stereotypes Colombians have been striving to shake off for the past 30 years for laughs. While Schumer did not write the film, her presence in it  —   as a comedian who has gone on the record calling Latin American men rapists  —   only exacerbates the outrage of mocking as delicate a situation as the 50+   FARC conflict. The timing of the film, in the middle of Colombian leftists imposing on their people a peace deal that will turn the FARC into the wealthiest political party in Latin America, didn’t help, either. In every one of these cases, the stars in question proceeded under the assumption that their status as feminist heroes would shield the American public from the racist opportunism present in their work. Though some leftists did condemn these works, showing ideological consistency, none of these women saw their profiles in Hollywood shrink because of their work. No mainstream director, studio, or artist has refused to work with them until they cease exploiting the suffering of   people to line their pockets. Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0
4583,Comment on This is the Man Militarized Police at Standing Rock are Working For by hawkmo99,"  Isaac Davis 
The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. 
But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? 
The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. 
So who is Kelcy Warren? 
A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nation’s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The company’s holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. 
Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warren’s personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as “among America’s new shale tycoons” — but rather than building a fortune by drilling he “takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it’s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.” [ Source ] 
Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . 
“According to the governor’s office, the state parks and wildlife commission “manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,” along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.” [ Source ] 
This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : 
Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren’s company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. 
With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlife… Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren.

4584,Video: Trump Explains The Syrian Conflict And Working With Russia,"Share on Facebook If you remember the Texas primaries, then you would surely remember that Donald Trump shook the world when he said that he was in favor of Libya, and his views on not killing Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein were/are the same. He went on, saying that if both of them had been alive right now, then the US would not have been involved in this mess, as both the leaders were killing terrorists. He further went on saying that he never supported what they were doing, but he further questioned the mess that the US has involved itself with. According to Donald Trump, it's better if the politicians take a day off, rather than go into a war. However, his views on the Syrian conflict do not differ. When asked about his views on President Assad and the US support, Trump simply explained that President Assad is not a good guy, but if we replace the man there, then who knows if the next one will be worse. He further commented that the money spent on the people there, to help them support the war, is outrageous. Donald Trump was invited into CBS for an interview over his views on the Syrian conflict and Russia's involvement. Take a look below at what he has to say. Related:",0

4586,She Was No Bird: ‘Jane Eyre’ Manuscript on First Trip to America - The New York Times,"THE dress  —   a      petal print with little round buttons up the bodice and a tight collar  —   is tiny, tailored for a woman 4 feet 9 inches tall. The wearer was Charlotte Brontë, and her demure day dress, just about big enough for a    girl, was the plain wrapping that encased an enormous talent, a bubbling blend of ambition, passion and literary genius. Like a disembodied spirit, the dress stands at the entrance to “Charlotte Brontë: An Independent Will,” which opens at the Morgan Library  Museum on Friday and runs through Jan. 2. Timed to the 200th anniversary of Brontë’s birth, the exhibition offers a compact, sensitively arranged and surprisingly comprehensive tour of the life and work of one of the Victorian era’s most beloved writers, an object of fascination from the moment that “Jane Eyre” was published under the pen name Currer Bell in 1847. The exhibition’s subtitle comes from the pivotal chapter in “Jane Eyre” in which the heroine, although deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, the master of the house where she is a governess, spurns his proposal that she live with him, in effect, as his mistress. He entreats her to stop struggling like a “wild frantic bird. ” She replies: “I am no bird and no net ensnares me. I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you. ” The passage  —   one of the sizzlers that made “Jane Eyre” an   in its time  —   may be read in the novel’s bound manuscript, on view for the first time in the United States, and opened to the relevant page. Christine Nelson, a Morgan curator, secured the loan from the British Library and, to complement the Morgan’s deep holdings of Brontë manuscripts, books and drawings, arranged to borrow other items from the National Portrait Gallery in London and the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, Yorkshire. The exhibition, tracing a fluid, chronological circle, begins by establishing the location. For nearly all her life, Charlotte lived in a modest parsonage in Haworth, northwest of the urban and industrial Bradford and Leeds, perched on the edge of a wild moor. In the hands of the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, whose enormously popular biography “The Life of Charlotte Brontë” appeared in 1857, two years after its subject’s death at the age of 38, the village, the house and its inhabitants took on a gothic character that haunted the public imagination. High on a windswept hill, wrapped in darkness and incessant rain, lived a family of creative geniuses, with three little Wednesday Addamses  —   Charlotte, Emily and Anne  —   afloat in a literary fantasy world. Two souvenir postcards in the exhibition ratify the general impression: a stern photograph of the parsonage, with gravestones in the foreground, and a truly frightening ambrotype showing the house as a blackened, solitary form with eerily glowing windows. It cries out for an exorcism. Haworth was actually a busy village with 11 grocery stores and six pubs, one of them a few steps from the parsonage. And the three sisters, along with their brother, Branwell, made this humble dwelling a factory of fun, despite the death of their mother and two older sisters. From an early age, the precocious siblings churned out fantasy fiction set in Glass Town, Angria and Gondal, magical imaginary lands populated by aristocrats, poets and lovers aflame. The current of romance ran strong in Haworth Parsonage, where Byron and Scott were gods. Along the walls devoted to “Imagination,” Chapter 2 in the exhibition’s story, the Brontë juvenilia unfolds, remarkable in both form and content. Charlotte mastered a nearly microscopic handwriting, with the appearance of printed fonts, to give her   publications the look of a finished book or magazine. The Young Men’s Magazine, a pretend journal in the style of Blackwood’s, measures an inch and a half by just over two inches, yet it contains a table of contents, articles and fake advertisements. Magnifying glasses have been provided, and they are needed. The print was small, but the ambition was titanic. Charlotte, bowing to the prejudices of the day, often presented herself as a kind of country mouse, nothing more than the daughter of a humble clergyman. It was, in large part, a pose. Ms. Nelson has come up with telling bits of counterevidence. Charlotte’s 1830 pencil portrait of Zenobia Marchioness Ellrington, one of her Glass Town characters, is accompanied by a pungent quote, reproduced on a wall of the exhibition. When Zenobia, a formidable intellect with similarities to her creator and to Jane Eyre, attracts the sniping criticism of a circle of males, the beguiling Marquess of Douro rises to her defense. “You are certainly jealous because a member of the feminine gender has displayed such wonderful abilities,” he begins, and goes on to praise a genius “likely to pale the ineffectual fires of her male contemporaries. ” The childhood world of fantasy takes a somber turn at the exhibition’s wailing wall. As the sisters entered their late teens, they faced painfully limited prospects as daughters of a humble clergyman. The world of work beckoned, and for single women of their class, that meant one of two professions, teacher or governess, neither of which they were suited to by talent or temperament. The saddest document in the exhibition is a prospectus that the sisters drew up advertising a school that they hoped to run: “the Misses Brontë’s establishment for the Board and Education of a limited number of young ladies. ” The number was very limited: zero. Just a few years before this low point, Branwell, an aspiring artist, painted a group portrait of the four siblings, one of the focal points of the exhibition. It is a strange visual document. At some point, Branwell painted over his likeness, leaving a whitish pillar between himself and his sisters, almost as though he had beamed himself out of the family, “Star Trek” style. In a sense, he did. His life ended, at 31, in a suicidal spiral of alcohol and opium addiction. Tuberculosis would claim Emily at 30, soon after “Wuthering Heights” appeared, and Anne at 29. For more than a   the portrait sat, folded in four and deeply creased, on top of a wardrobe in the home of Arthur Bell Nicholls, the curate at Haworth whom Charlotte married nine months before her death. It was discovered in 1916 by his second wife. It now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery and, like the British Library’s “Jane Eyre” manuscript, rarely leaves. “It was quite extraordinary to secure these,” Ms. Nelson said in an interview this week. “These are pilgrimage pieces. People come to the National Portrait Gallery seeking out that portrait in particular. ” Branwell lacked talent, sad to say, and his depiction of Charlotte gives little or no sense of what she looked like. The only other known portrait of her, by George Richmond, also on loan from the National Portrait Gallery, is a polite, decorous effort. Richmond was commissioned by Charlotte’s editor, George Smith, to produce a flattering image of his subject, and he obliged. Posterity has been left with a hopeless quest for an image to match the vividness of the literary personality. After the misery of servitude, the exhibition follows the path to glory, the years when Charlotte leapt immediately to the front rank of Victorian fiction with “Jane Eyre. ” She managed two more novels in her short lifetime, “Villette” and “Shirley,” which stand guard, along with her posthumously published early effort, “The Professor,” behind the “Jane Eyre” manuscript. The rest is history, of a peculiar sort. Admiration turned to worship within a few years after Charlotte died, three weeks before her 39th birthday and pregnant with her first child, her votive flame fanned into a blaze by Gaskell’s book. Readers of the life and the novels began making their way to Haworth, eager to see the famous moors and behold the parsonage. The exhibition includes an 1858 letter from Patrick Brontë, Charlotte’s father, with a   snippet cut from one of Charlotte’s letters, in response to an American admirer seeking a sample of Charlotte’s handwriting. The trickle of pilgrims  —   perhaps 200 a year in the 1860s  —   became a flood after the opening of the Brontë museum in a few rooms over the Yorkshire Penny Bank in 1895. Today, little Haworth attracts a million or so visitors a year, at least some of them headed for the Brontë Parsonage Museum, which opened in 1928, replacing the first museum. The fever still rages. At the parsonage museum, the exhibition “Charlotte Great and Small” runs through Jan. 1, and an exhibition in London at the National Portrait Gallery, “Celebrating Charlotte Brontë: ” ended its run last month. “To Walk Invisible,” a period drama about the Brontës written and directed by Sally Wainwright (“Happy Valley” and “Last Tango in Halifax”) is scheduled for broadcast on the BBC later this year. “Jane Eyre,” one if its early reviewers wrote, was a novel “to make the pulses gallop and heart beat. ” The same could be said for its author. And here is the evidence, undeniable and irresistible.",0
4587,"Catfished by a Catfish: 1 in 5 Seafood Samples Is Fake, Report Finds - The New York Times","Seafood lovers, are you getting “catfished” at the dinner table? It’s very possible. One in five seafood samples tested worldwide turns out to be completely different from what the menu or packaging says, according to a report on seafood fraud released Wednesday by the ocean conservation group Oceana. Of the more than 25, 000 seafood samples the group analyzed, 20 percent were incorrectly labeled. “It is likely that the average consumer has eaten mislabeled fish for sure,” said Beth Lowell, the senior campaign director for Oceana and an author of the paper. “You’re getting ripped off, while you enjoyed your meal you’re paying a high price for a low fish. ” The biggest impostor, fittingly, was farmed Asian catfish, a fish with white flesh that is easily disguised when it’s filleted and drenched in sauce. It was sold in place of 18 types of more expensive fish, including perch, cod and grouper. The report is a sort of   of more than 200 studies from 55 countries. One of those studies found that in Italy, 82 percent of the 200 perch, groupers and swordfish sampled were mislabeled. King mackerel, which is high in mercury, was sold as “barracuda” and “wahoo” in South Africa. In Hong Kong, only one out of 29 samples of “abalone” was correctly labeled. Two sushi chefs in Santa Monica in Southern California were charged with selling endangered whale meat as fatty tuna. Using the various studies, the researchers created an interactive map that shows where they found cases of phony fish. The studies include DNA analyses from   papers, newspaper investigations and about 10 of Oceana’s own studies. The report found examples of mislabeling at every level of the seafood supply chain, including the wholesaler, the importer and the retailer. “We kept thinking we’d find a success story, a place where seafood wouldn’t be mislabeled,” Ms. Lowell said. “Every single study that we reviewed except for one found seafood fraud. ” Even that case had a caveat Ms. Lowell said, because it took place in Tasmania where some mislabeling, like calling hake “smoked cod,” is allowed under Australian regulation. About 80 percent of the studies were conducted at grocery stores and restaurants. Because these locations are at the end of the supply chain, retailers tend to have higher instances of mislabeling. The report doesn’t name names. Ms. Lowell said the researchers were not sure whether the restaurants and food stores knowingly deceived their customers, or if they themselves were victims of a bait and switch when they purchased the fish. They found that 58 percent of the mislabeled samples were substituted for fish that could potentially pose health risks to certain consumers, especially pregnant women and children. In a New York grocery store they found blueline tilefish, which is on the Food and Drug Administration’s “Do Not Eat” list because of its high mercury, sold as “Alaskan halibut” and “red snapper. ” In some cases the substituted fish turned out to be an endangered species, such as in Brazil where “sharks” were actually meat from the largetooth sawfish, which is critically endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Ms. Lowell said that one way to combat seafood fraud in the United States is by implementing stricter regulations for   that extend throughout the supply chain. Gavin Gibbons, the spokesman for the National Fisheries Institute, a trade group that represents the seafood industry, criticized the report and stressed that its findings reflected only what the selected studies found and were not representative of all seafood sold globally. He added that the best fix for seafood fraud is more enforcement of the law rather than more bureaucratic regulations. “Oceana’s focus on the most often mislabeled species distorts their findings by design,” he said in an email. Ms. Lowell disagreed. With more than 25, 000 samples tested from around the world, she said it is the most comprehensive review of seafood fraud to date. “This report reveals that it’s a global problem,” she said, “and it’s not going to go away on its own. ”",0
4588,Paul: Will a GOP Congress Ever Balance the Budget? - Breitbart,"Two months after the election heard around the world, I’m worried that the more things have changed, the more they have stayed the same in Congress. [Voters swept the Republican Party into full control of the federal government, expecting us to honor our promises to put a stop to a reckless status quo that is mortgaging their futures.  So what’s the first order of business for Republicans in Congress? To pass a budget that doesn’t balance.  Ever. To pass a budget that will put our voters on the hook for $9. 7 trillion of new debt over ten years. Is that really what we campaigned on?  Is that why voters turned out to the polls? I know it’s not why Kentucky sent me to Congress.  The budget’s defenders tried to sell me on it as just a “vehicle to repeal Obamacare. ”  I’ve even been told that it’s “just numbers” and not really a budget.  The legislation’s own title clearly says otherwise.  The numbers “really” say it will add $9. 7 trillion of new debt. But if these are indeed only numbers on a page, and if what’s in the budget doesn’t actually matter, then why don’t we at least use numbers that balance?  Why don’t we put a vision into the budget that represents what we as Republicans claim to stand for? Republicans say we are the conservative party.  Are we?  During President George W. Bush’s eight years, and under a partially Republican Congress, the national debt doubled from $5 trillion to $10 trillion.  The response?  “Well, he had Democrats to deal with, and if we could ever take all three branches of government, things would be different. ” The debt has gone on to nearly double again under President Obama, and finally the conservative party  —   the supposedly conservative party  —   has won all three branches.  So what are we looking at?  More debt, with the same kind of numbers we rightfully railed against during the Obama years! Congress has special rules for passing a budget that we can use to repeal Obamacare.  I’m all for that approach, as long as that budget moves us toward fiscal responsibility.  As a physician, you won’t find anyone more excited to get rid of Obamacare than me.  But are we so hurried that we can’t even be bothered to vote on a budget that represents our conservative view and doesn’t add $9. 7 trillion to the debt? This is outrageous, and it is unacceptable.  And I’m fighting back. We don’t need to choose between either repealing Obamacare or putting forward a budget that balances.  We can do both  —   without a single Democrat vote!  We have no excuse.  On Monday, the Senate will go on record on an amendment I am offering that will strike and replace the current budget resolution.  My alternative presents a conservative vision by freezing   spending and balancing by 2024  —   without changing Social Security.  And it still repeals Obamacare! It even starts in 2018 so as to allow agencies plenty of time to adjust to new spending levels.  By containing zero specific cuts to any function of government, it also offers Congress and the administration a chance to work together to prioritize spending. Is there really a difference between how a Republican and a Democrat Congress act?  We’ll soon find out.  But I need your help.  I need your senator and representative to hear from you with a clear message that says, “Enough is enough. ” Let’s balance the budget and repeal Obamacare.  Let’s do both now, and let’s honor our commitment to be the change voters called for in November.",0
4589,What Options Does the U.S. Have After Accusing Russia of Hacks? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Now that the White House has formally accused Russia of meddling in the presidential election with   cyberattacks and   information warfare, devising a response might seem fairly easy: unleash the government’s cyberwarriors to give the Kremlin a dose of its own malware. Technologically, that would not be too difficult, American officials say. But as a matter of strategy and politics, formulating the right kind of counterstrike is not that straightforward. President Obama’s options range from the mild  —   naming and shaming the Russians, as he did on Friday  —   to the more severe, like invoking for the first time a series of economic sanctions that he created by executive order after North Korea’s attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The Justice Department could indict the Russians behind the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the email accounts of prominent individuals, as it did with members of China’s People’s Liberation Army, who have been charged with stealing industrial secrets. Or Mr. Obama could sign a secret intelligence finding  —   similar to many he has issued to authorize Central Intelligence Agency efforts in Syria or drone strikes against the Islamic State  —   to attack and disable Russian computer servers or expose the financial dealings of President Vladimir V. Putin and his oligarch friends. While the last option is tempting, officials say, it would carry risks with the election just a month away. Attacks on online voter registration rolls could sow chaos at polling places, and the election infrastructure has never truly been tested against a power like Russia. The system that underpins American democracy is not even listed as an element of the nation’s critical infrastructure, a list that includes movie theaters and the Jefferson Memorial, among other monuments. Just as Henry Kissinger and other American strategists argued decades ago whether it was possible to wage a limited nuclear war, officials at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, as well as outside experts, have been debating whether it is possible to control the escalation of a cyberconflict. In the nuclear era, seven decades passed with no answer, despite some close calls. Online, where the damage is less lethal but cheap, and attacks are hard to trace and easy to carry out, Mr. Obama and other top officials are proceeding cautiously.   cyberpowers face few limits to their ability to escalate attacks. And it is unclear how the United States can establish what the generals call “escalation dominance”  —   the assurance that America can ultimately control how a conflict ends. Michael J. Morell, a former deputy director of the C. I. A. and a veteran of many debates on the growing cyberweapon arsenal in the Bush and Obama administrations, said on Saturday that the American response had to strike at something that Mr. Putin held dear. But, he added, unleashing a counterattack may not be the answer. “Our response needs to be proportionate to the attack,” said Mr. Morell, who now advises Hillary Clinton on national security matters and is widely believed to be in line for a top intelligence post if she is elected president. Criminal indictments and sanctions against individuals “are only a slap on the wrist,” he said, adding that “offensive cyberactions can’t be seen and are inconsistent with the norms we want to set in the world on cyber. ” Mr. Morell advocated two approaches: deep sanctions on the entire Russian economy and an “aggressive Voice of America program in Russian to tell the Russian people that Putin is only interested in his own aggrandizement” and is threatening the only hope for the country’s economy: integration with the West. But the challenges, as Mr. Morell acknowledges, are clear. Europe is unlikely to go along with sanctions if that means cutting off their access to the Russian gas that keeps them warm. And Voice of America programs, a relic of the Cold War, are slow to work, if they can work at all in the internet age. At its core, the problem that the Obama administration faces is this: What the Russians have done in hacking into American political institutions  —   and perhaps accessing voter registration rolls  —   is a digital form of hybrid warfare. In Ukraine, this took the form of Russian soldiers engaging in quiet guerrilla actions out of uniform to undermine the government. (Russia also turned off the electric grid in part of Ukraine last December, mostly to show that they could.) Leaking emails and phone conversations, and generally stirring chaos around elections, have been a   Russian art form in Europe, especially in former Soviet states. Such actions walk the line between harassment and      conflict. Now, they have come to American shores. That, at least, was the assessment of the director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security on Friday, though they did not show their evidence. “We believed, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s   officials could have authorized these activities,” the statement said. In background conversations, officials strongly hinted that the evidence had come, in part, from data collected by the National Security Agency’s implants in foreign computer networks, presumably including Russia’s. The question, said James Lewis, a former government official who specializes in cybersecurity, espionage and warfare at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, is how to deter future attacks while maintaining escalation dominance. “We don’t necessarily want to start a war with Russia,” he said. Mr. Lewis said he doubted that using intelligence findings to embarrass Mr. Putin  —   leaking details of his financial dealings, his personal life or his relationships with the moneyed elite who help keep him in power  —   would be the solution. “If we couldn’t deter Moscow from going into the Ukraine, we’re not going to deter them from hacking us,” Mr. Lewis said. For a declining power like Russia, whose economy has been battered by falling oil prices and economic sanctions, cyberattacks are an easy answer. They usually happen below the radar. And for the past two years, Russian hackers operating at the behest of, or directly for, the state have had a string of successes against foreign targets, even testing the limits of the American doctrine that destructive hacking attacks could be considered acts of war. Russian hackers were identified by German intelligence officials as the culprits behind a cyberattack that damaged a blast furnace owned by ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s biggest steel maker. Forensics experts discovered malware in the plant’s system that had previously been tied to a   Russian espionage group. That same group was later found to be responsible for a cyberattack on a major French television network, TV5Monde, last year that brought down the station for several days and cost tens of millions of dollars in repairs. And the Russian group, known in the cybersecurity community as APT28 or Fancy Bear, was responsible for a string of cyberattacks on the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Obama decided not to name the Russians in those attacks. “The Russians have had a string of unbroken successes against U. S. targets, and they haven’t paid much of a price,” Mr. Lewis said. That may have created an impression in the Kremlin that cyberattacks would carry no consequences. The deeper concern is that Russia, like other major powers, has a long playbook ready for potential future attacks. Security experts point to evidence that a   Russian hacking group, known as Energetic Bear, has been probing the networks of power grid operators and energy and oil companies in the United States, Europe and Canada. That could be exploration  —   or it could be preparation of the battle space in the event of a future conflict. This summer, hackers calling themselves the Shadow Brokers released a trove of N. S. A. tools that the agency had used to break into and spy on foreign networks. Though it is not yet clear who was behind the attack, some speculated that an N. S. A. insider had leaked the trove, while others said it may have been Russian   hackers putting the United States on notice. Mr. Obama seems likely to invoke some kind of financial sanctions under the new executive order, which allows the Treasury secretary to freeze the financial assets of individuals tied to hacking attacks or prevent them from conducting financial transactions. The White House considered applying the sanctions against the Chinese companies and individuals involved in the hacking of the Office of Personnel Management last year, but ultimately decided against it after China pledged that it would not conduct economic espionage against the United States and arrested several individuals. But a similar deal with Russia seems hard to imagine. “How can we choose not to use the sanctions?” Mr. Lewis said. “The question is if we name and punish these guys, will Russians take the hint? My sense is no. ”",0
4590,9 in 10 Gang Rapists In Sweden Have Foreign Origins,"A new report suggests that in cases of gang rape or sexual assaults involving two or more attackers in Sweden, 85 percent of the attackers come from a foreign origin. [The information comes from a Swedish website “Gang Rape Sweden” which has kept tabs on the various instances of group rape that have occurred in the country over a period from 2011 to 2015. The site lists the various rapists’ names, case numbers, and other details which show the national origins, if known, of the attackers. According to the site, “All records and documents available on this website are Swedish public records. ”  The site claims that in total between 2011 and 2015 there were 125 individuals accused and convicted of participating in group sex attacks. The majority, 41, come from unknown countries outside of Sweden, and they are followed by 23 from Afghanistan and 20 from Sweden itself. The total number of   amounts to 105 or around 85 percent. The site makes a distinction of those accused of true gang rape (participating in sex acts) and those tried along with a rapist for other crimes like failure to disclose the sex attack. Of the “true gang rapes,” they measure 50 such cases. Details are also given on the site as to the nature of the accusations, with thirteen of the gang rapists accused of having sex with underage children. Among those accused of molesting minors, none of the suspects are Swedish. The longest sentence for rape occurred in the case of Bardiya Coen Pajouhi, who comes from an unknown country and received a   sentence for aggravated rape, though it says he will not be deported to his country of origin. Among those convicted of raping a child, many of the attackers were underage themselves, which matches previous reports of young boys and girls being raped in or around asylum accommodations. In one particular attack, a group of boys from Afghanistan took another young asylum seeker into a wooded area in Uppsala where they beat and raped him, filming the attack on their mobile phones. The Afghani migrants who raped the boy, who is said to have been under the age of 15, were tried and found guilty, but will not be deported back to Afghanistan because Swedish courts have deemed the country “too dangerous” for them to return to. In the statistics provided by the site, only 30 of those convicted face deportation, as opposed to 73 who will not be sent back to their countries of origin, more than double. The Swedish government refuses to keep official statistics that track the origin of criminals and have not done so in over a decade.

4591,MSNBC Anchor Asks If Trump Trying To Provoke A Domestic Terror Attack ’For His Own Gain’ - Breitbart,"Sunday, MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts asked twice if President Donald Trump is trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack in order to “prove himself right” about Islamic terrorism.  In separate interviews, Roberts asked if Trump’s tweets had the nefarious motive, first with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and then with former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Trump’s tweet about Saturday’s terror attacks in London read, “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse. ” Roberts asked Reed, “The president doesn’t want us to be politically correct, right? So let’s not be PC about this. Is the president trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this Twitter rant, because, only to prove himself right?” Roberts later repeated the inquiry to Dean, “I asked this of Mayor Reed, but it seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in America. Do you feel that way?” Dean answered,”I just think he’s  —   well, I think he’s totally incompetent. ” (  Daily Caller) Follow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN ",0
4593,How the Push to Advance Bathroom Rights for Transgender Americans Reached the White House - The New York Times,"The people of Palatine, Ill. a   suburb of Chicago marked by generic strip malls and tidy    had not spent much time debating the thorny questions of transgender rights. But in late 2013, a transgender high school athlete, so intent on defending her privacy that she is known only as Student A, took on her school district so she could use the girls’ locker room. After the federal Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights ruled in her favor last fall, the two sides cut a deal: Student A could use the locker room and the school would install private changing areas. Some in the community denounced the arrangement others joined the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, which represented the girl, in declaring a victory for civil rights. Now the whole nation is in a pitched battle over bathroom access, with the Obama administration ordering all public schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. Across the country, religious conservatives are rebelling. On Friday, lawmakers in Oklahoma became the latest group to protest, proposing one measure to effectively overturn the order, and another calling for President Obama to be impeached over it. How a clash over bathrooms, an issue that appeared atop no national polls, became the next frontier in America’s   culture wars  —   and ultimately landed on the desk of the president  —   involves an array of players, some with law degrees, others still in high school. The sweeping directive to public schools seemed to come out of nowhere. In fact, it was the product of years of study inside the government and a highly orchestrated campaign by advocates for gay and transgender people. Mindful of the role “Whites Only’’ bathrooms played in the civil rights battles of more than half a century ago, they have been maneuvering behind the scenes to press federal agencies, and ultimately Mr. Obama, to address a question that has roiled many school districts: Should those with differing anatomies share the same bathrooms? The lobbying came to a head, according to people who were involved, in a hastily called April 1 meeting between top White House officials  —   led by Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama’s senior adviser and one of his closest confidantes  —   and national leaders of the gay and transgender rights movement. North Carolina had just become the first state to explicitly bar transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice. “Transgender students are under attack in this country,” said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a   advocacy group that is active on the issue, summing up the message he sought to convey to Ms. Jarrett that day. “They need their federal government to stand up for them. ” Ms. Jarrett and her team, he said, listened politely, but “did not reveal much,” including the fact that a legal directive on transgender rights that had been in the works for months was about to be released. When  —   or precisely how  —   Mr. Obama personally weighed in is not clear the White House would not provide specifics. But two days before that meeting, scores of advocacy groups sent Mr. Obama a private letter, appealing to his sense of history as he nears the end of his presidency, in which he has already advanced gay and transgender rights on multiple fronts. “Too many students  —   including every single transgender, intersex, and   student in North Carolina  —   will go to sleep tonight dreading the next school day,” the groups wrote, telling him that “your legacy will be defined by the tone you have set and the personal leadership you have shown on these issues. ” The dispute in Palatine came amid increasing confusion for school districts over how to handle questions about bathroom access for transgender students. Officials at the Department of Education said it had received hundreds of requests for guidance  —   so many that advocates for gay and transgender rights, frustrated by the Obama administration’s failure to issue specific policy guidelines, decided to act on their own. In August, several groups seeking protection for transgender people  —   including the Human Rights Campaign, the National Education Association and the National Center for Lesbian Rights  —   issued a   guide for schools, hoping to provide a blueprint for the White House. At the Department of Education, Catherine E. Lhamon, 44, a former civil rights litigator who runs the agency’s Office of Civil Rights  —   and has made aggressive use of a federal nondiscrimination law known as Title IX  —   was taking the lead. The department’s ruling in favor of Student A in November was the first time it had found any school district in violation of civil rights over transgender issues. For Student A, the federal intervention has been life changing. Her mother, who requested anonymity to protect the privacy of her daughter, said she was close to finishing her junior year and had just gone to the prom with a group of friends. (She wore a “nice, expensive dress” with a lot of sparkles, her mother said.) Student A is starting to think about which college she might attend. “She’s in her own teenaged world right now,” her mother said. The ruling in Palatine reverberated across the Midwest. In the South Dakota Legislature, Republicans were so alarmed by the situation in Palatine that, in February, they passed a measure restricting bathroom access for transgender students  —   similar to the one that later became law in North Carolina. Opponents sent transgender South Dakotans to meet with Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, and they believe that influenced his veto of the bill. Among the visitors was Kendra Heathscott, who was 10 when she first met Mr. Daugaard, then the executive director of a social services organization that treats children with behavioral problems. In his office to lobby against the bathroom measure, she reintroduced herself. “He remembered me as a little boy,” she said. In Wisconsin last year, another   bathroom bill began to work its way through the Legislature, but was beaten back by transgender rights activists, many of them teenagers. In rural   Florida, a retired veterinarian and cattle rancher named Harrell Phillips was alarmed one evening in March, when his    son reported over dinner that he had encountered a transgender boy in the high school bathroom. “I marched myself down to the principal,” said Dr. Phillips, who believes that “you are born into a sex that God chose you to be. ” The principal, and later the school superintendent, citing advice from lawyers, said there was nothing they could do. So Dr. Phillips turned to his best friend, a lawyer in Jacksonville, who introduced him to Roger Gannam of Liberty Counsel, an   Christian organization. Mr. Gannam represented Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk jailed for refusing to issue   marriage licenses last year. Mr. Gannam had just helped block a proposed   ordinance in Jacksonville, with an argument religious conservatives have been lately using to powerful effect: It would endanger women and young girls by allowing men  —   and even sexual predators  —   to pose as transgender and enter women’s bathrooms. Ocala, where Dr. Phillips’s son attends school, is now embroiled in a fight much like the one that engulfed Palatine. The school board, at Mr. Gannam’s prodding, voted in April to require transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their biological sex. One transgender young man there has been suspended for using the boys’ bathroom. The A. C. L. U. of Florida sued the day before the White House issued its directive, and last Sunday night, transgender activists and their allies held a strategy session in a church  —   with a sheriff’s deputy standing guard outside because attendees feared for their safety. “It’s separate but equal, so they might as well put black and white up on the bathrooms, too,” said Beth Miller, the mother of    Mathew Myers, formerly Madison, an R. O. T. C. student in Ocala who came out as transgender this fall by asking his sergeant to permit him to switch from a women’s uniform to one for men. The sergeant accommodated Mathew on the uniform, but the school required him to use the   bathroom in the nurse’s office. “I go to the guy’s bathroom all the time out in public, and no one cares,” Mathew said. Dr. Phillips, who like many Americans was not focused on the issue until recently, vows to take his fight to the Supreme Court. He believes that Mr. Obama “should be impeached” and is furious at “the liberal left trying to push this down our throats. ” Though North Carolina was the first state to adopt a law explicitly barring all transgender people from using public facilities of their choice, many say the current debate has its roots in Houston. In November 2015, voters there repealed the city’s   measure, after a campaign in which the law’s opponents boiled their message down to a   slogan. It appeared on yard signs,   banners, and ominous ads on TV, radio and the Internet: “No Men in Women’s Bathrooms. ” More than 200 cities across the United States had adopted similar   laws by the time Houston went to the polls Minneapolis expanded civil rights protections to transgender people back in 1975. But in Houston, the vote took place less than five months after the Supreme Court victory for   marriage. Social conservatives were energized. Religious conservatives say that broad civil rights protections for transgender people are unnecessary  —   a solution to a problem that, they argue, does not exist. Jeremy Tedesco, the lead counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, an   conservative advocacy group, argues that ‘‘when it comes to locker rooms and restrooms, separating the sexes is a matter of common decency. ” The repeal of the Houston ordinance rattled national gay rights leaders. “I think they have now created a campaign in a box that we are going to see shipped from city to city and state to state,” Mr. Griffin, of the Human Rights Campaign, said in an interview at the time. Mr. Griffin was correct Alliance Defending Freedom has a website, www. safebathrooms. org, that went live two weeks ago, and its video has been viewed more than 300, 000 times. But the Human Rights Campaign and its allies have a playbook of their own, one patterned after their strategy for marriage equality, in which they fought the battle for acceptance state by state. After the defeat in Houston, their next targets were Jacksonville, Fla. and Charlotte, N. C.  —   Southern cities where the advocates worked aggressively to elect politicians who would push the cause of gay and transgender rights. In Charlotte, an   ordinance failed in February 2015 after that, the Human Rights Campaign and other gay rights leaders poured money into a new organization  —   Turnout Charlotte. The goal was “to identify and support and ask candidates, ‘Where are you on this issue?’ ’’ said LaWana Mayfield, an openly gay City Council member. With heavy backing from the activists, three new council members were elected last fall, tilting the balance on the council, which passed the   ordinance in February. Religious conservatives, who had adopted the “No Men in Women’s Bathrooms’’ message from Houston, were taken aback. “It’s outrageous to have a big Washington, D. C.  organization come into the state to influence the public policy of a major city,” said Tami Fitzgerald, the executive director of the North Carolina Values Coalition, an advocacy group. Republicans in the legislature responded with the   bathroom bill, which Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law on March 23. Nine days later, the advocates had their audience with Ms. Jarrett. The North Carolina law, they argued behind closed doors, had created an untenable conflict. “The schools were put in this weird situation by Governor McCrory,” said Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, who was at the meeting. “And it just sped this whole thing up. ”",0
4594,Erica Garner SLAMS Hillary- ‘Don’t Use My Dead Dad To Push Your Gun Control Agenda!’,"0 comments 
Wait! Using the death of Eric Garner to push “Gun Control”? 
Hillary….THERE WERE NO GUNS INVOLVED! For some reason, the Hillary Camp does not know the difference. They just know Police are involved, and BlackLivesMatter hate police so they want to use it to push…. their agenda against gun. 
Even though…it makes ZERO sense. 
WikiLeaks has just released a batch of evidence that Eric Garner’s daughter has read through…and good thing she did. Her own NAME is in it! Which got her furious… 
So she’s speaking out… 
Erica Garner has become one of the more vocal #BlackLivesMatter activists after her father died while resisting arrest. Yes, we all have opinions about BLM, but that’s not this post. Okay? Okay. 
This post is about how shameless leftists like the Clinton Campaign used a man’s death for their own means, to push their own agenda. No, of course you’re not surprised an entity like the Clinton campaign would use anyone for any reason whatsoever. Par for the course. What’s different is how Erica has responded. Let’s just say she’s none too pleased. 
Side note reminder: Eric Garner, her father, wasn’t even shot. No guns. 
So what got Erica justifiably peeved are some recent Wikileaks, which revealed the backdoor dealings of how the Clinton Campaign discussed Garner’s case. Like how it could be used to further the anti-cop and anti-gun agendas. 
Garner first tweeted a link to leaked emails that appear to show internal discussions from the Clinton campaign about whether to mention her father’s name in op-ed piece that Clinton was writing for the New York Daily News. 
“Finally, I know we have Erica Garner issues but we don’t want to mention Eric at all? I can see her coming after us for leaving him out of the piece,” Clinton campaign aide Nick Merrill wrote. 
Erica Garner was not, shall we say, amused. These people will co opt anything to push their agenda. Police violence is not the same as gun violence. 
— officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 I'm vey interested to know exactly what @CoreyCiorciari meant when he said "" I know we have an Erica Garner problem"" in the #PodestaEmails19 
— officialERICA GARNER (@es_snipes) October 27, 2016 https://t.co/jzfUl0FbXF In this #PodestaEmails leak @CoreyCiorciari n @NickMerrill plot to use police violence victims to push gun control 
Keep reading… 
Just like the scandalous bunch of crooks in the Clinton camp to abuse their power and twist the truth to get what they want… more power! Greed is never satisfied, and that’s going to be a HUGE problem if Hillary gets into the White House.

4596,Race and Economic Disparity in North Carolina,"Photo by -ted | CC BY 2.0 
While the recent police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has led to increased scrutiny on police activities in North Carolina, police-community relations are not the only reason racial tensions are flaring. While encounters with police officers can radically differ depending on the race of those involved, access to economic resources tend to follow a similar pattern. Although racial gaps regarding wealth, incomes, and healthcare are nationwide issues, observing them from a statewide perspective can help understand why specific communities feel maltreated. 
A UNC Chapel Hill study found that the income and wealth disparities between African Americans and whites in North Carolina are far worse than the national average. It states that: 
…black households, at the median, claim only about 13 percent of the wealth and, stunningly, about 4 percent of the net worth of white households. The corresponding figures for the nation are bleak: 15 and 13 percent respectively. Median wealth for white households is roughly seven times that of black households…Nationally, black households have about half the home equity of whites. In North Carolina, it’s about a third. 
The study goes on to state that half of all black households in North Carolina have under $100 in savings. At the median, black heads of household aged between 50 and 65 own $17,000 in assets compared to white households’ median of $143,000, which seriously hampers older, black workers from retiring comfortably. This data paints a picture of a state that fails to allow black communities from advancing economically and obtaining some semblance of equality. 
The issue is further exasperated by lack of access to health insurance. A North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services study found that 13% of North Carolina whites have no health insurance as compared to 22% of blacks. 16% of whites were reported to be in “fair or poor” health as compared to 23.2% of blacks. The Kaiser Family Foundation research shows that the majority of non-elderly uninsured North Carolinians were minorities: 30% Hispanic and 14% black, while 10% were white. This is especially concerning considering minorities experience disease at a higher rate than American whites, and visit the doctor at much lower rates. The result: communities most in need of medical assistance are least likely to attain it. 
This imbalance is in part due to the state government’s failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something which would have significantly reduced the coverage gap between those receiving Medicaid and those obtaining income-based subsidies. The North Carolina Justice Center finds that, had the expansion gone through, 500,000 low-income North Carolinians would have health insurance who currently don’t have it, and over 1,000 unnecessary deaths would have been prevented. 
While the protests in Charlotte appeared to be a backlash against apparent police brutality, underlying economic factors also come into play. A breaking point will eventually be reached by those living in undesirable economic situations which they view as consequential of a racist and unfair system. 
The case of North Carolina is a particularly negative one, but the principles outlined in this research are not unique to North Carolina. Americans cannot expect race relations to cool until access to income, wealth, and healthcare are equalized and structured in a fair, equitable manner. More articles by: Patrick Carr next -",0
4597,Most Top Retailers Sell Food Produced With Bee-Killing Pesticides,"Most Top Retailers Sell Food Produced With Bee-Killing Pesticides Only Aldi, Costco, and Whole Foods got passing grades Julie Fidler | Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
A new ‘scorecard’ report gives a failing grade to 17 out of 20 major food retailers in the United States, based on their policies and practices regarding pollinator protection, organic options, and pesticide reduction. [1] Source: Friends of the Earth 
Tiffany Finck-Haynes, food futures campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: 
“U.S. food retailers must take responsibility for how the products they sell are contributing to the bee crisis. 
The majority of the food sold at top U.S. food retailers is produced with pollinator-toxic pesticides. We urge all major retailers to work with their suppliers to eliminate pollinator-toxic pesticides and to expand domestic organic offerings that protect pollinators, people and the planet.” [1] Organic Offerings And Transparency Are Lacking 
The report “Swarming the Aisles: Rating Top Retailers on Bee-Friendly and Organic Food” is the work of a coalition led by Friends of the Earth and more than 50 farmer, beekeeper, farmworker, environmental, and public interest organizations. [1] 
The coalition sent a letter urging food retailers to eliminate pesticides that are toxic to bees and other pollinators , and increase U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) certified organic food and beverages to 15% of overall offerings by 2025. The group would like to see retailers prioritize domestic, regional, and local p­roducers. 
Friends of the Earth and its allies have been successful in the past at convincing more than 65 garden retailers, including Lowe’s and Home Depot, to commit to eliminate pollinator-toxic neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides. 
According to Haynes, the demand for organic foods has grown by double-digits , but grocers aren’t keeping up. She said: 
“A lot of the major food retailers have started to increase their organic offerings, but few of them have really adopted clear goals or metrics to continue to significantly increase their organic food offerings in the future.” [2] 
As evidenced by the group’s research, it’s difficult for the public to know where retailers stand concerning pesticide use and organic food. Eleven of the 20 retailers’ websites examined by Friends of the Earth don’t provide basic information concerning their policies on organic food, pollinators, and/or pesticides , Haynes said, adding: 
“There’s a lot that retailers could do by adopting creative programs with their supply chain to help farmers grow their organic offerings, and then be able to sell that in their stores.” Americans Are Ready For Change 
A YouGov poll released 25 October 2016 by Friends of the Earth and SumOfUs reveals that 80% of Americans believe neonics should not be used in agriculture , and 65% of those who do the grocery shopping for their household would be more likely to shop at a store that has made a formal commitment to eliminate neonicotinoids. [1] 
Additionally, the poll shows that 59% of respondents believe it’s important for supermarkets to sell organic food. Another 43% said they’d likely spend more time at a different grocery store if it sold more organic food than the store they currently frequent. 
Said Angus Wong, lead campaign strategist at SumOfUs, a consumer watchdog with ten million members: 
“Over 750,000 SumOfUs members have spoken out advocating that U.S. Hardware stores take action to protect our pollinators. And after years of pressure, Home Depot and Lowe’s have finally enacted more bee-friendly policies. 
And the findings of this poll show that a vast majority of consumers want to eliminate neonicotinoids from their grocery stores too. This is why food retailers must commit policies that protect our bees immediately.” 
Only four of the nation’s top food retailers – Albertsons, Costco, Target, and Whole Foods – have adopted and made public a company-wide commitment to increase offerings of certified organic food . They are also the only retailers to disclose data on the current percentage of organic food they offer, or organic sales. 
Aldi, Food Lion, part of the Delhaize Group, and Kroger disclosed data on the current percentage of organic offerings or organic sales. 
None of the retailers that the group looked at have publicly committed to sourcing organic food from American farmers . Retailer Apathy Is Killing Pollinators 
Of the top 20 food retailers surveyed by Friends of the Earth, a shocking 16 were predominantly unresponsive to Friends of the Earth’s requests for information via surveys, calls, and letters. The group was forced to turn to publicly available information, including company websites, company annual reports, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reports, press coverage, and industry analyses, for their data. 
We have bees to thank for every 1 in 3 bites of food we take ; and without bees, stores would run low on everything from strawberries to almonds. Source: Bee Cause 
Science increasingly points to neonicotinoid pesticides as a leading cause of pollinator decline. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s blockbuster herbicide, Roundup, has been shown to play a significant role in monarch butterfly declines . 
Several U.S. cities have banned neonics, including Boulder City, Colorado , and Portland, Oregon . This past spring, Maryland became the first state to ban the pesticides .

4598,"‘Girls’ Finale: Is It Just Us, or Did the Show Get Better? - The New York Times","HBO aired the final two episodes of the fifth season of “Girls” on Sunday, which found Hannah (Lena Dunham) bonding with her college classmate and frenemy Tally (Jenny Slate) Marnie (Allison Williams) trying to understand her romantic impulses toward Ray (Alex Karpovsky) Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) embracing her role as a marketer, and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) and Adam (Adam Driver) trying to make sense of their budding relationship. Amanda Hess, a staff writer, Margaret Lyons, the TV critic for Watching (the Times newsletter) and Jenna Wortham, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine, discuss the entire season, and where the show might be headed in its sixth and final season. This conversation contains spoilers. JENNA WORTHAM I haven’t cried this much watching television since rewatching the second season of “Grey’s Anatomy. ” Even Hannah Horvath, who at one point felt like a monstrous caricature of a millennial, has been cracking me up this season. And the look on her face when she realized Adam and Jessa were together   …     whew. Everyone is growing in a way that feels so painful, and honest and real. “Girls” has suffered a little as it’s become less of a unicorn. In the last few years, there are so many new and interesting television shows and story lines about women (and by them and for them) on television, so the show hasn’t been as special or as singular since its debut in 2012. But having a little breathing room has gone a long way. I started watching this season when a few friends mentioned how good it’s gotten and I agree: The writing is stronger than ever, and episodes, especially the ones directed by Jesse Peretz, have beautifully poignant arcs. I’m so glad this isn’t the final season, that we get a few more episodes before the  . How did the show get so good? What do we think changed since last season? [ You don’t like the girls in “Girls”? That’s its genius. ] MARGARET LYONS: I liked last season! I liked this season, too, though I’m in the minority because I absolutely hated “The Panic in Central Park,” where Charlie   and turns out to be a heroin addict. And I did not love “Homeward Bound,” last week’s episode where Hannah dumps Fran, jumps on Ray, and eventually hitchhikes back to New York. But I wanted “Hello Kitty,” the Kitty Genovese episode, to last for nine hours I was riveted, and the closing moments, when Hannah realizes that Jessa and Adam are together, just knocked me out. I would have called it the best acting moment of the “Girls” season, but Elijah’s slow crumple as he realizes his    Dill is rejecting him might best it. JW: Margaret, that scene with Elijah walking toward the window in Dill’s apartment, with the glittery New York scape spilling out below, right as “iT” by Christine and the Queens swells behind him  —   it slayed me. It was absolutely devastating, a sign of how much the show is pushing its characters to confront their desires  —   and ask themselves if the shiniest things are necessarily the best things. It wrenched my heart right open  —   and showed off Lena Dunham’s creation at its best. This season also really brought home how good “Girls” is at capturing the spirit of New York, and its power to transform everyone that lives here. It is so good at filling that “Sex and The City” shaped hole in my heart. AMANDA HESS: I’m feeling it, you guys. As the series had marched on, something had become unbelievable about this foursome staying glued together as a friend unit. They aligned in college or just after, but many of these relationships tend to unstick by the time women reach 30. Unlike “Sex and the City”  —   where the regular brunch date served as a kind of otherworldly purgatory for staging boozy debates about feminism and sex  —   “Girls” is not timeless. These girls change. And so it was satisfying to see them head off on their own this season  —   Shoshanna in Japan, Hannah at her mom’s     retreat, Marnie on her   lark with Charlie, even Jessa kicking around with Adam on Coney Island. And to see them hang out with new girls, too! Watching Tally and Abigail, played by Jenny Slate and Aidy Bryant, step in as emergency contacts for Hannah and Shosh was a highlight of the show for me. Also, finally giving honorary girl Elijah the romantic subplot he deserves. JW: Was it just me or does Shoshanna in Japan feel a little like when Don Draper went to California? Similar Draper dream vibes when Marnie put on the red dress  …    . AH: Japan has been working double time this year as the   destination for white indie girls who need a life change. In “Master of None,” Dev’s girlfriend Rachel torpedoes their relationship by announcing her exit to Tokyo. (She even dyes her hair, too! ). But there was something really appropriate about seeing Shosh in Harajuku, a place that in all of its aesthetics, so perfectly reflects Shoshanna’s intense, girlie drive. I agree with her   Abigail: I’d watch the Shosh and Yoshi show any day of the week. JW: Yes, we seriously need a Yoshanna spin off. Side note  —     Dunham’s   as a salty coffee barista have been so great.  ML: “Girls” really benefited from the change of scene. (I’d loop Hannah’s time in Iowa in with that, too.) I’ve never been a big Shosh person, but seeing her bob around in Tokyo gave her new context: What would Shosh be like if being “the weird one” wasn’t what defined her? She’d be more confident, maybe, and more grounded. The big question of this season, posed to each character in a different way, was: How do you know you are growing up? For Shosh, that answer was professional success her little victory dance with Colin Quinn at Ray’s coffee bar was as happy as we’ve ever seen her. For Marnie, her answer was getting married. She turned out to be wrong of course marriage is almost always a bad answer, but that doesn’t mean people don’t think it’s the answer. I think her ultimate   move might be getting divorced. For Jessa, it’s being in a real  —   and sober  —   relationship. (I wish we saw more of her schooling I bet she’s an interesting classmate.) For Elijah, it’s being vulnerable. For Hannah’s dad, Tad, it’s being out. Out out. For her mom, Loreen, maybe it’s being on her own after all. So what is it for Hannah? I think she declared it for herself in her story for the Moth. It’s being free, even just for a little bit. Free of her own bad behavior: Not flashing anyone, not sneaking off to have sex at the spa, not throwing herself at  —   or on  —   Ray, not scolding her parents. Just chill. For 10 minutes. Whether any of these characters actually wants to grow up is a different story  …     AH: But Hannah’s behavior was so bad this season, it kind of felt like she was going to end up in a jail cell, or else in the neurologist’s office: You have 10 episodes to live. The “Basic Instinct” flash, the lesbian gymnastics, the Ray   …     thing  —   it all went beyond the edge of delicious discomfort for me, to the point where I had to fight the urge to   through her scenes. (Desi’s dopey yet magnetic narcissist was more my speed  —   Ebon   is so good at dancing right on the edge of comedy and tragedy.) The Moth bit was a   refresher that Hannah can actually be quite charming in those precious moments when she chooses to reflect. And the ending, where we freeze on her leaping to action, felt like such a psychic correction from the Season 2 finale, when Adam raced to sweep Hannah off her feet to the tune of Fun  —   my personal   “Girls” moment. What do we think Hannah is running toward in Season 6? JW: Earlier this week, I made the joke that the Lena (with Hannah) and Kanye (his bars in The Life of Pablo) are the worst things about their current creations. I hated Hannah in the first two episodes, and I warmed up to her as the season progressed. “Girls” has always excelled at illustrating the diverse taxonomy of uncomfortable youthful sexual encounters and Hannah’s encounter with the lesbian yoga teacher at the retreat was so perfect for that  —   plus I loved her flash scene. It was hilarious! I could not stop laughing. The nude photo shoot was as excellent, just so classic Hannah Horvath. And even though I loved Jenny Slate’s cameo, the dance scene felt a little gratuitous (but maybe I’m just holding it up to the instant classic Robyn scene from Season 1). But I let out a little whoop when she and Tally went into hysterics at seeing Jessa and Adam (whose union feels so satisfying) in the apartment hallway on their way outside. Maybe Hannah’s biggest revelation will be that the world doesn’t revolve around her, that friendships fade and that we survive. Life does go on. And isn’t that enough? It could be. The more I think about it, the more I love how grotesque Hannah has become. Jessa’s passionate speech in the    episode really cut to the quick for me  —   maybe there’s something redemptive in the hot mess that is Hannah Horvath, even if we can’t see it yet. Maybe there won’t be a payoff. Maybe there doesn’t need to be a grand revelation. If there is, it might be inauthentic to who Hannah has been this entire time. I think I want to root for terrible, narcissistic women to take up as much space as terrible, narcissistic men. ML: I would be so sad if Hannah suddenly became an ordinary or healthy person at the end of next season. And I can’t picture that happening  —   that’s just not what the show has ever been about. What I liked most about Hannah’s interaction with her former nemesis Tally was her gentle realization that she didn’t have to stay friends with her friends. Like Amanda, I too feel like our main four characters wouldn’t really be a crew anymore, and while Jessa, Marnie, and Shosh have seemingly decided the direction they want their adult lives to take, Hannah hasn’t  —   and doesn’t seem like she wants to. She still wants to be impulsive (steal a bike!) or unreliable (I’m not going on this road trip after all! ). If her current friends don’t want to do those things anymore, well, she can find new friends. And maybe she should find new friends at this point  —   given that she has shared sexual partners with all of them. The final scene of Hannah running  —   complete with freeze frame  —   was not a new Hannah. She was just her giving into her   “do this thing right now” reflex. Hannah doesn’t want to plan, she doesn’t want to lock things down, and she doesn’t want social responsibilities (though she wants others to be responsive to her own needs). She’s flaky, and she has no     whatsoever. She didn’t even research The Moth story slam enough to know you can’t use notes! But unlike lots of other “Girls” viewers, I don’t hate Hannah. I love the character, and I want Hannah to have a life she wants. But in the last two seasons, what became clearer was that her path toward happiness wasn’t going to come from the cessation of bad behavior it was going to come from accepting it and not trying to change anymore. You want to be a demanding, inappropriate narcissist forever? Embrace it. AH I somewhat hate all of these people. (Except for maybe Shosh, who is annoying but strikes me as a fundamentally good person). One of my favorite moments of this season was when the thrift store shopgirl in “The Panic In Central Park” episode, played by the wonderful Lane Moore, openly judges Marnie’s life choices, and Marnie is too   to even notice. I salute you, shopgirl! You are me, watching “Girls. ” And part of the deranged joy of Marnie’s arc has been witnessing the garbage fire that is her personality ignite her nascent music career. My biggest laugh of the season came right on the heels of Marnie’s breakup with Desi, when they got news that their   indie song had been selected for a death montage on “Grey’s Anatomy” and the pair mirthfully united in the name of their shared cause: Fame. Similarly, it was fun watching Hannah get and then squander her book deal, get a gig at GQ (as a native advertiser!) and then enroll and implode at Iowa. But this season she bottomed out by teaching at a private school and squabbling with her      boyfriend. This is Hannah’s nightmare scenario: Doing normal person stuff. In the next and final season of “Girls,” I’m ready for her to get back in the game. If she’s going to be a narcissistic monster, I want her to try to eat New York.",0

Here’s what you need to know: • Kurdish forces reported success in their opening salvos of a vast operation to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State. Analysts say the battle could be a turning point in the war against the militant group. We have two reporters and a photographer near the front lines as Kurdish pesh merga troops advance on villages east of the city. Warplanes from the U. S.  coalition are providing air support for the crucial operation, which could take months and involve nearly 30, 000 troops. • European Union trade ministers meet today in Luxembourg to vote on a free trade deal with Canada. Anything short of unanimous approval could derail plans to sign the agreement, known as CETA, at a summit meeting in Brussels this month. • Donald J. Trump said that if he won the U. S. presidential election, he might meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia before being sworn in. Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile, said the country’s relations with the U. S. were the worst since 1973. Hillary Clinton is beginning an ambitious assault on traditionally Republican states to further diminish support for Mr. Trump. And new documents show sharp disputes between the State Department and the F. B. I. over Mrs. Clinton’s emails, including a discussion of a possible “quid pro quo” to settle one disagreement. • A   separatist commander was killed by a bomb as he rode the elevator in his apartment building in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine traded accusations of responsibility. The two countries’ presidents are expected to meet in Berlin tomorrow, along with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President François Hollande of France, for talks aimed at reviving the peace process. • In Britain, a candidate to lead the U. K. Independence Party, Steven Woolfe, quit, saying there was “something rotten” in it. He called on Nigel Farage, who resigned as the party’s leader after successfully campaigning for Britain’s departure from the E. U. to return. And widespread uncertainty about “Brexit” is shaking not only Britain’s business community, but also scientists who rely on   funding and international collaboration. • France has been enthralled by the publication of letters that the late President François Mitterrand sent to Anne Pingeot, the   “other woman” during his years in the Élysée Palace. Ms. Pingeot typed up the handwritten letters herself. “I don’t know if I did the right thing,” she said. • An explosion at the chemicals maker BASF’s largest production site in Germany killed at least two people and injured at least six others. • Russia’s main   satellite network, RT, said a bank in Britain, NatWest, had abruptly closed its accounts. The network, which critics call a Kremlin mouthpiece, denounced it as a   attempt to interfere with freedom of speech. • One of China’s richest men, Wang Jianlin, announced sizable financial incentives to draw Hollywood filmmakers to China. His conglomerate’s $8 billion investment in the U. S. film industry has raised concerns in Washington. • Need a tractor in India? There’s an app for that. Rural residents are turning to their smartphones to rent heavy equipment for farming. • The euro and the pound gained against the U. S. dollar overnight. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Der Spiegel: “The Kitsch King’s Palaces Get a Facelift. ” The   palaces built by King Ludwig II of Bavaria are in decay and now require extensive restoration. • Politico: “Why Central Europe’s Youth Roll Right. ” New   nationalism is taking root among new voters. • BBC: “Exorcism in Italy a Job ‘Too Scary. ’” The Catholic Church is struggling to recruit young priests willing to confront demons. • Monocle: “World Atlas of Tea. ” In this podcast, a tea expert discusses changes in the industry. • ExoMars 2016, a spacecraft launched by the European and Russian space agencies, is to arrive at the red planet on Wednesday and begin gathering data on gases that may provide clues about geological processes, or even hints of life. • The American first lady, Michelle Obama, has drawn praise for quietly and confidently changing the course of U. S. history. Four influential thinkers  offer   notes. The Obamas will host Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy tonight at the White House, in what could be the administration’s last state dinner. • Romania is investigating allegations that the Orthodox archbishop of Constanta, a city on the Black Sea coast, fraudulently claimed 300 million euros, or $330 million, in E. U. agricultural funds. •  Bob Dylan, the newest Nobel laureate for literature, has said nothing about the award, even to the Swedish Academy (which says it is in touch with one of his associates). A black American doctor was in the news last week after writing on Facebook that a flight attendant seeking help for a sick passenger refused to believe she was a physician. Her experience touched a nerve with other professional women of color who have faced skepticism about their credentials. The episode also calls to mind the poet Phillis Wheatley’s ordeals nearly 250 years ago. Kidnapped as a child in West Africa and sold into slavery, she was bought by the Wheatley family in Boston, who used for her first name that of the ship that brought her across the Atlantic. They taught her to read, and she channeled her intellect into writing poetry. Her work earned praise in both the colonies and Europe. Some of Boston’s most learned men, though, doubted that a slave could write so beautifully. In October 1772, Wheatley successfully defended herself to an   panel. She “is thought qualified to write them,” the men said of the poems. The following year she toured England, where her book was released, “marking the beginning of an   literary tradition,” according to Henry Louis Gates Jr. a historian. A letter to an acquaintance on this day in 1773 indicates that her renown also won her freedom. “Since my return to America my Master, has at the desire of my friends in England given me my freedom,” she wrote. But in one of her poems, she addressed the pain of slavery more directly: “And can I then but   may never feel tyrannic sway?” Sean Alfano contributed reporting.

4600,Re: Did America Really Pass The Test? – Hillary Clinton Is Going To Win The Popular Vote By A Wide Margin,"Archives Michael’s Latest Video Did America Really Pass The Test? – Hillary Clinton Is Going To Win The Popular Vote By A Wide Margin By Michael Snyder, on November 9th, 2016 
The 2016 election was a test, and it would be easy to assume that since Donald Trump won the election that America passed the test. Unfortunately, it may not be that simple. A closer look at the numbers reveals a very sobering reality. Yes, Donald Trump won far more electoral votes than Hillary Clinton did, and that means that he is on track to become our next president . But Hillary Clinton is going to win the popular vote, and it is likely to be by a very wide margin once all the votes are counted. 
As I write this article, Hillary Clinton has a lead of 218,000 in the popular vote, but most of the votes that have not been counted are on the west coast. 
In California, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by a 5,482,166 to 2,966,654 margin, and only 68 percent of the vote has been counted so far. So assuming that the ratio stays about the same the rest of the way, Clinton is going to add at least a million more votes to her lead just from the state of California. 
Up in Washington state, Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by more than 370,000 votes, and only 60 percent of the vote has been counted there so far. So she could easily pick up another 200,000 votes in that state. 
When everything is all said and done, it seems very likely that Hillary Clinton will have received well over a million more votes than Donald Trump did in this election. 
So the truth is that the American people chose Hillary Clinton, but because of some electoral college magic Donald Trump is the winner of the election. 
And I am certainly very, very happy that Hillary Clinton is not going to be our next president. Four years under her “leadership” would have likely been the final nail in the coffin for our nation. My hope is that she will now disappear from national politics for good. 
But just because she is not going to be our next president does not mean that we passed the test. 
In this election, the American people were faced with a very stark choice. Hillary Clinton is the most wicked politician that our country has ever seen, and over the past three decades the American people have gotten to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. 
And despite knowing exactly what they would be getting, more Americans voted for her than voted for Donald Trump. 
If every vote counted equally, she would be our next president. 
I certainly don’t mean to rain on the Trump parade. Christians, conservatives and patriots are right to celebrate this victory by Donald Trump. But the truth is that I don’t believe that we did actually pass the test that we were faced with. 
As a nation, we willingly chose Hillary Clinton by a pretty substantial margin. 
And don’t think that the radical left is going to forget that Trump lost the popular vote. Already, violence and protests have erupted all over the nation. 
Shortly after Trump declared victory, riots broke out in Berkeley, San Jose and Oakland … 
“Not my president! Not my president!” chanted anti-Trump rioters in Berkley, California as they light flares and storm the streets. 
Riots erupted in Berkley, San Jose and Oakland shortly after the announcement of Donald Trump as president-elect. Rioters are breaking into stores, vandalizing cars and shooting flares. 
One woman in Oakland was hit by a car on Highway 24 just after midnight and has suffered serious injuries after. When she pulled over to the right shoulder, she was surrounded by anti-Trump rioters, who vandalized her car and broke the back window, according to CHP officers. 
There were reports of protesters burning American flags in some areas of the country, and there were even brawls outside of the White House . 
And once the sun set on Wednesday night, the protests started again. According to USA Today , “thousands of demonstrators” have hit the streets in New York City… 
In New York, thousands of demonstrators blocked off streets around Trump Tower near the busy intersection of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, chanting “hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go” and “p—y grabs back,” a reference to tape of a Trump conversation from years back in which he One woman protester was topless while another climbed on top of a tree to see the activity. Taxis, city buses and passenger vehicles stood at a standstill. 
In Boston, radical leftists were organizing a giant protest against Trump … 
Far-left organizers are planning a mass protest in Boston against President-elect Donald Trump, citing the need to “immediately start fighting against him.” 
Approximately 2,300 people have indicated they will gather outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston tonight for a “Boston Against Trump Rally.” According to the Facebook event page, another 5,000 people say they may be interested in attending. 
“Donald Trump is the next President of the United States. We need to immediately start fighting against him. We need to build a movement to fight racism, sexism, and Islamophobia,” the event description says. 
Sadly, this could be the beginning of a new era of protests, rioting and civil unrest. 
Instead of coming together behind the new president, the radical left seems ready to go to war. 
So even though Trump won the election, the truth is that our troubles may only just be starting. More than half the country didn’t want Trump, our nation was already more divided than it has been in decades before he won, and it won’t take much for many of our big cities to descend into utter chaos. 
Without a doubt, we should be very excited that Donald Trump won the election, but an election victory is not going to magically make our problems go away. 
When faced with the most monumental election in any of our lifetimes, Hillary Clinton received the most votes from the American people, and the consequences for that decision may be far more severe than most people are now anticipating.

4601,U.S. General Seeks ‘a Few Thousand’ More Troops in Afghanistan - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The commander of the   international military force in Afghanistan, warning that the United States and its NATO allies are facing a “stalemate,” told Congress on Thursday that he needed a few thousand additional troops to more effectively train and advise Afghan soldiers. “We have a shortfall of a few thousand,” Gen. John W. Nicholson said in a sober assessment of America’s longest war to the Senate Armed Services Committee . The international force that is helping the Afghans currently has 13, 300 troops, 8, 400 of whom are American. Afghan forces have taken heavy casualties over the last year as they have sought to hold off the Taliban and prevent them from capturing provincial capitals. General Nicholson repeated previous assessments that the sanctuary Taliban fighters and militant groups enjoy in Pakistan remains a major obstacle. “It is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven,” said the commander, who added that the United States needed to do a “a holistic review” of its policy toward Pakistan. The issue of safe havens in Pakistan also was discussed Thursday when the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, spoke by telephone with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s chief of army staff. In the conversation, “Gen. Bajwa reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to counter all militant groups operating in its territory,” according to a Pentagon statement. In his Senate testimony, General Nicholson also complained that Russia was trying to “legitimize” the Taliban by creating the “false narrative” that the militant organization has been fighting the Islamic State and that Afghan forces have not. Russia’s goal, he asserted, was “to undermine the United States and NATO” in Afghanistan, expressing a far more skeptical view of the Kremlin’s intentions than President Trump. On the positive side, he said, the area in which Islamic State fighters operate in Afghanistan had been greatly reduced. General Nicholson’s argument amounted to an implicit criticism of the approach taken by former President Barack Obama, who imposed a series of rigid troop ceilings and significantly reduced the number of American forces in Afghanistan  —   though not by as much as he had initially projected. But the broader question is what course President Trump might chart on Afghanistan. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said that for too long the United States strategy had been “not to lose,” and urged that a plan be devised to break the stalemate. General Nicholson said the administration was working on one. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, served as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan. Mr. Mattis, Mr. Trump’s defense secretary, oversaw the military effort there when he served as the head of Central Command. Mr. Trump has said little about Afghanistan, although on Thursday he held his second call since his election with Ashraf Ghani, the nation’s president. “The two leaders spoke about the counterterrorism efforts, threat levels in Afghanistan, the capabilities of Afghan forces, as well as the risks of terrorism in the region and the countries that support terrorism,” said Nader Nadery, Mr. Ghani’s adviser on strategic affairs. Mr. Nadery said troop levels were not a focus of the call. But Afghan officials say Mr. Ghani and Mr. Trump spoke about the possibility of increasing troop levels if a military assessment showed the need for it during their first conversation, in early December. The war in Afghanistan is a topic the president has rarely discussed. “Hardly a word was mentioned by Trump about Afghanistan during the campaign, yet it remains one of the U. S.’s largest security expenditures,” said Daniel Feldman, who served as the senior envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Obama administration. Mr. Feldman said that a broad assessment was needed of the terrorist threat, the role of international partners and how to pursue reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban. But he said there was no indication that the new administration had begun such a review. Explaining the need for more troops, General Nicholson indicated that there were sufficient Special Operations forces to carry out counterterrorism missions. The shortfall, he said, was in those training and advising the Afghans. Currently, advisers are mainly working with Afghans at the command level of army corps. But more advisers, he said, would enable the   coalition to advise at lower levels in the chain of command, most likely at the level of Afghan brigades. The use of military advisers is generally more effective if it is not limited to advising foreign armies in their military headquarters, but extends to units in the field. The Obama administration’s decision last summer to give American commanders more flexibility to provide air support for Afghan forces fighting the Taliban also increased the need for advisers below the level of Afghan army corps, General Nicholson said. He said that the thousands of additional advisers he was seeking could come from allied armies and did not all need to be American. But there appears to be little appetite among NATO nations to send more troops to Afghanistan. Assessing the Afghans’ military performance, General Nicholson said Afghan forces had suffered high casualties because of poor leadership and the excessive use of checkpoints. But he underscored that he was encouraged by the leadership within the country’s special forces and increasingly in its budding air force.",0
4602,Remembering Rasul Gamzatov: The Poet of the People,"Email 
November 3 rd is around the corner. This day of the year may or may not mean something to you. I consider it is a sad day for poetry. On this day 13 years ago the poet of Dagestan, Rasul Gamzatov, left our world. Born on September 8, 1923, Gamzatov is not only the “People’s Poet of Dagestan”, he is the poet of the people who love poetry, nature, home, language, and beauty. In his prolific writings, Gamzatov showed that if we know the place where we come from intimately, we will have enough stories to tell for the rest of our lives. He taught us that it is only by telling stories and paying attention to others’ stories that we truly live. From the remote villages and treacherous mountains of Dagestan, Gamzatov wrote poems and stories whose words are like loaves of bread to feed the hungry. His rhythms like raindrops falling on the endless deserts of the deprived souls. His depth and clarity like clear spring waters from the melting snows of the mountaintops of Dagestan. Some of his poems turn me into a bleeding red rose, a singing wind on a long lonely night, a thunder loudly objecting every form of oppression on this planet. Others silence my vocal cords and sets free a stubborn tear hanging on the corner of my eye. With his stories, I turn into a bird, into a short-lived wild flower on the side of a mountain rock, into a shiny distant star on a silent and cold winter night. Is it a coincidence that Gamzatov died in 2003, the same year Iraq, the land of poetry and beauty, was occupied and turned into rubble and ashes? 
The poet arrived to this world in the Avar village of Tsada in the north-east Caucasus. The name of the village means “fire” in the Avar language, which reflects his own poetic fire that was neither tamed nor domesticated nor put out throughout the 80 years of his life. His poems capture the human soul that is like nature: powerful yet also fragile and delicate in other ways. As children of nature, we are capable of doing so much, yet Mother Nature can crush our arrogance in a blink of an eye. Gamzatov understood our delicate existence that can easily be crushed by the cruel rocks of reality. Yet our only bet is on our souls that enable us to fly high and far away. Reminding us of our strengths and weaknesses, he wrote: “Hit a bird with a stone, the bird dies. Hit a stone with a bird, the bird dies.” 
The son of the well-known bard, Gamzat Tsadasa, Gamzatov from the early years of his youth showed an extraordinary passion for Avar stories, myths, oral traditions, village songs, and everything the people of the mountains cherished and held dear and sacred. His intellectual character is best captured in a version of an old saying that many mountain peoples worldwide recite: “One should only kneel down in two cases: to drink clear water from a spring, or to smell a wild flower.” This profound expression reminds us of the role of the intellectual in a world where everyone and everything is up for sale. Intellectuals can only kneel down to drink from the spring water of knowledge; or to smell a wild flower whose scent would set their imagination free. If we kneel down for any oppressive power even once, we may forever be cursed, crippled, paralyzed, and perhaps never able to stand up on our feet again. Gamzatov tells us that he first picked the seeds of poetry from his mother’s songs in the cradle. He picked the fire of poems from his father who loved reading and writing poetry, in addition to working long and harsh hours in the fields. From an early age, he was determined to capture the stories of his people to show the world that poetry transcends languages, human differences, and all artificial borders. He once recalled his father, Tsadasa, reacting to one of his early poems: “if you rummaged in the ash, you might find at least a glowing amber.” 
I am sad to report that there is an embarrassing absence of the translations of Gamzatov’s writings, particularly in the English language. This negligence is itself a form of censorship of works that may potentially humanize and change how we think about other people and cultures who inhabit our planet. Great works of literature from other places are not only censored by banning them, but even more so by silencing them, by refusing to translate them in the first place. Marginalization is the worst form of censorship and intellectual assassination. Likewise, choosing what gets translated into a certain language and what gets marginalized is a form of shaping and constructing the historical memory of a place according to whims of those who own the money and means of knowledge production. But since the “politics of translation” is not the subject of this article, I will spare you more details lest I distort this poetic atmosphere. To commemorate the 13 th anniversary of Gamzatov’s death, I would like to take you on a journey in one of his most poetic books of all time titled My Dagestan . The book, originally written in the Avar language, was first translated into Russian in 1967. Since then the book has been translated into many languages. For those interested, the only English translation I was able to find is one from 1970, published by Progress Publishers in Moscow. In this article, I will use the Arabic translation first published in Damascus, Syria, in 1984, to share with you some of the countless gems Gamzatov leaves us with in this masterpiece. 
From the very opening of the book, Gamzatov treats the reader as a “guest” who, upon entering his home, shall hopefully leave as a long-lasting friend. He opens it with what he titles “Instead of an Introduction”. From the early pages, the poet creates a harmony between writing and his beloved Dagestan. He writes that ideas and emotions are like mountain guests: they come without invitations, without prior notice, and there is no way for us to hide or escape from them when they arrive. In the mountains, there are no “important” or “unimportant” guests. The youngest of guests are equally important and honored even more than the oldest person in the household, simply because they are guests . We receive guests at the doorstep without asking them “where are you from?” We take them to the center of the house and seat them on the pillows, near the fireplace. Gamzatov adds that guests in the mountains appear suddenly and unexpectedly, but they never surprise us, because we are always waiting for them. We wait for them every day, every hour, and every minute. And “like a mountain guest, the idea of this book came to me.” Elsewhere he writes: “I want to write a book in which not the language follows the grammar, but the grammar follows the language.” 
Quoting from his notebook, the poet shares with us how in Kolcata (formerly Calcutta) India, while visiting the house of Rabindranath Tagore, he saw a drawing of a bird that doesn’t exist in reality. That bird was first drawn in Tagore’s imagination. Yet if Tagore hadn’t had seen and observed so many different birds that do exist, he would have never been able to draw his own bird. Gamzatov calls it “Tagore’s bird”. To him, this is how writing about the self, the place you love, and the others is also done. In fact, originality and original thinking, in a sense, are like Tagore’s bird: they are unique and never seen before. Yet they can only be created after seeing and observing so many different types of birds that do exist in reality. This is why, Gamzatov insisted that his book be titled My Dagestan , because just like the bird he saw in Tagore’s house was “Tagore’s bird”, so is the Dagestan in the book “Gamzatov’s Dagestan”. It is not, he adds, because Dagestan only belongs to him, but because the way he sees, imagines, and perceives Dagestan is different than any other person on earth, especially when seen through the eyes of transient visitors and tourists. In this sense, Gamzatov reminds us that our homes, our languages, our mountains, and everything we love dearly need a lifetime to be known and a lifetime to be forgotten. 
Later he writes that everything around us is potentially a piece of gold or silver. But silver and gold don’t mean anything in themselves. What is important is that the crafter has skilled hands to turn them into something meaningful and beautiful. This is precisely how the stories we hear, see, and experience in this world can be turned into meaningful writings. Here he cites a phrase he once saw engraved on an old jar that read: “the most beautiful jars are made from clay. The most beautiful poems are written with simple words.” 
On a different page, he reminds young writers that writing takes so much patience and perseverance. He then cites a phrase he once read on an old door in one of Dagestan’s villages which read: “Don’t break the door! It can be opened with its key!” This, to him, is the type of patience a young writer needs to learn how to open different doors through different words, different styles of writing, and through patience. He advices young writers that rather than asking for a specific topic to write about, they should ask for a set of eyes that can recognize and capture topics worth writing about. In this way, the poet is telling writers that instead of thinking of themselves as “magicians” who can change the world in one piece of writing, they are really more like farmers who plant the seeds of their alphabet not knowing on which hearts and minds they shall fall and grow into new wild lives. Gamzatov then goes on to remind us that just as it is hard to determine whether it is the feelings that generate music or is it the music that generates feelings; it is equally hard to determine whether it is the writer who produces the writing or the other way around. 
Gamzatov’s appreciation for poetry and writing that spring out of the deepest point of knowing the self after demolishing all walls with others is deeply connected to the Avar culture and myths. He shares that the Avar people have an old myth stating that the poet was created 100 years before the world was created, as though they are saying that had the poet not participated in creation, our planet would not have been as magnificent as it is. This is why poets and writers must never compromise themselves. The only way to do so, he writes, “is to always be yourself in every single word you write.” As usual, the poet draws on a village tradition to illustrate the point. He cites the tradition of mountain villagers who, before entering a wedding, usually ask: “is this gathering complete, or do you still have a space for me?” The wedding holders usually respond: “Come on in if you are you !” And “in this book,” Gamzatov writes, “I want to prove that I am me !” 
In a section titled “Genius”, the poet writes that even if humans get to know all the secrets on this earth, nobody will ever know what “genius” really is, what is its source, how is it shaped, and how does it grow over time. Genius people are also different from one another, for if they were similar, they would cease to be called so: “I have seen so many faces like my father’s face, but I have never recognized in any of them the genius like that of my father,” he writes. He then adds that, fortunately, genius is not inherited, for if it was, it would be like a royalty passed from one royal family to another, from one rich family to another. Indeed, “it is not unusual for an idiot to be born out of a wise person, nor a child of an idiot to turn out wise.” 
In the second part of the book Gamzatov begins another journey to introduce us to his love and attachment to his hardly known mother tongue, the Avar language. To him, this deep love and connection with this language is precisely what makes him able to appreciate every other language, land, mountain, plain, and valley on this planet. He shares that a poet can and should in fact be able to speak to all people, regardless of their languages. For Gamzatov, the destinies, dreams, and pains of all people can be carried in a single heart—the heart of the poet. Yet poets don’t actually write poems for each single heart on the planet, nor do they write for every single love, every single smile, or every single teardrop. Poets write about themselves only. But it is only when the boundaries between the self and the other are demolished that the poet will be able to at once write for nobody and for everybody. 
Perhaps not surprisingly, following a long chapter on the “mother tongue”, as My Dagestan nears its end, Gamzatov dedicates a good part of the book to mothers and how the first lullabies and songs they sing to us shape and provide us with enough love and inspiration to face the harshness of this world for the rest of our lives. He wonders whether “cowards” are those people whose mothers didn’t sing for them in their cradles. Perhaps those who betray others are people who have forgotten the songs their mothers sang for them in their cradles. The poet is deeply aware of what it means when a mother—or any loving woman in her place—sings for us our earliest songs and tunes. He writes “a mother’s song is the beginning and the source of all human songs. It is the first smile and the last tear.” Considering how the early tunes and the early songs shape our intellect, cognitive abilities, and literary and poetic selves, it is significant that Gamzatov would emphasize the role of mothers’ songs that teach us how to be in love with everything beautiful around us. He writes that there are songs mothers sing when the child is born, others they sing when they lose their child, and yet others they keep singing long after their beloved children are gone. In this way, poetry for Gamzatov is neither words nor music nor the human senses that receive them. It is the encounter between language, music, and the senses. After reciting numerous stories about the power of singing that, to him, far exceeds the power of swords and weapons, he insists that songs can change the world and save countless lives. His words in this section remind me of a very old saying from the Arabian Peninsula which asks us to beware of mingling with people who don’t love music; to beware of people who don’t like and don’t know how to sing. 
Gamzatov left us in 2003 but he left behind a treasure in the form of poetry. He left us prose even more poetic than his poetry. From the magical and tough mountains of Dagestan, he wrote in the Avar language and spread so much love and poetry for so many people who aspire to be human before anything else. After all, one of his favorite inscriptions he saw on a tombstone read: 
He was no sage, 
But bow to him: 
He was a man. 
In My Dagestan , Gamzatov writes that the people of the mountains were asked why they built their villages so far away, blocked from others, and secluded by all these mountains. Villagers were told that in residing in these mountains, it is impossible to reach them given the dangers of the road. The villagers responded: “Good friends will reach us without worrying about these dangers. As for bad friends, we don’t need them anyway!” Gamzatov was keen throughout his life to record many inscriptions he came across on old doors, gates, tombstones, and mountain rocks in Dagestan’s villages. In two memorable inscriptions about “guests” he writes: 
Come, hillfolk, please knock! 
We’re well. If we’re not, 
Your coming shall cure us! 
* 
Don’t knock, don’t rouse the household, 
You who pass this way! 
If good you bring us, enter! 
If mischief, go away! 
It is hard to end an article about Gamzatov as much as it was hard to start it. I first read My Dagestan when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Baghdad. This year I had to reread its 550 pages to share some of its vivid images and poetic jewels with you. As soon as I finished rereading the book, I felt sad and empty, because the poet indeed fulfilled his promise: I entered the book like a passing mountain guest and here I am leaving it as a dear friend to the poet and to all the remote villages and people he writes about. Gamzatov’s mountains and magical scenes resemble northern Iraq and remind me of everything and everyone I loved and loved me. It reminds me of all the letters I have received over the years from friends who cared about me, friends who betrayed me, and others who still renew their vows of love and friendship in my life every day. 
I close the book with great sadness because, in a strange way, it makes me ask the same old questions always secretly lurking in the back of my head or circulating in my bloodstream like an incurable virus: do we only realize the meaning of all things, people, and places that we love after they are no more? Do we always put the people, things, and dreams that truly matter to us aside like storing a precious item in a closet, hoping naively to come back one day to find them as we left them? Is it the big paradox of life that we don’t master the art of living until it is nearly time to depart? After all, Gamzatov himself was quoted saying shortly before his death: “My life is a draft I wish I had the time to revise.” Oh, my friends, I know I should not end on this sad note. Perhaps to truly celebrate Gamzatov’s poetry and life, I should end exactly as he ended My Dagestan in the translation I am holding now in my hands: “We are finished. It is time to separate. And, as they say, we shall meet again. God willing.”

Veterans help veterans cope with PTSD through decorated Marine’s New York-based nonprofit Headstrong Project By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 7, 2016 PTSD 
BY Larry Mcshane 
Two years after serving two tours in Iraq, Army veteran Dustin Shryock started feeling something was wrong — and he didn’t know how to make it right. 
“Anxiety attacks that would pop up for no reason,” he recalls of the problems that surfaced out of the blue in 2010. “I’d be sitting on the couch, doing nothing. You can just imagine a normal anxiety attack, like a public speaking engagement. 
“And a tiny little thing like that, over time, over and over, became debilitating.” 
A fellow veteran pulled him aside with a solution: The Headstrong Project, a group founded four years ago by combat-decorated Marine Corps officer Zach Iscol to assist his fellow American fighters scarred by invisible wounds.

4604,Regret Ever Buying Gold and Silver? AGXIIK Has A Few Words To Share With You…,"Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Regret Ever Buying Gold and Silver? AGXIIK Has A Few Words To Share With You… 
If you bought silver at $35 and now regret buying silver because the dollar-based price dropped 50%, I have a few words to share with you… 

Submitted By AGXIIK: 
Some people on these boards debate the wisdom of buying precious metals and PM stocks and tend to blame the messenger if the prices change or sentiment goes against that purchase. 
I can understand that entirely because on the surface, when Doc or others, including myself as the #2 precious metals pimp on these boards, along with the 20 other sites offering the same advice and products, urged and continue to urge in strongest terms the wisdom of buying gold and silver, plus stocking up on preps such as are offered here as well (I don’t hear anyone busting Doc’s balls for selling ammo, survival food, medicines and water filters) there will be a number of people who question that wisdom. 
If you bought silver at $35 and now regret buying silver because the dollar-based price dropped 50% I have a few words to share with you. 
If you made that choice for the right reason and see the price drop by 50%, you will be rewarded in other ways. Time is on our side, even for the older of us who don’t have the luxury of decades to wait. Some certainty that you have real money in your safe comes to mind. The price might not be on your side right now but 6,000 years of history is. 
You might be rewarded by silver going to $50 an ounce although that might be the low end of the price spectrum when silver reached its apogee. 
If you made that choice in the hopes that the $35 silver goes to $100 or even $200, as I did in the early stages of my purchases, then hopes for riches were far from realized. Now we can see why that was not the best decision by a very wide margin. Precious metal prices can make the strongest of us question our thinking and maybe shed a tear or two over our decision. 
If you didn’t stay the course because you thought you were lied to the precious metals dealers, couldn’t stand the financial pressure of going ‘all in’ or no longer can fight the evil bastards, that cast of characters ( you know who they are) who’ve taken over the majority of the markets and rig the prices on an hourly basis, I can completely understand that capitulation. The stock market has kicked the living crap out of me more than a few times. 
I’ve had more moments of doubt that I made the right decision that I can count as I watch others making fortunes investing in this and that, harvesting paper profits in investments that are destined for the dust bin. But I’ve never regretted or repudiated my decision to buy precious metals. 
My strategies have changed a bit now given that I know more about these markets. That’s been a very slow process, partly because it’s been very difficult to shed 55 years of living in a far different paradigm than this one and partly because I am very hard headed SOB and hate to admit I jumped on the band wagon early on and at much higher prices. Fortunately I’ve received good counsel from some really smart people, those who have a much broader perspective than me. EdB, Eric, Sovereign Economist, Pat Fields (RIP) to mention a few. And if I forgot your name I didnt forget your wisdom. 
My wife and I have lived in the miasmic stink of the Obama paradigm for 8 years. This latest chapter of a decades-old scheisse show seems like it’s lasted a lifetime but it is coming to an end. The last 8 years and decisions made by us are still sound in light of the latest news. Today, with the horror show we watch on a minute by minute basis, these decisions are becoming even more sound. We live in a world beset by uncertainty. The ability to move quickly and wisely instead of reactively is vital to our well being. Having a strong financial base is critical to buffer ourselves against uncertainty. Precious metals form part of that base. 
For thousands of years we peasants have lived by a credo of self reliance. We know, on an instinctive basis, that the powers that be are always willing and able to take what we have by hook or crook. That psychopathic 1% has always been with us. This time is no different. The forces arrayed against us rely on the same time-tested means to harm us. We used to counter them with revolutions, migrations and holding real money in a hole in the dirt floor of out hut. 
Unbacked paper currency, debt, central banks out of control, total corruption in the political and banking worlds, moral depravity, intentionally spread of fear and despair, pitting us against them, divisive politics and an overarching world girdling power that controls everything from afar are nothing new. What is new is the world wide awakening of the masses. We peasants, serfs, Ordinary Joes and Janes who see we are being serious screwed with by the powers that be are mad as hell and we’re not going to take it any more. Good News. We finally know their names today. To know their names is to give names AND faces to our enemies, the enemies of the people; names and faces of those who would oppress us. 
This time around the situation is even more grave because the people who would have us are legion, with fangs bared and hands reaching out to take what for we have worked our entire lives. The tipping point of us vs them is coming to a head. But they are still human and vulnerable. The bleed like the rest of us. They can be killed, just the rest of us. More good news. There are 10,000 of us to 1 of them. 
As Ballinger notes, the real crises in several dozens of countries worldwide is pressing against the people. We see it in real time, see the terror of the people as their lives are being systematically destroyed by forces so dark and evil that I have trouble even imagining there are people like this living the world, united to take We, the People down to hell with them. They have faces and we see them in real time. 
I’ve studied, thought, wrote, proselytized and yes, pimped precious metals and preps, awareness and means to counter the threats we see arrayed against us, even to the point that it makes me look like some loon on a Hyde Park soap box. Soap box or note, I’m still fully convinced of the wisdom of those choices, putting my money and time where my mouth is. It’s taken thousands of hours out of my life to do this; time that I could have easily spent elsewhere. I made a decision years ago to be a voice that would not be idle or quiet. If I can turn a bit of the tide and change even a mere 100 minds then it’s been worth every minute of time spent. 
Like Doc, Tyler, Eric Dubin and hundreds of others, I believe we are facing an existential threat, partly of our own making because we allowed some really bad actors to move on us, and partly due to things we are barely aware of. I’m not Biblical in that respect, leaving those avenues to others more schooled in religious matters. 
The fact that we now see the fangs and claws of those who would have us, it’s impossible to put that cork of unawareness and lack of knowing back in the bottle and just hope for the best. The best we can do is be self aware, prepared and knowledgeable that these are uncertain times filled with financial mistakes, monetary hurricanes and political earthquakes. Some are of our own making because we elect fools and psychos to high office. Some are made by those who don’t care who they harm they do so long as we are forced to pick up the tab. Picking up the tax used to be voluntary. Now it’s written into law. We get to make good on everything that’s been done wrong by the 1% and their political allies. They f*** up and we get to pay. 
Ayn Rand spoke of this and many things in her book Atlas Shrugged but more than that, we have dozens of tomes and hundreds of authors telling us that things are not what they seem. The old paradigms no longer hold. Knowing this it’s best to have some assets that comprises a good fallback position if the worst should befall us.

4605,Kohrs &amp Coleman: A Pen and a Phone - Breitbart,"When President Obama came into office in 2009, his party held commanding majorities in both houses of Congress. By the time he left, they had hemorrhaged dozens of House and Senate seats, and nearly 1, 000 seats in State houses around the country. Obama may have beat Romney in 2012, but voters were sending a clear message about which party they wanted passing the laws. [Still, Obama had no intention of “waiting for legislation” when it came to his agenda. “I’ve got a pen and I’ve got a phone,” he declared.  Ignoring the fact that gridlock between the executive and legislative branches is not a defect in America’s government, but an essential component, Obama figured the elected representatives of the people would be no match for his executive orders. Certainly, the executive order is a legitimate constitutional tool at the president’s disposal. Presidents frequently use them to direct federal departments, and to implement Congressional statutes. Few criticized Obama’s mere use of executive orders, or even the number he issued. The problem was always their brazen unconstitutionality. Take for example Obama’s executive order on immigration. Congress had been debating “comprehensive immigration reform” ad nauseam for decades, with attempts to pass major legislation failing in 2007, and again in 2013. Growing restless, Obama issued an executive order in 2014 that would have delayed deportations of 5 million illegal immigrants.   states filed for injunction, arguing that the order violated the Administrative Procedures Act. The Supreme Court would deadlock   effectively blocking Obama’s executive amnesty. But the issue raised before the Court was telling. For perhaps the first time in American history, the Supreme Court reviewed whether a president had violated the Take Care Clause of the Constitution. Article II, section 3, reads in part that the president “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. ” The obscure clause serves as a bulwark against monarchical suspensions of law, while imposing on the President an affirmative duty of faithful execution of the law. Despite campaigning on reversing President Bush’s policy of “trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress,” it appeared Obama was issuing orders in lieu of legislation. Curiously, now that Obama is no longer president, the left is once again interested in executive overreach. In his first few days in office, President Trump fired off a barrage of executive orders. But while Trump’s orders are worthy of debate as matters of executive policy, they so far have not created new law. Yet, reactions have been apoplectic. When Trump issued a temporary freeze on travel from seven Middle East countries, protesters rushed to the airports to stop this “Muslim ban. ” Where were these people when Obama was openly writing his own laws? Trump’s order broadly restricts citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, and Libya from entering the U. S. for the next 90 days, and suspends all refugees for 120 days. It was the Obama administration that first identified these countries as areas of terrorist “concern. ” In 2015, the administration required persons who had travelled to these countries in the previous 4 years to apply for a visa before entering the United States. Obama also blocked Iraqi refugees for six months in 2011, after discovering Al Qaeda terrorists living as refugees in Kentucky. Trump’s restrictions are certainly broader than Obama’s visa restrictions, and many criticized Trump’s order as it applied to permanent U. S. residents holding green cards. But that is a question of policy, not constitutionality. For one, the order says nothing about banning Muslims, and it affects the same seven   countries as Obama’s visa restrictions. It does not affect   other   countries. If Trump’s order singling out these seven countries amounts to religious discrimination, then so did Obama’s visa restrictions. Others say the order religiously discriminates because it prioritizes refugees of a minority religion. But prioritizing classes of refugees isn’t a novel policy. In 2015, the Obama administration declared its preference for refugees “deemed to be the most vulnerable,” including minorities, “whether that’s a racial minority or an ethnic minority or a religious minority, or even   …     an LGBT person. ” Moreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act expressly authorizes the president to suspend immigration in furtherance of public safety, or national security. Indeed, national security policy is indisputably within the president’s constitutional authority. In the order, Trump cites national security for these temporary restrictions. As a matter of fact, Obama cited national security when he placed restrictions on visas for these same countries, and when he halted Iraqi refugees. So did President Carter in 1980, when he restricted visas to Iranians. So did several other presidents in the numerous other times immigration restrictions were placed on specific countries. Last Friday, U. S. District Judge James Robart issued a nationwide injunction against the ban. In his brief ruling, Judge Robart does not address any constitutional issues, and merely finds that the State of Washington met its minimum burden. Yet, on the same day, a federal judge in Boston reached the exact opposite conclusion, ruling against the ACLU’s similar attempt to block the travel ban. Robart’s nationwide injunction now goes to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. No matter the outcome, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which this does not reach the Supreme Court. Nationwide injunctions were issued several times against the Obama administration, including for his   executive amnesty. But while the Constitution does not authorize the president to write new laws, or extend legal status to 5 million   it certainly grants the president substantial authority where national security is concerned. Perhaps a few federal judges think they have a “pen and a phone” too?",0
4606,Civil Rights Commission Launches Investigation into Trump Admin. - Breitbart,"The U. S. Commission on Civil Rights says it is launching a   “comprehensive assessment” into the Trump administration, in light of proposed budget cuts and staff eliminations that it says will cause the civil rights of people of color, the LGBT community, and other “marginalized” groups to be at risk. [Americans deserve better.  This civil rights rollback is dangerous for all of us.  https:  .   —   Catherine E. Lhamon (@CatherineLhamon) June 15, 2017,   According to a press release, the commission, which was created in 1957 as an independent agency that advises Congress and the president on civil rights matters, unanimously approved the investigation. The press statement says the commission is especially concerned with what it perceives as the Department of Justice “minimizing its civil rights efforts” by placing ICE officers in courthouses and by not emphasizing the need for protection for the LGBT community or the disabled. In the Department of Education, the commission says the proposed budget and staffing cuts in the Office for Civil Rights will affect those filing complaints based on sex, race, and other specially protected class categories. Proposed staffing and budget cuts, and mergers of various offices in the Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services will all have a negative impact on the federal government’s job to monitor civil rights compliance efforts, says the commission. The investigation is launched as   ProPublica released an internal memo  —   sent by Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Candice Jackson  —   it says it “obtained” that suggests “the Department of Education has laid out plans to loosen requirements on investigations into civil rights complaints. ” ProPublica says: Under the Obama administration, the department’s office for civil rights applied an expansive approach to investigations. Individual complaints related to complex issues such as school discipline, sexual violence and harassment, equal access to educational resources, or racism at a single school might have prompted broader probes to determine whether the allegations were part of a pattern of discrimination or harassment. The new memo, sent by Candice Jackson, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, to regional directors at the department’s civil rights office, trims this approach. Breitbart News reported in April ProPublica’s concern that Jackson “once complained that she experienced discrimination because she is white. ” When an undergraduate at Stanford University, Jackson was critical of an extra help section of a class held solely for minority students. “I am especially disappointed that the University encourages these and other discriminatory programs,” she wrote at Stanford Review. “We need to allow each person to define his or her own achievements instead of assuming competence or incompetence based on race. ” So grateful to hear today from @EByard @MaraKeisling @rea_carey. @MaraKeisling summarized: ”we are the storm raining down justice” https:  .   —   Catherine E. Lhamon (@CatherineLhamon) June 16, 2017,  However, Vanita Gupta, the former acting head of the DOJ’s civil rights division under Obama, said, “At best, this administration believes that civil rights enforcement is superfluous and can be easily cut. At worst, it really is part of a systematic agenda to roll back civil rights. ” In an emailed statement to ProPublica, Elizabeth Hill, press secretary for the U. S. Education Department, said the new “enforcement instructions seek to clear out the backlog while giving every complaint the individualized and thorough consideration it deserves. ” The commission is composed of eight commissioners. Four are appointed by the president and four by Congress. The commissioners serve   terms and are not confirmed by the Senate. Currently, four members of the commission are Democrats, three are independents, and one is a Republican. The four presidential appointees were all selected by former President Barack Obama. “For 60 years, Congress has charged the Commission to monitor Federal civil rights enforcement and recommend necessary change,” says commission chairwoman Catherine E. Lhamon, an Obama appointee. “We take this charge seriously, and we look forward to reporting our findings to Congress, the President, and the American people. ”",0
4607,Donald Trump Vows to Create 25 Million Jobs Over Next Decade - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump unveiled a pledge on Thursday to create 25 million jobs over the next decade, but he offered few details on how he would achieve that ambitious goal as president. In remarks that may stir new consternation abroad, Mr. Trump told the Economic Club of New York that he would pay for his economic agenda in part by requiring allies to shoulder the full cost of American military resources deployed in their defense. Mr. Trump has long criticized the country’s defense arrangements, but on Thursday, he drew an uncommonly straight line between his   promises and the “billions and billions of dollars” currently spent on “defending other people. ” He specifically mentioned Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea as “economic behemoths” that the United States should not pay to protect. “You could ask yourself, how long would Saudi Arabia even be there if we weren’t defending them?” Mr. Trump said in his speech. “And I think we should defend them, but we have to be compensated properly. ” He added, “I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to hear that. ” Speaking at the Waldorf Astoria, Mr. Trump largely reiterated a broad economic vision he outlined in Detroit last month, vowing to slash taxes on business and scale back federal regulations, and to redraft or void trade agreements he views as disadvantageous to the United States. But Mr. Trump’s remarks also underscored the opaque and improvisational nature of his policy agenda, which has been defined by a few grand promises but few concrete details. By putting a hard number on his   promises  —   even if    —   Mr. Trump may be aiming to strengthen a campaign message that has been light on policy outside the issues of immigration and trade. And Mr. Trump has now twice revised his tax proposals during the campaign, first sharply scaling back plans for a $10 trillion tax cut and then, on Thursday, backing away from several ideas that drew criticism and mockery in the past. He partly rolled back his earlier proposals to reduce corporate taxation: Mr. Trump still proposes a 15 percent tax rate on corporate income, but it would no longer apply to business income reported on personal taxes, generally limiting the lower rate to the largest corporations. He also reduced a tax break that generated backlash because it would particularly benefit real estate developers. Mr. Trump also now proposes to cut federal taxes by $4. 4 trillion, not $10 trillion he insists the plan would ultimately cost the government only $2. 6 trillion in revenue, with the difference made up in economic growth. Mr. Trump spoke loosely and plainly enjoyed himself, repeatedly teasing the   crowd about their own wealth and business ventures. He put his audience on notice that he would enlist some of them in government, to help renegotiate deals far larger than any they had dealt with before. “Hate to say it,” Mr. Trump joked, “but your companies are peanuts. ” But Mr. Trump also continued to cast himself as a champion of   interests, and in his remarks invoked nostalgia for the heyday of the American auto industry, steel manufacturing and coal mining. And Mr. Trump attacked his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, for having described some of his supporters as “deplorables” for holding views she called bigoted. “My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving and that our economy can never grow as it did once before,” Mr. Trump said. “And boy, oh boy, did it used to grow. ” Mr. Trump’s description of an economy growing more slowly than it did after World War II until 2000 is accurate. But his promise to return to that postwar growth rate and add 25 million jobs over the next decade would be difficult to attain, given the nation’s shifting demographics. Part of the downshift in the growth rate since 2000 was caused by a   population that has grown less rapidly than in earlier eras. And that trend is unlikely to reverse, despite Mr. Trump’s criticism in his speech of “cynicism that our labor force will keep declining. ” The Congressional Budget Office projects employment will rise by 7. 1 million over current levels by 2026 amid an increase in the labor force of eight million people. In effect, to add 25 million jobs by then, the number of people who seek to work would have to increase more than three times as much as the economists at the budget office think likely. One way would be to encourage more   Americans who neither work nor look for work to do so. This group includes    parents and those who see few possibilities in the work force, and their numbers have risen substantially since 2008. But even if the percentage of working   to    returned to its peak of the spring of 2000, that would add only about 5. 2 million more potential workers compared with current levels. Another way would be to encourage people to retire later, extending the length of their careers. A third option would be to increase immigration levels sharply over the next decade so there are more potential workers born elsewhere. Beyond promising to put many more people to work, Mr. Trump pledged to attain 3. 5 percent annual growth in gross domestic product over the next decade  —   versus the 2 percent that has been routine in recent years and that the Congressional Budget Office projects for the decade ahead such growth would require a steep increase in businesses’ productivity. While not articulated in these terms, his plan imagines that the    slump in productivity will reverse itself if Mr. Trump’s agenda of lighter regulation and lower taxes was put into effect. The revised version of Mr. Trump’s tax plan would still substantially reduce federal taxation, replacing seven tax brackets with three and taxing most income at lower rates. Under the plan, a married couple with $50, 000 in taxable income would pay 12 percent in taxes, or $6, 000, rather than 13 percent, or $6, 572, under current law. Families with more income would save more. The top tax rate would drop to 33 percent from 39. 6 percent. More Americans would avoid paying taxes entirely, although not as many as under Mr. Trump’s earlier proposal. Mr. Trump said he wanted a $30, 000 standard deduction for married couples instead of the $50, 000 in his last plan. He also proposed a new limit of $200, 000 on deductions by wealthy couples. Mr. Trump’s proposals drew a friendly reception from his audience, particularly for his plan to reduce taxation on businesses. But he also offered reminders of the distance that separates him from many of the financiers and business leaders who typically fund Republican campaigns. He repeatedly attacked foreign trade in harsh language, and for the second time this week questioned the independence and legitimacy of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Trump charged that rather than simply doing what is right for the economy, the Fed made “the political decision every single time. ” And there was perhaps a subtler reminder of the divisive nature of Mr. Trump’s campaign: Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Macy’s and the chairman of the Economic Club of New York, did not attend the speech. Under Mr. Lundgren, Macy’s pulled   merchandise from its shelves last year, after Mr. Trump  —   who retaliated by repeatedly taunting Mr. Lundgren from the campaign trail  —   described undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists and drug smugglers.",0
4608,"Bill Nunn, Who Played Radio Raheem in ‘Do the Right Thing,’ Dies at 63 - The New York Times","Bill Nunn, a versatile actor best known for playing the role of Radio Raheem, the   neighborhood philosopher killed by police officers in Spike Lee’s 1989 film “Do the Right Thing,” died on Saturday in Pittsburgh. He was 63. His death was announced on social media by Mr. Lee. His wife, Donna, told The Associated Press that Mr. Nunn had cancer. The first major acting role for Mr. Nunn, the son of a   professional football scout, was in the 1988 film “School Daze,” also written and directed by Mr. Lee. The next year brought the critically acclaimed “Do the Right Thing,” in which he played Radio Raheem, who carries a boombox blaring Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” through the streets of the   area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer. Radio Raheem sits at the moral heart of the film, delivering a soliloquy directly to the camera on the ceaseless contest between love and hate, symbolized by the   rings he wears on each hand. The character’s choking death at the hands of police officers in front of a crowd of his neighbors incites the film’s wrenching final scenes. Mr. Nunn became a popular character actor after “Do the Right Thing” and appeared in a variety of films, including “New Jack City,” “Sister Act” and the “ ” trilogy by the director Sam Raimi. In 2004 he appeared in a Broadway revival of “Raisin in the Sun” as Bobo, alongside Audra McDonald, Phylicia Rashad and Sean Combs. But it was his performance as Radio Raheem that allowed him to make his greatest mark, Mr. Nunn said in an interview with ABC News to mark the 25th anniversary of the film’s release. He was a frequent collaborator of Mr. Lee and also appeared in his films “Mo’ Better Blues” and “He Got Game. ” Mr. Lee referred to him on Saturday as ”my dear friend, my dear Morehouse brother. ” They both attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. William Goldwyn Nunn III was born on Oct. 20, 1952, in Pittsburgh. His father was Bill Nunn, a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers who helped build a football powerhouse in the 1970s by recruiting from the   football programs at historically black colleges and universities. He died in 2014. Mr. Lee memorialized Mr. Nunn in a series of social media posts on Saturday, sharing the text of his “Do the Right Thing” soliloquy as well as pictures of him as Radio Raheem. On social media, Mr. Lee cited the death of Eric Garner, who died after an officer placed him in a chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, as evidence of the continuing resonance of Radio Raheem’s violent death. In an interview with ABC News in 2014, Mr. Nunn reflected on the death of Mr. Garner, which was captured on video and helped propel a nationwide debate on the treatment of black men by the police. Much like the character that brought him to fame, Mr. Nunn focused on the need for love. “You know you’re watching a guy lose his life,” Mr. Nunn said in the interview. “For me, I’m just getting a little tired of watching these mothers on television, these poor mothers grieving their sons and children. It makes me wonder sometimes about where the compassion is. ”",0

Leader at al-Hashd al-Shaabi in Hawija district, Hassan al-Sawfi, announced on Thursday, that the Islamic State extremist group abducted 75 civilians, southwest of Kirkuk for leaving the land of Caliphate.
Sawfi said in a press statement, “This evening, ISIS militants abducted 75 civilians from Hawija district, while fleeing the district,” adding that, “The civilians were abducted for leaving the land of caliphate and helping other civilians to flee the ISIS-held areas toward Kirkuk and Salahuddin.”
“The abduction took place in the area between Hamrin Mountains and southwest of Kirkuk,” Sawfi explained. “ISIS militants are collapsing and lost their ability to fight,” Sawfi added.
Sawfi also called on officials to accelerate the battles to liberate the district of Hawija to rescue the civilians who are used as human shields.

4610,F.D.A. Will Allow 23andMe to Sell Genetic Tests for Disease Risk to Consumers - The New York Times,"For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration said it would allow a company to sell genetic tests for disease risk directly to consumers, providing people with information about the likelihood that they could develop various conditions, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. The move on Thursday is a turnaround for the agency, which had imposed a moratorium in 2013 on disease tests sold by the company, 23andMe, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. The decision is expected to open the floodgates for more    tests for disease risks, drawing a road map for other companies to do the same thing. 23andMe will now be reporting telltale markers for 10 diseases. Most, like factor XI deficiency, a blood clotting disorder, and Gaucher disease type 1, an organ and tissue illness, and celiac disease are rare. Anyone who buys the $199 Ancestry and Health test from the company will automatically learn if they have mutations increasing their risk for those diseases. Risk genes for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are treated separately. Customers will have to specifically say that they want that information. The company’s website offers links to genetic counselors for those who are weighing whether to be tested. If they want those results they will be included at no extra charge, though patients have to pay for the counseling separately. Until now, the only way for people to get such genetic tests was to see a medical professional who would order a test and later deliver the results to patients. Often, patients were required to see a genetic counselor before getting a test. The process for customers is simple. A customer spits into a tube and then mails it to 23andMe. The company’s lab extracts DNA from the saliva cells and tests it with probes that find genetic markers using a special chip for genotyping. In about six to eight weeks the company sends the customer an email saying the results are in. By logging onto an online account, the customer can see the report and its interpretation. It will include not just the genes for disease risk, but also reports of ancestry and results on things like how much the person is likely to weigh and whether alcohol will elicit flushing of the face, shoulders and neck, or even the entire body. This is not the first foray by 23andMe into    disease risk testing several years ago it marketed tests to consumers claiming it could provide genetic information for a variety of diseases from a simple saliva sample. But when the F. D. A. shut that endeavor down in 2013, it told the company it had to prove that its tests were accurate, and that customers understood their results. The F. D. A. established on Thursday what it called “special controls” to permit the company to sell the tests, and future ones, if it met those requirements. The company did that and Tara Goodin, a spokeswoman for the F. D. A. said the agency now intends to issue a new exemption allowing other companies to market similar tests under the same conditions. While some applaud the F. D. A. ’s move, saying people do not always need the intervention of medical professionals and genetic counselors to learn their risk for certain diseases, others worry that it sets a dangerous precedent. People often need genetic counseling before deciding they want to know if they are at risk for Parkinson’s disease, said James Beck, chief scientific officer of the Parkinson’s Foundation. “Once you get the test and read the results, there is no going back,” Dr. Beck said. But Dr. Robert Green, a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School, said that most people who want to get such information on their own are able to handle it just fine. He has studied tests for Alzheimer’s risk in rigorous studies, asking if patients who simply got their results, without counseling, understood what they were doing and were able to handle the information. The vast majority were, he said. “I do not want to be cavalier,” Dr. Green added. “In some cases people did not realize what they were saying yes to and others did not realize the psychological impact it would have on them. There is some potential for distress, but it is much, much smaller than was anticipated. ” The test’s results do not by any means guarantee that a person will get the disease. Instead, they mean the disease is only more likely. With Alzheimer’s, for example, the test looks for a gene variant called ApoE4. Those with one copy of that gene have a threefold increased risk of Alzheimer’s. Those with two ApoE4 genes have a   increased risk. The actual risk depends on age, but even having two copies of ApoE4 does not foreordain the disease, Dr. Green emphasized. For Parkinson’s disease, the company looks for two mutations, LRRK2 and GBA, each of which increases risk. The LRRK2 increases it by 25 percent and GBA increases it fourfold. But if a person of Ashkenazi Jewish background inherits LRRK2, the risk increases to eightfold. But those risks must be put in perspective said Dr. Beck of the Parkinson’s Foundation. Parkinson’s disease is rare  —   about one million Americans, out of about 330 million  —   have it. The new test approval comes just two years after 23andMe got approval for a different kind of testing that determines whether people carry certain gene mutations for diseases. In 2015, the F. D. A. allowed the company to tell customers if they had a copy of a mutated gene for a disease like cystic fibrosis that would not affect them  —   you need two copies of such mutated genes to get the disease  —   but could affect their future children. If a person with one copy of a cystic fibrosis gene, for example, has children with a partner who also has one copy of the mutated gene, each child has one chance in four of inheriting a mutated gene fromeach parent. If that happens, the child would get the disease. But the new approval takes the testing a giant step forward. “The difference between then and now is that we now have authorization to tell you about your personal risk,” said Anne Wojcicki, chief executive at 23andMe. 23andMe has been providing the same genetic tests the F. D. A. just authorized to customers in Britain and Canada, which have more lenient regulations, since 2014. The company says it has followed more than 20, 000 customers in Britain who got their genetic risk results. “There were no untoward incidents,” Ms. Wojcicki said. But nothing is easy in this new world of direct to consumer genetics, noted Dr. Gail P. Jarvik, head of the division of medical genetics at the University of Washington, in an email. “If people know what they are purchasing and understand the results, then I support such tests,” she said. “It is in the execution that my concerns lie and I will be following that. We have seen patients who did not understand tests they purchased from this company in the past. Hopefully, this information will be delivered in a way that has value to the person purchasing the service and does not cause unneeded medical visits. Many of these tests indicate risk of getting disease, not the certainty of getting it. And that, she said, “can be a challenging concept to communicate. ”",0

4612,White Artist’s Painting of Emmett Till at Whitney Biennial Draws Protests - The New York Times,"The   photographs of the mutilated body of Emmett Till, the teenager who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955, served as a catalyst for the civil rights movement and have remained an open wound in American society since they were first published in Jet magazine and The Chicago Defender at the urging of Till’s mother. The images’ continuing power, more than 60 years later, to speak about race and violence is being demonstrated once again in protests that have arisen online and at the newly opened Whitney Biennial over the decision of a white artist, Dana Schutz, to make a painting based on the photographs. An   artist, Parker Bright, has conducted peaceful protests in front of the painting since Friday, positioning himself, sometimes with a few other protesters, in front of the work to partly block its view. He has engaged museum visitors in discussions about the painting while wearing a   with the words “Black Death Spectacle” on the back. Another protester, Hannah Black, a   black artist and writer working in Berlin, has written a letter to the biennial’s curators, Mia Locks and Christopher Y. Lew, urging that the painting be not only removed from the show but also destroyed. “The subject matter is not Schutz’s,” Ms. Black wrote in a Facebook message that has been signed by more than 30 other artists she identifies as nonwhite. “White free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights. The painting must go. ” She added that “contemporary art is a fundamentally white supremacist institution despite all our nice friends. ” The protest has found traction on Twitter, where some commenters have called for destruction of the painting and others have focused on what they view as an   attempt by Ms. Schutz to aestheticize an atrocity. Mr. Bright, in a Facebook Live video of his protest, makes some of the same points in objecting to the painting’s inclusion in the show. The biennial is an unusually diverse exhibition of work by 63 artists and collectives nearly half the artists are female and half are nonwhite. Calling the painting “a mockery” and “an injustice to the black community,” Mr. Bright adds that he believes the work perpetuates “the same kind of violence that was enacted” on Till “just to make a painting move. ” “I feel like she doesn’t have the privilege to speak for black people as a whole or for Emmett Till’s family,” Mr. Bright says in the video. He also objects to the thought that the painting could be sold and make Ms. Schutz, whose work is highly sought after, a significant amount of money. Ms. Schutz, who first exhibited the painting last year in a gallery in Berlin, has stated that she intends never to sell the work. In a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Schutz said: “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America but I do know what it is like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till’s only son. The thought of anything happening to your child is beyond comprehension. Their pain is your pain. My engagement with this image was through empathy with his mother. ” She added: “Art can be a space for empathy, a vehicle for connection. I don’t believe that people can ever really know what it is like to be someone else (I will never know the fear that black parents may have) but neither are we all completely unknowable. ” The curators said that they wanted to include the painting because many of the exhibition’s artists focus on violence  —   racial, economic, cultural  —   and they felt that the work raised important questions, especially now, in a political climate in which race, power and privilege have become ever more urgent issues. “For us it was so much about an issue that extends across race,” said Mr. Lew, who along with his   Ms. Locks, met with Mr. Bright on Tuesday to discuss his protest. “Yes, it’s mostly black men who are being killed, but in a larger sense this is an American problem. ” Ms. Locks said: “Right now I think there are a lot of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show. ” She added that she felt the painting was a means of “not letting Till’s death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted. ” The story of Till’s murder has begun to resonate loudly again in recent months. News recently emerged that the Mississippi woman who said that the    Till whistled at her and was verbally and physically aggressive  —   an account that led to Till’s abduction, torture and killing  —   told a historian in 2007 that she had made up the most sensational part of her account. The Black Lives Matter movement and greater awareness of the killing of black men by the police have led to efforts to film the Till story, with at least three screen adaptations in production.",0

Hillary Supporters Burn American Flag, Riot, Threaten to Kill Trump After Losing Election

Rioting hit the streets of Portland and Oakland as Hillary Clinton supporters reacted badly to Donald Trump’s election victory, while death threats against the new president-elect flooded social media. 
Windows were broken and cars were set on fire in Oakland as irate protesters lit flares and blocked freeways.

“A protestor was struck by a vehicle on the eastbound lanes of Highway 24 although it was not immediately clear what the extent of the victim’s injuries were,” reports Fox 5 .

The irony of the riots is that many pro-Clinton media outlets previously circulated the talking point that Trump supporters would be likely to stage violent unrest after they lost the election.
Twitter was also inundated with death threats , with leftists either hoping for or personally expressing their willingness to carry out Trump’s assassination.

4614,Brazil To Release Millions Of Mutant GM Mosquitoes,"Posted on October 29, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments 
Scientists in Brazil are planning on unleashing millions of genetically modified mosquitoes into the public in an attempt to stop the spread of the Zika virus. 
Despite the fact that evidence shows that GM mosquitoes were responsible for the deadly virus spreading across the globe, scientists have been given the go-ahead by the government to release the GM mosquitoes into the wild. Recommended 
A doctor has said that he believes the release of 5 million GM mosquitoes per week in Brazil may be causing a rise in brain cancer among humans. (2 hours ago) 
Phys.org reports: 
They will mate with the females of the ordinary mosquitoes, spawning babies with a genetically inbuilt flaw that causes them to die quickly. 
With their work done, the modified father mosquitoes will then give up the ghost themselves—as they are genetically programmed to do. 
Oxitec says its factory in the town of Piracicaba, northwest of Sao Paulo, can produce 60 million mutant mosquitoes a week. 
Piracicaba is the world’s “first and biggest factory” of genetically modified mosquitos, said Oxitec president Hadyn Parry. Recommended 
U.S. regulators could allow the release of millions of genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes into the state of Florida to fight the Zika virus. (2 hours ago) 
“This is the only place where we have a factory like this. We can use this as a hub for Brazil,” said Parry, who traveled to Piracicaba for the plant opening. 
Currently their only Brazilian customer is the city of Piracicaba, “but we are having conversations with several municipalities and states,” Parry said. 
Mosquitoes by the millions 
According to the firm, five field tests that they conducted between 2011 and 2014—in Panama and the Cayman Islands, as well as the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia—showed the population of wild Aedes aegypti insects dropped by 90 percent after the mutant mosquitoes were released. 
Oxitec does not yet have a sales permit from Brazil’s Anvisa health authorities, and there are no epidemiological studies showing whether mosquito-carried diseases drop after the factory-bred insects are released. Recommended 
British company Oxitec hope to win approval to release millions of genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys, pointing to climate change and the rise of tropical diseases as the need. (2 hours ago) 
Parry is not concerned. “We are still waiting for Anvisa approval—we have no date for it, but we expect it for 2017,” he said. 
And none of this has stopped the mayor of Piracicaba from signing a four-year, $1.1 million deal with Oxitec. 
In its first wave, the company will release 10 million factory-bred mosquitos each week into this city of 360,000 people. 
The need for insect control is pressing, as the summer in the southern hemisphere approaches and the mosquito population—and cases of the diseases that they carry—is likely to boom. 
As of July nearly 1.4 million cases of dengue were recorded in Brazil, following the record 1.6 million cases in 2015, according to health ministry figures. Recommended 
The United States government have announced plans to introduce GM mosquitoes in Florida in an attempt to thwart the spread of the dengue and chikungunya virus. (2 hours ago) 
In the same period 174,000 cases of Zika were reported. 
The Zika virus outbreak began in late 2015 in Brazil and has since spread across the Americas. 
Zika is particularly dangerous to pregnant women because it can cause birth defects such as microcephaly, in which babies are born with unusually small heads and brain deformities. 
Zika infection has also been linked to a nerve and immune disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome.",0
4615,Al Pacino to Play Penn State Coach Joe Paterno in HBO Movie About Jerry Sandusky Sex Abuse Scandal,"Al Pacino has been cast as former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno in an upcoming Barry   HBO film about the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal. [The    Scarface and Godfather icon will play the role of Paterno during his time as coach of Penn State University, according to Variety.  Paterno is still considered by many to be the greatest college football coach of all time however, his career and reputation were severely damaged after the emergence of a sexual abuse scandal in which his longtime assistant coach, Jerry Sandusky, was found guilty of sexually abusing dozens of children. The film will examine Paterno’s role in the scandal. Paterno died in 2012, just two months after he was fired from Penn State. “After becoming the winningest coach in college football history, Joe Paterno is embroiled in Penn State’s Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal, challenging his legacy and forcing him to face questions of institutional failure on behalf of the victims,” the official logline for the film reads. The film, which does not currently have a title, will be directed by Barry Levinson, whose previous work includes titles such as Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) Rain Man (1991) and Wag the Dog (1997.) It will be produced by HBO and released by Sony Pictures. Sandusky was found guilty in 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse the    disgraced coach was later sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.

4617,Bill Clinton Gives The Rundown on Obamacare We Have Been Looking For (VIDEO),"Bill Clinton Gives The Rundown on Obamacare We Have Been Looking For (VIDEO) By Natalie Dailey on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
Ever since President Barack Obama passed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aka Obamacare, Republicans have been fighting against it. 
The insurance companies are no longer allowed to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. It also set up a system of federal insurance marketplaces. The local media can sometimes make it sound more confusing without meaning to. 
President Bill Clinton helped explain it during a recent speech. He said : “All the headlines are full of the stories that average premiums are going up 22 percent. But the subheadline is, if you’re in the healthcare program, your subsidies are going up too so the increase won’t be as much.” 
Also, 70 percent of people buying insurance on the Marketplace will be able to get a plan for under $75 per month. 
He further said : “So you’ve got one proposal, her opponent, just repeal it and go back to the way it used to be.” “That’s a terrible idea. More than 20 million people would lose their health insurance. Families that can now insure their kids up to age 26 wouldn’t be able to do it anymore and 100 percent of Americans would be worse off because you today cannot deny someone coverage based on a preexisting condition. We do not want to get rid of that.” 
He did talk about some of the disadvantages of the law, but it is still better than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s non-plan . 
Clinton said : “The people who are getting killed in this deal are the small business people and individuals who make just a little too much to get in on these subsidies.” 
Yes, the co-pays and drug prices are high. However, the Marketplace is the only way some people can get insurance. If your employer doesn’t offer healthcare or if you are self-employed, you would be screwed under the old rules. We need to fix this system, not throw it away.

4619,SB Nation Blog Claims That MLB Broadcast Booths Lack Diversity - Breitbart,"Finding ways to make baseball better has become an   topic in sports talk. Limit the number of relievers, end the intentional walk, limit the time and frequency of replays all these issues and more have found their way to Commissioner Manfred’s desk. [Another area in need of improvement, in their minds, was found by The Good Phight, the blog at SB Nation which covers the Philadelphia Phillies. They discovered that there aren’t enough minorities in MLB broadcasting booths.  According to Hardball Talk, “Of 164 announcers in 30 teams’ booths, 148 (90. 2 percent) are white men. Only nine are   men (5. 5 percent) five are Latino men (3. 0 percent) one is an Asian man (0. 6 percent) and one is a white woman (0. 6 percent). “There are only two broadcast teams with multiple persons of color: the Twins (Torii Hunter and LaTroy Hawkins) and Angels (Victor Rojas and Jose Mota). 17 broadcast teams are comprised of only white people. “The broadcast booths do, however, reflect viewership. Cohen, citing Nielsen stats, notes that 83 percent of those who watch baseball on television are white and 70 percent are men. ” Bill Baer of Hardball Talk concludes by saying, “  …    I am pessimistic about baseball’s future with its reluctance to cater to a younger, more diverse audience. MLB was, until only very recently, behind the times in technology and social media and still is in some ways. It has made no effort to curb culture policing by white players past and present. “If MLB wants to remain a mainstay in the sporting realm, it will have to bridge the demographic divide as much as it has recently bridged the technological divide. ” The idea that MLB hasn’t reached out to minorities is ridiculous. The league has hosted tournaments and helped build ballparks in   neighborhoods for years. Commissioner Manfred even fired the league’s leadership search firm after teams failed to hire any minorities for managerial and GM positions. Have those efforts yielded great results? Evidently not, but those failures should not be confused with a lack of effort. MLB has clearly attempted to increase its appeal to minorities. The problem is, despite those efforts minorities don’t necessarily seem more interested in playing baseball. Perhaps that will change in the near future. Hopefully it will, yet right now it doesn’t seem clear that MLB’s efforts have worked. Which brings us to the point about the study pertaining to the lack of minority broadcasters. The problem isn’t that there aren’t enough   in the broadcast booth, the problem is that there aren’t enough of them on the field. Channeling Hillary Clinton here for a moment, what difference does it make, if MLB teams hire more black broadcasters? Are black high school and college players going to become more likely to pursue a career in baseball because the number of black broadcasters directly mirrors the percentage of blacks in the general population? What baseball needs, especially after the retirement of Vin Scully the greatest sports broadcaster of all time, is an infusion of great   and   artists. If those guys happen to be black, then great. What we don’t need is yet another social justice crusade. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0

4621,Miami Beach Zika Cases May Prompt Call to Avoid City - The New York Times,"MIAMI BEACH  —   A cluster of Zika cases most likely transmitted by local mosquitoes has been identified in Miami Beach, and federal and state officials are considering whether to advise pregnant women to avoid traveling to the city and possibly even all of   County, a health official said Thursday. Such a decision would signal that the potential threat of local Zika transmission had catapulted to a new level. It would no longer be confined to one zone of active local transmission in Miami  —   the only one identified in the continental United States up to now. A broad travel advisory could threaten tourism in South Florida and deepen fears among pregnant women living in the area. The Miami Beach City Manager Jimmy Morales, in an email to city commissioners, confirmed that two cases of Zika have been tied to Miami Beach. One case is a tourist who had visited Miami Beach two weeks ago. Another case involves a Miami Beach resident who works on the island, Mr. Morales said in the email, which was first reported by The Miami Herald. “I have been informed that two Zika cases have been linked to Miami Beach,” Mr. Morales said in the email. At noon on Friday, Gov. Rick Scott will hold a news conference to discuss the developments. While the Zika virus has mild or negligible effects in most people, it can be devastating in pregnancy because it can damage the brain of a developing fetus, leading to babies born with unusually small heads, a condition called microcephaly. The Zika epidemic has swept across Latin America and the Caribbean since last year. In Brazil, which has been hardest hit by the virus, more than 1, 800 babies have been born with microcephaly. Until three weeks ago, all documented cases of Zika infection in the continental United States had been linked to people who had traveled to the outbreak region, or people who had sexual relations or close contact with someone who had traveled there. While officials have long expected cases of local transmission in the United States, especially in warm climates like Florida’s where mosquitoes flourish, it was impossible for them to predict exactly where those cases would crop up. On July 29, health officials announced that the first cases of local Zika transmission in the continental United States had affected four people in   and Broward Counties. On Thursday, the health official with knowledge of the new developments said that in Miami Beach, there are “a handful of cases” of likely local transmission that involve people who were in “close proximity to each other,” including two new cases that the Florida Department of Health announced Thursday. The official insisted on anonymity, saying that details about the location and any travel guidance for pregnant women are not likely to be officially announced until Friday at the earliest. The official said that expanding the travel advisory broadly would not indicate that health officials think that the Zika virus was spreading rapidly throughout the county or Miami Beach. Rather, it would be “for the sake of almost simplification to make it easy for people to understand the geographic area,” the official said. “Now that we have a second area of local transmission, I think officials wouldn’t be surprised to see in the coming weeks another area,” the official added. “So in an effort to simplify things and get ahead, there are discussions about expanding the area to possibly include the county or other parts of the Miami area. ” Jackie Schutz, Gov. Rick Scott’s communications director, said Thursday that public health officials “have not confirmed a new zone of active transmission,” besides the    area in Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, that has been designated a zone of active local transmission of the Zika virus since Aug. 1. She added, “there are multiple cases being investigated. ” So far, 25 of the 35 cases of suspected local transmission that Florida health officials have announced have ties to the Wynwood neighborhood, most of them linked to two small businesses. Mara Gambineri, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Health, said the department “still believes active transmissions are still only occurring in the area that is less than one square mile in   County. ” She added, “If investigations reveal additional areas of likely active transmission, the department will announce a defined area of concern. ” The mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, said that state officials had not confirmed to him that there were cases in Miami Beach. But he said, “There could be a link to Miami Beach. ” He added, “We can expect to see Zika popping up here and there, but it’s not an epidemic. ” The health official interviewed Thursday said Florida officials might be waiting to announce the new cluster until a decision was made about how large an area would be included in any new travel advisory, something that officials from the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were discussing Thursday night. “At a minimum is expanding the travel advisory to Miami Beach,” the health official said. “What’s on the table right now is Miami Beach and making it bigger than Miami Beach. There are discussions about the whole of   County. ” The C. D. C. had not issued a statement as of Thursday night, and agency officials said it would do so only after the State of Florida released more details about a new cluster and location. A city of 92, 000 people, Miami Beach sits on a series of barrier islands east of Miami. Its crystalline waters, night clubs, restaurants and hip hotels make it one of the biggest tourist hot spots in the state. About seven million tourists stayed in Miami Beach hotels in 2015, and others visited without staying there, according to the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. About half are international tourists, with Brazil leading the way. On Thursday, the health official with knowledge of the discussions said that any updated travel guidance would probably be similar to the advisory for Wynwood. Pregnant women were advised not to travel there and women who lived or worked in the zone, and their partners, were advised to protect themselves from mosquito bites and to practice protected sex. Among those affected by an advisory would be Batsheva Wulfsohn, who is seven and a half months pregnant, and her husband, Zak Stern. The couple live in Miami Beach, and Mr. Stern runs a bakery in Wynwood. “I’m still searching for that reasonable reaction to something that is still quite mysterious in its effects,” said Mr. Stern, who had not heard about the Miami Beach cases on Thursday. “My wife is trying to kind of balance doing everything she can as a responsible mother, while not allowing herself to be crippled in fear all day. ” It is exactly that kind of balance that public health officials have also been striving for, said Dr. William Schaffner, the head of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University’s medical school. In issuing travel warnings, he said, “they don’t want to do social and culture and economic harm and they don’t want to do medical and public health harm by indicating that people are at risk when the risk may be very, very low. ” The authorities have limited travel advisories to Wynwood because it was linked to multiple cases, and because the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits Zika, can travel only short distances, does not live long and does not pass the virus to its larvae, he said. Also, in two other viruses the mosquito transmits, dengue and chikungunya, a mosquito has usually infected only one person, not many, he said. “But the world is sometimes a little messier” than scientific precedent would suggest, he said. So far, health officials “have been making reasonable decisions, and we have all wondered what’s it going to take for them to expand the travel advisory,” he added. “They tread a fine line between really aggressive and being really cautious. ”",0
4622,South Korean President Dismisses Aides in Bid to Stem Worsening Scandal - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The shadowy woman at the center of President Park  ’s worst political scandal apologized on Sunday for her “wrongdoings. ” Hours later, Ms. Park fired her chief of staff and seven other presidential aides in an effort to regain public trust, a day after thousands of South Koreans took to the streets to call for her removal from office. Choi   a longtime associate widely seen here as a shamanlike adviser to Ms. Park, returned to South Korea on Sunday from Europe, where she had been in hiding since the scandal erupted weeks ago. Ms. Choi’s lawyer, Lee   said she would present herself to prosecutors for questioning on her murky ties with Ms. Park, which are at the heart of the president’s troubles. “She apologizes deeply for causing the people humiliation and despair,” Mr. Lee said of Ms. Choi at a news conference. Mr. Lee said Ms. Choi also apologized for “her wrongdoings,” but he did not elaborate. Ms. Park has been accused of letting Ms. Choi, a private citizen with no security clearance or background in policy making, advise her on crucial state affairs. Ms. Choi, 60, has also been accused of using her influence with Ms. Park to plant her associates in the government, including the presidential office, and to coerce big businesses to donate millions of dollars each to the two foundations she controls. As new details of Ms. Choi’s accused manipulation of state affairs have surfaced, Ms. Park’s approval ratings have plunged to record lows. She apologized last week for letting Ms. Choi edit some of her most important speeches. On Sunday, Ms. Park carried out a major reshuffling of her presidential staff in recognition of “the graveness of the current situation,” her office said. Those dismissed included Ahn   the senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, who was accused of collaborating with Ms. Choi in pressuring businesses to donate to her foundations. Also fired were three   aides known as the three gatekeepers for their purported role in controlling whom Ms. Park met with and what information reached her. All three are considered close to Ms. Choi. Despite the reshuffling, Ms. Park did not replace her aides on foreign policy and national security. Pressure has been mounting on her to overhaul her leadership style and government to regain some of her lost authority. On Sunday, her governing Saenuri Party asked her to form a new cabinet with opposition parties. Ms. Park’s plummeting political fortunes were dramatized on Saturday when prosecutors raided the homes of a few presidential aides who are believed to be under Ms. Choi’s sway and are accused of collaborating in  . Prosecutors also appeared at the Blue House, Ms. Park’s presidential office and residence in Seoul, the capital, demanding that they be allowed to search aides’ offices there for criminal evidence. The Blue House refused them entry, but the prosecutors returned on Sunday, pressing the same demand  —   a highly unusual move for prosecutors, who have long been accused of being servile political tools of the sitting president. Also on Saturday, at a rally in downtown Seoul, thousands marched on the Blue House to chants of “Down with Park  !” and “Impeach Park  !” Shoving matches erupted when riot police officers blocked the marchers. Organizers said 30, 000 people had attended the demonstration, while the police estimated the crowd at 12, 000. South Koreans are proud of the global economic powerhouse they built from the ruins of the   Korean War and the democracy they achieved after decades of brutal rule by military dictators. Those dictators included Ms. Park’s father, Park   who led the country from 1961 until his assassination in 1979. Ms. Park’s scandal is seen as particularly inflammatory because it hurts that pride. On Saturday, many demonstrators said they felt ashamed to be South Korean. Speaking to the crowd, Lee   the mayor of Seongnam, a city just south of Seoul, said the president had humiliated the people by relying on a “shamanlike figure” to handle important state affairs, referring to Ms. Choi. “We may be weak, we may be poor, but we have not lost our pride yet,” Mayor Lee said to cheers from the crowd. “President Park has lost her authority as president, and she must step down. ” Little had been known about Ms. Choi, except that she is the daughter of a minor religious cult leader and befriended Ms. Park in the 1970s, when Ms. Park’s father was still in power. Ms. Choi’s father, Choi   who died in 1994 at the age of 82, had been accused of manipulating Ms. Park, though Ms. Park has defended him as a patriot and a mentor. Some critics believe that Ms. Choi has inherited her father’s   role in Ms. Park’s life. Major political parties have so far refrained from calling for Ms. Park to step down. Her single   term ends in February 2018. All recent South Korean presidents have ended their terms in ignominy, disgraced by scandals that often implicate their children as well. Many South Koreans had hoped that Ms. Park, the country’s first female president, who is unmarried and has no children, would be an exception.",0
4623,"Mothers’ Diets Have Biggest Influence On Children Eating Healthy, Study Suggests","in: General Health Every once in a great while, a perfect child is born. One who never cries, sleeps all night, and gladly eats whatever food you choose to put in front of them. But unfortunately for most of us with children, developing lifestyle habits, such as a healthy appreciation for nutritious fruits and vegetables, usually requires years of continual work. New information recently released by researchers at Michigan State University’s College of Nursing helps to shed some light on the problem of establishing healthy dietary preferences in young children, and more importantly, may help both parents and medical professionals find more effective ways to approach it successfully [ 1 ] . Does Your Diet Really Affect Your Child’s? In order to better understand the connection between mother’s dietary habits, and those of their children, researchers questioned almost 400 low-income women from all over the state with pre-school-aged children then currently enrolled in educational head start programs. They found that the children whose mothers ate fewer than four servings of fruits and vegetables per week were less likely to consume the recommended number of servings themselves. Perhaps more interesting, was their discovery that children who were viewed as “picky eaters” by their mothers were also likely to consume an inadequate number of servings per week, regardless of the mother’s own dietary habits. This has led the researchers behind the study to speculate on improved methods for encouraging better eating habits in children. Many nutritional specialists have become increasingly focused on making healthy foods appear fun and therefore more appealing to kids. And while a certain amount of progress has been made following this approach, it is far from a stand-alone solution. Tips for Being a Better Influence for Your Child’s Diet In today’s busy world, it’s easy to fall into a routine of serving your family convenience foods — especially when dealing with young children and toddlers, whose taste buds can be very difficult to please. Still, the importance of developing smart dietary habits early in life cannot be overstated. Without a balanced and varied diet, growing bodies don’t get the vitamins and minerals they need to thrive. By focusing directly on the food choices of mothers, experts may be able better influence the diets of their children. This is likely due to a combination of positive modeling and increased access to more nutritious foods. There’s more to it than just working a few extra vegetables into dinner. (Although cooking meals at home instead of eating out every night is a smart first step for some.) Make sure that fresh snack options are also readily available for those in-between bouts of hunger. Not only is this better for your family’s health, replacing pr-epacked commercial snack products with seasonal organic fruits and vegetables or raw nuts and seeds is a great way to save money in the checkout line. Parent’s of so-called “picky eaters” should also keep in mind that some children may need to be exposed to a given food as many as 15 times before they are able to decide whether or not they like it. So don’t give up just yet on convincing your little one that broccoli is good. In the long run, it’ll be worth the effort. References: Jill Vondrasek, Jason Cody.

4624,Trump: Israel is a ray of hope to the world,"November 11, 2016 Trump: Israel is a ray of hope to the world 
Just two days after his stunning election victory, President-elect Donald Trump delivered a message to Israel, describing his personal affection for the Jewish state and hopes that his administration will be able to strengthen ties strained by eight years of tense relations between Israel and the Obama administration. 
Calling Israel a “ray of hope,” Trump released the statement to the Israel HaYom newspaper, which is owned by prominent Jewish Republican donor, Sheldon Adelson. Adelson backed Trump in this year’s election towards the end of the race, giving tens of millions of dollars to the Trump campaign and pro-Trump political action committees. 
“I love and respect Israel and its citizens,” wrote Trump. “Israel and the US share so many common values, like free speech, freedom of worship, and the special emphasis on creating opportunities for all citizens to fulfill their dreams.” 
“I look forward to strengthening the unbreakable bond between our two great peoples. I know well that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, and that it is the only one that defends human rights, and that it is a ray of hope for many people.” 
Along with his praise for the Jewish state, Trump also touched upon the thorniest issue in the Israel-US relationship – the two-state solution.",0

4628,No Monkeying Around: NFL Network’s Mayock Threatens to Walk Off Set After Orangutan Announces Draft Pick - Breitbart,"The NFL Draft has turned into a zoo, literally, and NFL Network draft guru Mike Mayock is having none of it. [The NFL has recently endeavored to spice things up and enhance the entertainment value of the draft. Long gone are the days of a bunch of       football nerds sitting around a hotel ballroom calmly scribbling names on sheets of paper, to be carried by runner to the commissioner at the podium so he could announce the name of the player in which the franchise had entrusted its future hopes and dreams.  Oh no, say goodbye to suspender moustache guy, and say hello to skinny jean wearing,   having purveyor of social media guy. In short, the draft has become an entertainment event geared towards the   NFL fan. An entertainment event that, especially in light of the recent,   financial demise of ESPN, has to attract   viewers in order to draw ratings and raise revenues. One of the new entertainment innovations of the marketing and advertising department of the NFL Network was to have   draft pick announcements made  . The Texans had their draft picks read from the International Space Station, the Chiefs had picks read from Whiteman Air Force Base, and the Colts had their picks made by  …    well  …    an orangutan at the Indianapolis Zoo. The orangutan announcing the #Colts selection is the pick of the #NFLDraft pic. twitter.   —   Jeffrey Kahn 247 (@jkahn247) April 29, 2017,  This latter innovation did not sit well with Mayock. Following prompts from a zookeeper, the orangutan then tapped a TV screen, which then displayed the name of the player the Colts had selected. Funny, right? I thought so. Mike Mayock did not. According to Pro Football Talk, Mayock said, “If we’re going back to the zoo, I’m walking off the desk. I’ve about had the zoo, OK? Enough. Enough. I mean, is this good TV?” NFL Network’s Rich Eisen introduced the zoo segment with some sarcasm, saying, “If we don’t go to the zoo, the world will stop spinning. ” When the orangutan revealed the Colts’ selection of defensive tackle Grover Stewart, Mayock indicated he thought it was unfair to Stewart to turn one of the most significant moments of his life into a circus. “I think we’ve got to be a little respectful,” Mayock said. “It’s a big day for Grover Stewart, and rather than talking about that chimp, let’s get back to some football here. It’s a big day for him. ” While one can certainly see how having an orangutan announce the fulfillment of your life’s dream to reach the NFL could be considered disrespectful, at some point Mayock also has to understand that he’s in the entertainment business, and not just the sports business, which is something that’s probably quite easy to forget when you’ve been immersed in game tape and analysis of over 400 draft prospects for the last several months. The financial collapse of ESPN has heralded in the start of a new era for much of the sports world. Gone are the salad days when you could just name a price and the   monster would pay it, then eagerly ask for more. Sports leagues and their affiliated news networks can’t be lazy anymore, relying on the financial largesse of the “Magic Kingdom. ” Instead, they’re going to have to make their products more entertaining, lucrative, and productive in order to pay the freight. Does that mean the NFL Network did the right thing in having an orangutan announce a draft pick? No. Personally, I found it funny and thought Mayock completely overreacted about a moment of levity in the midst of      bonanza about football players, the overwhelming majority of whom the country has never heard of before. Maybe I’ve got that wrong, and that’s fine. Here’s what I don’t have wrong: Gimmicky draft selection ideas aren’t going away, and Mike Mayock will not be receiving a Christmas card from the Indianapolis Zoo anytime soon.

4629,Comey Accused Of Interfering In US Presidential Election,"in: Government , Government Corruption , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests (image: REUTERS/Gary Cameron) Had Comey recommended Hillary be held criminally responsible for mishandling classified State Department documents last July, along with perjury for lying to the FBI and Congress, a firestorm of criticism wouldn’t have followed his Friday announcement. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D. NV) accused him of “tarring Secretary Clinton with thin innuendo,” saying his action “appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another” – claiming he “may have broken the law,” citing the 1939 Hatch Act (An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities). It prohibits federal executive branch employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity – exempting the president, vice president and designated high-level administration officials. Proof of intent is required to hold someone culpable under the law. According to the Wall Street Journal , within the FBI, there was “sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national election campaign.” In a prominently featured NYT op-ed , Law Professor Richard Painter said “(w)e cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power.” Not according to former federal prosecutor Daniel Richman, saying “Comey’s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was (his) stated aim.” A Sunday released ABC News/Washington Post poll indicated about a third of likely voters are less likely to support Hillary following Comey’s October surprise. The Washington Post said the Justice Department’s public integrity unit blocked the FBI from investigating the Clinton Foundation, claiming inadequate “evidence to move forward.” The department is run by longtime Bill and Hillary ally, Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Last June, she met privately with the former president at Phoenix’s Sky Harbor airport while Hillary was under FBI investigation – a clear conflict of interest despite her disingenuously claiming “no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body” took place. In a Washington Post op-ed , former attorney general Eric Holder expressed concern about Comey’s “vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest” – claiming he “violated long-standing Justice Department policies and tradition.” Holder disgraced the office he held. Law Professor Francis Boyle called him “a total disaster for the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, Human Rights and the Rule of Law.” Speaking in Florida on Sunday, Hillary changed the subject, saying “there’s a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won’t be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us.” Clearly, Comey’s bombshell changed the dynamic of the race, whether enough to derail her White House bid we’ll know in days. Reports indicate the FBI will examine an astonishing 650,000 emails from former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s laptop – estranged husband of top Hillary aide Huma Abedin. It could take months to review volume this immense, likely extending well beyond November 8 and January’s inauguration, to determine if any evidence warrants prosecuting Hillary, Abedin, Weiner or anyone else for mishandling classified government documents, perhaps compromising national security.

Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 27, 2016 
Megyn [sic] Kelly has continually asserted over the last two weeks that she personally fears that if Donald Trump is elected President, he will use his Presidential powers to grab her by the pussy. 
However, this begs the question: if Megyn [sic] Kelly is so concerned about having her pussy grabbed, why did she pose for this “grab my pussy” photo shoot for GQ? 
Keep in mind, these pictures are from 2010. She wasn’t some dumb college student trying to make a few bucks to pay rent with a quick “grab my pussy” photo shoot. She was already a multi-millionaire Fox News host. 
Last year, when the whore Kelly was attacking Trump as a sexist, he pointed out this “grab my pussy” photo op, and noted that Kelly is a bimbo. 
In response to allegations of bimboism, Kelly told People Magazine : “I was 40, and I was pregnant, I was like, ‘I look pretty good.’“ 
Of course, in woman-speak this translates to “I was 40, and I was pregnant, and I wanted to send the message to random men that they should grab me by the pussy to confirm that I am still attractive.” 
And sure, the pictures do look good, but they are airbrushed all to hell and back 
For instance, she is wearing a push-up bra, but the curvature of her breasts has been corrected and wrinkles have been removed from the place where her breasts connect to her chest and from her neck. Armpit wrinkle removal is also plainly obvious. 
So nothing is proved by these pictures – other than the fact she wants her pussy grabbed. 
In the same year, 2010, she went on the Jew Howard Stern’s show and said that she wanted to fuck Bill O’Reilly, which is bizarre and I believe sick. In this interview she also talked about her breasts and her husband’s penis size. 
(Full interview here .) 
It is not like she didn’t know she was walking into a sex interview here. That is Stern’s entire shtick. And everyone knows who Howard Stern is. 
So the only reason she would go on this show is to sexually objectify herself, which again, is to feel sexy when old and beginning to sag 
All of this simply confirms that Megyn’s continued attacks on Donald Trump – such as we saw Newt Gingrich slap her around like an even cheaper hooker than she actually is for earlier this week – are part of a gigantic shit test against Donald Trump. 
Basically, Kelly’s entire career is now devoted to trying to bully Donald Trump into grabbing her by the pussy. 
Tsk-tsk, Megyn [sic]. 
Tsk-tsk. 
Roger Ailes Firing Conspiracy Confirmed? 
Way back when Fox News chief Roger Ailes was fired – OVER A SEXUAL HARASSMENT HOAX THAT MEGYN [sic] KELLY TOOK PART IN BY SAYING HE HUGGED HER WEIRDLY – I said that it was obviously part of an anti-Trump conspiracy by the station’s owner, Rupert Murdock . 
Murdock, while claiming to be a “conservative,” is an elite globalist and friend of the Clintons. 
Ailes, while not a perfect guy (shilled for Bush’s wars, shilled for Israel), is a friend of Trump and wasn’t going to allow this whore Kelly – as well as a whole bunch of other hosts and pundits – to betray the network’s viewership by shilling for Hillary Clinton. 
Because that is exactly what we are seeing now: a massive betrayal of Donald Trump by the Fox News channel. 
O’Reilly hasn’t been horrible, but he hasn’t been great either. 
The only one who has consistently supported Donald J. Trump is Sean Hannity, and his ratings have now gone through the roof because of it. I’m half-surprised Murdock doesn’t just fire him for it, but I suppose that wouldn’t work, as the entire viewership would boycott the channel. Right now, they can do a lot of damage to Trump by having the majority of their hosts shill for Hillary, but still having a few support Trump so they don’t totally expose themselves as being part of a Clinton conspiracy.",0
4631,"As Protests Flare, Iran Bids Farewell to Rafsanjani - The New York Times","TEHRAN  —   Iranians bade farewell to Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday, with the sprawling state funeral veering slightly off script when groups of mourners started shouting opposition slogans. The authorities were forced to raise the volume on the loudspeakers playing lamentation songs after some in the crowds took up cries of “Oh, Hussein, Mir Hussein,” a reference to a former presidential candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, who has been under house arrest since 2011. Some of the chants were aimed at Russia, Iran’s ally in the Syrian conflict. Video clips on social media showed mourners shouting “Death to Russia” and “the Russian Embassy is the den of espionage,” as they passed the embassy’s complex in the heart of Tehran. People also called for the release of hunger strikers in Iranian prisons. State television, broadcasting the funeral live, airbrushed the protests, which were nevertheless allowed to proceed without police intervention. Mr. Rafsanjani, 82, who died on Sunday, was laid to rest after an elaborate ceremony that lasted several days. Right after his demise, his body was placed in a coffin that was put on public display in the modest house of the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. For two days, mourners had filed through the northern Tehran site, untouched since Mr. Khomeini died in 1989. A religious chanter brought the crowds to tears as he recalled how Mr. Rafsanjani helped to oust Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in the 1979 revolution. “Our sheikh was so wise, he made the shah leave, leave,” the chanter sang. Men gathering on the ground floor bowed their heads in respect, while on the first floor  —   the women’s section  —   mourners in black chadors peeked down. Qassem Soleimani, the general of the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards who runs Iran’s operations in Iraq and Syria, paid his respects, some people said, showing clips of him on their cellphones as proof. Because of Mr. Rafsanjani’s close relationship with Ayatollah Khomeini, he was accorded the honor of being buried in the late leader’s mausoleum, in a golden cage. Before the interment, all Iranians were invited to gather around the campus of the University of Tehran, in the central part of the city, where Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, led a prayer. People showed up early, some wearing scarves around their faces to protect them from the morning cold. Families passed by, pushing strollers carrying babies wearing woolen hats. Students took videos with their cellphones. Shiite clerics in traditional winter robes made of camel’s hair held prayer beads. There were so many people  —   2. 5 million by official estimates  —   that many of the dignitaries and family members invited to the campus were marooned in their cars amid the crowds. Some hid behind curtains others waved at the collection of camera phones. One of Mr. Rafsanjani’s daughters, Faezeh Hashemi, was photographed sticking her head out of the window of a bus and flashing a victory sign. She and her brother Mehdi have been harassed by   for their growing support of reformists and moderates seeking change in Iran. The daughter, an activist for women’s rights and personal freedoms, was jailed in 2011 for making “  propaganda,” while her brother was given leave to attend the funeral from prison, where he was sent on embezzlement charges. In recent years their father, long a staunch conservative, became an unexpected hero to Iran’s middle class. Mr. Rafsanjani sympathized with some demands made by protesters during the   Green Revolution, the antigovernment demonstrations following the disputed   victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. They saw him as a lone voice representing their beliefs in Iran’s establishment. Such deviations from the official line were put aside by the authorities on Tuesday. In death it seemed that Mr. Rafsanjani was to be remembered for his revolutionary credentials, not for his criticisms. Potential troublemakers were not invited. The former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, who was supported by Mr. Rafsanjani, was told not to attend, local websites said. The same apparatus that normally churns out posters showing Uncle Sam with blood dripping from his teeth to burn during     demonstrations, now printed pictures of Mr. Rafsanjani, extolling him as “a man of history, who is immortal. ” In the teeming streets, scenes clashed incongruously. At one point, Ayatollah Khamenei could be heard through loudspeakers saying prayers for Mr. Rafsanjani while protesters chanted opposition slogans. Some wore green wristbands, the color of the opposition, and flashed victory signs. Supporters of the establishment tried to drown out the slogans by shouting “Allahu akbar,” meaning “God is great,” but for the most part they were overmatched. On state television, sound engineers at one point forgot to lower the volume when people shouted, “Hail to Khatami. ” “Hashemi’s death is a great worry to us,” said Leili Farhang, a    university graduate, who emphasized that she was unemployed “like many of my generation. ” She and her friends had showed up in front of the Tehran University campus “to pay respect to a man who respected us. ” It was hard, she and her friends agreed, to come up with the name of anybody within Iran’s establishment to replace Mr. Rafsanjani. Not one has his weight and stature, they concluded: “He will be missed. ” It took hours for the body to arrive at the South Tehran mausoleum, because of “the millions that have come out to honor the ayatollah,” Khabarfori, an Iranian online news channel, said on the Telegram messaging app. Inside the mausoleum, state television showed, a marching band played the national anthem, after which Mr. Rafsanjani’s coffin was placed next to Mr. Khomeini’s, as planned.",0
4632,"Anonymous: ""Soros Has Just Funded Jill Stein To Call For Legal Vote Recount In Election Reversal"" - Conservative Daily Post","
Posted by Alex Cooper | Nov 25, 2016 | Breaking News Hacking Group “Anonymous” Has Issued A CHILLING Announcement 
Something seriously bad is happening right now and it’s about to shift the face of democracy in the free world. 
George Soros is well known by now for his donations to BLM and other extreme leftist groups, not to mention the millions he’s given Hillary. 
Things just went to code red though, because Jill Stein has just initiated a campaign to demand a recount of the vote. 
What is about to happen could possibly cause a civil war. Anonymous, the infamous group responsible for hacking multiple high-level officials and agencies, just made a grave announcement: 
“It’s over, folks. 
They are absolutely taking this from Trump. If you were able to see these stories they already have prepared for us to start running next week, your jaw would hit the ground. 
They are going to “find” that the results were indeed “hacked”. They have everything set in place, and have been ready to play this out for over a week. 
All 3 states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania) are going to be reversed and awarded to Hillary Clinton. Speculations are in the midst of who is pulling the strings, but this is undoubtedly going to happen. 
Start preparing for the news to pour in, NOW. 
When Michigan is reversed, it will send a clear message of irreversible corruption; the state had only paper ballots. Furthermore, the votes have already been certified. The stringent program was designed specifically to defend against cyber attacks.” 
There is already evidence that death threats were sent to multiple electors, but that didn’t work. Jill stein has already raised enough money to trigger a complete recount of the votes in Wisconsin—the other 2 states are even cheaper. This is BAD News 
Trump may have taken Michigan, but it won’t matter. Jill Stein demanded a recount, and as a third party it will be carried out. The election WILL be rigged. January 20 th is literally 2 months away. Do you seriously think they are going to remain idle for 2 months? 
I’m a realist—I call it like it is and I don’t care who I offend. But, do not be mistaken. This is BAD news. 
It’s already happening. Multiple fake “computer experts” have stated there are “anomalies” in the vote that favor Trump. Who have they blamed? Russia. 
So then what happened next? Jill Stein was able to push a recount order on these grounds. If foul play is “detected”, a recount can be initiated (even if the “foul play” is completely false and planned as a scapegoat to initiate the recount for Hillary). Rogue Hacking Groups Like Anonymous And WikiLeaks Gave Us A TREMENDOUS Amount Of Factual Information During The Election Race. This Warning Is Not To Be Taken Lightly. 
But wait a second. How is Jill Stein connected to Hillary and why would the recount benefit Clinton? The answer lies in a serious screw-up that became apparent when a bot was found in the donation system. 
Go to the fundraising website and see for yourself! The campaign was started literally yesterday and already has over $4,000,000 in donations! This Is NO Coincidence. Do You Think A Man Who Has Spent BILLIONS Will Stop Now? The Media Is On His Side, Pushing The Entire Narrative! 
That’s not the scary part though. What gives away the entire operation is the behavior of the donations. The funding came in at an absolutely perfect $160,000 per hour. That wouldn’t be odd, except the donations continued full speed through the middle of the night when all of America was asleep! 
Jill Stein now has the money she needs to initiate the recount. Where did the funds come from? Soros. The mainstream media is pushing the narrative hard right now that the votes were hacked, even In Pennsylvania where that’s not even possible . 
They are openly and brazenly lying about everything. Google, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are all censoring the spread of this information, creating dissent and misinformation. To make things even worse, the establishment has launched a campaign against “fake news”, allowing the mainstream media to dictate reality for hundreds of millions of Americans who receive constant news! 
This is BAD news people, and it’s about to get even worse. There is no reason they would be attempting to pull this stunt unless they had absolute certainty it would execute successfully. 
Please spread word of what is about to come. I will continue to keep you informed, but you must join me in this fight and spread word. This news is being suppressed on literally every channel. We must fight back.

4633,Russia Is Hoarding Gold at Breakneck Pace — The Next Global Conflict Will Be Fought With Currencies - Jay Syrmopoulos,"Citizen journalism with a punch Russia Is Hoarding Gold at Breakneck Pace — The Next Global Conflict Will Be Fought With Currencies 
The fastest-growing gold reserve in the world Print Originally appeared at The Free Thought Project 
With all eyes on Russia’s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the “SATAN” missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow’s most potent “weapon” may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical “weapon” brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia’s native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order – potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift – and much sooner than you might think. bankofrussia-e1475520013798.png 
The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia’s national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed “reset” in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn’t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report : 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led “resistance bloc” breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led “Washington Consensus.” 
For those who don’t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system’s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book “Currency Wars,” wrote that “Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.” Rickards believes a “strong turnaround” is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation’s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman’s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are “an integral part of the state policy” in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia’s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: russiangoldchart.jpg 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia’s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia’s state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider : 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold’s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick’s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It’s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country’s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. Rickards, in his 2011 book “Currency Wars,” theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it’s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF’s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it’s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall – thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it’s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a “weapon.” 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. 
It’s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the “rights” of corporations over that of people .",0

4635,"How Sunflowers Follow the Sun, Day After Day - The New York Times","At dawn, whole fields of sunflowers stand at attention, all facing east, and begin their romance with the rising sun. As that special star appears to move across the sky, young flowers follow its light, looking up, then over and westward, catching one final glance as the sun disappears over the horizon. At night, in its absence, the sunflowers face east again, anticipating the sun’s return. They do this until they get old, when they stop moving. Then, always facing east, the old flowers await visits from insects that will spread their pollen and make new sunflowers. Those flowers too, will follow the sun. It’s not love. It’s heliotropism, and sunflowers are not the only plants that track the sun. But until now, how sunflowers do it has been a mystery. In a study published Friday in Science, researchers revealed that the sunflower’s internal clock and ability to detect light work together, turning on genes related to growth at just the right time to allow the stems to bend with the arc of the sun. The research team also showed that when fully grown, as tall as people in some cases, plants that always face east get a head start, warming up early to attract pollinators. To get to the bottom of sunflowers’ pursuit of the sun, Stacey Harmer and Hagop Atamian, plant biologists at the University of California, Davis, and their colleagues studied sunflowers in fields, pots and growth chambers. First, to find out what the advantage of this solar tracking might be, they prevented outdoor potted sunflowers from tracking the sun. As a result, the plants grew smaller than those that followed the sun. Chasing the sun promoted growth. But what triggered it? The fact that sunflowers switch directions at night to face east again, with no apparent cue, suggested an internal clock at work. The researchers put sunflower plants in a room with lights rigged to mimic the sun’s path on different light and dark cycles. The plants behaved as expected on a   cycle. But during a   day, they were confused. And when plants that had learned a   cycle outdoors were placed under a fixed light indoors, they continued to bend from east to west for a few days, as if following the sun. This meant that a   circadian rhythm was guiding the sunflowers’ movement. But without muscles, how did they move? The answer was in their stems. Like those of other plants, the stems of young sunflowers grow more at night  —   but only on their west side, which is what allows their heads to bend eastward. During the day, the stems’ east side grows, and they bend west with the sun. Dr. Atamian collected samples of the opposite sides of stems from sunflowers periodically, and found that different genes, related to light detection and growth, appeared active on opposite sides of the stems. Now the researchers needed to know why mature sunflowers wind up facing east when they are done growing. They found that   flowers in pots, as opposed to ones they forced to face west at dawn, were warmer and attracted more pollinators. Heating up the   flowers brought in more pollinators as well. The researchers think the plants develop an eastward preference when young, and continue it as mature plants because being warm in the morning when bugs are more active offers an advantage. “If you’ve ever driven across the south of France at the right time of year, there are these huge fields of sunflowers, all facing east. You wonder how they got there, and why they bothered,” said Winslow Briggs, a plant biologist who discovered phototropins, the photoreceptors in plants responsible for their ability to align with the sun. Dr. Briggs, who was not involved in the research, said the study demonstrated how sunflowers do it. But many unknowns remain: For example, just how does the young sunflower weave together light signals, the circadian clock and growth rates to reorient its head every night? While the scientific inquiry continues, perhaps some space remains to imagine sunflowers and their romance with the sun.",0
4636,Hedge Fund Managers Work to Stanch Loss of Investors - The New York Times,"Hedge fund titans once ran their firms like elite private clubs, picking who made it past the velvet rope and how much they would pay for access to supercharged performance. Years of poor performance have now led a number of funds to consider something more like general admission. Some   investors  —   MetLife, American International Group and the New York City pension plan, among them  —   have recently begun to withdraw their money from hedge funds in larger numbers. And the investors who stay are getting a chance to sit at the negotiating table and dictate lower fees and better terms for sharing in the returns that managers make. It’s an unusual position for many hedge fund managers, who as a group are not known for sharing well with others. For decades, hedge funds operated on a “2 and 20” model: Investors paid fees of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gain in any year. When performance was good, the founders of the biggest firms were catapulted to the top of global wealth rankings. Now, in a bid to persuade investors to stay, some managers are sweetening the deal by lowering fees in return for locking up investor money for a longer period of time and setting certain performance targets that if exceeded, investors would pay a fee. For newcomers, managers are even offering the favorable terms once exclusively offered to longtime loyal clients. “Managers are having to negotiate, and investors are demanding much more than they used to in the absence of value,” said Adam I. Taback, head of global alternative investments at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “High fees are like an expensive car,” he said. “It is fine as long as you’re getting performance out of it. ” In recent years, investor criticism of hedge fund underperformance against a roaring stock market was met with frustration by managers who complained that investors couldn’t have their cake and eat it, too. A hedge fund manager’s job was to protect in down years but not outperform in good years, the industry argued. But when markets began to fall last summer, so did hedge fund returns, rendering the point moot for many investors. Over the last 18 months some of the   managers  —   including William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management  —   have consistently lost money. Others that made bets on macroeconomic trends were caught off guard by   bets and had to shutter their firms. And many hedge fund managers found themselves crowded in the same stock. That meant big returns as everyone piled in but even bigger declines when everyone sold out. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, for example, was one of the most popular stocks held by hedge funds in 2015, and its stock price soared to more than $260 a share at one point. But when news of a government investigation came to light and issues with the company’s pricing strategy became apparent, the stock came crashing down. On Friday, Valeant’s share closed at a low of $24. Mr. Ackman, who has been Valeant’s biggest cheerleader, has lost billions of dollars so far on his bet on the company. His Pershing Square Holdings is down 17. 5 percent so far this year through June 7, in large part because of the Valeant position. Other hedge fund titans including Paulson  Company and Viking Global Investors have collectively lost billions of dollars on the Valeant trade. “I see the herd mentality among hedge funds every day,” Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, said at the SkyBridge Alternatives, or SALT, hedge fund conference in Las Vegas last month. Describing how some funds spend “two seconds” on one theme before deciding to put investor money behind the idea, she added: “We pay 2 and 20 for treatment like this. I am reflecting that maybe we are not making the right decision. ” All of this has prompted some   within the industry. “We are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds,” Daniel S. Loeb, the founder of the hedge fund Third Point, wrote to investors in a recent letter, describing a “catastrophic period” for the industry. But for some investors, acknowledgment of poor performance is not enough. In September 2014, the nation’s biggest pension fund, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, announced plans to liquidate its $4 billion hedge fund holdings on concerns that the investments were too expensive and too complicated. In April this year, the pension fund for New York City civil employees voted to exit its portfolio of $1. 5 billion in hedge fund investments. Some insurance companies have shown their displeasure, too. “We had a very negative experience in hedge funds,” Peter D. Hancock, the chief executive of A. I. G. told investors earlier this year. The insurance group plans to pull about half of its $11 billion in hedge fund holdings. MetLife, another insurance giant that has roughly $1. 8 billion invested in hedge funds, has been sending out redemption requests to those managers. Steven Goulart, its chief investment officer, recently told shareholders that the exit was prompted by inconsistent performance. The market environment will “continue to be challenging for hedge funds,” he added. Investors pulled $15. 1 billion from the industry in the first quarter of the year. But these exits are a drop in the ocean compared with the $2. 9 trillion the industry manages. Other institutional investors, meanwhile, continue to pump money in. Still, the pressure is mounting. “Now the fact that people are willing to cut, you’re going to see pressure on managers who are not at the top of the pyramid are going to have to cut,” said Mark W. Yusko, the chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital. In a move that is largely   in the industry, Mr. Robbins recently apologized to investors in an attempt to stem the outflow of investor money from his firm. He pledged to “right the ship as quickly as possible” and even offered investors the opportunity to put more money into a new fund that would waive fees. Mr. Robbins has continued to lose money this year. Investors in his flagship fund have lost 6. 5 percent as of the end of May. So Mr. Robbins is now offering more favorable redemption terms, allowing existing investors that add more money into the fund to step into the shoes of investors that have left, according to three people briefed on the firm’s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. As long as performance continues to lag, hedge funds will be scrutinized and hedge fund giants will be at a disadvantage. David Rubenstein the billionaire   of the private equity firm Carlyle Group, perhaps summed up the sentiment best when he told an audience of money managers at the SALT conference in May, “Please don’t be embarrassed about the industry. ” In case there was any hesitation, Mr. Rubenstein added: “We shouldn’t be upset about what we do. We should be proud. ”",0
4637,It’s Not Over Yet: “They May Be Trying To Steal Arizona And Michigan” | Calls For Electoral College To Ignore Will Of People,"
You didn’t think she’d go down without a fight did you?
The Clinton campaign is clawing it’s way to what they hope may land Hillary in the White House. Though Clinton officially conceded the race to Trump on Wednesday morning, a concession is not legally binding. During the 2000 election Al Gore conceded to George Bush on the night of the election, only to begin court proceedings a few short hours later to contest the results and initiate recounts.
According to Jim Stone , the race between Trump and Clinton may not be over just yet:
They may be trying to steal Arizona and Michigan, and then use special powers to flip 9 electoral votes away from Trump. THERE IS A REASON WHY THEY HAVE REFUSED TO MAKE THEIR TOTALS OFFICIAL. THIS IS NOT OVER YET 
…
Trump won Arizona. Why has it not been made official? Trump won Michigan. Why has it not been made official? They are calling the counts “unofficial,” WHY?
Election officials in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire are still counting votes. The vote differentials while the counts conclude are so close that Clinton could potentially inch out a win with early voting ballots and provisional ballots. The small difference in votes in most of these states could trigger recounts. And given what we know about the Clinton campaign, we suspect that any recount would bring with it the real possibility of “uncounted votes” being discovered in back closets, much like we saw in Florida during the 2000 election debacle. 
Newsweek confirms that Clinton still has a chance:
AP analyst Michael McDonald says he is skeptical that Trump won Wisconsin, as the AP projected. If that state flips for Clinton and she wins the other toss-up states, she and Trump could be in a tie at 269 votes each .
“Maybe Clinton actually wins Wisconsin,” McDonald says. “Look, just because the media calls something does not mean that that’s actually the outcome of the election.”
In that event that neither candidate hits the 270 electoral vote threshold, the vote for President would be passed on to the Repoublican controlled House of Representatives and the vote for Vice President would be put before the Senate, also controlled by Republicans.
One might say this is a no-brainer, except we have two words: #NEVERTRUMP.
The NeverTrump movement, started by conservatives and championed publicly and privately by sitting U.S. Congressional leaders, could potentially steal the win right out from under Donald Trump.
Though unlikely, it remains a distinct possibility. 
And never to go without a Plan B, as John Podesta hinted on election night , Clinton has a second option, which involves targeting the electoral college directly.
Change.org has already filed a petition that includes 361,000 signatures as of this writing asking members of red States’ Electoral College to turn on the will of the people of their state and cast a vote for Hillary instead of Trump. The situation would not be unprecedented, as there have been 157 “faithless electors” since the inception of the College in 1787. None of those faithless votes ever resulted in a significant shift in the election. Electors are bound by most states to cast the vote for their pledged party and failure to do so comes with fines and, in some cases, jail time.
What it boils down to is that Hillary could conceivably flip 10 Electors to her side, however unlikely of a scenario that is:
Petition Excerpt: 
On December 19, the Electors of the Electoral College will cast their ballots. If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win. However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! 
We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton. Why?
Mr. Trump is unfit to serve. His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic.
Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.
Hillary won the popular vote. The only reason Trump “won” is because of the Electoral College.
But the Electoral College can actually give the White House to either candidate. So why not use this most undemocratic of our institutions to ensure a democratic result?
We can fully expect Hillary Clinton to push, even if she does so from behind the scenes.
We expect that within hours or days the push from the liberal media will be widespread and the thousands of protesters taking over major cities across America will be calling for recounts, faithless electoral votes and revolution.
It’s definitely not over until the electoral votes are cast on December 19.

4639,"‘Ghostbusters’ Is No. 2, Behind ‘Secret Life of Pets,’ but Sony’s Giddy - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   “We got one!” Those words, shouted by a   Annie Potts in the 1984 version of “Ghostbusters,” summed up the feeling on the Sony Pictures lot on Sunday, as the   studio released a remake of that comedy to solid results. The new “Ghostbusters,” directed by Paul Feig and featuring women in the main roles, took in about $46 million over the weekend at theaters in the United States and Canada. It was only good enough for second place, behind Illumination Entertainment’s “The Secret Life of Pets” (Universal) which collected an estimated $50. 6 million in its second weekend, for a new domestic total of $203. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. But ticket sales for “Ghostbusters” were strong enough to merit revelry nonetheless. “We’re totally ecstatic,” Josh Greenstein, Sony’s president of marketing and distribution, said by phone. Resuscitating any film franchise that has been absent from theaters for 27 years (ever since “Ghostbusters II” arrived in 1989) is extremely difficult. In this case, Sony had the additional challenge of facing down internet trolls unhappy about the casting of Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Kristen Wiig. In Hollywood, trouble like “Ghostbusters” faced before its release can either prompt damaging studio infighting, as executives squabble over what to do, or it can galvanize a management team in new ways. Sony, currently in last place among the six major studios as measured by annual domestic ticket sales, has undergone an extreme makeover in the last 17 months, with Thomas E. Rothman taking over as movie chief in February 2015. “The team really pulled together,” Mr. Greenstein said. Even so, Sony and Village Roadshow spent $144 million to make “Ghostbusters”  —   ads cost at least $100 million more  —   leaving the film a long way from profitability. Sony is counting on foreign ticket sales, although China, the world’s No. 2 box office market, is unlikely to clear the   film for release. Mr. Greenstein said he expected the generously reviewed reboot to perform well in the weeks ahead. “Paul’s movies have big, huge, high multiples, and there are no big comedies on the horizon,” he said. Amid more straightforward summer remakes and sequels, “the movie is both new and nostalgic, which makes it stand out,” he added. For the weekend, “The Legend of Tarzan” (Warner Bros.) was third, taking in about $11. 1 million, for a   total of $103. 1 million. Also of note: Woody Allen’s “Café Society” (Lionsgate) got off to a strong start in five theaters, collecting $355, 000.",0
4640,G.O.P. Senators Suggest Changes for Health Care Bill Offered by House - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A day after a harsh judgment by the Congressional Budget Office on the House plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act, nervous Senate Republicans on Tuesday suggested changes to the bill. They told Trump administration officials  —   including the health secretary, Tom Price  —   that they wanted to see lower insurance costs for poorer, older Americans and an increase in funding for states with high populations of    people. They said those changes would greatly improve the chances of Senate approval even though they might further alienate conservatives. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership, said Senate Republicans could take steps to make the bill “more helpful to people on the lower end. ” The Congressional Budget Office’s official assessment of the American Health Care Act  —   House Republicans’ proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act  —   put President Trump and Republican congressional leaders on the defensive. The budget office predicted an increase of 24 million people without health insurance by 2026 under the Republican plan, while forecasting $337 billion in deficit reduction over the same period. Speaker Paul D. Ryan was counting on that deficit reduction  —   as well as tax cuts for high earners and insurance and medical device companies  —   to entice members whose Republican constituents want to see the law crumble. He is facing critics from different factions in his party, including conservatives who say the bill does not represent the wholesale replacement of President Barack Obama’s signature health law that Republicans pledged, and more moderate members concerned that thousands of constituents will lose coverage. Because Democrats are expected to vote as a bloc against the House bill, Republicans cannot afford many defections when the bill is expected to come to a vote next week. But by underscoring the bill’s effect on the ranks of the uninsured, Congress’s official scorekeeper, the C. B. O. made wavering Senate Republicans all the more skittish of the House’s legislation. Any of the changes that senators are seeking would almost certainly alienate conservative House Republicans who already believe the bill is too generous. “The C. B. O. score has modified the dynamics,” said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey. “It’s incumbent upon our leadership in the House to make sure that whatever is being discussed has the ability to pass in the Senate,” Mr. Lance said, “and I do not believe that that is currently the case. ” Mr. Trump was left to strike a balance between siding with House Republicans while also distancing himself from the details, with top aides conceding that the legislation needed modifications before it could pass the full Congress. On Tuesday, the president talked with House leaders about revisions to address the concerns of the most conservative members, and to Republican senators who fear the measure headed to the House floor would be too costly for older residents. The C. B. O. report clarified just who stood to lose the most under the Republican plan, which in effect would shift health insurance costs from younger, healthier Americans to older, sicker Americans. Under current law, insurers cannot charge older adults more than three times what they charge young adults for the same coverage. The House bill would allow insurers to expand that to   . Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, noted that Americans over 60 who earn a little too much to qualify for Medicaid would “have a hard time affording insurance” under the House plan, since insurance premiums would rise far higher than the modest tax credits on offer. “That’s not good,” he said. The House bill includes large transition grants to the states that can be used to help cover people with   medical conditions, subsidize insurance purchases beyond the bill’s tax credits, or other interventions some Senate Republicans would seek to make those bigger as well. Mr. Thune wants to revise the tax credits so that they would be focused more on   people. The changes sought by Senate Republicans could upend White House efforts to shore up support from Mr. Ryan’s conservative flank. On Tuesday, several of the most conservative members of the House continued to voice their opposition. “Leadership’s public positions have pretty much been ‘this is the bill, take it or leave it’ kind of approach,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, adding, “I have no indication that it has changed. ” And if changes are not made, conservatives are balking. “I’m a no,” Representative Dave Brat, Republican of Virginia, said in an interview on Tuesday. “The C. B. O. report doesn’t really affect my calculation too much. ” Mr. Ryan’s calculus at this point is less strategic (how to actually get a bill that would replace the health care law to final passage) than tactical (how to muster enough votes to get the measure through the chamber he leads). House Republicans portrayed the intraparty divisions as minor. “I think what we unite upon is much greater than what divides us in this,” Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for part of the repeal measure, said on Fox News Tuesday. Mr. Ryan is counting on Mr. Trump, whom he talks to almost daily, to help win passage of the bill in the House. The speaker would then leave it to Senate Republicans to decide if they want to be the ones to refuse to honor the longstanding Republican promise to repeal the law. Mr. Trump, though, has remained leery of Mr. Ryan since the campaign, when the speaker publicly voiced skepticism about Mr. Trump. That point was reinforced this week when Breitbart News, a   website and frequent Ryan critic, released comments by Mr. Ryan from October that were critical of Mr. Trump. And House conservatives continued to oppose the bill, which Representative Mo Brooks, Republican of Alabama, described in an interview with CNN as “still the largest welfare program ever proposed by the Republican Party. ” But the very elements of the bill that conservatives, whose votes will be needed for final House passage, want changed are the very things that many Republican senators, who have a far broader base of constituents, are fighting to maintain or enhance. That is true even in Republican states where the law has helped many patients, especially those who are too young for Medicare but aging and thus more costly to insure. “The way to get to yes is to pass legislation that honors our promise to repeal Obamacare and that drives down costs,” said Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, arguing that the House bill did not do enough to drive down insurance premiums. Mr. Ryan was also not getting any support from Republican governors, who are trying to figure how they can roll back Medicaid expansion without leaving poor and older residents uninsured. “Their bill needs to be the starting point, not the ending one,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican, said in an interview. There is additional pressure on Republicans from groups like AARP, the lobby for older Americans that is fighting provisions of the House bill that could significantly increase health insurance premiums for older Americans. “The bill will dramatically increase health care costs for      who purchase health care through an exchange,” said Joyce A. Rogers, a senior vice president of AARP, who denounced the plan as an “age tax. ” Hospitals, with billions of dollars at stake, also stepped up lobbying against the House bill. A coalition of health care providers and advocates, the Alliance for Healthcare Security, is running television advertisements describing the harm that it says could come from curtailing the expansion of Medicaid. The ads are running in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia and are meant to influence senators from those states. “Tell your senator, these Medicaid cuts hurt real people,” one advertisement says. Susan Van Meter, a senior vice president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, recently led a delegation of hospital executives in a lobbying trip to Capitol Hill. The proposed changes in Medicaid, she said, “are, by far, the most worrisome provisions of the bill, would be disastrous for patients and could create a fiscal crisis for New York. ”",0

In February, the model's creator, Helmut Norpoth, gave Trump a 97 percent chance of becoming No. 45 if he got the GOP nomination, though the model now gives Trump an 87 percent chance.Norpoth's model predicts general election results based on how the candidate does in his or her party's primary. Norpoth applied the model to past elections and says it worked for every presidential election except one since 1912.""My feeling always has been, what I saw in the primaries, was that Donald Trump did very well,"" Norpoth said. ""He beat a large field. According to my metric about how primaries are shaping up, he did better than Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, so that gave him a leg up.""There are a couple of issues with this. Usually, candidates shift their message after the primary to appeal to voters outside their base. Trump isn't doing that. His speeches haven't changed much, if at all, and he's not really bringing anyone new into his tent.Also, the model doesn't factor in anything that's actually happening in the country at the time. And factors like the economy, the incumbent president's approval numbers and the country's demographics all affect how people cast their vote in November.Outside of Norpoth's model, basically every other measurement out there shows Donald Trump's chance of winning 270 electoral votes is super slim. But, hey, this is 2016, and if we've learned anything, it's that there is nothing normal about this election cycle. Page 1",0
4643,The Hyperinflationary Death Watch,"Home » Headlines » Finance News » The Hyperinflationary Death Watch 
Every hyperinflation is unique. No one wants the chaos it will bring. We are not rooting for it. Monetary crisis is always part and parcel or a extension of the inevitable cycles of history. The DEATH WATCH has begun… 

From Dr. Jeffrey Lewis : 
An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense – perhaps more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez-faire – that gold and economic freedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other. – Alan Greenspan 
Every hyperinflation is unique. No one wants the chaos it will bring. We are not rooting for it. Monetary crisis is always part and parcel or a extension of the inevitable cycles of history. 
The current path will at some point become yet another statistic. Like each currency collapses that has come before it, the next one will be burned into the viscera and the psyche of a generation. It should serve as a warning, though sadly it will likely be forgotten again as the collective memory fades. 
Here is an excellent summary of the underlying process from the How Fiat Dies blog: 
Isn’t the U.S. very different from Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe? 
Each case of hyperinflation is unique, so if you are looking for differences you will always find them. You need to understand the common characteristics. Hyperinflation happens because government debt gets over 80% of GNP and deficit gets over 40% of spending. It does not matter how you get into that situation. Hyperinflation works the same if you lose a foreign war, a civil war, a dictator goes crazy, a government with excessive foreign debt, nationalizing too many businesses, rampant corruption, productive collapse, excessive regulation, a regime change, too many taxpayers fleeing high taxes, a massive depression, or whatever. It just matters that the government is spending nearly twice what they get in taxes and has already borrowed more than is reasonable. When they are in this situation they cannot borrow more, except from the central bank under their control. So they get the central bank to make money and “loan” it to them. When the reality is the only way they can pay back that “loan” from the central bank is by first getting another “loan” from the central bank, you are probably headed for hyperinflation. 
Another problem is that people often compare the U.S. before hyperinflation to some country during hyperinflation, which is not a fair comparison. For example, after prices are shooting up and interest rates go up, no banks will be making 30 year loans. So people will say the fact that the U.S. is making loans shows that it is different than some country with hyperinflation. This is silly. Of course, a country that does not yet have hyperinflation is different from a county in the midst of hyperinflation. The real trick is recognizing the circumstances that lead to hyperinflation. 
When a country gets hyperinflation, there are a number of stages it goes through. 
Things are very different as hyperinflation progresses. 
The Buffet Paradox 
Watch as they do, not as they say. 
Quote from Warren Buffet’s father, Howard Buffet: 
“I warn you that politicians of both parties will oppose the restoration of gold, although they may outwardly seemingly favor it. Unless you are willing to surrender your children and your country to galloping inflation, war and slavery, then this cause demands your support. For, if human liberty is to survive in America, we must win the battle to restore honest money.” 
The irony is nearly absurd. Warren Buffett and his partner Charlie are the archetypes of the ant-capitalist movement. 
They are perceived to be the enemies of precious metals. 
Why does this dynamic duo scorn precious metals? 
Because they need the system in tact. Their survival depends on the mainstream buying it. They are to the mainstream culture, as Goldman Sacs is to their clients. There is no awareness; no punishment for recommending a flawed strategy for your clients that enriches your owners. 
In essence, this is manipulation gone wild. It is what the bullion banks accomplish with their interventions. They move the price, paint sentiment, induce buying and scoop up the real assets. 
Buffet is buying physical assets and infrastructure. Energy and transportation to move that energy. Essentially, he is dumping dollars. And it is perfectly rational from the mainstream perspective. 
Simply follow the money. He is no different than you or I who, instead, dump dollars for hard assets and the infrastructure to store it. 
Growth is the key, velocity is the myth. 
Have you ever seen an economy in which it’s so easy to borrow, but so hard to earn? 
That is the key – the juxtaposition of no growth and low interest rates. It is unsustainable – and as the system fails incrementally, the very medication applied will be increased. 
We have billions of dollars of corporate buybacks pushing stocks higher. This is a far cry from real growth. 
The socialization of the U.S. mortgage market – where privately issued mortgages (unbacked by government guarantees) have virtually vanished. 
The unemployment number farce; if you remove enough potential workers from the count, the unemployment plummets toward zero. Orwell is twitching in his grave. 
The U.S. economy contracted by 2% in the first quarter of 2014, managing to wipe out $100 billion in economic growth from the initial forecast for Q1 GDP. 
But what is more compelling is that if one excludes the artificial stimulus to the U.S. economy generated from the Obamacare Q1 taxpayer-subsidized scramble, Q1 GDP would have contracted, not by 1%, but by 2%! 
All of this comes with good intentions centered on the belief that intervention on this scale will magically lead to an economy that no longer needs extreme manipulations to sustain itself. 
The monkey’s conclusion after the fish dies is that he should have done more sooner. This echoes all the way up to the most powerful money policy makers, including the infamous Ben Bernanke and his narrow belief that the first Great Depression could have been avoided if more aggressive monetary measures had been implicated. 
The calm before the storm. 
Today, we have the spectacle of stagnant wages and rising prices. 
Currently, we don’t have hyperinflation. We have steady, grinding, and relentless inflation. 
It’s not the inflation that makes you think of wheelbarrows. It’s the sort of inflation that quietly eats your grandchildren. 
Growth is the life blood of all organic systems. If an economy is not moving forward, it is dying. Organic growth in this iteration has all but vanished. Short term pain for long term gain is an anathema. Long written off and socialized out of the vernacular. This is the ultimate signal of impending collapse. And it is right in front of us. 
The next hyperinflation will very quickly become an historic anomaly difficult to relate with. Yet we can see the current experiment evolving right before our eyes. If only we dare to look and take action. 2017 Gold Pandas and 2017 Silver Pandas Are Now Available! Secure Your 2017 Panda Coins Today at SD Bullion!",0

LONDON – England – Treachery comes in many forms, and the insipid vile traitor, Lord Kerr, is a stain on everything that is British. 


By calling the British people ‘stupid’ he in fact reveals himself to be an unintelligent pustule of treasonous puss seeping through the veins of the unelected House of Lords. 
The Europhile peer has claimed Britain needs intelligent migrants to come to the UK because ‘native’ Britons are ‘so bloody stupid’. 
Here is a man who has benefited highly from British taxpayers, who have serviced his chauffeur driven limousines, his first class flights, his mansions, and privately educated his children, calling the people ‘stupid’. 
Maybe the taxpayer has been stupid to finance this maggot of a human, a contemptuous traitor willing to sell Britain off to the lowest bidder. 
As for the intelligent migrants he speaks of, yes there are a few, but the majority are now selling copies of the Big Issue outside your local train station, or receiving vast amounts of state subsidies, burdening the NHS, and overcrowding the schools. Something Lord Maggot Kerr would not know about since he lives in his taxpayer funded mansions replete with duck houses and luxury. 
What he does not understand is that the premise of Brexit is not to halt migration completely but to control it. We are not against controlled migration, we are against unfettered uncontrolled migration. 
If there ever were a time to bury these cockroaches infesting the House of Lords, now would be a good time to begin. Share on :",0
4645,"Kidnapped Border Patrol Agent Was Hacked with Machete, Suspects Caught","Suspects in the kidnapping and attack of a U. S. Border Patrol agent have been captured and an official statement from authorities reveals that the agent was hacked with a machete. Breitbart Texas first reported on the issue and first reported the identity of one of the suspects. In this case, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) first tried to keep the matter from the public and then downplayed aspects of the attack. [The first report on the June 9, 2017, kidnapping and attack, “Border Patrol Agent Found injured on Side of Roadway after Attack,” revealed that the issue had occurred and that CBP had not prioritized alerting the public or other Border Patrol agents.  The second report, “Border Patrol Agent was Kidnapped, FBI Leads Investigation,” relied on Breitbart Texas sources who had provided the actual BOLO (Be On Lookout) that was sent to law enforcement officers and agents on the matter. The third report, “FBI’s Suspect in Kidnapping of Border Agent is   Deported 3 Times Prior,” revealed all of the details of the BOLO, named the suspect, and source claims that the listed suspect had been deported three times prior to the attack. The recently released official statement directly confirms most of the information Breitbart sources provided. Other aspects, such as the immigration status of one of the suspects, is left unconfirmed by authorities though implied in the fact that one of the suspects’ residences is mentioned and the alleged illegal immigrant’s place of residence is omitted. The official statement from the Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Department is provided in full below: TWO MEN SUSPECTED IN ATTACK OF   AGENT IN CUSTODY,             Two men accused in the brutal attack of an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on June 9 are in custody.             On Tuesday, FBI agents in the El Paso Sector, with the assistance of Doña Ana County Sheriff’s detectives, arrested    Sergio Ivan   on an outstanding warrant of aggravated battery (great bodily harm) and aggravated assault. He is currently in custody at the El Paso County Detention Center awaiting extradition to Doña Ana County. Thursday,    Fernando Puga of Las Cruces was taken into custody by Doña Ana County Sheriff’s detectives with the assistance of FBI agents. Puga is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and attempted murder.  He is currently being held at the Doña Ana County Detention Center on a $1 million cash bond.             According to court documents filed by sheriff’s detectives,   and Puga confronted an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on Friday, June 9, as the agent was reportedly helping his mother at her tamale stand near the intersection of Stan Roberts and McCombs in northeast El Paso.             The agent reportedly left in his vehicle with   and Puga.             At approximately 11:40 p. m. that same night, a sheriff’s deputy was dispatched to Paradise Lane, just off Shalem Colony Trail west of Las Cruces. Upon his arrival, the deputy reported finding a    male subject who appeared to be suffering from multiple lacerations to his head and arms.             The male subject was later identified as the   agent who reportedly left with   and Puga from northeast El Paso. The victim said the two men were armed with a gun and a machete. Detectives say the victim was struck repeatedly with the machete.             The gun was later discovered to be a pellet gun.             Sheriff’s detectives began to piece together details of the attack with an earlier call for service, one that happened just before 9 p. m. on the same night in the 100 block of Amparo Road in Chaparral.     Deputies responded to that location on what was initially believed to be an unrelated domestic dispute. When they arrived, it was learned that   had been at the house, demanding to see his  . The woman’s sister told deputies   threatened her with what appeared to be a handgun. The sister described the vehicle   was in as an   red Nissan  —   the same vehicle that sheriff’s deputies located on the side of McCombs Road, just south of the New   state line. The vehicle matched the description provided by the victim on Amparo Road. Physical descriptions of the two suspects also matched between the victim on Amparo Road, the agent and his mother.

4646,NRA to Campaign Against Red State Democrats who Oppose Gorsuch - Breitbart,"With a vote on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch fast approaching, the NRA is making clear they will campaign against Red State Democrats who vote against the nominee. [There are number of Senate Democrats from Red States who are up for   in 2018. Gateway Pundit published a list of names that included Senators Tammy Baldwin ( )  Sherrod Brown ( ) Joe Donnelly ( ) Heidi Heitkamp ( ) Joe Manchin ( ) Clair McCaskill ( ) Bill Nelson ( ) and Jon Tester ( ) among others.  Democrats in this list who vote against a Gorsuch confirmation will not only find themselves campaigning against a Republican challenger but against the NRA as well. The Washington Examiner quoted a letter from   executive director Chris Cox, in which he wrote, “The NRA has every confidence that Judge Gorsuch will protect the Second Amendment rights of law abiding gun owners and will faithfully apply the Constitution in the cases that come before him. He has our strongest support for confirmation. ” Cox added, “Because of the importance of this issue to NRA members and gun owners throughout the country, votes on his confirmation will be considered in future candidate evaluations and we will notify our members accordingly. ” The New York Times shows that Senators Baldwin, Brown, Donnelly, Heitkamp, McCaskill, Nelson, and Tester already voted against the confirmation of   Amendment Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Those votes, plus any votes against Gorsuch, could only be expected to unleash the NRA’s unfettered campaigning power against the Red State Democrats. It is also interesting to note that President Trump won all eight states represented above: Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, North Dakota, Missouri, Florida, Montana, and West Virginia. This alone puts added pressure on the Senators, should they vote against the nominee Trump put forward to save the Second Amendment from the machinations of the left.

4647,STUNNER: CHRISTIANS BANNED FROM CHRISTIAN CHURCH,"STUNNER: CHRISTIANS BANNED FROM CHRISTIAN CHURCH 
For the same reason – a forced conversion to a mosque. 
It’s happening as the Islamist agenda of Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan advances. 
The recent forced move came against the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, often described as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. 
“Islamists have detested that fact for years,” reported Michael Van Der Galien at PJ Media. 
“After all, it is a Christian church, and therefore a Christian symbol. That’s why the Ottoman Turks wasted little time transforming the church into a mosque when they invaded and conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) centuries ago. Christian symbols and works of art were destroyed or covered, and a dominating tower was built from which the Islamic call to prayer could be sung.” 
He explained, “The Ottomans did that because they wanted to show Christians that, from then onwards, Islam was in power. Christianity would be subjugated.” Read more at http://www.wnd.com/2016/11/turkeys-descent-into-islamist-tyranny-deepens/#Du0BeTVXDtrtp7q5.99",0
4648,Independence Days: My Perfect Imperfect Gap Year - The New York Times,"Midway through a lackluster freshman year at the University of San Diego, I called my parents and told them I planned to leave school after the spring semester. They took the news pretty well considering they had just shelled out more than $50, 000 in tuition and living expenses at one of the ritziest private universities in the country, a university where the gym bears the name of the dietitian Jenny Craig and some dorms feature an ocean view. Here, you could easily graduate unaware that 1 in 10 students at surrounding California State universities is estimated to be homeless. I listened to my father’s objections as I walked to the west edge of campus, passing the university’s big, whitewashed buildings, its meditation garden and its infinity pool, before I reached a spot where I could see San Diego’s entire Mission Bay and, beyond that, the Pacific. “If you leave now,” my father said, “you’ll never go back. ” He asked me to get permission from the school so I could return after a year, and I agreed. This made my departure a gap year  —   something I hadn’t considered up to that point. A lot of other Americans hadn’t either, until the White House announced that President Obama’s oldest daughter, Malia, would take one before attending Harvard next fall. In coverage of Malia’s decision, conservative and liberal media alike called out the perceived elitism of gap years: “Malia Obama Taking a Gap Year Is the Ultimate Sign of Luxury” read the The New York Post headline. “Malia Obama’s ‘Gap Year’ Is Part of a Growing (and Expensive) Trend,” said The New York Times. Slate posed the question “Gap Years for Everyone?”  —   speculating that “a   student who spends a year working to save up money would probably just call the experience ‘life. ’’u2009” Commenters on Twitter further demonstrated negativity: The idea that gap years are inherently elitist may be due to the potentially high cost of travel and of independent programs, which offer a structured experience  —   typically of adventure, service and more or less education  —   that can cost upward of $20, 000. But that criticism cuts against the realities most students already face  —   that is, average   tuition and fees of $8, 940, or $28, 308 at private colleges, according to the College Board. When factoring in room, board and other expenses, this would mean spending about $100, 000 over five years at public colleges and more than double that at private ones. After five years, only 53 percent of students at public colleges have graduated. The remaining students will have racked up absurdly high expenses on the way to earning, or not earning, a degree. For them, regardless of what   background they come from, time away from campus seems prudent. I certainly wasn’t alone in failing to think carefully before committing to college. I sometimes took three trips a day to the beach with other students. By second semester, most of my friends were less concerned with final exams than with finding the coolest house the fewest steps from the beach to live in the following year. And I would have been too, if I had stayed. I was already failing at least one class. And although my grades were not poor enough to be asked to leave school, I had lost the motivation to do anything but fulfill the minimum course requirements. I felt guilty for wasting so much money and I couldn’t see doing the same thing for three more years. Although I appreciated my parents’ support, I also recognized the extent to which it had become detrimental. Their attempts to eliminate any possibility of real failure had guaranteed its own kind of failure. Financial dependence had enabled me to make a major life decision, the decision to go to college, without taking personal ownership of it. I had managed to avoid thinking about why a degree mattered to me or how I hoped it would enrich my life. When applying to colleges, I had put down whatever fluff my high school counselors suggested for my admissions essays and was accepted by a few schools whose campus scenery had attracted me far more than the course offerings. A gap year presented itself as a chance to claim the independence that formalized education had not encouraged. It was an opportunity to discover a sense of purpose outside of school, to prompt some thinking on those questions before graduating. Without classes and the path to a degree as a crutch that gave structure to my days, I’d be forced to create a structure of my own. But my father wasn’t convinced that a gap year was the right decision. He let me know that if I left school, I wouldn’t receive any financial support. At the time, I viewed this as a threat. Now I see it as a first step toward allowing me the freedom I needed. I knew this wasn’t an easy concession for him. The dependence that many parents encourage  —   throughout college and even after their children leave home  —   is now commonplace. In her book “Parenting to a Degree,” the sociologist Laura T. Hamilton documents cases in which a parent comes to the rescue with homework help or buys a daughter clothes so she fits in better with her sorority sisters. What’s often lost in these stories  —   and the predictable rants on the negative effects of helicopter parenting  —   is the question of what responsibility children have, as they get older, to put an end to patterns of dependency. It was difficult making a clean break from those patterns to figure out what I wanted to do for the unstructured year ahead. Most of the information I found on gap years was written for parents, by parents. It seemed to miss the point, at least the point as I saw it: to loosen the parental grip so that students can develop an educational framework of their own. While working summer jobs to save money, I found an internship at Surfer magazine in Orange County and reported for duty in late August. I slept in my car the first two nights and rinsed off in the ocean before work until I found an affordable place to rent, and because the internship was unpaid, a job at a   store where I could work evenings. As I quickly learned, a food store that defines itself by what it doesn’t have tends to attract a   clientele. I took turns providing customers with my   and stocking shelves, which I did with a recent college graduate who could not find employment that put his degree to good use and with a woman who claimed to hate the taste of water so much that she drank only juice. This wasn’t the kind of job I wanted to hold for the rest of my working days. Showing up at the store after a day at Surfer, where the editors had some level of engagement with the tasks at hand, prompted career reflection like never before. It was refreshing, after a school year filled with so much apathy, to meet people who seemed to actually care about their work. At the same time, entering the work force made the burden of assuming debt  —   and my own privileged ability to attend college free of loans  —   visible in ways that continuing on in school would have never allowed. I came to realize what it meant to take a college education for granted. Aside from opportunities for unpaid internships, I found few   options for learning experiences during my gap year. According to the nonprofit American Gap Association, about 1 percent of students in the United States take gap years. By contrast, in Australia and certain European countries, gap years are encouraged as part of the educational process 17 percent of students in the United Kingdom participate in a gap year, according to one study by its department of education. More colleges in the United States are encouraging applicants to consider a “bridge” year before enrolling, and many independent programs and some campuses  —   like Florida State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Princeton and Tufts  —   even offer fellowships and financial aid. Ethan Knight, the executive director at the American Gap Association, still sees the need for greater support to encourage a more diverse set of students to participate. “You can get access to Pell funding to go to beauty school,” he said. “There’s certainly as much learning to be had in a gap year as there is in beauty school. So why shouldn’t students be able to earn access to Pell and other government grants for certain gap year experiences?” Mr. Knight pointed to   opportunities that could be valuable, such as traveling abroad to learn languages that the State Department views as critical. But federal grants are contingent on receiving college credit, making them unavailable to anyone taking a year off school. In its own way, my limited options became a rewarding educational challenge. In the winter, I moved to Puerto Rico, scrubbed dishes in a locally owned hotel restaurant for $5 an hour, found a used car for $450, and shared a   for $400 a month. I ate leftovers off dirty dishes in the restaurant. I cleaned the deep fryers, the   garbage bins and the vomit left in the bathrooms by   East Coast vacationers. All the other employees at the restaurant spoke in Spanish, and I was perceived as dumb for not speaking fluently. I’d seen the same thing happen at home to   whose first language was not English, although it had never fully registered until our roles were reversed. Experiencing these humiliations was a lot easier knowing I had the freedom to leave at any time. Still, it poked holes in my comfort with, and blindness to, some of the inequalities I had grown up with, making them harder to ignore when I left the restaurant behind. And I did leave the restaurant behind, as soon as I had saved enough money to travel for a few months. I bought a plane ticket to Indonesia, rented a motorbike there, and traveled island to island by ferry. The trip was not without its mishaps. To name a few: I was bitten by a monkey got in a motorbike accident lost a good amount of skin on my hands, chest, back, legs and feet in numerous brushes with coral while surfing got a raging ear infection surfing too close to a polluted river mouth after it rained. I did not want my parents to worry, and so I took care to avoid mentioning these hiccups in sporadic calls and emails home from Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Java and Sumatra. What I did mention to my parents, much to their satisfaction, was that I actually looked forward to returning to college in the fall. Time free from the obligations of schoolwork had enabled me to realize my passion for writing, and to apply this to an English major, where I would discover the most formative classes and professors of my education. With this newfound interest I experienced many of the benefits that gap years are said to provide: Studies show that students who take time off before graduating increase their   averages, drink less when in college, and go on to find more fulfilling career paths. It also helped me graduate in only two and a half more years  —   one semester behind where I should have if I’d stayed in school. After graduating, too, I found satisfying work (for a few years, editing a surf magazine). Looking back, though, it would be hard to identify anything from that year as a formula for success. But that was exactly the point. I stocked shelves, scrubbed dishes, did an unpaid internship and traveled. My performance in school did improve afterward, but if I’d thought about chasing those results, or recommended those experiences to others, there’s just no way the same benefits would follow. While there’s certainly a place for making those kinds of calculations, a gap year was about removing those expectations, at least temporarily. It was a time when education ceased to be an act of dependence, an act of fulfilling my parents’ wishes. Only then could the act of graduating from college become a move toward independence. Only then could I make space for education to have value of its own.",0

Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary Heisenberg 5 mins ago News Comments Off on Yikes! Catholic Church announces a major warning against Hillary 
A San Diego Catholic Church claims Hillary is doing the devils work. Reuters reported: A Roman Catholic church in San Diego told its parishioners the devil works through politicians like Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and warned that voting for Democrats is a “mortal sin,” according to local media and the church’s website. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Old Town made the statements in its weekly leaflet to churchgoers, a copy of which remains on the church’s website. The letter railed against issues like abortion and constraints on tax-exempt organizations from certain political activity, likening them to slavery. “Satan has deceived many Christians to convert to worldly values from Christian ones,” the Oct. 30 bulletin reads. “The devil does this through the tactics outlined by Saul Alinsky with the outcome as Hillary Clinton has stated, ‘And deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed,’ to draw us away from God’s teachings.” ",0
4650,How you can create space in a tiny home - The New York Times,"This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life’s opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes. com. Let go of that   you’ve had since middle school, the cracked mirror that you haven’t had time to replace and the lamp that works only when you kick it on the third try. When you’re trying to maximize a small space, every inch counts, from under the bed to unclaimed wall space over your head. While moving is considered one of life’s great stressors, living in a small space doesn’t have to be. All it takes is some thoughtful planning and smart storage options. For Julia Haney Montanez, an interior designer living alone for the first time in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, purging is the first step to making the most of what you have. “You have to stop being a hoarder,” Ms. Montanez, 30, said this week in her studio apartment. “The secret to   living is trying to avoid owning too much stuff that’s a good practice for life. You don’t have to be a minimalist, but you have to get really creative where you store your things and maybe think twice about buying something new. ” (Related: A beginner’s guide to home décor) Once you’ve winnowed down your belongings, it’s time to consider how to use your limited space. Ms. Montanez, a producer for the Architectural Digest show and a freelance designer, lives in a    studio. When she first moved in, Ms. Montanez spent hours looking at the floor plan and figuring out the ideal configuration for her furniture. By living in the space for a while before making any major purchases, Ms. Montanez said, you get an idea of how to make your home as functional as possible. “As you live in the apartment you’ll know and understand what you need,” she said. “Do you have your freeloader friends crashing all the time? Then get a longer sofa. If not, get a smaller sofa because they take up so much space. Get to know your own space before you start throwing money at those things. ” If you have the opportunity to splurge, Ms. Montanez recommends creating a custom piece. For her it was a California Closet and a table that doubles as her office desk. “It was the best decision,” she said of the custom closet. “Everything goes in there. ” Shoes, cleaning supplies and home office material like fabric swatches all live in her closet, neatly tucked away in designated cubbies alongside double hanging clothes racks. “Take your dinner money for the next month and put it toward something that will fit perfectly,” she said. “It’s like Tetris, and it’s that one thing you need. ” Making a tight spot work can require bending the rules on traditional uses of space. Consider using a medicine cabinet for storing glassware or kitchen cabinets for sweater storage if cooking isn’t a priority. Every space has to serve a purpose, said Susan Winberg, an interior designer based in New York City. “It has to have more than one function,” she said. Ms. Winberg typically takes on larger residential projects, she said, but with two children in their 20s, she began designing projects with much more limited space. Her daughter’s San Francisco   apartment, for example, had a Murphy bed alcove with no bed in it, she said. They put her bed elsewhere in the apartment and converted the alcove into a closet. If you have limited closet space, prioritize where you store your things, Ms. Winberg advised. The Murphy bed closet is tucked away, so Ms. Winberg’s daughter uses that area to store winter clothes and boots, saving her more accessible closet for things that she uses more regularly. If you’re working with a dresser, add another piece or shelf above the dresser for extra storage, she said. Madeline Fraser, one of the founders of a new app called Homee, which offers personal design services and a virtual showroom, summed up a similar approach to coping with small spaces in two words: up and out. “The use of the wall space is where you’re going to maximize your overall space,” she said. Ms. Fraser recommended putting storage on walls with open floating shelving, an affordable option, she said, especially for renters who can easily Spackle the wall when it’s time to move out. And shelving can go beyond the living room and bedroom, too. Open shelving in kitchens, especially in a galley or small kitchen, can make the room feel more open. “When you have cabinets, it can appear closed off like there’s a wall there,” she said. Everyone thinks, ‘Oh, I have to have cabinets,’ but you can easily do open shelving and arrange your kitchen stuff to look cool. It will feel more like a restaurant. ” To keep things looking tidy, Ms. Fraser suggested bringing symmetry to open shelves by displaying dishes, cutting boards and kitchen accessories stacked in clusters or leaning against the wall. Books and bookends offer a way to ground shelving, too, she said. And for miscellaneous items, wire baskets can help contain odds and ends that may be without a home. At a bare minimum, get the mattress and box spring off the floor, Ms. Fraser said. Every big piece of furniture should have legs if possible, to provide storage space underneath. “You can get an   bed frame that gives you more storage under your bed,” she said. “You can do a bed skirt and put a lot under your bed. Your mom will not be happy with you if she comes over and sees the bed on the floor. ” Want more?

4651,First Ever Hindu Woman Elected into Congress,"First ever Hindu was elected to the US House of Representatives. She will take the oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita. 

During election, Hawaii elected Japan-born Mazie Hirono to be the first ever Asian-American woman elected to the Senate. Hawaii also elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as the first ever practicing Hindu to the US House of Representatives. Because of this, Fox News have declare Hawaii a “disaster zone”. 

Gabbard is the daughter of two conservative Hawaii politicians. She first ran, and was elected into office at the age of 21. After her first term, she served on a 12 month tour of duty with Hawaii’s National Guard, and then became the first woman in history of the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy to be designated a “distinguished honor graduate”. 

She was then deployed to Baghdad as a medical operations specialist in 2004, and she was deployed to Kuwait in 2008. 

History has proven that not everyone is comfortable with a Hindu elect. When Hindu statesman Rajan Zed was asked by the Senate to open with a prayer in 2007, the American Family Association called the prayer “gross idolatry” and urged people to protest. Three protesters interrupted the prayer with shouts from the gallery. 

When she is sworn this January, Gabbard will take her oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text for Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma. 

Gabbard hopes to assist the US in fostering a better relationship with India, the world’s largest democracy with a growing economic and nuclear power. She also hopes to work on veteran’s affairs, and environmental issues. 

Other non-Christian people in Congress include Minnesota’s Keith Ellison, who took his oath of office over the Qu-ran.

4652,Life in the Lights - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton has lived most of her life in the public eye  —   and in front of cameras. Staff photographers for The New York Times have documented her career since her husband, then the governor of Arkansas, ran for president in 1992. They covered her during her sometimes turbulent tenure as first lady and over the course of her own political career. Four of those photographers reflect on their experience covering Mrs. Clinton and their impressions of the 2016 presidential election. Covering a campaign is like taking a photograph through a window. The challenge is to see beyond the reflected image  —   what the campaign is trying to project  —   and to capture what is really there. I was with Mrs. Clinton on and off during the 2016 campaign and her first presidential run. Her image has always been carefully managed, and our access to    activity is rare, making it a challenge to capture the candidate in more unguarded moments. I see no point in showing what anyone can see from the audience or on television. For me, a successful campaign photo allows you to step back and give a fuller sense of the scene. I have taken tens of thousands of pictures of Mrs. Clinton and covered her first presidential run. This campaign feels very different from the 2008 race, and I have wanted to make sure our images reflect that. This time around, Mrs. Clinton has shown more confidence as a candidate and seems more energized on the trail. The crowds at her events are far more diverse and much younger than those during her last run  —   they look a lot like the ones Barack Obama had in November 2008. Many of the best photos I take of Mrs. Clinton are at the moment she arrives onstage or when she is on the rope line talking to voters. Mrs. Clinton was the   in this race, just as she was in the 2008 campaign. But she seems to have enjoyed this one more. There are a couple of moments that have stuck with me as I covered Mrs. Clinton over the course of her political career. At the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion during the 1992 transition, Mrs. Clinton appeared at a news conference with a group of her husband’s senior advisers. It was a quiet signal that she would wield significant power in his administration, and a hint of her political ambitions. In October 2015, I was at the   Dinner, an annual Democratic   in Des Moines, where I watched as Mrs. Clinton’s primary opponents took sharp jabs at her for her policy positions and her ties to big banks. But as Mrs. Clinton entered the room, the mood turned from political gathering to rock concert as ecstatic supporters reached across bicycle gates, trying to touch her. Mrs. Clinton was a superstar who was expected to cruise to the nomination and enjoy clear advantages in the general election. But very few people  —   possibly including Mrs. Clinton herself  —   had an inkling that she was about to take part in the most searing presidential campaign in modern history. I have been photographing Mrs. Clinton since the 1992 presidential campaign, and have spent so much time watching her that I can sometimes predict her gestures and actions at campaign events. While Mrs. Clinton is often described as guarded and hyperaware of how she is perceived, she has frequently projected a sense of ease with who she is during this campaign. She refers to her age unapologetically, often talking about being a grandmother, and seems more comfortable interacting with voters on the trail, at times appearing to take genuine delight in it. Though she rarely deviates from her script, I am always looking for those real and telling moments that show her as a private person rather than just a public figure  —   though in Mrs. Clinton’s case, those two roles are deeply intertwined.",0
4653,"H-2B Expansion ’Directly Counter’ to ’Buy American, Hire American,’ Says Workers Union","A trades union representing American   construction workers says a plan to expand the     foreign guest worker visa is “directly counter” to President Donald Trump’s “Buy American, Hire American” agenda. [The budget, promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan, will allow Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to expand the number of foreign workers who come to the U. S. for   jobs by at least 20, 000.  The   visa brings foreign nationals to the U. S. for   nonagricultural jobs. The visa impacts   and poor Americans most, as jobs in the hotel industry, theme parks, retail, and restaurants can insource jobs to foreign workers under the program.   visa workers filled more than half a million jobs in the U. S. in the past five years. The North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) is denouncing the plan, saying it will further undercut   American workers and the security of their jobs. “This maneuver runs directly counter to President’s Trump’s recent executive actions to ‘buy American and hire American,’ and which were specifically crafted to instruct the Departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security, and State to take prompt action to crack down on fraud and abuse in our immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States and their economic conditions,” NABTU officials said in a statement. “The   visa was conceived as a   guest worker program that is meant to be used by employers to fill seasonal and temporary jobs, but which has now been all too often used by unscrupulous employers in the construction industry as a means to exploit guest workers and drive down community wage and benefit standards,” the organization continued. “The many horrific abuses within the   program have long been documented, and NABTU has repeatedly sought reforms to address the shortcomings in the law that have enabled these abuses to continue unabated. ” NABTU argues that the language in the omnibus spending bill, passed by the House, does not “address” or “reform” the problems within the   visa system, saying “it doubles down on bad policy which will have the effect of further jeopardizing the jobs, wages and benefits of American construction workers, while ensuring that guest workers remain vulnerable to abuse. ” The   expansion slipped into the spending bill came as a treat to the big business and open borders lobbies, who through the   Workforce Coalition organization, successfully lobbied Congress to expand the number of   foreign workers who can enter the U. S. every year, as Breitbart Texas reported. Breitbart Texas reported how American wages are struggled to increase in professions covered by the   visa. For instance, for landscaping and   jobs given to   foreign workers, wages decreased by 3. 4 percent between 2004 and 2014. For jobs in the amusement and recreation industry, which also employs a multitude of   foreign workers, wages between 2004 and 2014 fell by 1. 3 percent. Overall, in the top 15 industries that employ   foreign workers, wages increased in the last decade by 1. 8 percent. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas.

4654,7 Essential Money Questions Sure to Start a Conversation - The New York Times,"It’s the season of the long hike, the slow beach stroll, the idle time when you can finally just talk and think for at least a little while. Even if you don’t get to go on vacation over these next two weeks, many workplaces will be quieter than usual, allowing, perhaps, for an early escape and a longer evening meal. No time like the present, then, to put a few big, searching money questions on the table. What follows are the seven best queries that I could find that tend to stop people cold and get them to open up about whatever money they have and the emotions that wrap themselves around their personal finances. You won’t find much about investments below, as it’s easy enough nowadays to put your retirement money in a   fund that automates everything or sign up for a cheap bit of software to spread your savings over a collection of index funds. Instead, the focus here is on family, feelings and the often unknowable future that we have to plan for nevertheless. Scoop out some ice cream or pour an adult beverage and take them in order. What lessons about money did you learn from your parents? I use this one when counseling my own friends and family for two reasons. First, it can help get at   guilt. Are you determined to maintain a certain social class or climb a rung up the ladder because you’ll feel less successful in your parents’ eyes if you don’t? Are you unhappy in a   career because your parents worked so hard to send you to college and you can’t bring yourself to quit? If your children don’t go to a school as good as yours was, do you worry that you’re failing them somehow? Also, it’s crucial to be explicit with yourself and your spouse, if you have one, about how or whether your parents are role models. What specifically did they teach you that has helped? And how, in their silence about some aspects of money, could they have failed you? What does the word “money” conjure up for you? This bit of word association may seem elementary, but its power hit home for Peg Eddy, a financial planner in San Diego, when a client responded with the word “food. ” The client’s mother was an alcoholic, and their food stamps ran out each month, so she started working at age 11 and grew up to be a successful academic. Because of that history, it took a lot of work and conversation before she was willing to spend money on things she could easily afford. Ms. Eddy described a sort of victorious moment when she got a call one day from the client asking her to come outside and see her new car. Other common responses to the question include security, freedom, reward and burden. One particularly honest person answered Ms. Eddy with the word “control. ” How many children would you like to have when you retire? Credit for this   goes to Derek Tharp, a financial planner in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who said he drew heavy inspiration from a book called “Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids,” by the economist Bryan Caplan. Mr. Tharp said the younger couples he counseled often thought too hard about the financial cost of children in the short term and the amount of attention that younger ones needed. He encourages them to more carefully consider their future selves, the ones who will want to improve the odds of being surrounded by grandchildren  —   and having adult children who may be able to help in their old age. For the record, Mr. Tharp has no children, but he has not been married for long and expects that the family dog, Eli, will not be the last living being that he and his wife will care for. How do you think your children feel about that? Sometimes, the people who call in Julie Ford, a financial planner in New York, to help them are in some degree of financial distress. If they have children, Ms. Ford says she asks them this question, knowing full well that parental anxiety has almost certainly rubbed off on the children as well. Invoking the little people, she finds, often gets adults to be more honest and vulnerable. “I also try to give them ideas on how to involve kids in money conversations,” she said. “If they need to make big budget cuts or vacations will look different going forward, kids can handle it. It can be a teachable moment, and that may be a bit of a silver lining. ” Tell me about your financial situation when you first met. When Ted S. Halpern, a financial planner with two offices in the Washington suburbs, feels tension brewing when he talks to couples, he hits them with this storytelling opportunity. “It goes from a tighter face to a glimmer in their eye,” he said. “And they look at each other and realize that, yes, they do still love each other. ” With one set of clients, they recalled their first date in a Honda Civic with a busted back seat and manually controlled windows. So he asked a  : Imagine if I could have offered you a deal back then where 20 years later, you would be married with healthy children and your own business with your current income. Would you have signed that contract? The wife leaned forward. “In blood,” she said. People usually respond in the affirmative, Mr. Halpern said. And it helps remind them of a larger point, if they are bickering over where to cut back on spending. They are arguing over something that they already have. What are the most important things in your life? Kevin M. Reardon, a financial planner in Pewaukee, Wis. has tried a number of leading, searching questions over the years, including the three that George Kinder, who has trained many planners, suggests. How would you live your life differently if you were completely secure financially? What would you change if you knew you only had five to 10 years left to live? And what would you regret if you knew you would die tomorrow? Mr. Reardon eventually settled on this more basic question, which doesn’t immediately suggest anything related to money. “But if you get to the why and what motivates someone, everything else just fills in from there,” he said. That means using the answer and working backward to set financial goals around these matters of great importance. What does the prospect of retirement look like to you? Many of us thought we knew what that word meant once upon a time, and perhaps some of us still do. Financial independence. Not having to work at a job to survive. Travel. A particular age span. Twice, however, Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S. D. has heard the following answer: I die. One client who said this, a physician, had some empirical proof that this would be his fate, since all of his male relatives had dropped dead within a year or two of the day they stopped working. Mr. Kahler says he helped bring him around to a   description that is slightly more optimistic: Retirement means doing what I want, when I want, with whom I want. Once we figure that out, a successful retirement is just a matter of filling in the activity calendar and inviting others along.",0
4655,Donald Trump in Brussels: ‘We Will Win This Fight’ Against Terrorism - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump vowed to keep fighting terrorism, calling the attack in Manchester a reminder of the importance of the battle. [“[T]he top problem right now is terrorism,” Trump said after landing in Brussels, during a meeting with Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium.  The president added that under his Generals, the fight was “doing very well,” but described the terrorist attack in Manchester as a “horrible” and “unthinkable” situation. “When you see something like what happened a few days ago, you realize how important it is to win this fight,” he said. “And we will win this fight. ” Trump will meet with NATO allies in Brussels to discuss the future of the alliance and the ongoing struggle against terrorism. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that NATO should join the coalition against ISIS. “They’ve been an observer. But they’ve become more and more engaged in the actual fight to defeat ISIS,” he said.",0
4656,U.S. Court Rules Infringement Suit by Trader Joe’s Can Proceed Against Pirate Joe’s - The New York Times,"A federal appeals court said Friday that Washington State has the authority to hear a trademark lawsuit by Trader Joe’s against a Canadian store called Pirate Joe’s that resold the grocery chain’s products. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a decision by a district court to dismiss the trademark case against Pirate Joe’s and its owner, Michael Hallatt. The district court had said that the violations occurred in Canada, where Trader Joe’s has no stores, and that the company failed to prove that Pirate Joe’s affected business in the United States. In its ruling, the appeals courts said the lawsuit could proceed because Mr. Hallatt’s actions  —   setting up a facsimile storefront in Vancouver, British Columbia, with knockoff branding and online merchandising  —   could devalue the   trademark. The case will return to a federal district court in Washington State. “We’re here to see it through, and that means doing this for the people who want this stuff,” Nathan Alexander, Mr. Hallatt’s lawyer, told The Associated Press. The decision reopens a case that began in October 2011 when workers at a Trader Joe’s in Bellingham, Wash. noticed Mr. Hallatt buying products in excess. He often returned several times every week. Mr. Hallatt acknowledged he was buying the products to distribute them in Canada through his store, then called Transilvania Trading, according to court documents. He later changed the name to Pirate Joe’s. Sometimes donning disguises to avoid detection, Mr. Hallatt conducted shopping runs and occasionally hired other people to buy goods on his behalf. An advertisement Mr. Hallat placed on Craigslist called for a “  for undercover work” with a “  international grocery smuggling operation. ” Court documents said Mr. Hallatt, who holds dual citizenship, had spent more than $350, 000 on goods from Trader Joe’s, which he resold in Canada at a markup. In 2013, the company filed a lawsuit in Washington against Mr. Hallatt for trademark infringement, unfair competition, false designation of origin and false advertising. It added that Pirate Joe’s was not an approved reseller. Responding to the lawsuit, Mr. Hallat said he never claimed an affiliation with the American company.",0
4657,Recovery Finally Yields Big Gains for Average Worker’s Pay - The New York Times,"It has been a long time coming  —   eight years, in fact  —   but the economic recovery is finally showing up in the average American worker’s paycheck in a big way. There have been plenty of winners in the recovery, which began in  : companies, homeowners, investors and, especially, households at the apex of the economic pyramid. But the paucity of gains in   pay has stoked anxiety and frustration for many others, a factor in the wave of discontent that   Donald J. Trump rode to victory in November. But even as Mr. Trump prepares to succeed President Obama in two weeks, the Labor Department reported on Friday that average hourly earnings rose by 2. 9 percent last year, the best annual performance since the recovery began. And many economists expect the trend to gain momentum this year, as a tighter labor market forces employers to pay more to hire and retain workers. “This is a turning point for the overall economy,” said Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago. While wage growth was robust last year, government data for December showed a more tepid increase in employment, with 156, 000 jobs added during the month, and a slight uptick in the unemployment rate to 4. 7 percent. Until recently, a rise in salaries one month would peter out the next, but the upward trajectory in 2016 reflects wage gains even for Americans at the low end of the pay scale, Ms. Swonk said. Leisure and hospitality workers, for example, saw hourly earnings jump 4. 4 percent from a year earlier, equal to the increase enjoyed by employees in the surging technology sector. To be sure, a number of the economic problems cited by Mr. Trump during the campaign remain: millions of former workers not even looking for jobs, ebbing factory positions and fewer opportunities for the 55 percent of Americans without college degrees or other   school credentials. “Strong economic growth doesn’t really matter if it’s not widely distributed,” Ms. Swonk said. “You can have a better economy but still not good enough for people who aren’t participating at all. ” A more comprehensive government barometer of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take   jobs because   positions were not available, stood at 9. 2 percent in December, a much higher level than at this point in past recoveries. But rising wages should counter the economic undertow, especially if the gains remain  . And while a 2. 9 percent increase may not sound like much, it goes much further because inflation is about 1. 7 percent. Economists expect wages to rise by up to 3. 5 percent in 2017  —   still below the gains many workers saw in the recovery of the   and in the   boom of the late 1990s. Although not reflected in the December figures, many   workers are getting raises this year because of state increases in the local minimum wage. Some of the increases were substantial, with Arizona, Maine and Washington each raising the floor by $1. 50 or more an hour. Even in California, where, at 50 cents an hour, the wage gain is not as steep, one in 10 workers has gotten a raise. And   gains can have a spillover effect, pushing up pay for workers just above the bottom salary tier. For all his criticism during the campaign of Mr. Obama’s economic stewardship, Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid. Consumer sentiment, corporate profits and the stock market are all at or near multiyear highs. On Friday, Wall Street embraced the       labor market figures, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average close to 20, 000 and a new nominal record. Investors and traders are watching the jobs data closely for clues about when the Federal Reserve Board may next raise interest rates. Last month, the Fed increased interest rates for only the second time in a decade, and policy makers signaled that three more increases could come this year. The wage gains are among the reasons the Fed is likely to stick to that plan, Ms. Swonk, the Chicago economist, said. Monthly job creation last year was well below the 236, 000 average for hiring in 2014 and 2015. But with the economy close to what Fed policy makers and other experts consider full employment, employers are increasing wages, to retain workers and to attract new ones. While the minimum wage increases provide a floor when it comes to pay, the ceiling continues to rise in fields like financial services, sales and technology, said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company. “Across the board, I see more aggressive salaries being offered by corporations than at any time in the last 10 years,” Mr. Gimbel said. Seasoned sales representatives are drawing base salaries of $150, 000 a year, compared with $125, 000 two years ago, according to Mr. Gimbel.   software developers who once started at around $50, 000 a year can now command $70, 000. Other executives in the Midwest also report upward pressure on wages, including in grittier settings than the   fields where engineers and financial professionals cluster. At Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria, which has 46 restaurants in the Chicago area and one in Phoenix,   pay in hourly positions like server, cook and dishwasher is now about $11. 50 an hour, compared with $10 an hour three years ago. Mark Agnew, the chain’s president, said most of the increase was a result of the steady rise in Chicago’s minimum wage, which has gone from $8. 25 in 2014 to $10. 50 now. It is set to hit $13 by summer 2019. “We want to stay ahead of the minimum wage because we want to attract the best talent,” Mr. Agnew said. A substantial portion of the chain’s 3, 000 workers have been with the company for more than 10 years, a rarity in the   restaurant industry that is another benefit of the slightly higher wages. Economists and politicians have long debated whether raising the minimum wage ultimately hurts workers as companies cut positions or leave them unfilled in the face of rising labor costs. So far, that has not been the case at Lou Malnati’s, Mr. Agnew said. The chain has opened about a dozen new locations in the past three years, adding about 600 workers to its payroll over all. “It’s very tricky, and I know the minimum wage may erode job creation in some industries,” he said. “But in my own company, it hasn’t hurt hiring. ”",0

The U.S. Elections: The Latest Crack in the System 
The 2016 U.S. presidential elections are unprecedented: I don’t believe we have ever witnessed before a campaign year so toxic, so dangerously divisive and full of ad hominem attacks. Both camps have vilified the opposition and their followers, creating a schism in society. There has been no rational dialogue on the issues that truly concern the American public. 
Instead, we have witnessed personal insults and petty attacks, rumors and gossip. At this point, as a result of this catastrophic campaign, the public will not vote in favor of the candidate they agree with the most or the one they like, but against the one they hate! 
In this article, we do not focus on comparisons between Clinton and Trump; enough has been said and written about the candidates themselves. Here, we look at their supporters – the crowd behind the candidates, those that will in fact shape American policy making in the coming four years. 
Hillary Clinton: The Establishment Remains in Control 
The most important and formidable group within those backing Clinton belong to the upper echelon of society: Wall Street’s movers and shakers, big business, the top of the political pyramid and the servants and profiteers of the public sector. In one word: the establishment. 
Clinton’s support base includes therefore practically everyone who profits from government regulations and government corruption – they have everything to lose if Hillary doesn’t win. It is the same group that advocates and leads the political correctness movement ; they are those state-bred and fed intellectuals who poison the university campus and mass media circus with their belief that they can transform the U.S. into a “utopia”. 
In reality, this “utopia” will be created through intense centralization, endless wars and plundering, only to create a totalitarian government where the political elite enforces its will and instructs the public on how to live a happy life, which only benefits the top strata of society that designed it in the first place. Years ago, Jewish American philosopher Hannah Arendt summarized the toxic impact of political correctness as follows: 
“There is no thought process without freedom. To deprive man of his liberty is to deprive him of his own ideas, and if one is not allowed to think, only subjugation and slavery remain.” 
This can only be achieved through a strong foothold on the centralized state and its propaganda engine, the mass media, operating under the doctrine of Edward Bernays, the father of propaganda, better known as public relations. 
Then there’s the other extreme of Clinton’s supporters: the artificially created underprivileged minorities. These groups have come to depend on the state for support and protection, which has also made it easy for the state to indoctrinate them and reset their mindset to its advantage. 
Those are the people who have fallen in the trap of thinking that only the state can provide them with what they need for a good life, when in reality it only disempowered them. The globalist Clinton herself accuses Trump of “populism”, casting “nationalism” in a negative light, but she is actually the one promising free lunches for everyone: lenient immigration laws, higher minimum wages, universal healthcare, etc. 
Clinton also preaches against income inequality and condemns Wall Street greed in her speeches, while her campaign cashes in from Wall Street’s finest: JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Under those circumstances… what can you possibly do? Ms. Clinton’s top five donors are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, DLA Piper, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley. Somehow we don’t think Wall Street has reason to fear her much. Cartoon by Cataslino 
Trump – the Greatest Politically Incorrect Shock in Decades? 
Whenever people are forced by the government to accept and pay for things they do not want, the outcome is discontent and opposition, typically suppressed and downplayed by the mainstream media in accordance with the state’s agenda of political correctness. This further escalates the situation and things often take unpleasant turns, including the fostering of racist and bigoted subsections that we see within the Trump voting base. 
But they are not the majority, not by long shot! One might get this impression, because the mainstream media tend to focus exclusively on this sub-set of supporters through footage and interviews at Trump rallies, because they are considered “interesting” material; after all, they say outrageously horrible things and are therefore great for TV sensationalism. 
What does Donald Trump stand for? From my perspective, for anything and everything! He stands for everyone who is sick and tired of the current system and the political elite who have grown out of touch with ordinary American citizens. You will find them among the working class, small business owners, and the segment of society that used to be known as the middle class before the crisis; they all harbor grievances against the establishment. 
These are people who understand that the slogan “the Union and the Constitution forever” has been under attack and downgraded to nothing more than an empty phrase by the power elite and the Deep State. We see first hand how the Patriot Act directly violates not only the first amendment’s guarantee of free speech, but also the fourth and fifth amendments, thereby tearing apart the very foundation of a country once based on respect for civil liberties. 
There is no doubt that the second amendment will be crushed under Clinton as well, “regulating to extinction” the natural right to self-defense and personal sovereignty. We must never forget that we are born with inherent rights, that can neither be granted nor taken away from us by the State. As Judge Napolitano once put it: 
“Natural law teaches that our freedoms are pre-political and come from our humanity and not from the government. As our humanity is ultimately divine in origin, the government, even by majority vote, cannot morally take natural rights away from us. A natural right is an area of individual human behavior – like thought, speech, worship, travel, self-defense, privacy, ownership and use of property, consensual personal intimacy – immune from government interference and for the exercise of which we don’t need the government’s permission.” 
Even though polls suggest that Trump is trailing nationally, they probably underestimate exactly how big the Trump wave is, and it is significant: between 74% and 83% of Republicans said they will support him (according to polls conducted between Oct 9 th -11 th ). But there is also the silent majority that has been present at his rallies. This silent majority does not necessarily consist of Trump fans, but they do not want to see the country falling into the abyss of state centralization and political correctness. 
They want to discontinue the economic system that has taken them from bad to worse – they are the American version of the European anti-establishment movement. They are well aware of Trump’s coarse character and crude remarks, but feel they can overlook that, for the sake of his main strategic advantage: Trump’s promise that he does not want America to be controlled by the establishment anymore. 
A Tale of Two Hatreds 
“Politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching… then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” Hillary Clinton, National Multi-Housing Council, April 2013 
One key reason behind the peoples’ hostility towards Clinton is that she personally embodies the hypocrisy and the hubris of the U.S. federal government itself: a government that maims and kills millions with its war on terror, it arms and supports murderous regimes and ideological fanatics and it is known to deploy chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. And yet, it somehow pretends to hold the moral high ground and lectures others on human rights. 
Just as America is an “exceptional” country, for which normal standards don’t apply, Clinton is its “exceptional” candidate. She accuses her opponent of populism, when her own platform is entirely based on crowd-pleasing promises. 
She calls Trump’s policies fascistic while her own would put the final nail on the coffin of free speech. She claims to stand up for the little guy, while she funds her campaign with Wall Street money. She positions herself as the defender of minorities’ and women’s rights, while her Foundation accepts donations from the most oppressive regimes on the planet. 
At the same time, the American electorate also feels hostility for Trump; that hate is not equivalent though, as few would argue he is trying to hide who he is. The reason why so many dislike him is very different, and it has to do with the identity he projects. He is the ultimate “anti-intellectual”. 
Of course the term “intellectual” is quite broad these days, and many intellectuals dislike Trump solely because of what it would say about who they are (in the eyes of their like-minded peers). But these people share a common denominator: they are educated beyond their intelligence and critically depend on repeating what other “intellectual” people say, as they feel (consciously or not) their ignorance would be exposed if they dared to express an original idea. Trump’s world, according to a recent NYT cartoon. The statist intelligentsia certainly feels threatened by Trump. Cartoon by Chappatte 
The Day After: The Legacy of a Bitter Campaign Year 
Unfortunately, whoever wins, the nation will pay a price for this “divide and conquer” rhetoric. Americans today are too polarized and the tensions that are brewing in the background will not just go away the day after the election: racial and social divisions, as well as the split caused by the choice between a planned vs. a free market economy, a big or a small government. 
Under Trump, we can only hope that America will be given time to heal and to overcome these divisions. Free speech is key: Society can only heal if it returns to a culture of debate with a willingness to agree to disagree. 
From what we know from modern American history, we shouldn’t be surprised that the financial markets appear to prefer Hillary over Trump. Wall Street, the bankers and the military industrial complex are expected to continue to thrive under President Clinton. The establishment will live on. Right now the establishment is seemingly pushing for war against Russia and Clinton is undeniably on board with this aggressive narrative. 
And then we have Trump, who is certainly far from perfect. His objectification of women, his comments about Muslims and minorities, his crass demeanor: All these have made it very hard for him to find support for his genuine policy points. 
Even if the actual net effect of his policies were to benefit women, he won’t get them on his side by calling them pigs – there is a difference between free speech and just being plain rude, uncivil and vulgar. We may disagree with his infamous “wall” with Mexico and demands for “a new budget to rebuild our depleted military” (which makes him no different from Clinton). But he is an outsider, a businessman, and most importantly, a crack in system! 
He challenges the status quo, and that’s why the status quo attacks him, by trying to ridicule both him and his voters, by painting them as extremists, or as ignorant and racist. The question is, why don’t we just let Trump be Trump? 
As he himself said: “It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to!”. Consider the boldness of this statement – regardless of whether one agrees with him, he stands confidently for his principles and ideas, even against his own party’s leaders (many of which have withdrawn their support). This is a clear projection of power and independence; it says that no one can dictate their demands to him. It says that he is unafraid to speak his mind. 
I say, we should trust his followers. It seems clear that most Trump voters are striving to defend the essence of the constitution and its original intent – to be the basis of a free society. And for me as a believer in civil rights and sovereignty, this is enough to give him or let me rather say, his voters, the benefit of the doubt.",0
4659,California Today: Capturing the ‘Firefall’ at Yosemite - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Please note: We will pause for Presidents’ Day and be back on Tuesday. For a couple of weeks each February, Yosemite’s Horsetail Fall puts on a show when the setting sun appears to transform its ribbon of water down the face of El Capitan into glowing lava. That’s if conditions cooperate. The phenomenon only works when the sun is lined up just so, the skies are clear and the mountains are snowy enough to fuel the waterfall. A bit of mist whipped up by the wind helps to get the full effect. Pamela Marcelino, a Postal Service worker in San Francisco, made the drive to Yosemite last Saturday to capture the   firefall. More than 150 other photographers were there, cameras poised, she said. “And you just wait for that moment, holding your breath,” Ms. Marcelino, 41, said. Then, the   glow fades in gradually, peaks and fades out in a matter of roughly 10 minutes. And it’s over. Since last weekend, photographers have been posting dozens of their images to Instagram.

The bridge cost $35 million, or about $590 million in today’s dollars. The bridge’s nearly perfect record was due to the obsession with safety protocols from its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, along with an innovation he brought that was   in 1930s construction: a safety net to catch falling workers. Nineteen workers fell to the net while the bridge was being built, forming what they called the “Half Way to Hell Club. ” But on Feb. 17, scaffolding on the side of the bridge fell and ripped through the net, taking the 10 laborers with it.

4660,Scientists Say Universe Is Part Of 4th Dimension Born From Black Hole,"A new scientific theory claims our universe was born from an Event Horizon event as part of a second dimension in an enormous black hole gobbling up other universes in the fourth dimension. 
Via YourNewsWire 

At the very beginning of time, around 13.8 billion years ago, there was a hot dense energetic point where the laws of physics did not apply – something scientists today refer to as a ‘singularity’. The only other place where a singularity occurs in the Universe and all the known laws of physics are temporarily abandoned is at the event horizon of a black hole – which scientists cannot explain.
Scroll Down For Video Below What is odd about black holes is that the even horizon is two-dimensional in an otherwise completely three-dimensional universe. This means that there is something that we are unable to perceive and the theory, which was first suggested in 2014 and is now under serious scrutinisation, claims that our Universe is the result of a singularity of a huge black hole.
In simpler terms, there is a possibility that our three-dimensional Universe is surrounding the event horizon of a four-dimensional Universe. A 2014 study from the Perimeter Institute and University of Waterloo stated: “In this scenario, our Universe burst into being when a star in a four-dimensional universe collapsed into a black hole.
Re-visiting the theory recently, Ethan Siegel, a professor of physics and astronomy at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, explained how a black hole could have formed in another universe which led matter to “fall” into our Universe.
Dr Siegel wrote for Forbes: “As the black hole first formed, from a star’s core imploding and collapsing, the event horizon first came to be, then rapidly expanded and continued to grow in area as more and more matter continued to fall in.
“If you were to put a coordinate grid down on this two-dimensional wrapping, you would find that it originated where the gridlines were very close together, then expanded rapidly as the black hole formed, and then expanded more and more slowly as matter fell in at a much lower rate.
“This matches, at least conceptually, what we observe for the expansion rate of our three-dimensional Universe.”

4661,George Michael’s Freedom Video: An Oral History - The New York Times,"Pop music and fashion never met cuter than in George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90” video. Sure, other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era, and fashion photographers like Steven Meisel and Herb Ritts were recruited by stars such as Madonna, Chris Isaak and Janet Jackson to burnish their visuals. But the convergence of a   maker’s irresistible rhythms and lyrics, a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave “Freedom! ’90” a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a  . Directed by David Fincher, who was at the start of his film career, and filmed over several days at Merton Park Studios in London, the video from Mr. Michael’s 1990 album, “Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1,” brought together five models  —   Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford and Tatjana Patitz  —   who were then the queens of fashion. It runs for six and a half minutes, and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion, including the stylist Camilla Nickerson, the hairdresser Guido Palau, the makeup artist Carol Brown and the model John Pearson. Shot in moody, romantic   tones, “Freedom! ’90” had been viewed more than 37 million times on YouTube by the time of Mr. Michael’s unexpected death at 53 last Sunday. Reached by phone this week, some of the participants recalled their experiences on set, and some of the video’s most ardent fans reflected on its impact. Naomi Campbell, model. We’d done a British Vogue cover with Peter Lindbergh with all of us. I met George in L. A. and he said: “I’ve been told that I need to speak to you to get the girls for the video. What would it take to get you?” We were living in America, so I said you’d have to fly us in, basically. I said yes, and then Christy and Tatjana and everyone came in. The night before the video, I didn’t sleep at all, because we did five shows for Thierry Mugler in Paris. He had 76 models, and it was the big finale of him designing, although none of us knew that then. The last show finished at around 3 o’clock in the morning, and George was there. So from there I went back to my hotel, packed my bags and went on the first flight to London. David Fincher knew exactly what he wanted. He didn’t really give us parts, but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing. I was more the active one. Cindy was sultry. I don’t think any of us knew what it would become. We knew the song was a hit, but we didn’t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos, the way it would affect people. We were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired. They all had great premieres back in the day. They don’t have them anymore. Not that I’ve seen. MTV’s changed. Hasn’t it? I got to see George a little bit more after that because Kate Moss was neighbors with him. When we did the Olympics, he sang there in London. We all did the finale, and he was rehearsing and Kate and I went to watch him with this amazing choir singing “Freedom. ” After, he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice   in the garden, and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together. That’s the memory I’m going to keep. Guido Palau, hairdresser. I don’t know how I got the job. George Michael and David Fincher had seen some of my work in British Vogue. It was a different time then. It was a big, big production, a   video because they had to bring in all the girls. Every girl had a day, though Christy and Linda were there together. My part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were. They weren’t playing characters. They were playing themselves. And each had their own personality: Linda the comedian, Christy much more classic, Cindy the pinup, Tatjana this kind of film noir, and Naomi a very strong kind of woman. We extracted that from them. They weren’t prodded at all, though there were some surprises, like Linda’s hair, which she’d done for a job for someone else. It wasn’t like I said, “Oh, dye your hair blond,” not at all. At the time, we really didn’t realize how iconic the video would become. I was probably a bit naïve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a   job for me. What I remember most is the days being very long, and at the end of the day, the red wine would come out. There we’d be in the location van drinking and singing with George. Tatjana Patitz, model. I was in my own zone. I had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day. The feel of the set was so   this big, loft kind of vibe. There was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket. I think I may have had a bustier on. And I was smoking, even. People still smoked in videos then and even in films. George Michael wasn’t on the set the day I was there, but I’d met him a few times in L. A. Herb Ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine  —   I’m trying to remember what magazine it was. So many magazines have come and gone. Glamour was very present in fashion in those days, feminine glamour, people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the ’40s and ’50s  —   Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. A lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers. It was very different those days. The business was much smaller and wasn’t as saturated, not as fast as it is now. Models were known by their first names, and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film. We were part of the entertainment industry, which made it really fun. George was very nice, almost a little shy. Maybe that’s the wrong word. He was mellow and kind. I was quite   at the time because I grew up with Wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes. In the five or so times I met him, he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid, not one of those vivacious,   people who take a room by storm. I remember the shoot being in fall or early winter. I flew in on the Concorde for the day and flew back to New York right after that. It’s funny. A lot of people were using models in videos then, but this one in particular stood the test of time. It’s not like you look at “Freedom! ’90” now and say, “Oh, my God, it’s so ’80s!” It’s not like “Working Girl. ” John Pearson, model. My agent called up and said: “Hey, do you want to do this video? All the big girls are doing it. ’” Of course I said yes. I was a big George Michael fan. I used to see him all the time in London at the clubs. I arrived at the studios at 3 o’clock in the afternoon and met David Fincher briefly, and then basically sat around all day and watched while Christy and Linda were being shot. There’s one shot where Linda puts her head underneath her sweater that’s amazing. That wasn’t rehearsed. Linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way, never cheap and tawdry. George was there, very warm and nice but very shy. The day went long, and the producer said at the end of the day, “Can we shoot you tomorrow?” I didn’t have another job booked, so I said, “Sure. ” Then he said, “Do you mind doing it for nothing?” I said, “No way. ” It was a little bit bolshie of me, but I knew what the girls were getting. In the end, I was paid $15, 000 for the day, which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous, beautiful girls. But I’d been working nonstop for three years, and I wasn’t going to do it for free. And it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy,    jobs, everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models. I really didn’t realize how big it all was at the time. Candis Cayne, actress, model and former drag personality. There was a group of girls in N. Y. C. in the ’90s, and we didn’t want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels. Linda and Naomi and Christy. So when the video of “Freedom!” came out and they were all in it, we were obsessed. I used to do shows at Boy Bar, so I decided I was going to do “Freedom!” and got Lina and Mistress Formika and Sherry Vine to play the various parts. I was Linda. She was my favorite. We did the whole thing naked under white sheets. After the very last chorus, we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas. That song meant a lot to us. There were singers we knew were gay then, but no one really talked about it. We just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were, whether it was Madonna with “Vogue” and “Truth or Dare” or George Michael with “Freedom!” I don’t know if he was openly gay or not, then. I guess not. But it was almost O. K. because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time. It was so oppressive, particularly when you factor in the AIDS epidemic. To be open would have been a career killer. But going to a club, listening to “Freedom! ,” it was an escape. Alan Hunter, one of the original MTV V. J. s. It was a funny moment in my life. I was driving my kid to day care on a day where I didn’t know where my career had gone. I’d left MTV. My agent wasn’t calling. I was depressed. And I turned on the radio, and on came George Michael’s new song. It was George Michael at the peak of his writing skills. It was such a brilliant   capstone I’d ever heard. It was his    song. He was saying, “Everything that brought me to pop stardom I now disavow. ” Then I saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he’d used in his past, and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them. The leather jacket he’d worn and the jukebox from “Faith. ” And he just steps away. He wasn’t even in the video. It showed how serious he was, even while he said it all with a lot of love. It was such a joyous song. I actually felt happy. Zac Posen, fashion designer. I was 10 years old, 10 or 11. I’d see it in my living room waiting for Madonna to come on. I probably wanted to be the child in “Open Your Heart. ” But what I remember about “Freedom!” was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge. Because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial, Corinne Day,   space. There’s water dripping down the walls and George Michael’s leather jacket is on fire, and the models are naked. It was really the glamour of the ’80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come.",0
4662,4 Die in Jerusalem Attack as Palestinian Rams Truck Into Soldiers - The New York Times,"JERUSALEM  —   A Palestinian driver plowed a truck into a group of Israeli soldiers as they were getting off a bus in Jerusalem on Sunday afternoon, killing four and injuring 17 others, according to the police and witnesses. The police called the episode an act of terrorism. Micky Rosenfeld, a police spokesman, said the attacker had been shot, and the police released images showing the truck’s windshield riddled with bullet holes. The dead included three female soldiers and one male soldier, the Israeli military confirmed. Several people were hospitalized, some with critical injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the scene of the attack and said the perpetrator was “by all indications a supporter of the Islamic State. ” “This is part of the same pattern inspired by Islamic State, by ISIS, that we saw first in France, then in Germany and now in Jerusalem. This is part of the same ongoing battle against this global scourge of the new terrorism,” he added. Mr. Netanyahu has often made the comparison between local attacks against Israelis and those in the rest of the world, though the attacks in Israel are more broadly viewed as being more connected to the   conflict. While the Israeli security services have described a few Palestinian attackers as having been inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State, no direct links have been established between them and the organization. The attack on Sunday occurred on the Armon Hanatziv Promenade, a popular tourist spot between East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem that offers sweeping views of the Old City. The four soldiers killed were Erez Orbach, 20, from Alon Shvut, in the West Bank Yael Yekutiel, 20, from Givatayim, near Tel Aviv Shir Hajaja, 22, from Maale Adumim in the West Bank and Shira Tzur, 20, from Haifa. The violence ended several months of relative calm in the contested city, after a period of frequent stabbings, shootings and car attacks. It also underlined the volatility of the situation at a time when   Donald J. Trump has promised to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, a potentially explosive step that American administrations have avoided for decades. Palestinian officials say it would destroy the chances of any peace process by prejudging the outcome, and some have said it would constitute a declaration of war against Palestinians. Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, said on Friday that the Palestinians would view any such change in the status quo in Jerusalem as the crossing of a red line. Mosque preachers addressed the proposed embassy move in their sermons during Friday prayers, apparently on the instruction of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Israel captured the area from Jordan in the 1967 war and claims sovereignty there. Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds sway in Gaza, praised Sunday’s attack, without taking responsibility for it. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas official, described it as a “courageous and heroic operation. ” In Gaza City, people were handing out sweets to   in celebration. Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, condemned the attack in a statement. “It is reprehensible that some choose to glorify such acts, which undermine the possibility of a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis,” he said. “There is nothing heroic in such actions. ” The Palestinian official news agency, WAFA, identified the driver of the truck as Fadi Ahmad   28, a resident of the nearby Palestinian neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber in East Jerusalem. Ribhi Ewiysat, a resident of the neighborhood, said that a large number of Israeli security forces had entered the area and were at the attacker’s house. Chaim Newman, a tour guide who was accompanying the group of soldiers at the scene, told Israel Radio, “The soldiers got off the bus, and we were getting organized when suddenly the truck came with great speed and rammed into the group. ” “Civilians and soldiers began shooting, and this prevented a worse tragedy,” he added. “He rammed them a number of times, going into reverse and forward in order to hurt more people. ” Chen Lendi Sharon, a paramedic from the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said there was “chaos on the scene” when she arrived. “I saw a truck that rammed youngsters getting off the bus next to the Armon Hanatziv observation point. ” Ms. Lendi Sharon said that at least 10 people were trapped under the bus or were lying on the grass by the road. The attack occurred around 1:30 p. m. Dozens of soldiers were getting off buses at the site as part of a routine educational tour of Jerusalem. Aged 18 to 21, they were cadets from an officers’ course, Israel Radio reported. About two hours after the attack, the truck, a white flatbed with a crane on the back, remained at the scene and an ambulance was still removing bodies. Dovy Meyer, a spokesman for the United Hatzalah ambulance service who was at the scene, said that around 100 soldiers had been milling about when the attack occurred. A spate of deadly stabbings, shootings and car attacks began in October 2015 and quickly spread from Jerusalem and the West Bank to cities around Israel. More than 30 Israelis and two American visitors were among those killed in the attacks. More than 240 Palestinians have been killed during that period, many of them while carrying out or intending to carry out attacks, according to Israeli officials. Several attackers have come from the Jabel Mukaber neighborhood. Mr. Netanyahu said the neighborhood had been “encircled” by security forces on Sunday.",0
4663,Martha Stewart Gave a Portrait of Trump the Middle Finger at Art Fair - Breitbart,"Martha Stewart took a photo op between portraits of President Trump and Snoop Dogg Saturday at an art fair where she appeared to flip the bird at the president while flashing a peace sign towards the rapper. [Someone posted the photo of Stewart appearing to give Trump the middle finger at the Frieze Art Fair taking place at Randall’s Island Park in New York City on Twitter, where it went viral before the account responsible for posting the photo was set to private, the Hill reported.  “Was taking a pic of Trump and Snoop Dogg at Frieze [Art Fair] and Martha Stewart walks up like this #america,” user Newlin Tillotson wrote on Twitter, according to E! News. Stewart later posted a more politically correct version of the photo to her Instagram account, where she flashed peace signs towards both men while promoting the VH1 cooking show Martha  Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party that she stars in alongside Snoop and the 2017 MTV Movie and TV Awards that will air Sunday. E! News reports that an executive at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia took both photos, calling the second photo more “politically correct” and “so much less interesting. ” Stewart publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton when she ran for president against Trump and had feuded with Trump in the past. The feud was mostly over Stewart’s 2006 spinoff of Trump’s The Apprentice, which got canceled after one season. The cooking show star did, however, appear to make up with Trump in 2014 at a relaunch party for the New York Observer and congratulated Trump and his family on the election win. “I sent my congratulations to the Trump family, and I think they have an opportunity —  let’s see how they do with it.

4665,New Play Vicuña Portrays Trump in “Emperor’s New Clothes” Tale,"“Vicuña,” the new play that opened Sunday at Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, Calif., portrays a Donald Trump-like candidate in an “Emperor’s New Clothes” tale. The satire about a real estate tycoon and reality TV star turned presidential candidate could be perceived as a hatchet job. However, it offers an entertaining topical comedy on the surface, with glimpses into the climate of fear and xenophobia that has spread across America.
The improbable, uncontrollable Republican candidate here, Kurt Seaman (a name that results in sophomoric jokes that take away from the effort), bears an obvious resemblance to Trump. The mogul “wants to add the White House to his list of properties,” as one character notes. The Trumpisms include the well- respected daughter (called Srilanka here), ex-wives with names that evoke Trump’s, negative attitudes toward immigrants and even an uncomfortable feeling in his party that he will hurt them on Election Day.
“Vicuña” clearly evolved with the election since the Jon Robin Baitz play (his fourth world premiere for the Center Theatre Group) was drafted earlier this year. It takes place as preparations are under way for the third debate between Seaman (played by Harry Groener) and his unseen female opponent, who clearly did better in the first two debates.
Directed by Robert Egan, most of the play’s action takes place in a posh tailor’s atelier, where the character Anselm Kassar (played by Brian George), an Iranian Jewish immigrant, designs garments for presidents and world leaders that create the illusion of power and confidence. The character is based on an actual Washington, D.C., tailor named Georges de Paris, a Greek immigrant who crafted suits for presidents for decades.
Seaman decides that for his last debate he needs a magical, powerful suit made out of the finest vicuña (hence the name) for him by the great presidential tailor. “Clothing conveys credibility,” is the premise. He believes the polls are lying: “People are afraid to admit they are on my side.” However, just in case, this emperor wants new clothes.
The tailor decides, ignoring his personal feelings, to make a suit for a candidate that he finds repellent and make him more. He cannot resist the reflected glory of his powerful suits on the wannabe or truly powerful.
Seaman is at first delighted to meet the tailor’s apprentice, Amir Masoud (played by Ramiz Monsef), who is the son of immigrants. He tells him “Apprenticeship is good. It’s my thing.” But the candidate’s world view collides profoundly with this young Muslim man’s concepts of justice and America. The candidate actually comments that if people cannot make it in their own country and flee, “what kind of people are we letting in?”
Amir serves as the play’s conscience and challenges the candidate (and his daughter). He points out, “A suit can’t stand in for actual goodness and vision.” Amir’s character (like others in the play) is uneven and his actions do not always convey his feelings (like taking advantage of his prep school and Harvard University scholarships before flaunting his Marxist leanings.)
Srilanka (played by Samantha Sloyan) is tired defending her dad against his inappropriate comments. Initially, she tells Amir, “His message is lost when he is not ‘disciplined.’” The dutiful daughter even boasts that “when he’s elected he will be far more human than he’s being painted.” However, once he speaks positively about woman at her alma mater and then does a disparaging sexist interview, she can no longer ignore his inappropriate comments.
The Republican party leadership cannot ignore his “pitchfork campaign” and questionable opinions either. They offer Seaman billions to throw the debate and not become president. The real estate tycoon is now engaged in negotiations “to buy and sell the presidency.”
The final scene is the debate, with the candidate and his exquisite vicuña suit. The final act of the real election is yet to be played. But this play’s final act is veers into darker territory and an “emperor has no clothes” type moment.
The Vicuña cast is excellent. Groener avoids the obvious parody, but conveys the appropriate pomposity. Sloyan does a great job displaying early confidence crumbling to vulnerability of Srilanka’s campaign life. However, the key character is Monsef’s Amir, and the actor is up to the task of carrying the audience on his journey challenging the candidate’s beliefs and actions.
“Vicuña” portrays Trump in an “Emperor’s New Clothes” type tale, opening one week before the election. Baitz’ new play may not have a long shelf life now. However, it raises some serious issues that are not going away on Nov. 9. Maybe the play will be dusted off years from now and presented as a dramedy based on actual people. But, in the meantime, the reality is a little too real as election day looms.

4667,Re: Trump And Clinton Assemble Army Of Lawyers To Contest Election Results,"Email 
What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled “ Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime “, Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. 
Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. 
However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. 
And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. 
So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . 
For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . 
The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I don’t anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we don’t have a new president until long after election day is over. 
Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has “thousands of lawyers” that have donated their time to her campaign… 
Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isn’t saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns — including the potential for voter intimidation — and to verify normal procedures. 
The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trump’s biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. 
And most Americans don’t realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states… 
Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . 
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a “campaign of vigilante voter intimidation” that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. 
Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of “Clinton’s inner circle” … 
There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clinton’s inner circle or their closest relatives – the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. 
The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin’s estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary’s campaign chairman’s brother did the same. 
Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. 
If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. 
But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. 
Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the “ miracle ” that Donald Trump desperately needed? 
Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. 
Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. 
Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trump’s destiny to be president. 
Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see.

4669,The Chinese Who Saw the Perils of Westernization,"Posted on October 28, 2016 The Chinese Who Saw the Perils of Westernization Sacco Vandal, American Renaissance, October 28, 2016 They cautioned their countrymen 100 years ago. 
Many Westerners fear the decline of their own society while they foresee Chinese ascension and impending dominance–with alternating tones of fear or enthusiasm. The United States is growing demographically and may remain a viable cultural entity, but the consensus is that Europe faces demographic disaster. China and the West seem to be approaching an inversion of their relationship of just over a century ago, during the late Qing period, when the West was dominant and China was peripheral. [1] 
Patrick Buchanan described the Western dilemma in 2008: 
What happened to us? What happened to our world? When the twentieth century opened, the West was everywhere supreme. For four hundred years, explorers, missionaries, conquerors, and colonizers departed from Europe for the four corners of the Earth to erect empires that were to bring the blessings and benefits of Western civilization to all mankind. . . . Whatever became of those men? Somewhere in the last century, Western man suffered a catastrophic loss of faith–in himself, in his civilization, and in the faith that gave it birth. [2] 
Although the United States remains the strongest–but not the sole–superpower, European peoples are in decline everywhere. In another book, Mr. Buchanan points out that “In 1960, people of European ancestry were one-fourth of the world’s population; in 2000, they were one-sixth; in 2050, they will be one-tenth. These are the statistics of a vanishing race.” [3] Mr. Buchanan is hardly the first to warn of impending doom for the West. The lamentations of Oswald Spengler (1880–1936) are well known. Less known, however, are the Chinese from the same period who dreamed of a resurgence for China and warned of Western decline. These voices from the late Qing Dynasty may now seem prescient. 
Spengler saw the First World War as a sign of the West’s inevitable decline. Many of the Chinese literati who had at first been smitten with the dynamism of the West also came to see the war in the same way: Western civilization was in a state of crisis that would lead to its destruction. Today, Mr. Buchanan also calls the First World War a “mortal wound” that was “inflicted upon our civilization.” [4] Meanwhile, the Chinese, who have resurrected many of the tenets of their traditional civilization after decades of Maoist rule, argue that Western liberalization and democratization are not the True Way by which they will inherit the Earth. As China begins to return to traditional Chinese pragmatism and the West implodes, certain late Qing intellectuals now appear vindicated. Devastation after WWI. 
First among them were Yan Fu (1854–1921) and Liang Qichao (1873–1929). The dynamism of the West at first impressed them, leading them to promote Westernization in China. However, by the end of their lives, both men had come to see the dynamism of the West as self-destructive. They exhorted China to take a middle path between traditionalism and modernization, hoping that this might by the key to supplanting the West. 
China in trouble 
In the latter half of the 19th century, China was at a technological and military disadvantage. It lost a series of wars with Western powers and was forced to accept unequal treaties. This led various ministers of the Qing Dynasty, such as Li Hongzhang (1823–1901) to advocate mild forms of modernization. Meanwhile, the Meiji government in Japan had started an ambitious effort of full-scale Westernization beginning in 1868. And in 1895, after Japan defeated China in the Sino-Japanese War, it became obvious to most Chinese intellectuals that their nation’s program of limited modernization was not enough. 
Until the mid 19th century, Europe had been an inconsequential backwater for China. As late as 1793, a British attempt to establish a greater amount of trade with the Qing was rebuffed with the assertion by the Qianlong emperor (1711–1799) that China “possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no products within its own borders,” and thus had “no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians.” [5] By the mid 19th century, industrialization had made the West vastly more rich and powerful. However, some Chinese thought the sudden dynamism of the West also had intellectual origins. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, China found itself at the mercy of the Western powers that it once looked down upon. 
Darwin’s dangerous idea 
In 1895, Yan Fu was superintendent of the Beiyang Naval School. In an explanation of Western civilization to fellow Chinese intellectuals, he focused on the theory of evolution. As a young man, he had studied in England and become familiar with social Darwinism, and came to see it as the cultural fountainhead of wealth and power. “Since the publication of [Darwin’s The Origin of Species ],” wrote Yan, “of which nearly every household in Europe and America now has a copy, there has been a tremendous change in the scholarship, politics, and religion of the West. The claim that the revolution in outlook and intellectual orientation occasioned by Darwin’s book exceeds that of Newtonian astronomy is hardly an empty one.” [6] Yan spent the next ten years translating works on English evolutionist thought by men such as Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) and Thomas Huxley (1825–1895) in the hope of converting his colleagues to social Darwinism. Yan Fu was attracted to social Darwinism while studying in England. 
Perhaps it took an outsider to see the power of evolutionary thought. Darwin’s theory shook Westerners but it also gave them a certain will to power. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term “survival of the fittest,” led the transformation of Darwinism into social Darwinism, which called upon Western man to glorify victory in social competition. Victory in competition was the purpose of all life everywhere. 
Yan quickly saw the winning-at-all-costs ruthlessness of social Darwinism as a remedy for China. Writing in his work on Yan’s life, Benjamin Schwartz writes: 
What interests [Yan] is not so much the Darwinian account of biological evolution qua science. It is precisely the stress on the values of struggle–assertive energy, the emphasis on the actualization of potentialities within a competitive situation. The image of ‘nature red in tooth and claw’ does not depress him. It exhilarates him. [7] 
Yan nevertheless worried that it might be too late for China to adopt social Darwinism, and that his country would be overwhelmed by the nations that had. In a 1895 newspaper essay, “On Strength,” he wrote: 
Months and years slip by, and with rapacious neighbors all around, I fear that we will be too late, that we will follow Poland and India, providing an example of Darwin’s [elimination] before we have been able to implement Spencer’s methods. . . . Alas, our individual lives are not worth the worry, but what of our descendants, and the 400,000,000 of our race? [8] 
The battle for reform 
After defeat in the Sino-Japanese war, many Chinese intellectuals, such as Yan, began to advocate full-scale Westernization. Japan had already adopted social Darwinism in its pursuit of Western wealth and power, and the Chinese intelligentsia began to believe that China should follow suit. In 1898, the Guangxu emperor (1871–1908) appointed the minister Kang Youwei (1858–1927) to head a reform movement after Kang had requested permission to imitate Japan: 
As to the republican governments of the United States and France and the constitutional governments of Britain and Germany, these countries are far away and their customs are different from ours. Their changes occurred a long time ago and can no longer be traced. Consequently I beg Your Majesty. . . to take the Meiji Reform of Japan as the model for our reform. The time and place of Japan’s reform are not remote and her religion and customs are somewhat similar to ours. Her success is manifest; her example can easily be followed. [9] 
The emperor agreed, and the minister initiated a flurry of Meiji-style reform. A bright young man named Liang Qichao worked with Kang as his protégé, and he became one of the most influential Chinese advocates for Westernization. However, Kang and Liang’s efforts were quickly aborted after an imperial coup under the Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908). Liang Qichao 
After the Empress Dowager cut short what later became known as the Hundred Days Reform, Kang and Liang escaped political persecution by fleeing to Japan. Once there, Kang continued to support the Qing dynasty and to justify an agenda for Chinese reform via cautious appeals to Confucianism. Liang, however, ultimately broke with Kang and–like Yan–began to espouse “a new view of world history strongly colored by social Darwinism: a struggle for survival among nations and races.” [10] 
He wrote: 
If we wish to make our nation strong, we must investigate extensively the methods followed by other nations in becoming independent. We should select the superior points and appropriate them to make up for our own shortcomings. [11] 
Liang increasingly came to see social Darwinism as the fuel of the West’s dynamism, one of the “superior points” that China would do well to “appropriate.” Writing from Japan, he exerted great influence on young Chinese. Together, Yan and Liang instilled in an entire generation of Chinese students a fervent desire for change. But this influence did not bring social Darwinism to China. Instead, it brought the 1911 Revolution, the New Cultural Movement (1915–1921), and the May Fourth Movement of 1919–perturbations that would spin China into over half a century of upheaval. 
Accommodative versus transformative thought 
Despite their attraction to social Darwinism and their sometimes radical calls for reform, Yan and Liang were not revolutionaries. Indeed, although Liang and–especially–Yan attacked various instances of Chinese backwardness, they continued to support the Qing Dynasty, advocating slow transition into a constitutional monarchy based on the British model. Once the 1911 Revolution succeeded, however, Liang grudgingly threw his support behind the new republican government, but Yan continued to support monarchy. 
Questioning the West 
The First World War was a shock to reformers who wanted to embrace the West. As the war dragged on, aging reformers such as Yan and Liang became increasingly disillusioned with not only transformative revolution, but Westernization and even the West. Yan wrote that the carnage of the war was a consequence of Western traits: “Such has been the effect on the human race of civilization and science! When I look back on our [Chinese] sacred wisdom and culture, I find that it foresaw this even at that early date. . .” [12] 
Yan explained further: 
As I have grown older and have observed the seven years of republican government in China and the four years of bloody war in Europe–a war such as the world has never known–I have come to feel that [the West’s] progress . . . has lead only to selfishness, slaughter, corruption, and shamelessness. When I look back upon the ways of Confucius and Mencius, I find that they . . . have profoundly benefited the realm. This is not my opinion alone. Many thinking people in the West have gradually come to feel this way. [13] 
Liang wrote that “recently many Western scholars have wanted to import Asian civilization as a corrective to their own,” and, indeed, the latter half of the 20th century saw the importation of philosophical, religious, and cultural curiosities from the East and into the West. In the meantime he stated his goal for China: 
I therefore hope that our dear young people will, first of all, have a sincere purpose of respecting and protecting our civilization; second, that they will apply Western methods to the study of our civilization and discover its true character; third, that they will put our own civilization in order and supplement it with others’ so that it will be transformed and become a new civilization; and fourth, that they will extend this new civilization to the outside world so that it can benefit the whole human race. [14] 
Because of the devastation of the First World War, these two thinkers who had once promoted modernization and Westernization instead advocated a modernization without Westernization (or at least minimal Westernization). They seemed to believe that the course of the West was not sustainable and that the West could be supplanted by China if it modernized in a way that was compatible with its nature and culture. They seem to have realized that social Darwinism was a false promise, and that the forces it unleashed could destroy the West. 
China and the West today 
In the end, China did not follow Japan down the path of Westernization. A burgeoning Chinese nationalism grew up around anti-Japanese sentiment, and this enmity was extended to the West after Japan instead of China was awarded Germany’s Chinese concession at Versailles in 1919. Ultimately, communism on the Soviet model provided the Chinese with an alternative to both Chinese traditionalism and the West. China entered a period of socialist tyranny under Mao Zedong (1893–1976). 
After Mao’s death, China began to abandon Maoism. It is still nominally communist, but since the 1980’s, it has followed the example of Hong Kong and Taiwan and has increasingly returned to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. Chinese now praise Yan and Liang for their wisdom and prescience. The post-Mao leadership of the People’s Republic of China–beginning with Deng Xiaoping–has espoused views nearly identical to those advocated by Liang over a century ago. [15] Statue of Liang Qichao in Tianjin. 
At the same time, Westerners are now studying the warnings of Yan and Liang about the inherent instability of the West. As Western liberals such as Martin Jacques herald the coming Chinese domination, there may be a generation of European and American scholars who find themselves in a position similar to that of Yan and Liang: struggling to understand why their civilization has fallen behind that of a rival whose inferiority was once taken for granted. 
Thus, while China has found its way back to the middle path, balancing its modernization and Westernization with pragmatism, caution, and Confucianism, the West is disintegrating in a chaos of heterogeneity and decadence. The warnings of Spengler have come true, and Patrick Buchanan forecasts the death of the West. Russia and parts of Eastern Europe are trying to save themselves from liberalism and democracy, but success is not guaranteed. 
Thinkers in the Alt-Right are wrestling with the question of how to save our own white civilization. The old order is collapsing due to challenges from abroad and the immigrant invasion. Non-whites are chopping up the West the way the West once chopped up China. We are Yan Fu and Liang Qichao. We must forge a plan for the preservation of our race.

4670,CNN’s Zeleny: ’Hard to Imagine’ Obama Would Have Commuted Manning If Manning Wasn’t Transitioning - Breitbart,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” CNN Senior Washington Correspondent Jeff Zeleny stated that Chelsea Manning’s transition from a man to a woman “certainly played into” President Obama’s decision to commute Manning’s sentence, and “Without that, it’s hard to imagine, I think, this president would have done that. ”  Zeleny said, “I think a question that this president the White House will have to answer here  —   will answer, and I think it’s an important one, if  —   how much was the personal story of Chelsea Manning involved in this, because the outcry from the left was so strong on this. And she’s having a difficult time in federal prison, no question. But, to me, that is a central question here. Without that, you have to wonder if the outcome would be the same. I think it might not be. ” He added, “[B]ecause she transitioned from a man to a woman, I think all of that certainly played into this.

4671,WIKILEAKS: Suggest Sanders Was A Possible Plant Or Threatened By Mook,"We Are Change 
Wikileaks emails have shaken the very fabric of the political spectrum to the core. We have seen Clinton campaign collusion between the media, DNC, DOJ, DOS, etc. But now everyone’s fears that Sanders was potentially a plant or threatened may have been confirmed in an email from 2015.

In an email exchange from Robby Mook (re47@hillaryclinton.com) to John Podesta ( john.podesta@gmail.com ) on May,26,2015 Mook forwards an email from Christina Reynolds to the rest of the Clinton camp. In which she says that Senator Sanders went after HRC and WJC on wealth including using the word hustle. She then goes on to say that she followed up with Brad (potentially DNC CFO Brad Marshall who resigned ) and “the only thing that they’ve pushed is from the attached docs trying to get reporters to write that HRC and Bernie are actually in the same place.” Likely Referring to political stances now exposed to be a lie by Wikileaks because of Hillary’s private and public opinion. 
Following up on our call on Friday, just wanted to give some updates and flag that Bernie went after HRC and WJC on wealth (including using the word “hustle.) I followed up with Brad. The only thing they’ve pushed is from the attached docs—trying to get reporters to write that HRC and Bernie are actually in the same place. They are happy for any suggestions, but were not planning on making any big attacks around the announcement.
Mook then writes, “This isn’t in keeping w the agreement. Since we clearly have some leverage, would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via Welch–or did you establish a direct line w him?”
What agreement is Robby Mook talking about? What does he mean by “send a signal via Welch.” Is Robby Mook referring to Vermont representative Peter Welch?
Even if Mook was talking about Brad Marshall DNC CFO when he said “This isn’t in keeping w the agreement” that would expose that not only the Clinton campaign but the DNC was feeding reporters to write stories. However this possibility quickly falls apart since earlier this year Guccifer 2 revealed the DNC rigged the primary against Sanders. So Mook wouldn’t need to send a signal to the DNC CFO they were already well connected from the beginning.
The alternative is that it’s a different Welch and different Brad and that Mook wasn’t talking about Sanders but was talking about Brad. However the email chain would suggest that it’s Sanders who Mook is referring to because deeper down the string of emails are two links forwarded from Colin Campbell (Business Insider Journalist) to Clinton staffer Josh Schwerin . One to a story that is criticized by the Clinton campaign in which Sanders bashes Hillary and the other to a story about Hillary Clinton’s campaign selling pants suits. 
But it doesn’t end there, in the attachments that Christina Reynolds remarked in the email under a section in the document called “Personal Comments Praise” are positive comments by Senator Sanders about Hillary Clinton.
So I then decided to do some digging through CNBC’s reporter list and contributor list from 2015 and found no one named Brad worked there in July 2015. I looked at July, 2015 because no earlier date was available from archive.org.
I then did the same for Business insider looking for a reporter named Brad seeing as Wikileaks has already previously exposed the close connection between the media and Clinton campaign. Thinking that I could debunk the claim that Bernie Sanders was a potential plant and Robbie Mook was talking about Brad at business insider since CNBC didn’t have anyone named Brad who worked there.In which I found that business insider did not have an entry at all for 2015 either available on archive.org.
Again alternatively Mook might have been referring to another reporter not apart of CNBC or Business Insider named Brad. However the next comment “I could send a signal via Welch” doesn’t make sense. Seeing as how connected the campaign was to the media why would Mook need to send a signal?
It’s also worth noting that earlier in the year it was revealed that the Sanders campaign sold out to the Hillary Clinton’s campaign for a private jet towards the end of the campaign run.
Whatever the case may be this email is deeply disturbing and connecting the dots if the two people mentioned are Peter Welch and DNC CFO Brad Marshall things just got a lot more crazier if that’s even at all possible with recent Wikileaks emails revealing Podesta talking about satanic spirit cooking. What did Robby Mafia Mook mean by “since we clearly have some leverage?” Was the “leverage” Blackmail? threats? Maybe that explains Bernie’s cut on his face later on during the DNC. With such a wild election cycle absolutely nothing would surprise me anymore. Do you feel the Bern?
“The mafia never separates.”

4674,"5,561 Killed in Iraq during October","Share This At least 5,561 people were killed and 2,463 were wounded across Iraq during October. These figures are estimates, perhaps even conservative ones. Breaking down the above numbers, we find that 1,629 civilians were killed, and 1,693 were injured. At least 303 security personnel were also killed, and 660 more were wounded in fighting. Militants lost an estimated 3,611 members, while 108 more are known to have been wounded. Again, these are very rough estimates. Also, one U.S. soldier was killed, and at least two French soldiers were wounded during October. Turkish airstrikes left at least 17 Kurdistan Workers Party (P.K.K.) guerrillas dead as well. These figures are much higher than they were in September due to a massive operation that was launched against the city of Mosul. Last month only 2,824 people were killed and 1,208 were wounded. Due to the nature of the fighting in Iraq, accurate numbers may be impossible to obtain. The Iraqi government has been tight with releasing casualty statements concerning security personnel. On the other hand, authorities may be too loose with figures detailing militant losses. Those figures may also represent civilian losses counted as military. In other news: Iraq’s special forces entered the Gogjiali (Kokjali) district on Monday, which marks the first time security personnel have been within Mosul city limits since the Islamic State militants seized the city in 2014. They were able to progress to the Karama neighborhood. A Reuters reporter in nearby Bazwaya village — which was recaptured today — could see smoke rising from the Karama battle, and soldiers also fought in the Aden district. There are also new reports of resistance fighters attacking militants in the city. Special forces also captured the eastern villages of Subhi, Sunaidii, and Tubruq. Shi’ite militiamen reported freeing the western villages of Abu Shwayha, Albu Juradi, Arish, Aslya Huwaysh, Dalawiya Al Sharqiyan, Imam Hamza, Hasuna, Kharani Gargara, Khurba Tayir, Mushairafa, Sahi Abas, Sruj, Um Shanin, Um Sijqn, Zuwai’za’s, and Tal Shikham. On the northern front, troops liberated Najmook, Shalalat, and Tal Yabis. At least 408 people were killed and 71 were wounded in recent violence: Militants executed 300 people , civilians and former security personnel, north of Mosul in the village of Moshairefa . In Baghdad , at least 16 people were killed and 50 were wounded in various attacks around the city. Gunmen killed a Peshmerga soldier in Tel Skuf , as he was trying to defuse a bomb. In Mosul , militants killed 50 of their own and mutilated 20 others for fleeing the fighting. Seven militants were killed in fighting in the Aden district. An explosion killed several militant leaders. Read more by Margaret Griffis",0
4675,"California Today: On Catalina, the Drought Is Far From Over - The New York Times","Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) For many Californians, the drought now feels long gone. According to the latest figures from the United States Drought Monitor, about 17 percent of the state remains under “moderate drought” conditions or worse. This time last year, it was about 95 percent. But not everyone is rejoicing. On Catalina Island, just off the Southern California coast, water scarcity is so severe that residents still rely almost entirely on a pair of desalination plants. Catalina is home to population of 4, 000 or so people and a beach playground for roughly a million annual visitors. Residents and businesses have had to contend with mandatory water rationing since 2013. Surrounded by ocean, the island has a major disadvantage to the rest of California: It can’t tap the melting Sierra Nevada snow that sustains mainland farms and cities during the warm months. That’s why officials have tightly restricted the use of Catalina’s main water source: an aquifer connected to the interior Middle Ranch Reservoir. The drumbeat of winter storms has helped to replenish the reservoir, but as of last week it was still only roughly a quarter full  —   and summer is looming. Alex Krowiak, a photographer and marine science educator who lives on Catalina, published a photo essay on the island’s water problems in News Deeply this month. He shared some of his pictures with us: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • A day after 14, 000 people were ordered to flee rising floodwaters in San Jose, the mayor acknowledged that the city had been ill prepared.

We asked a few energy experts for their reactions to the plan. • Is the timeline plausible? It’s “ambitious,” said Felix Mormann, a faculty fellow at Stanford’s Steyer —  Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. “But not implausible. ” “Last year, Germany was able to briefly meet 95 percent of the country’s electricity demand with renewables,” Mr. Mormann said. “But such peak events are still a long way from weaning an entire energy economy off all nonrenewable energy on a permanent basis. ” • What are the biggest challenges?

We also presumably would have to retire some existing power plants, so the ratepayer impacts are unknown. ” Another challenge is energy storage. A total reliance on renewable energy would require a major expansion of storage capacity for those times when the wind dies down and the sun fades, said Sadrul Ula, managing director of U. C.

4676,29 Cartel Inmates Escape Border State Prison,"Authorities continue to investigate how 29 suspected cartel members were able to successfully break out of the state prison in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas. The prison escape utilized a   tunnel. [The breakout took place on Wednesday close to midnight when 29 inmates from the prison in Ciudad Victoria escaped, information provided to Breitbart Texas by Tamaulipas authorities revealed. The fugitives stopped a passing motorist and killed him in order to steal his vehicle.   Tamaulipas state police officers set up a perimeter and began a raid inside the prison to confirm how many inmates had escaped. Authorities have organized various    operations throughout the city to capture the fugitives. So far authorities have been able to capture 10 of the escapees.  Preliminary information provided by state officials point to the inmates being able to dig a tunnel that went 15 feet underground and ran 120 across to an outside area. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, Ciudad Victoria has been ground zero for a violent turf war between three rival factions of Los Zetas.

Disinformation. Misinformation. Propaganda. Outright lies. Purposeful distractions. Misleading bias. All tools of the government and close ally, corporate media, to keep the public unwise to the depth and breadth of imperialistic actions taking place around the world — and ever-encroaching surveillance and police states inside the borders of the United States. 
Perhaps you have been fortunate enough to begin pulling back the curtain on the inner workings of the government — the tandem dealings by politicians, regardless of party affiliation — to exploit the public in as many ways possible for the profits of elite politicians, corporations, industries, and banks. 
And what frequently starts as a trickle of paradigm-shifting new information, quickly forces open the floodgates — as the realization things aren’t at all as they hammered into your psyche for years through State-sponsored indoctrination of public education. It can be overwhelming — and you likely want to ‘wake up’ others to this reality — but there are pitfalls in doing so, marked by the same tactics the State employed to fool you in the first place. 
Disinformation. Misinformation. Propaganda. Outright lies. Purposeful distractions. Misleading bias. 
Sound familiar? 
With the sheer amplitude and magnitude of corruption exposed on a daily basis in the lead-up to the November 8th presidential election, alerting friends and family could seem more imperative than ever — but the aforementioned traps should and must be avoided at all costs — even when it comes from outlets posing as an answer to the mainstream. Let it be noted, that is not to decry credible, consistent independent and alternative media outlets — but it’s crucial to employ critical thinking and a bit of research to separate those with integrity from the mendacious and misleading. 
Spreading misinformation, false reports, and surreptitious propaganda does nothing to further the cause of truth — and, in fact, serves more to harm the credibility of legitimate reports in opposition to the dominant State narrative. Social media, however, has provided plenty of dry tinder for faulty info to spread like wildfire — either by the haplessly unaware, or by those with motives to ensure it quickly disseminates to cast doubt in the public mind. 
But there are a number of ways to divine authentic, genuine information from that meant to distract, divide, discredit, and delegitimize. 
Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary defines ‘disinformation’ as “false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.” 
So common is disinformation, those familiar with it will destroy said item with facts before it gains traction in public forums — but rumors being rumors, sometimes take on a life of their own. Checking whether or not a new report has any basis is usually as easy as a web search for secondary reports from known credible sources parroting the same claim — indeed, one surefire clue a report might be false, or even satire, is a lack of hyperlinks to other sources. 
Misinformation, on the other hand, can present a trickier issue in that it can have at least a kernel of truth at its core — but the packaging, which can include blatant lies or opinion misconstrued as fact, intends to mislead. 
Political and elections polls tilt public opinion, and — when convincing — can even dissuade people from voting on candidates and issues they might otherwise deem critical. In fact, selectively cherry-picking a sampling pool — or crafting targeted questions — will dramatically and sometimes ridiculously fit results to glean a desired answer. Zero Hedge, for example, caught ABC News and the Washington Post in the act over the weekend, after their joint poll showed Hillary Clinton with a double-digit lead over Donald Trump — despite increasingly heated controversy from John Podesta’s leaked emails. 
Every government on the planet employs propaganda to garner favor for policy and legislation — and more subtly to inculcate the citizenry into hollow feelings of nationalism, which serves little purpose other than fueling separation and pride based on the arbitrary geopolitical happenstance of one’s birth. Although the most cunning propaganda is virtually imperceptible, this year’s narrative of Russian aggression couldn’t be more patently obvious if it tried. 
However, that’s not to say the same idea of a Russian threat hasn’t also crept into reports from supposed ‘analysts,’ as well. A number of generally credible outlets, rather than presenting analysis with open-ended outcomes, have taken the government’s cue to warn of impending nuclear war at Pres. Vladimir Putin’s behest — despite a lack of evidence to back the claim. Fearmongering, it should be noted, is a common tool of propagandists worldwide. 
Outright lies and deliberate distractions go hand-in-hand when it comes to parsing truth from fiction — and an unfortunately growing number of tabloid-esque outlets peddle absurd lies as truth in the interest of getting clicks. Notably, differentiating tabloid sites from credible alternative sources can be the most difficult to the newly ‘awakening’ truth-seeker. 
A fine line exists between attention-grabbing headlines topping truthful articles and head-turning captions screaming wholescale lies. Indeed, considering the populace-at-large now champions an attention span less than that of a goldfish, convincing readers to venture past the first two sentences of a legitimate article can be the most frustrating facet of the job of independent media journalist. Scammers and profit-seekers capitalize on the fact most will share a link without ever bothering to view its contents — no matter if the work constitutes so much garbage. 
Although it isn’t an absolute guarantee, a wise axiom to follow stands the test of time: If it sounds too good or too absurd to be true, it probably is. If you’re still uncertain, ask someone you trust, seek a second and third and fourth source, and, above all, do a little digging — after all, the Internet puts the world at everyone’s fingertips. 
Journalism is not meant to be devoid of bias — on the contrary, good journalism persuades. However, bias can be employed in the extreme, easily bordering on misinformation. A topic proffered by FOX News and MSNBC will never be reported the same way — each has clear political bias and an agenda to push. Bias doesn’t have to be quite so flagrant to be effective. 
So-called political pundits are a common tool used by corporate media to subtly infuse bias by appealing to the public trust of a putative ‘expert’ in the particular topic of discussion — and pundits are usually just political or party insiders, ex-government employees, and others with a vested interest in ensuring public opinion sways in a certain direction. Also, pundits and experts nearly always receive compensation for their input. 
A stellar recent example of a biased opinion presented as expert assessment came from former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom — a known devotee of presidential candidate Donald Trump — who castigated the Clintons for being a “crime family.” While that point is debatable, the fact Kallstrom appeared as a former official of the government connoted insider knowledge — an appeal to his ostensible authority — and his diatribe went viral nearly immediately for its incendiary nature. It isn’t so much that his opinion didn’t deserve to be shared, but that it needed to be considered in light of his political desires — his characterization of the Clintons directly feeds Kallstrom’s desire for Trump to win the White House. 
While each of these topics could and have filled tomes, hopefully this provides a gentle reminder to be wary of believing everything you read. As any journalist worth their salt will say, if you don’t believe what’s written, research it on your own. Follow links provided. Seek new information. Open your mind to new ideas and be willing to part with indoctrinated thoughts that no longer serve you. 
But don’t be fooled — and it behooves all of us not to spread the sort of faulty information that discredits the general movement to expose the government’s innumerable lies. Share Google + The Kali Whrite Boi 
Well, the evidence is substantial: The Clintons are a crime family. And in regard to bias: any degree of journalistic bias is a complete lack of journalistic integrity. imho Hawkeyerightsmart 
Thanks for the article. I try to do my best. I also ask that you make sure the pipeline protesters are legit. That looks suspiciously like the scenario that unfolded in Canada when protesters paid by interests in the US and elsewhere crippled our industry. Neil Young even whored himself and made an appearance, took a check and was never heard from again. Tides foundation funded by the Rockefellers for example. I think you may be backing the wrong side as the natives protesters up here have no honor. They are lying whores. Social Trending",0

4680,"Flecks of Extraterrestrial Dust, All Over the Roof - The New York Times","After decades of failures and misunderstandings, scientists have solved a cosmic riddle  —   what happens to the tons of dust particles that hit the Earth every day but seldom if ever get discovered in the places that humans know best, like buildings and parking lots, sidewalks and park benches. The answer? Nothing. Look harder. The tiny flecks are everywhere. An international team found that rooftops and other cityscapes readily collect the extraterrestrial dust in ways that can ease its identification, contrary to science authorities who long   the idea as little more than an urban myth kept alive by amateur astronomers. Remarkably, the leader of the discovery team  —   and   of a recent paper in Geology, a monthly journal of the Geological Society of America  —   turns out to be a gifted amateur who devoted himself to disproving the skeptics. A noted jazz musician in Norway, he rearranged his life to include eight long years of extraterrestrial sleuthing. His hunt has now produced a significant discovery, a colorful book for lay readers and what scientists call a portrait gallery of alien visitors. “I hope and believe this will start something,” the musician, Jon Larsen, said in an interview. His goal? “Making it easy. ” His book, “In Search of Stardust: Amazing   and Their Terrestrial Imposters,” due out in August, details the secret of his extraordinarily successful hunts. Its 150 pages and 1, 500 photomicrographs, or photos taken through a microscope, tell how Mr. Larsen taught himself to distinguish cosmic dust from the minuscule contaminants that arise from roads, shingles, factories, roof tiles, construction sites, home insulation and holiday fireworks. As his book puts it, “To pick out one extraterrestrial particle among billions of others requires knowledge both about what to look for and what to disregard. ” The diminutive flecks to which Mr. Larsen, 58, has devoted himself represent the smallest parts of a cosmic downpour that has lashed the Earth for billions of years. Careful observers of the night sky are familiar with shooting stars  —   speeding bits of extraterrestrial rock that plunge through the Earth’s atmosphere, often burning up completely. The biggest can strike the ground, some forcefully enough to dig craters. In 2013, a relatively small rock exploded over the Russian city Chelyabinsk, releasing a shock wave that injured hundreds of people, mainly as windows shattered into flying glass. But all that represents a tiny fraction of the downpour. Scientists say most of the cosmic material is remarkably small  —   barely the width of a human hair. Known as micrometeorites, they rain down on the planet more or less continuously but have proved remarkably hard to find. Some bits are so small and lightweight that they drift down to the Earth’s surface without melting. The dust consists of tiny remnants from the solar system’s birth, including debris from the lumps of dirty ice known as comets and from ages of smashups among planets and the big rocks known as asteroids. While most of the particles are interplanetary in nature, some contain grains of matter from outside the solar system, or true stardust. Their diversity makes them excellent windows on the cosmos. Scientists have found micrometeorites mainly in the Antarctic, remote deserts and other places far from civilization’s haze. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, investigators tried to find them in urban areas but eventually gave up because of the riot of human contaminants. Significantly, it turns out that specialists trying to establish the cosmic origins of the tiny specks have tended to examine their chemical signatures rather than their overall appearance. That left a large opening for Mr. Larsen. Matthew J. Genge, one of the Geology paper’s four authors and a senior lecturer in earth and planetary science at Imperial College, London, used an electron microprobe at the Natural History Museum in London to determine the chemical makeup of Mr. Larsen’s finds and confirm their cosmic origin. In an interview, he said that, over all, the grains that survive the atmospheric plunge and land on the Earth’s surface add up to more than 4, 000 tons annually, or more than 10 tons a day. “He’s done a valuable thing in classifying the contaminants,” Dr. Genge said of Mr. Larsen’s work. “It has   implications. ” Donald E. Brownlee, an astronomer at the University of Washington who helped establish the field, called Mr. Larsen a true citizen scientist whose work will aid the global hunt for the tiny specks. “Your car is covered with cosmic dust,” Dr. Brownlee said. “We inhale this stuff. We eat it every time we eat lettuce. But normally, it’s incredibly difficult to find. ” Mr. Larsen came to what he calls Project Stardust as a jazz guitarist in Norway, perhaps known best as the founder of Hot Club de Norvège, a string quartet. His group helped spur the global revival of gypsy jazz. As Mr. Larsen tells the story, he was an enthusiastic rock collector as a child but did so well as a musician that he set aside his early scientific ambitions. Then, in 2009, at a country house outside Oslo, he was cleaning an outdoor table when a bright speck caught his eye. “It was blinking in the sunlight,” he recalled. He touched the fleck. “It was angular in some way, kind of metallic but so small  —   a tiny dot. ” Intrigued, Mr. Larsen suspected it was a cosmic visitor and began to look for more. He collected dust samples from Oslo and cities around the globe, moonlighting as a scientist while vacationing or touring with his jazz group. He took samples from roads, roofs, parking lots and industrial areas. Put indelicately, he collected hundreds of pounds of dreck  —   sludge from drains, gutters and downspouts, the dregs of civilization that most people try to avoid. “Still, I didn’t find a single micrometeorite,” he recalled. “It was very frustrating. ” Mr. Larsen then changed tactics. Rather than looking exclusively for cosmic dust, he taught himself how to classify the dozens of different kinds of earthly contaminants, starting a process of elimination that slowly narrowed the candidates and raised the chances that some tiny fraction of the urban debris might turn out to belong to the cosmos. The breakthrough came two years ago. In London, Dr. Genge studied one of the gathered particles  —   from Norway, not Timbuktu  —   and confirmed that it was indeed a traveler from outer space. Mr. Larsen quickly identified hundreds more. “Once I knew what to look for, I found them everywhere,” he said. In the Geology paper, the scientific team reports the discovery of about 500 micrometeorites  —   collected mainly from roof gutters in Norway  —   and tells of the detailed analysis of 48 of the extraterrestrial specks. The team includes two of Dr. Genge’s students, Martin D. Suttle of Imperial College and Matthias Van Ginneken of the Université Libre in Brussels. The team described the cosmic dust as the youngest collected to date, because gutters tend to get cleaned fairly regularly. Also, urban surfaces are recent arrivals in the global landscape compared to polar ice and ancient deserts. In his travels, Mr. Larsen recently visited with Michael E. Zolensky, an extraterrestrial materials scientist in Houston at the Johnson Space Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They not only talked shop but also went up to the roof of the large building that houses rocks from the Apollo moon program. “It was pretty cool,” Dr. Zolensky said. “The curation building is now a collector of cosmic dust. ” In an interview, Mr. Larsen described his method  —   sorting through the contaminants in a process of elimination  —   as “something that anybody can do. It could and should become part of teachings in schools, an aspect of citizen science. ” Dr. Brownlee of the University of Washington agreed. He said that, while many schools try to find cosmic dust particles in programs meant to make science classes more inviting and accessible, few if any succeed. “It could help a lot,” he said of Mr. Larsen’s method. “For education, it’s pretty cool. ” Dr. Genge of Imperial College said Mr. Larsen’s techniques, if adopted widely, might also open a new lens on the cosmos. The gravitational pull of the planets, he noted, appear to tug on the dust clouds of the solar system and slowly change their orbits. He said a wave of new terrestrial finds could help scientists better map the clouds, raising more questions for science about the structure of the universe. “I consider my microscope a telescope,” Dr. Genge said. “It can give you a pretty big picture. ”",0
4681,"A Senate Vote-a-Rama Primer, in Case You Plan to Sleep Tonight - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The Senate is getting ready for a very late night. As Republicans push forward with repealing the Affordable Care Act, lawmakers are about to undertake a grueling Senate tradition: the    a marathon of   votes that is likely to stretch on for hours. Yes, that’s really what it’s called. For at least some people in the Capitol, like those who enjoy sleeping when it is nighttime, the experience will be unpleasant. But there is a reason for the spectacle. For Democrats, it provides an opportunity to draw a distinction between their views on health care and how Republicans are approaching the issue. For Republicans, the completion of the exercise clears the way for them to advance to the next step in their quest to gut the health care law. In lieu of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, here is a primer on what to expect. No. Republicans have embarked on a fragile, multistep process to repeal major parts of the health care law, one that is on pace to at least take weeks, even without any big stumbles. But an important step on the way to repealing the law could be taken soon, perhaps early Thursday. The Senate is close to approving a budget resolution that would set in motion the process of drawing up and ultimately passing legislation to repeal the act. Don’t be fooled by the name. In this case, Congress isn’t working on the federal budget. Republicans are taking a series of steps to allow them to repeal the health care law without facing a Democratic filibuster. Passing the budget resolution will set in motion the process that, as drawn up by Republican leaders, will culminate in the passage of legislation repealing major parts of the act. The resolution will direct House and Senate committees to come up with that legislation. (There is some disagreement about the deadline for the committees to finish their work Republican leaders planned for Jan. 27, but this week a group of five Republican senators suggested extending that date by five weeks, until March 3.) The legislation that the committees come up with will be packaged in what is called a reconciliation bill, which is not subject to a filibuster. That’s critical, because Republicans have a   majority, and overcoming a filibuster requires 60 votes. Special rules apply to budget resolutions. Senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments, and being generally crafty people, they like to take advantage of that opportunity. The result is the spectacle known as the   . The Senate can consider dozens of amendments in quick succession, a task that can extend into the wee hours of the night. None of the amendments hold the force of law: A budget resolution is essentially a blueprint for Congress, and the measure never goes to the president for a signature. But the amendments can be used to provide grist for campaign ads, giving each party the opportunity to force the opposing party’s members to take votes on politically delicate topics. The lengthy undertaking, with minimal debate about the amendments being voted on, is not the ideal deliberative experience. Former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and a past chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, once described the    as “the Senate’s equivalent to Chinese water torture. ” The Senate is expected to begin the    Wednesday evening. Not surprisingly, Senate Democrats are expected to focus on amendments relating to health care law, as part of their effort to denounce the Republican push to unwind it. It remains to be seen how long the    drama will go on. Senate Democrats have already displayed their stamina once this week: They spoke on the floor in defense of the law until past midnight on Monday night. Once the amendments have been dealt with, the Senate is expected to approve the budget resolution, a key step toward the Republicans’ goal of repealing the law. The House will take up the budget resolution, which it plans to do once the Senate gives its approval. The House vote could take place on Friday. But some Republicans in the House have expressed unease with voting on the measure this week, because of uncertainty about when and how the health care law would be replaced.",0

After being sick for many years with ‘strange’ allergies, which all began after living in a home with a hidden mold problem, I can’t tell you how thankful I am and what a blessing it is that God has led me to Glen, the gentleman in the video. It is wonderful beyond words to actually feel ‘normal’ again after having felt sick, tired, and practically living in a prison to my allergies for many years now.
For many years now, I have lived with allergies so bad, not only did I feel like I had a cold 24-7, but I had other strange symptoms too:
—extreme fatigue
—sudden visual disturbances or double vision
—dizziness
—light headedness
—problems hearing, ringing in the ears
—swelling in my face
—swollen glands
—constant food allergies
—allergies to just about everything, including smells
—just an overall not feeling right, you can’t really put your finger on it, but you just don’t feel good
—constant excessively low BP and feeling as if I am about to pass out at times
—feeling like I am in a fog
—unmovitvated
—not feeling good when I would wake up in the morning, like a person having a massive hangover
There is so much more… but I have literally lived this way since around 2004 until now, and this is the first thing that has really helped to make a difference. I will keep everyone updated, as I have not yet tried the full dose. But so far, the low dose is really making a difference. I was told by Glen to start off small due to the strange allergies. So that is what I’ve been doing.
I really want to share this with everyone because I understand how frustrating life is when you don’t feel good, especially when no one gives you answers for your suffering and you have no idea what to do to fix it or make yourself feel better. It’s extremely depressing. I strongly urge everyone to share this post and to try this product. God bless you!

4683,The Financial Benefits of Buying What You Love - The New York Times,"Eleven years ago, I needed a new bike. At the time, I rode a lot. I was in a big group of relatively competitive riders, and we’d often put hundreds of miles on our bikes each week. I agonized over what bike to buy, but I kept coming back to one made by a company called Moots, a Colorado company that builds titanium road and mountain bikes by hand. The father of a good friend of mine had a Moots bike when I was growing up, and it made me salivate. The problem was, they were really expensive. Like, “far more money than I ever considered spending on a bike” expensive. Maybe $5, 000 or so back then. But the more I looked into it, the more I was convinced I had to have this bike. After putting myself through the painful process of shopping around, comparing prices and looking at models that I didn’t really want, I pulled the trigger. Following weeks of buyer’s remorse that more closely resembled terror, I came to realize something that is going to sound crazy. Buying this incredibly expensive bike was one of the best financial decisions I’ve ever made. I understand that writing $5, 000 and the words “bike” and “smart financial decision” all in the same sentence sounds absurd, but it’s not. This was a fantastic, rational, smart financial decision. And I know that goes against everything you’ve heard from every personal finance adviser out there. They’re always telling you how to save money, how to reduce expenses, how to buy cheaper. Right? Cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. What I’m saying is, that’s a shortsighted message that we need to change. Here are the reasons. 1. If you love it, you will keep it if you keep it, you will use it. I bought a bike I love. You may not like it. That’s fine. If you don’t like it, don’t buy it. But I love it. And since I love it, I’ve kept it for 11 years. And since I’ve kept it for 11 years, I use it all the time. 2. It replaces five other bikes. The guys I ride with own plastic bikes (carbon fiber). And they may feel the same way about their bikes as I do about mine, but most of them don’t. Most of them think, “Oh, I’ll just go buy a bike. ” A couple years later, they buy the newest bike, and a couple years after that, they buy the newest bike again. Each time they sell the old one and buy the new one, they lose money. That can be costly. I have changed almost nothing on my road bike in 11 years, and I like it more than when I bought it. 3. It will last. Let’s say you follow the standard advice and buy the cheaper bike. We all know what happens with the cheaper bike. It breaks! It wears out, you replace it. And not only does good gear last, but when you buy cheap stuff, you get bored with it. I do not get bored with this bike, and that is why it is saving me money. 4. It’s beautiful. That may sound silly, but it’s important. If you’re planning on having something for a long time, you’d better like looking at it. Any time I even consider looking at a new road bike, all I have to do is wash mine and see the beautiful welds, and I fall back in love again. When I’m done and can no longer ride my bike, it will hang above the mantle over my fireplace. That’s how much I love it. It’s a piece of art to me. 5. The cognitive benefit. Buying things is agonizing. The cognitive expense of switching, replacing and constantly thinking about whether you need a new bike or not has a cost associated with it, too. I don’t think about it. I don’t have to think about it. I’ve got the bike I love. Period. So, I hereby give you permission to consider buying the things you really love  —   things that may be two, three or perhaps even four times more expensive than a similar product. I am asking you to consider the possibility that buying stuff you love, regardless of price, may be the best decision you can make. Consider that if you love it and you’ll use it, you’ll save not only money but retain the cognitive and emotional energy you would have used to replace the thing once a year. You’ve heard of “buy nice, or buy twice,” right? Well this is a derivative of that idea. But don’t just buy nice, buy what you love. If you don’t, you’ll end up hating, and replacing, until you do.",0
4684,"Anti-Trump Women Marchers Threaten to Never Leave Washington, DC","Marching around without any clear direction, mission or destination  —   and without any clearly stated goal  —   the   women marchers in downtown Washington, DC, threatened to never leave the nation’s capital as they protest newly inaugurated President Donald Trump. [“We won’t go away, welcome to your first day,” women marchers chanted near the White House.  It’s ironic that they’re threatening to never leave, since many of the protesters are actually leaving tomorrow or the next day after having been bussed in from around the country and even from Canada.  For them to actually stay and occupy Washington, D. C. would cost millions per day —  an unrealistic possibility. It’s much more likely these protesters are going to catch their bus or their flight home in the next day or so and depart the national political stage without gaining any real ground. Part of the reason for their looming irrelevancy was evident in the disorganized nature of the march —  which was actually more of a giant gathering downtown. Protesters did not have a clear message of what they were asking for —  other than venting anger at the fact Donald Trump is the duly elected and inaugurated president of the United States —  and did not even march in a coordinated way in any particular direction throughout DC other than to just wander around in groups of a few hundred chanting one thing or another like the aforementioned threat to never leave or another age old Democratic Party protester chant “This is what Democracy looks like. ” Sure, celebrities like Madonna and Ashley Judd and top Democrats like newly elected California Sen. Kamala Harris joined in with speeches but the largely incoherent message that asks for nothing reasonable —  the only thing they seem to be demanding is that President Trump go away, something that will not happen —  leaves the women marchers against Trump leaving Washington empty handed.",0
4685,"AR-15 Rifles Are Beloved, Reviled and a Common Element in Mass Shootings - The New York Times","In recent years, the   has become, simultaneously, one of most beloved and most vilified rifles in the country. It is no surprise why the gun is so reviled by gun control advocates. Omar Mateen, the gunman in the attack this weekend on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. used a spinoff of the rifle produced by SIG Sauer to kill nearly 50 people. The   weapon has also been the gun of choice in several other mass shootings: at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. at a holiday party for county health workers in San Bernardino, Calif. and at the campus of Umpqua Community College in Oregon. But the National Rifle Association has taken to calling the   “America’s rifle. ” Though the federal government does not keep track of exactly how many   are in circulation, experts estimate that there are easily several million in the nation’s rifle racks and gun safes  —   a huge number, given that the gun, along with other   assault weapons, was banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004. The rifle’s extraordinary popularity can be traced to a number of factors, including the ease of its use, its embodiment of a certain military glamour, and the aggressive marketing of the gun industry. The weapon was first built in the late 1950s by Eugene M. Stoner, a former Marine and the lead gun designer at the ArmaLite Division of the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. It was an unusual rifle for the era, made of lightweight plastics and aluminum instead of traditional materials like wood and metals. It also fired a .  bullet, which was smaller and faster than the typical ammunition at the time. Partly for those reasons, the Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, purchased the   in bulk in the 1960s and, after renaming it the   turned it into the standard issue for American ground troops in Vietnam. Around the same time, a civilian version of the rifle, which unlike its military counterpart could not shoot automatically, also went on sale. Today, dozens of companies produce their own version of the weapon. “Back in the day, people called it the ‘plastic rifle’ because it felt like a toy,” said Sam Andrews, the owner of Tier One Weapons Systems, a gun engineering company in Eureka, Mo. “But that’s evolved. Now people realize that light can be good. ” Because of its   system, Mr. Andrews said, the   has a fairly gentle recoil. The weapon is also fast and accurate, he added, able to fire, under capable hands, eight rounds in a second. “The reason it’s so popular,” Mr. Andrews said, “is that if you bring a handgun to a fight where there’s an   you’re going to lose. And it doesn’t matter if you’re a   man like me or a   girl. ” Gun owners say that the   is used for hunting, sport shooting and  . The rifle is also easily accessorized with custom   like flashlights, infrared scopes and a variety of grips, and is called the Lego set of the gun world. Its owners swap product reviews or share personal hacks on a wide variety of blogs and online bulletin boards. According to a 2010 survey by the National Shooting Sports Foundation,   owners tend on average to have three different versions of the rifle and spend more than $400 per weapon on accessories and special modifications. Though the   can be bought as cheaply as $600, the average retail price was slightly more than $1, 000, the survey found. This demand has been accompanied  —   some would say caused  —   by vigorous mass marketing campaigns by gun manufacturers, which often refer to the   not as an assault rifle, but as a modern sporting rifle. Groups like the Civilian Marksmanship Program run   target competitions each year that attract scores of military veterans, one of the gun’s chief sales demographics. “You’ve got lots of returning servicemen who knew the   very well  —   how to shoot it, clean it, take it apart,” said Jim Scoutten, the executive producer of Shooting USA, a shooting sports television channel. “And when they come back, in many cases they acquire the civilian version. ” The   is also heavily marketed to younger gun enthusiasts who are attracted to the highly militarized, Special Operations culture that has become increasingly prevalent in action movies and   video games like “Call of Duty. ” In 2014, the Violence Policy Center, which advocates gun control, did a study of the marketing efforts by the Freedom Group, one of the world’s largest gun manufacturers. It found that many of the company’s advertisements used martial images of men in tactical gear and slogans like “Built to Be as Tough as the Job” and “Bravery on Duty. ” The study quotes an article in Shooting Sports Retailer, a gun industry trade magazine, warning salesmen to be wary of certain   buyers. “Many of the new shooters attracted to tactical guns for their first firearms purchase will think that they know guns because they’ve played a lot of first‐person shooter video games,” the article says. “Gamers inspired by ‘Call of Duty’ to purchase their first gun will eventually discover that they have a lot to learn. ” But despite such admonitions, the gun industry has used the popularity of these games to sell its products to “a youthful, aggressive, technologically savvy generation,” said Josh Koskoff, a lawyer representing the families of Newtown, Conn. in a lawsuit against the industry. In researching his suit, Mr. Koskoff said that he found screen shots from “Call of Duty” of   that bear the names of   gun manufacturers. To Josh Sugarman, the founder of the Violence Policy Center, the manufacturers’ attempts to push the   among the younger set stem from a stark realization about the future of the industry. “The traditional   demographic  —   white males  —   is aging and slowly dying off,” Mr. Sugarman said. “So they’re marketing the   to the next generation as the new, shiny thing. ”",0
4686,Is Yannick Nézet-Séguin Worth the Wait at the Met? - The New York Times,"That the brilliant Canadian conductor Yannick   41, will become the next music director of the Metropolitan Opera is not much of a surprise. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, has been dropping hints of this move for months  —   for a couple of years, really. After the announcement in April that James Levine was stepping aside, it took just six weeks for the details of Mr.  ’s appointment to be worked out. What is surprising, though, and concerning, is how long the Met is willing to go without a music director, even an interim appointment. After becoming director designate in 2017, Mr.   does not officially begin his tenure until the start of the   season. To put this time lag in perspective, whichever presidential candidate is elected in November could be in the final stage of a   campaign when Mr.   takes the podium as the Met’s music director. Even then, he is committing to only five productions during that season because he will continue to hold another   post as music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra. The obvious interim strategy would have been to appoint a caretaker, or a couple of them, until then. My fantasy? The Met might have asked the eminent Bernard Haitink, who once presided over the Royal Opera House in London, to share the duties with   Salonen, who could have been a sort of composer in residence. Mr. Salonen certainly proved himself a stunning conductor of repertory works this spring, when he led the most rapturous and truly electrifying “Elektra” you could hope to hear. But if the orchestra and administration are willing to wait for the gifted Mr.   so be it. The artists of the company, especially the musicians of the Met’s superb orchestra, must have an artistic leader they believe in. I think that the accomplished Gianandrea Noseda could have been a smart choice, or Fabio Luisi. Five years ago it seemed as if Mr. Luisi was being groomed to take over for Mr. Levine. That said, the Met’s enthusiasm for Mr.   is understandable. Since his 2009 debut conducting a sensual, exciting “Carmen,” he has led some 50 memorable performances at the house in works as varied as Verdi’s profound masterpiece, “Don Carlo,” and Dvorak’s gossamer fairy tale, “Rusalka. ” What he is capable of came through in 2011, when he conducted a new production of “Faust. ” Despite some wondrous passages, that Gounod opera is far from a favorite of mine. Yet drawing transparent, glowing playing from the orchestra, Mr.   had this score seeming not just refined but musically significant. Several years is a long time for an opera company to wait. There are potential downsides if the Met seems to be punting. In recent years, as Mr. Levine struggled with serious health problems (at one point missing two entire seasons of work) Mr. Gelb has been making all the artistic calls. Opera fans who count on the Met to live up to its legacy want to know that a powerful musician with real authority is in the room when decisions about commissions, repertory and casting are being made. Assuming the company muddles through this coming period without a musical leader, what artistic vision will the energetic Mr.   bring when he fully takes over? That he can conduct a probing “Don Carlo” is not enough, especially when the Met, like performing arts institutions everywhere, is under pressure to define a mission for the future that will both maintain loyal opera lovers and attract new audiences. For all his successes with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Mr.   has not charted a clear course for that essential ensemble. In a recent interview with The New York Times, he conceded that Philadelphia had become dismayingly conservative in its programming and identity. There was “not a cultivation enough of what’s new” before he arrived, he said in the interview. But when asked what he would do about it, what new or underappreciated composers he might champion, he could not come up with a single name. Compare this with Mr. Levine, who was afire with vision for the Met as soon as he achieved a leadership role in the 1970s. He founded the Young Artist Development program started giving Carnegie Hall concerts and touring with the Met Orchestra played piano quartets and other works with the Met Chamber Ensemble (another of his initiatives) made the operas of Debussy, Berg and Stravinsky central to the Met’s repertory brought overlooked Mozart works to the stage and pushed the company to present Schoenberg’s daunting   “Moses und Aron. ” His one major shortcoming concerned commissioning composers. He did not press hard enough to turn the Met into a house that fostered new opera. In many ways, the charismatic Mr.   is an exciting choice for the Met. But challenging issues and big questions will face him when he arrives. Many people will be looking for indications of his mission in the coming years. It would be an encouraging statement of purpose if one of those five operas he conducts in the   season was a world premiere.",0
4687,Woodward On Clinton Foundation “It’s Corrupt”,"  Woodward On Clinton Foundation “It’s Corrupt” By VNN on October 28, 2016 He’s correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton’s role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Conservative Tribune 
Voters have been concerned about Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s involvement in the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation. 
Liberal journalist Bob Woodward legitimized those concerns Sunday on Fox News by pointing to the Foundation’s “ pay-for-play ” scandals while Clinton served as secretary of state as something that should trouble voters. 
Woodward, who broke the Watergate story that led to the downfall of President Richard Nixon, told host Chris Wallace in no uncertain terms that the Clinton Foundation is “corrupt” and a “scandal.” 
Watch Woodward’s comments on Fox News Sunday here: 
“There are allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay-for-play,” Wallace said. “When you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new revelations (sic) about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the Foundation and the King of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this?” 
“Yes,” Woodward responded. “ It’s corrupt . It’s a scandal.” 
Wallace had attempted to get answers from Clinton about the issue at the final presidential debate with Republican candidate Donald Trump. 
But of course Clinton ducked the moderator’s question and instead talked about the organization’s charitable donations rather than its extreme conflicts of interest — something Woodward took note of and criticized her for. 
“She didn’t answer your question at all,” Woodward told Wallace. “And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done.” 
Woodward apparently didn’t want to discredit the “good work” done by the organization, but pointed out that even its “good work” is compromised by the overwhelming evidence of corruption. 
“(T)he mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation and actions by the State Department — which she ran — are all intertwined and it’s corrupt,” he argued. 
He’s correct: The Clinton Foundation is corrupt, and voters should be troubled by Clinton’s role in the unethical pay-for-play scandals. 
Unfortunately Clinton has an acute ability to avoid being held accountable for her scandals, but we have faith in the American people and their desire to be led by a person with integrity and respect for the office he holds, not someone who continuously looks for ways for his political power to benefit his personal life.

4688,Families Bearing Up a Year After Slayings in a Charleston Church - The New York Times,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   A year ago, the nation was transfixed by a different horrific crime, the shooting deaths of nine church members during Bible study at the Emanuel A. M. E. Church here. With the backdrop of the Orlando shootings, survivors and family members of the victims of the Charleston slayings on June 17, 2015, sat down to reflect on forgiveness, race relations, gun violence and the suspect, Dylann S. Roof, called Prime Evil by some of the survivors. On Friday, they joined parishioners from Emanuel A. M. E. Church, political leaders and congregations from around the region for a memorial service at the TD Arena in Charleston, where a year earlier President Obama delivered a eulogy that culminated with his singing “Amazing Grace. ” The conversation, led by Michael Schwirtz and Chris Dixon of The New York Times, included: Felicia and Tyrone Sanders, the parents of Tywanza Sanders, 26, who was killed. Felicia Sanders was present at the shooting, shielding her    granddaughter from the assailant. Polly Sheppard, a retired nurse who survived the attack. The children of Ethel Lance, who was killed. They are the Rev. Sharon Risher, Esther Lance, Nadine Collier and Gary Washington Daniel Simmons Jr. the son of the Rev. Daniel L. Simmons, who was killed. Michael Schwirtz: Nadine, you gained some fame and notoriety when you stood up in court during the bond hearing and publicly forgave Dylann Roof. Do you have any regrets about that statement? Nadine Collier: I stand behind it. All the way. I don’t have no regrets at all. I just believe in God. And didn’t have that hatred in my heart. Esther Lance: I don’t forgive him because my heart ain’t there. It ain’t going to be no time soon. I can’t forgive him. The Rev. Sharon Risher: Forgiveness is a personal journey for everybody. I have not gotten to that point where I could forgive Dylann Roof. That’s just me. Being in clergy, I’m mandated to forgive, yet I understand that God is a loving god and that he gives everybody an opportunity to reach that path of forgiveness. Felicia Sanders: Forgiveness is not for the person. The person doesn’t care whether you forgive him or not. Forgiveness is for you. Forgiveness is growth. If you don’t have any forgiveness in you, it makes you stagnate. You will never grow. You’re giving the individual the power over you, so that means you’re still a victim to the person. I want to say that we refuse to be a victim. I want him to know, Prime Evil to know, that just because you took our loved ones, you don’t have us. I believe we can get more done now than before. Tyrone Sanders: I want to put on the record that I’m not there yet. I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive. Mr. Schwirtz: Is there any wisdom or insight you have gained over the last year and what challenges are you still trying to overcome? Daniel Simmons: Over the past year, there are a lot of things that transpired positive and negative for all of us. One of the things that happens out of tragedy  —   as people we have a choice of whether we’re going to be active or how we’re going to respond. So one of the great things, and I’m so proud of my daughter, is that we began a nonprofit, the Hate Won’t Win movement. It’s a nonprofit that’s going to provide opportunity, services programs, initiatives about   crimes, violent crimes, gun control and empowerment initiatives. Everybody is doing something, whether it’s going back to school with their children, providing scholarships, whether it’s changing their lifestyles to have an opportunity to give back, to speak in different places, to travel to talk about their personal experiences, to sit down and do an interview with The New York Times. God chose the right place, the right families and the right individuals and most importantly the time. God does what he hates to accomplish what he loves. Mr. Schwirtz: Reverend Risher, what has it been like to be directly involved with the gun issue, pressing for legislation. Have you felt any frustration? Ms. Risher: Right after June 17, I became very vocal and involved in   advocacy groups on gun control. So I’ve been on Capitol Hill, I testified before the judiciary committee in Oregon. I have lent my voice to different bills. This is what that year has brought for me, an opportunity and a platform to beg our American people to look at the gun laws, look at background checks. It’s long hard frustrating work, the results aren’t something tangible that you can put your hands on, but laws are being changed and the attention to gun reform is out there. I’m always optimistic. Mr. Schwirtz: The shooting prompted fierce debate over the issue of race in South Carolina and culminated with the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the State House grounds. How has the issue evolved over the last year? Ms. Risher: The racial tension and history of Charleston is there. It took hundreds of years to build it it will probably take hundreds of years for people to look at Charleston, South Carolina, as a different place. Mr. Sanders: I had a Confederate flag, like about 10 doors down from me. I was tempted to go on the porch and ask them to take it down. But I said, ‘No I’m going to go ahead and leave them alone just like Ms. Polly says.’ If you leave them alone they’ll eventually settle down. And they took it down. They’ve got the state flag up now. Chris Dixon: Did you expect the Confederate battle flag at the State House to come down? Mr. Sanders: I was in awe because I didn’t expect it to happen. But that flag coming down won’t bring my son back. Or my aunt or the other seven. Mr. Dixon: How has the shooting changed Charleston and the way people relate or interact with each other? Mr. Sanders: If they know who I am, they’re a little kinder. When I went back to work, it seemed I got a lot of embracing from the white guys. Ms. Sanders: I still think that there is a lot of unity. I’ve met so many people within this year that I would have never met. So many people still coming giving their condolences. That’s unity right there. I see a lot more smiles. Ms.  Sheppard: The same. People are a little kinder to each other. Ms.  Sanders: June 17, 2015, was the first racism I’ve ever encountered. And I got it all at once. Ms. Sheppard: There’s unity in more ways than one. If you look on Sunday you’ll see about seven or eight of those trucks with those Confederate flags going across the bridge. So they’re unifying, too. Mr. Schwirtz: Can you speak about your relationship with Emanuel? Are any of you still active in the church? Ms. Sanders: I’ve been trying to go. It’s not easy. It’s a preparation for me. When I go there, I have to not eat at night or drink anything in the morning so that I won’t have to go downstairs to the bathroom. Emanuel is not Emanuel no more. Emanuel is the new Emanuel. The church for some reason thinks it’s about the church. The fellowship hall, where it all happened at, they didn’t give it no respect. I was in line to go into my son’s funeral. And I heard somebody say, ‘Oh, you should go downstairs now, it smells like blood.’ How do you think that made me feel? Ms. Sheppard: This happened on Wednesday and they were back in church on Sunday, which I thought was terrible. Ms. Simmons: I don’t feel the church should have been opened that soon. Because when I went to the church a couple of days after, I could still sense and smell blood. So it wasn’t a good feeling for me. It was one of my weakest moments I’ve experienced throughout this whole process. Ms. Collier: The last time I was there was Aug. 30, 2015, my mother’s birthday. And I haven’t been back since. Growing up I was on choir at the church. Since this happened, it’s like, everything, my whole life changed. My mom was assassinated for the church. My momma when she was not ushering, we got a little seat we sit at, two three rows from the back. I’d come around and sit on the side of her. Can you imagine me coming in and sitting in the front? It just freaks me out. Took everything out of my body just to do that on her birthday. I haven’t been back.",0

4690,President Elect Trump – A New Era of Unpredictability Awaits,"Leave a reply 
Makia Freeman – President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, who yesterday on November 8th, 2016 successfully won the US presidential election. Trump managed to defeat favorite Hillary Clinton by a relatively narrow margin. The victory came as a shock to many Americans, regardless of where they reside on the political spectrum. For many in the alternative media, the victory of President Elect Trump comes with a great sense of relief that career criminal Hillary Clinton was not elected (or installed) as so many had expected. Clinton had already showed a propensity to collude, cheat and lie during the Democratic Primaries where she triumphed with dirty tactics over Bernie Sanders. For many others, turned off by Trump’s racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and generally flippant comments, the Trump victory is devastating and will challenge them psychologically and emotionally to accept the reality for the results. Hillary Clinton: What Went Wrong? 
The result is especially surprising given the degree to which Hillary Clinton had ingratiated herself with the upper echelons of the NWO (New World Order). From an outside perspective, it seemed Clinton had left no stone unturned in brown-nosing and sucking up to the most powerful people and organizations in the world, including the Rothschilds, Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) and many many more. Additionally, given her propensity for criminality and her powerful backers such as George Soros, coupled with the serious problems electronic voting machines possess in being able to be hacked and the vote flipped, many are left wondering how Hillary lost . What went wrong? 
At this stage in the game of post-election analysis, we can point to a few things. Hillary’s criminal past clearly caught up with her. It is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections for a leading candidate to be under an on-again, off-again criminal investigation. Clinton simply has so many scandals in her recent and distant past that it’s like trying to stop a ship with 30 holes from sinking; you can’t plug them all. She was also running up against the problem that the Democrats had been in power for 8 years, when recent history shows that power seems to change hands in around that time frame. Clinton represented the establishment, and as the popularity of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shown, people are tired of the same. They intuitively know the system is rigged and corrupt, even if they can’t exactly put their fingers on it. Obama, Mr. “Hope and Change”, got in with a slick campaign of promising something different (upon which he didn’t deliver). Trump represented anti-establishment, and whether he truly embodies that or not is an entirely different matter, because it’s all about perception. Does a Trump Victory Show that NWO Powerbrokers Are Less in Control than It Seems? 
The win of President Elect Trump is truly shocking and monumental event. Many people (including myself) were predicting that it was a foregone conclusion that Clinton would win. For instance, founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange stated before the election that “Trump would not permitted to win” . The MSM (Mainstream Media) were clearly favoring Clinton at almost every turn. Whatever you think of Trump, we can at least say the will of the majority of American voters was respected, which is a relief, given how much corruption exists in our society today. 
The question now is this: is a Trump victory the result the NWO powerbrokers wanted all along, for reasons we are yet to see? Or is it a genuine uprising against these forces? What Does a Trump Presidency Mean for Liberty and Freedom? 
For me, Trump can be summarized in one word: unpredictable . President Elect Trump truly embodies unpredictability more than any other high-level politician around. One moment he is railing against the 9/11 official story, then he is declaring his love for Israel, then he is bringing up the vaccine-autism connection, then he is suggesting Snowden be killed. Next he is suggesting GMO corn makes you stupid, then he suggesting Muslims be banned from the US , then he is calling global warming a hoax , then he is suggesting the Government be given the power to shut down the internet. Then, after all of that, he makes friendly overtures to Russia while demonizing the hell out of Iran. What does he stand for? Peace or war? Freedom or tyranny? 
At this stage no one knows, probably not even Trump himself. He has contradicted himself numerous times throughout his campaign, and merely once suggesting a good idea (i.e. looking at who controls the issuance of money instead of letting the international bankers via the Federal Reserve control it) doesn’t mean it will become his policy. 
Unpredictability is one of Trump’s great qualities, but also one of his most dangerous. A lot will depend on with whom he surrounds himself once becoming President Trump, and what kind of advice they give him. His VP Mike Pence is a standard conservative Republican who will be no doubt far more to the liking of the NWO conspirators, but Trump is also taking advice from retired DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) chief Michael Flynn, the man who came out and highlighted how the US created ISIS in a declassified DIA document . 
For now, America and the world have around two-and-a-half months to get over the incredible shock of yesterday’s result and psychologically prepare itself for a Trump presidency. Meanwhile, it would be foolish for us to expect that one man can fix all of America’s problems. It will be the job of the independent and alternative media to hold Trump to his promises and his word, and to continue to share ideas of how we can truly create a better, freer and more just society. This necessarily involves questioning the very structures and systems of society, and will never magically improve with just the passing of the baton from one politician to another.

4691,OBAMA IN GREECE: THE LAST FLIGHT OF THE LAME DUCK,"Home » Obama in Greece: The last flight of the lame duck Obama in Greece: The last flight of the lame duck 15.11.2016 
Barack Obama begins his last tour as US president on November 15th. He plans to visit Greece, Germany, and Peru. The first place that President Obama is going to visit will be Athens. Common mockery 
According to the official statements of the White House, Obama is going to announce support for the ""ongoing efforts to stabilize the Greek economy"", as well as to appreciate the ""hospitality of the Greek government and people extended to the refugees and migrants"". Both statements may be considered an inappropriate joke: the Greek economy is still in very critical condition, and the country is facing a migration crisis leading to a humanitarian and demographic catastrophe. The Democrat’s requests 
Moreover, Barack Obama is going to demand that the Greek government support the anti-Russian sanctions on the ballot in the EU in December, as well as ban Russian warships from entering Greek ports. In addition, Obama is going to demand that Greece remove its veto on Macedonia’s entry into NATO. National interests against neoliberal delusion 
All of Obama’s demands for Athens are a classic example of the pressure exerted on national governments by globalists. Neoliberals demand the renunciation of individual countries’ own interests in favor of a ""common good"". However, the reality is that following this course leads to ruin, degradation, and sometimes the total destruction of states. Related links",0
4692,GOP Sen Collins: House Healthcare Bill ’Dead on Arrival’ in Senate - Breitbart,"Wednesday in an interview with Yahoo News’ Katie Couric, Sen. Susan Collins ( ) said there was little hope in the U. S. Senate for the House GOP healthcare bill should it make its way out of the House.  “I’m still looking at the bill, but I have a lot of concerns about it,” Collins said. “For example, some initial analysis suggests that as many as   million people could lose their health insurance. And for seniors, who make a disproportionate amount of the population in Maine, it would mean substantial premium increases that would not be covered by the increase credit. So those are two concerns that I have. ” After laying out some more problems she had with the legislation, she said she agreed with Sen. Rand Paul’s ( ) assertion the bill would be dead on arrival in the U. S. Senate, but not for the same reasons as Paul. “I do not think it would be well received in the Senate,” she said. “But I do want to emphasize that it’s still a work in progress. The House committees are going to be working their will on the bill and it has to go before the full House before it comes to us.  And it’s been a work in progress, as Secretary Price has said. And, the bill that was released this week is far better than the bill we were briefed on the week before. So, who knows, maybe it will eventually get better  —   and thus, will be better received in the Senate. ” (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

4694,Millions of South Koreans Rise Up Against Shadow Government,"Your News Wire 
South Koreans are rising up in their millions and demanding the overthrow of their government after a series of leaks proved president Park Geun-hye is a puppet controlled by a covert shadow government. 
In a furor eerily similar to that surrounding Hillary Clinton’s use of an email server and charity slush fund, critics are charging that Park has irresponsibly managed classified information and benefited from corrupt practices using non-profits as a front. 
The South Korean and U.S. comparisons stop there however. Rather than apathetically accepting the situation – like in America – South Koreans have risen up and the media has rounded on their leader. Citizens have taken to the streets en masse and the country’s media have called for the president to step down immediately – or face impeachment. 
The essence of the scandal is this: It has emerged that Park, famously aloof even to top officials and aides, has been taking instructions from a group known as the “eight fairies” including Choi Soon-sil, a shadowy billionaire with ties to George Soros and Angela Merkel. Choi has existed around the edges of South Korean power circles for decades, but has never held an official position. Posters of the president being controlled by puppet strings are cropping up all over South Korea as country-wide protests continue to rage.

The Washington Post reports that “Calls for her resignation — and even impeachment — are resonating from across the political spectrum, and her approval ratings have dropped to a record low of 17 percent, according to two polls released Friday. 
On Friday, Park directed all of her top advisers to resign en masse, with her spokesman saying a reshuffle would take place, the Yonhap news agency reported. Kim Jae-won, senior presidential secretary for political affairs, told a parliamentary session that Park’s chief of staff had already stepped down. 
It’s not clear, however, whether it will be enough. 
“Park Geun-hye’s leadership is on the brink of collapse,” said Yoo Chang-sun, a left-leaning political analyst. Shin Yool, a right-leaning professor at Myongji University, called it the “biggest crisis” since South Korea was founded 70 years ago. “The president has lost her ability to function as leader.” 
Choi is the daughter of the late Choi Tae-min, who was a kind of shaman-fortune teller described in a 2007 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul as “a charismatic pastor.” Locally, he’s seen as a “Korean Rasputin” who once held sway over Park after her mother was assassinated in 1974. 
“Rumors are rife that the late pastor had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result,” read the cable, released by WikiLeaks. 
Park has strongly denied any improper relationship. 
But South Korean media have uncovered evidence that, they claim, shows that Choi Soon-sil wielded undue influence over the president. 
JTBC, a television network, said it had found a tablet computer that contained files of speeches the president had yet to give, among other documents. The younger Choi is said to have edited the landmark speech that Park gave in Germany in 2014, laying out her vision for unification with the North. The Hankyoreh newspaper wrote that actual presidential aides “were just mice to Choi’s cat.” 
She is also rumored to have created a secret group called “the eight fairies” to advise the president behind the scenes. 
TV Chosun, the channel belonging to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, aired a clip showing Choi overseeing the making of an outfit for Park, “raising doubt whether Park made any decision at all without Choi,” the paper said. 
South Korean media have been full of Photoshopped graphics to illustrate the relationship, including one showing Park as a puppet and Choi Soon-sil pulling her strings. 
Meanwhile, investigators are looking into allegations that Choi siphoned off money from two recently established foundations that collected about $70 million from the Federation of Korean Industries, the big business lobby with members including Samsung and Hyundai. Prosecutors raided Choi’s home in Seoul this week looking for evidence. 
At the same time, there are allegations that the daughter of Choi Soon-sil was given special treatment when she applied for Ewha Womans University, one of South Korea’s top colleges. 
Local media have reported that her daughter’s grades were not good enough, so the rules were changed to give credit to applicants who had won equestrian awards, as she had. The already-embattled president of Ewha resigned this week. 
Ironically, this all comes less than a month after Park’s administration instituted a wide-ranging new law aimed at cracking down on corruption and influence peddling. 
Choi is in Germany with her daughter and is refusing to return to South Korea to answer questions, saying she is having heart problems and cannot fly. But in an interview with the Segye Ilbo, she denied creating the Eight Fairies group, owning the tablet or knowingly receiving classified information. “Because I was not a government official, I had no idea that this was confidential,” she told the paper. 
Park apologized Tuesday for the scandal, saying she had always acted “with a pure heart.” Then she canceled a planned meeting related to North Korea on Friday so she could consider ways to “resolve the nation’s anxiety and stably run the government,” according to a spokesman. 
She did, however, attend a ceremony in the southern city of Busan, where university students shouted “Park Geun-hye should step down!” and “Choi Soon-sil must be arrested!” Share:",0
4696,We Know The Truth,"link Hey People: I always enjoy your threads, though I think you focus too much on a singular belief issue or pattern, and then it becomes self affirming for you in your research. First, this: But voices actual voices in your head is always mental illness. Sorry, maybe a stress reaction, not to be judgmental, happens to the best and such, just really not what I am trying to convey here. Though I believe you are quite intelligent, I don't think you are qualified, exactly, to make that wholesale, definitive judgement. You even contradict that by referencing Dr. Vinod's ""channeling"" of the Nine in 1952. Channeling, by definition, (from Dictionary.com) means in one sense: the practice of professedly entering a meditative or trancelike state in order to convey messages from a spiritual guide. Surely this process would involve the sensory structure of hearing. I don't wish to debate voice to skull tech with you because I don't sense this is really what your thread is about. But there have been lawsuits waged and won over such technology being used to harass people, who don't test as schizophrenic or any other DSM related diagnosis that would explain auditory hallucinations, indicating mental illness. Now, that's not to say that anyone hearing voices is being technologically harassed. But saying definitively it's always mental illness does a disservice to the search for knowledge, and stopping such technology being used on people. link to lawsuit PSYCHOTRONIC WEAPONS-SPACE PRESERVATION ACT-House Resolution bill 2977-Brain manipulation from a distance-2001-2002 Last year, in October, the Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich introduced in the American Congress a bill, obliging the American president to get engaged in the negotiations aimed at the ban of space based weapons. In this bill the definition of a weapon system includes: any other unacknowledged or as yet undeveloped means inflicting death or injury on, or damaging or destroying, a person (or the biological life, bodily health, mental health, or physical and economic well-being of a person) through the use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations or the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations"" (12). As in all legislative acts quoted in this article the bill counts with sound, light or electromagnetic stimulation of human brain. Psychotronic weapons remain, at least for a layman uninformed of secret military research, in the sphere of science fiction, since so far none of the published scientific experiments was presented in the way which would allow for its replication. That it is feasible to manipulate human behavior with the use of subliminal, either sound or visual, messages is now generally known. This is why in most of the countries the use of such technologies, without consent of the user, is banned. Devices using light for the stimulation of the brain show another way how the light flashing in certain frequencies could be used for the manipulation of human psychic life. As for the sound, a report on the device transmitting a beam of sound waves, which can hear only persons at whom the beam of sound waves is targeted, appeared last year in the world newspapers. The beam is formed by a combination of sound and ultrasound waves which causes that a person targeted by this beam hears the sound inside of his head. Such a perception could easily convince the human being that it is mentally ill. The acts presented in this article suggest that with the development of technology and knowledge of the functioning of human brain new ways of manipulation of human mind keep emerging. One of them seems to be the electromagnetic energy. Though in the open scientific literature only some 30 experiments were published, supporting this assumption (1),(2), already in 1974, in the USSR, after successful testing with military unit in Novosibirsk, the installation Radioson (Radiosleep) was registered with the Government Committee on the Matters of Inventions and Discoveries of the USSR, described as a method of induction of sleep by means of radio waves (3), (4), (5)… 22. Dear Senator-Attorney Letter included: We seek your office’s assistance in initiating hearings and a fact-finding congressional inquiry into the government agencies and/or private companies that are targeting citizens. Many citizens are desperate to be freed from the disturbing, intrusive and oppressive targeting. Evidence supports the conclusion that weapons exist that could be used against individuals, based on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filings, public releases by agencies, and other technologies that indicate the level of technological sophistication. The weapons are believed to be based on electromagnetism, microwaves, sonic waves, lasers and other types of directed energy, and were characterized as “psychotronic” in Rep. Dennis Kucinich’s draft of House Resolution 2977, the Space Preservation Act of 2001. Furthermore, it is undeniable that government agencies have tested citizens without permission in the past; for example, the CIA’s human experimentation discussed in Orlikow v. U.S., 682 F.Supp. 77 (D.D.C. 1988), secretly administered lysergic acid diethylamide discussed in United States v. Stanley, 483 U.S. 669 (1987), and military chemical experimentation as discussed in Congressional Committee Report 103-97, 103d Congress, 2d Session, S. Prt. 103-97 (Dec. 8, 1994). Lastly, the sheer numbers of people complaining of being targeted, including people with post-graduate degrees and a lifetime of achievements, and the similarities in symptoms tend to outweigh a dismissive response based on charges of anecdotal evidence or group paranoia. there is a certain risk of sounding too conspiratorial, however, common denominators such as physical symptoms and medical reports, surveillance scenarios, harassment techniques, and more can be readily established. I highly recommend reading in full the details of this lawsuit, containing a great deal of verifiable information. The military has admitted for some time to having, at the least, a non lethal (lol) weapon called active denial. But this rabbit hole goes much, much deeper. Having said all that, as I've said before in one of your threads, I think it wise to consider that it's not just one thing or another. It's many things. There could be aliens, for instance. And then there could be MILABS, leaving the person with the memory of an alien abduction, rather than their being used for human experimentation, which is supposed to be against our constitution, and most certainly against our human rights. And then people can also suffer from temporal lobe, seizure like hallucinations, but one must also remember that these can most certainly be induced, artificially, as well. In short, I think your rabbit hole is only making it to the gopher level regards,",0
4697,How to Deal With Digital Distractions - The New York Times,"I used to teach at the graduate school of information sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. I couldn’t believe how many students looked at ESPN. com or its ilk in class. We live in a world of screens, where digital distractions contend with our need to learn. Is multitasking a good idea? No. Clifford Nass, a Stanford professor who pioneered research into how humans interact with technology, conducted numerous studies of people juggling different cognitive tasks, like talking on the phone, watching television and working on a computer. Basically, people are bad at it. They are actually moving in and out of different things quickly, not working simultaneously, and nothing gets enough attention. On the other hand, performance isn’t the same as learning.   Song, a psychologist working with the neuroscientist Patrick Bédard at Brown University, found that when people learn motor skills with a distraction, the two are internalized. That can create better learning, particularly if you have to recall facts in a dissonant environment. “When pilots are learning how to handle emergency situations,” Dr. Song said, “it’s better if they learn them with distractions going on. ” But don’t turn the volume to 11. “If you can take an exam while you have Twitter on, sure, study while you’re on Twitter,” Dr. Song said. “But you better negotiate with your teacher. By the way, colleagues say I shouldn’t even talk about this. ” If you’re easily distracted, do something small about it. Quiet music may be the distraction a flighty person needs to keep focusing. If the student tries to focus too completely, he may, paradoxically, break off altogether with a bigger distraction. Analog learning works better. Writing notes by hand is better than typing them on a laptop, according to a 2014 Princeton study. People taking notes by hand use fewer words but they have better recall of concepts. “People who take notes on computers are transcribing, and people taking notes by hand tend to be choosing more,” said Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. “An important part of learning is ordering things, and you do that more with note taking. ” Web surfing is the new secondhand smoke. Dr. Zimmerman, like me, used to spot students looking at entertainment websites in class, a disengagement he thought hurt the student and the class over all. Even sitting next to someone multitasking on a laptop could affect your learning and performance, according to a 2012 Canadian study. With that discovery, he said: “I banned them. No one has complained. ”",0
4698,Janet Reno Was Unafraid of Science That Could Exonerate the Innocent - The New York Times,"A phone call to the office of Jeremy Travis, new in Washington: “The attorney general wants to talk with you. ” The attorney general of the United States at that moment, in 1994, would have been Janet Reno, and not long before, Mr. Travis had gone to work for her as director of the National Institute of Justice, an agency that conducts research for the Justice Department. Ms. Reno told him that she was sitting with one of her deputies, Mr. Travis recalled on Thursday, and they had just read a news article about the DNA exoneration of a man who had been on death row. “She said, ‘I have two questions,’” Mr. Travis said. “‘How many more are there like this? What can we learn from it? ’” It may not be immediately apparent how daring that inquiry was 22 years ago. DNA testing was then in its early days as a tool in criminal justice, and few people anticipated that prisoners would clamor to have old biological evidence retested in hopes of clearing their names. Moreover, hardly anyone was willing to say aloud that innocent people really were locked up. Politicians could not spend money fast enough on prisons. After a long climb in crime rates, the country was ratcheting up sentences. Bill Clinton had suspended his presidential campaign in 1992 so that he could be in Arkansas, where he was then the Democratic governor, for the execution of a murderer who had shot himself in the head and was so   that he asked prison guards to save the pecan pie from his last meal for him as he was being led to his lethal injection. Ms. Reno had read, though, about the exoneration of 16 people, including a former marine, Kirk Bloodsworth, who had been sent to death row in Maryland for the killing of a child on the strength of testimony by five eyewitnesses. At such a    moment, the notion that fallibility was poured into the foundation of the criminal justice system was startling and disruptive. Ms. Reno, who died this week at 78, was unafraid of looking directly at it. The first woman to hold the position of attorney general, she served eight years. “This is an illustrative story of how she fought for truth, and how she worked,” said Mr. Travis, who is now the president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Without Google or the rich resources of the modern web, the researchers working for Mr. Travis scoured reports from around the country. The Innocence Project in New York, the leading organization using DNA to overturn convictions, had some information, but it too was still in an embryonic phase. Still, the researchers found 28 cases of innocent people who had been wrongly convicted, and prepared a report, “Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science. ” DNA testing is practical only in a small fraction of cases, but the flaws it discloses in conventional investigative techniques  —   first documented in that report  —   are profound. The most important question is not how those innocent people got out of jail, but how they got into it. Eyewitness errors were a leading source of wrongful convictions, as were false confessions and junk forensic science. The report included commentaries by prosecutors, a police superintendent, and Peter J. Neufeld and Barry C. Scheck, the   of the Innocence Project, who wrote, “There is a strong scientific basis for believing these matters represent just the tip of a very deep and disturbing iceberg of cases. ” (Mr. Neufeld, Mr. Scheck and I later wrote a book on the subject.) At Ms. Reno’s request, the justice institute brought in panels of psychologists who had studied the working of human memory. “She stayed the whole day,” Mr. Travis said. The work led to new ways of asking witnesses to look at suspects and of recording complete interrogations, as well as greater rigor in laboratory practices and the preservation of evidence. Ms. Reno met many detectives in her home as a child  —   her father had been a police reporter in Florida  —   and for her, it was important that the public realized they were hardworking,   great people, said James Doyle, a lawyer and author who interviewed her for “True Witness,” a book about eyewitness procedures. That first report she commissioned on DNA exonerations looked fearlessly at the errors not just of police officers, but of a whole constellation of players in justice. “Ernest Hemingway once famously wrote that ‘all modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain, called ‘Huckleberry Finn,’” Mr. Doyle wrote on the Crime Report website. “It is not too much to say that all modern criminal justice reform can be traced to that pamphlet. ”",0

4701,Ann Coulter: Trump Should Withdraw Funding from Any School with Speech Codes,"In an interview broadcast Friday on Breitbart News Daily, author Ann Coulter talked about the violent demonstrations   have employed to shut down speech they dislike, notably Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News at UC Berkeley this week. [SiriusXM host Alex Marlow contended that the mainstream media’s irresponsible use of terms like “fascist” and “white nationalist” for speakers who are not of the Left has laid the groundwork for violence against them.  “It is the rise of a genuinely violent fascist movement,” Coulter said of these   gangs. “It would be as if the Nazis went around complaining about how the Jews were attacking them and oppressing them. That’s basically what we have going on now. ” She recalled how violent protesters shut down a Trump rally in Chicago during the 2016 presidential campaign. “It was amazing to me how many families with kids, and wives, and daughters, they continued to go out to see Trump. It is like my college speeches, something I’ve been doing for a long time. You know, you’ll have 20 speeches that are fine, and then suddenly, BAM! the violent mobs show up. You never know when it’s going to happen, so you have to be prepared all the time,” she said. “But Americans still did come out. I think that was intended to reduce Trump’s crowds, and make it look like he was the one creating the violence. All of this, just for someone who says, ‘We have to take care of Americans first.’ That’s what they’re so upset about, Alex,” Coulter declared, returning to an earlier point about how the U. S. Congress is attempting to cut back on the cost of major programs for Americans, such as Social Security and Medicare, at the same time   advocates insist on importing even more dependents. “We can’t afford that. We can’t afford this. We have to raise the retirement age. No, stop! We gave at the office!” she exclaimed. Coulter agreed wholeheartedly with President Trump’s threat to “withdraw all federal funding from Berkeley” if the college administration refuses to deal with violence. “This is a genuine threat to democracy when people can’t engage in the first of the Bill of Rights, the very first one that’s mentioned: freedom of speech,” she warned. “This has been a burgeoning movement, particularly on our college campuses, for a long time. ”  “In a calm, reflective moment, I think he should do the same thing with any colleges that have speech codes or need special ‘free speech zones’ where students   professors are disciplined for engaging in First Amendment speech,” she advised.  “This has absolutely been done before,” she noted. “The IRS has been used to say, ‘Sorry. If you’re collecting student aid, you can’t attend these colleges. We’re not sending any student aid to these colleges who don’t abide by  …    ’  —   and those were often kind of silly ‘principles’ being enforced, like Bob Jones University, that’s sort of a very hardcore fundamentalist Christian college. I’m a Christian. It has some beliefs  —   or it used to I don’t know if they still do  —   but one was from the Tower of Babel. They wouldn’t allow interracial dating. ”  “They had blacks, they had whites, and it was mostly a    country back then  —   in fact, scholarships for black students  —   but whites couldn’t date black students. Blacks couldn’t date white students,” she explained. “And I ought to add, because I looked this up at the time, there was very little dating of any sort. If you went on a date at Bob Jones, you had to have a chaperone with you. Anyway, there was no racial animus to this it hit both races equally. ”  “But for that, the IRS came down like a ton of bricks on Bob Jones University. No federal aid through student scholarships, as I recall. A student who had student aid could not attend that college. And now, we have a genuine fascist, violent fascist, movement rising up, and there’s not only no punishment, but taxpayers are paying for this? Oh, no, no, no. Second to immigration, the next biggest problem in this country is the universities and public schools,” she said. Coulter said this climate of hatred and violent repression of dissent comes from the university administrations.  “These are not spontaneous movements,” she scoffed. “I described in my book Demonic on groupthink and mob behavior, that these are particularly lickspittle students that want to please the professor. And they know damned well their professors are opposed to everything Ann Coulter says and everything Milo says. It’s just like presenting a polished apple to the teacher. ‘Oh, teacher, here: I brought you a gift today! I went and protested Ann Coulter! ’” “At the risk of being snobbish, but telling you what the truth is, it doesn’t tend to happen at the Ivy League schools,” she observed. “Berkeley is weird.   …     The worst ones are the Jesuit colleges and the community colleges. I mean, at Harvard and Yale  —   and I’ve spoken at both places many times  —   Wellesley, Smith, my own alma mater Cornell, the kids are too  —   they want to challenge you intellectually. They’d be embarrassed to throw something. ”  “Though I do think there is a new movement kind of sweeping through here,” she added, “at some of these schools, we’d be organized. We’d be ready to go. I’d give the speech. They could stand up at the mics. I’d take questions until they had collapsed from exhaustion. And usually at the tougher schools to get into, that’s how they want to be. They want to ask you a question and outsmart you. It’s when it is a    who doesn’t have the power of speech or logic, and just throws food  —   so it would tend to be the lesser colleges. ”  “The other thing is, when we would be prepared and have college Republicans and large men prepared to throw out any hecklers, sometimes the members of the administration would stop people  —   our people, who had rented the room had paid for me to come speak. Someone comes to disrupt and start heckling, they try to remove the heckler, and an administrator  —   this happened at Syracuse University  —   some dean of students stepped forward and said, ‘You can’t remove the heckler because you’re interfering with his free speech rights! ’” Coulter said with astonishment.

4702,BBC: Hijab Wearing Basketball Players ’Big Step Forward for Women’s Sport’ - Breitbart,"The   funded BBC on Thursday claimed that new rules allowing women to wear a hijab during basketball matches represent “a big step forward in women’s sport”. [The organisation made the claim on the BBC Sport Facebook page, over the news that the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) had changed a ruling that did not allow female basketball players to wear the hijab during matches, on the grounds that it was a safety issue.  However, the claim was poorly received by the page’s followers, who contended the decision is, in fact, a step backwards rather than forwards. “In what way is this a big step forward? The hijab is an oppressive garment for men to control their wives. But yeah, if it makes the beeb feel more virtuous then let’s pretend it’s progressive,” user Nathaniel Shelley wrote. Another user, Codey Sharp, wrote: “This is a step backwards, allowing women to be oppressed even whilst playing sport, marvellous. ” In 2014, the Qatari women’s team were forced to withdraw from the Asian Games after being denied permission to wear the garment during matches. Last month, the BBC lauded an Australian photographer’s response to what he called a “tragic” rise in “  sentiment” in his homeland by taking the   piece of Islamic female clothing known as the burqa and using it as an art prop, describing it as “critique of the rising far right and Islamophobia”. BBC Radio host Roger Bolton recently described the organisation’s coverage of religion as a “mess” because its young metropolitan liberal staff are “dangerously   ”.

4705,Fact-Checking Donald Trump’s National Security Speech - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Donald J. Trump turned his attention to national security and military readiness on Wednesday, saying in a speech that his approach to foreign policy could be summed up in three words: “peace through strength. ” Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, offered many facts to support his vision and outlined the approach a Trump administration would take on issues related to national security. We found five of his key claims or proposals to be misleading or consistent with current policy. “As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild the military. ” The military, Mr. Trump said, needs to be expanded and equipped with a new generation of aircraft and other equipment. The changes he proposed  —   such as adding about 90, 000 soldiers to the Army and expanding the Navy to 350 ships  —   would require tens of billions of dollars a year in additional military spending (expanding the Army alone could cost more than $10 billion a year). To get the needed money, Mr. Trump said he would call on Congress to reverse the cuts to military spending made as part of the budget sequester in 2013, which was the result of a compromise reached between Democrats and Republicans. Still, the new spending would ultimately cost taxpayers nothing, Mr. Trump suggested, turning to familiar Republican talking points to explain how he would pay for it. He said he would eliminate wasteful government spending, increase energy production and trim the federal work force, including the military bureaucracy, for instance. He also suggested he would collect unpaid taxes, which he said amounted to $385 billion. But Mr. Trump offered scant details about how much his new military budget would cost and how his proposals to “make the government leaner” would cover the spike in military spending. _____ “The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915. ” The shrinking of the Navy’s fleet is a specious claim that has been a popular Republican talking point for years. The variation that Mr. Trump repeated on Wednesday  —   that the Navy’s fleet of 276 ships is its smallest since World War I  —   is accurate in strictly numerical terms. But military commanders and experts say the claim purposely obscures the ability of today’s Navy, ignoring the vast gap between what a warship could do a century ago and the frightening array of armaments, aircraft and surveillance equipment carried by modern Navy vessels. Cruisers and destroyers carry cruise missiles, submarines can launch nuclear weapons, and a single aircraft carrier with its escort ships wields more firepower than most militaries on the planet. _____ “I will ask my generals to present me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS. ” The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, is in retreat in Syria and Iraq, and Pentagon officials and analysts believe that the plans laid out by the Obama administration are working. Still, the group remains a potent force in the Middle East, and its loyalists overseas continue to present a significant threat. Could that be addressed by a new plan that focuses on, as Mr. Trump said, “cyberwarfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare” in addition to military action? Unlikely, say defense officials and analysts. The United States and its allies are already focusing on those fronts, and have been especially successful at targeting the Islamic State’s financial strength by striking its   infrastructure and seizing territory, depriving the group of its tax base. The ideological piece has proved more difficult  —   the Islamic State is still attracting recruits  —   but who exactly would come up with Mr. Trump’s new plan was not made clear. The generals he cited in his speech, after all, were the ones who devised the current plan. _____ “We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cybercapabilities. ” The United States has already prioritized cyberwarfare  —   in fact, it was arguably one of the first states to use a cyberweapon, the Stuxnet computer worm, which wiped out many of Iran’s nuclear centrifuges in 2010. The defensive part has proved more challenging in large part because no one  —   not a single country or private company  —   does it particularly well. There is no easy solution, experts say, and attackers have a huge advantage: They often need to find only a single vulnerability in software that contains millions of lines of code. Defenders need to find them all to “immediately protect” networks, as Mr. Trump promised to do on Wednesday. _____ “Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush in cash released by the United States. ” Mr. Trump claimed that the United States had released $150 billion to Iran. He failed to point out that the money came from Iranian assets frozen by the United States and released under the terms of a deal to limit Tehran’s nuclear program. The $150 billion figure he offered is also disputed by experts who say it represents the highest possible estimate for the total value of Iranian assets unfrozen by the United States. The figure is probably closer to $100 billion, many say. Mr. Trump also mentioned “$1. 7 billion in cash ransom payments. ” The payments were made in cash earlier this year to settle an old arbitration case, not pay a ransom. But the Obama administration has acknowledged that it used the money as leverage, holding on to the payments until Iran released American prisoners.",0
4706,Iraqi Army Discovers US-Made Missiles In ISIS’s Military Base In Mosul,"By wmw_admin on November 3, 2016 Reports Afrique — Nov 1, 2016 
Iraqi army and popular forces have discovered a number of US-made missiles from a military position of the ISIS (ISIL, IS, Daesh) in the Southern part of Mosul, informed local sources disclosed after the first group of pro-government troops opened their way into Southern Mosul on Monday. 
“Several US-made missiles were found in al-Shoura region to the South of Mosul,” a local source said on Monday. The Iraqi army and popular forces had found US-made missiles in Anbar province several times before. Provincial officials confirmed that the US-made weapons were sent by the US-led anti-ISIL coalition airplane for the ISIL terrorists in Anbar province. 
Meantime, Iraqi security officials announced that the ISIL has sent US-made military equipment to Tal Afar region in the last two days to stand strong against Iraqi popular forces’ impending attack to capture the region. 
“The ISIL terrorists have sent US-made TOW anti-tank missiles to Tal Afar and it is quite evident that they are preparing for a long-term war,” the Arabic-language media quoted an Iraqi security official as saying on Monday. 
In late August 2015, a senior Iraqi intelligence official revealed that the US helicopters drop weapons and other aids for the ISIL terrorists in the Western province of al-Anbar. 
“The fighters present at the forefront of fighting against the ISIL always see US helicopters flying over the ISIL-controlled areas and dropping weapons and urgent aids for them,” the official who called for anonymity told FNA. 
Yet, he said the helicopters could have also been sent from Turkey or Israel. 
He added that in addition to dropping aids, the helicopters transfer the ISIL ringleaders and wounded members from the battleground to some hospitals in Syria or other countries which support the terrorist group. 
The official cautioned that such assistance further prolongs the conflicts in Anbar, adding that when the Iraqi army and popular forces purge the terrorists from Anbar province, the US helicopters will transfer the ISIL ringleaders to other regions to prevent the Iraqi forces’ access to ISIL secrets. 
Also in March 2015, a group of Iraqi popular forces known as Al-Hashad Al-Shabi shot down the US Army helicopter that was carrying weapons for the ISIL in the Western parts of Al-Baghdadi region in Al-Anbar province. 
Meantime in February 2015, a senior lawmaker disclosed that Iraq’s army had shot down two British planes as they were carrying weapons for the ISIL terrorists in Al-Anbar province. 
“The Iraqi Parliament’s National Security and Defense Committee has access to the photos of both planes that are British and have crashed while they were carrying weapons for the ISIL,” al-Zameli said.",0
4707,"Meg Whitman Likens Donald Trump to Fascists, Shaking G.O.P.’s Brief Truce - The New York Times","A tenuous peace in the upper echelons of the Republican Party showed signs of unraveling this weekend as a major donor compared Donald J. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini, Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney reignited their feud, and one of Mr. Trump’s aides took a shot at an important campaign ally. Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a major contributor to Republican candidates, railed against Mr. Trump on Friday at a   meeting of Republicans in Park City, Utah, comparing him to the Axis leaders, according to several people in attendance who declined to be identified because the discussion was private. The comments, first reported by The Washington Post, came at Mr. Romney’s annual retreat of Republican donors, leaders and business executives. Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and the divisions it is causing among leading Republicans, was an undercurrent of the gathering. Mr. Romney has been outspoken in his refusal to support Mr. Trump, the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, even as other party figures have grudgingly fallen into line. No one has personified the party’s divisions like Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and the pressure on him intensified this weekend. At the Utah retreat on Friday, Campbell Brown, a former CNN anchor, pressed Mr. Ryan on his decision to support Mr. Trump, according to an attendee, saying she did not know how to explain it to her children. Then, on Saturday, Dan Scavino Jr. a senior adviser and the social media director for the Trump campaign, criticized Mr. Ryan on Twitter, linking to an article on a conservative website that accused him of harming his party, complete with the headline “Paul Ryan Is the Reason the G. O. P. Is Losing America. ” The discord appeared to bring a quick end to a period of relative peace in the party that began Tuesday when Mr. Trump issued a statement in which he backed away, slightly, from remarks accusing a federal judge of being biased against him because of the judge’s Mexican heritage. Mr. Trump did not apologize but said his remarks had been “misconstrued. ” Later that night, after the final primaries of the presidential race, he gave a restrained speech in which he refrained from offending anyone. The new approach did not last long. By the end of the week, he had resumed referring to Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has called Mr. Trump a “racist bully,” as “Pocahontas” because of her claims during her Senate bid that she had Native American heritage, which has not been proved. “Somebody said to me, one of the media, ‘Mr. Trump, would you apologize? ’” Mr. Trump said at a rally on Saturday in Tampa, Fla. “I said, ‘Yes, I’ll apologize  —   to Pocahontas, I will apologize!’ Because Pocahontas is insulted. ” Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Romney, calling him “a choker” and saying he “didn’t work like he should have worked” when he was the nominee in 2012. Once Mr. Romney lost, Mr. Trump added, he should have gone “off into the sunset. ” “You don’t sit there jealous and sick to your stomach,” he said. A day earlier, Mr. Romney, in an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, said he feared that Mr. Trump’s election would lead to “  racism” that would “change the character of the generations of Americans that are following. ” Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, gently chided Mr. Romney on Twitter on Friday, writing, “Respect Mitt and differences but couldn’t disagree more. ” Adding that the Supreme Court was “too important to lose for generations,” Mr. Priebus ended his post, “Let’s stop this and unify. ” Mr. Trump and the party have gotten a late start on   for the general election and need as many of the party’s reliable donors as they can attract. At Mr. Romney’s donor retreat on Saturday, Mr. Priebus was more pointed, telling donors opposed to Mr. Trump that the party would “win with or without you,” according to an attendee present for his remarks. A representative for Ms. Whitman did not respond Saturday to a request for an interview about her comments. Ms. Whitman, according to one of the people present, did not stop at comparing Mr. Trump to Hitler and Mussolini. She also warned the gathering that if Republicans compromised on their principles to win an important election, they would be entering fraught territory. “What happens next time?” she asked, implying that it could lead to more compromises and more candidates like Mr. Trump. Ms. Whitman, who ran for governor of California in 2010 and was a finance   for Mr. Romney in 2012, was part of a group of major donors who tried to stop Mr. Trump during the primaries through paid advertising. She has been explicit about her disdain for him. “Look at the comments he’s made about women, about Muslims, about reporters,” she told CNBC in March. “It’s just repugnant. ” The group at the retreat represented a mix of the Republican Party, divided between those who have said they cannot support Mr. Trump, like Mr. Romney, and those who have tepidly endorsed him, like Mr. Ryan, who was Mr. Romney’s running mate in 2012. In an emailed statement, Mr. Trump dismissed Ms. Whitman’s comments. “I never met Meg Whitman, but the job she is doing at Hewlett Packard is not a very good one,” Mr. Trump said. “Based on the disastrous campaign she ran in California, and the tens of millions of dollars she wasted, I have learned a lot from her. I do not want her support. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions about its social media director’s gibe at Mr. Ryan, which at a minimum showed a lack of message discipline inside the campaign. Whether it would endanger Mr. Ryan’s support of Mr. Trump was not clear the speaker’s office did not respond to requests for comment Saturday. He was forced to respond Friday when pressed by Ms. Brown, who now runs an education website and is married to Dan Senor, who was an adviser to Mr. Ryan and to one of Mr. Trump’s primary race rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Turning to Mr. Ryan during a panel discussion, Ms. Brown told him that one morning, one of her sons, expressing disappointment, had asked why he endorsed Mr. Trump. What, she asked Mr. Ryan, was she supposed to tell her child? The attendee present for the exchange said Mr. Ryan appeared slightly uncomfortable but handled the question well. He said Mr. Ryan had explained that while he understood the disagreement among Republicans, he believed that his decision to support Mr. Trump would be better for the Republican Party in the long term. Mr. Trump, he said, had won with large margins in some of his House members’ districts, and many voters liked and supported the candidate. Indeed, Mr. Trump ran away with the Republican nomination with the same flamethrowing approach he is using today. “It’s like what they said about his temper,” said Brett Mohnkern, 29, of Oil City, Pa. who went to Mr. Trump’s rally on Saturday in Pittsburgh. “Tone down for what?” Still, the attendee who saw the exchange with Mr. Ryan on Friday said the party’s debate over whether to support Mr. Trump was like a family’s struggle with a divorce. Mr. Ryan, in one of his appearances at the retreat, tried to infuse what little humor he could into the situation. He joked that he had recently told David Copperfield that he wished the magician could make Mr. Ryan disappear from 2016.",0
4708,Netanyahu Scuttles Trump’s Russian Rapprochement | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: Middle East The game begins. Turkey and Saudi Arabia are unwilling to follow the Trump announced policy on Syria, and are now planning on redoubling their efforts to support ISIS. In order to avoid an obvious confrontation with the US, which has been backing all forces fighting the Assad government including ISIS and other organizations officially deemed “terrorist,” both Turkey and Saudi Arabia have gone to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for help. Netanyahu, through back channels, has told all regional powers, including Iran, that any deal making with the US should go through him. Iran has already been given a price to derail Trump’s promised scrapping of the nuclear settlement. Netanyahu has promised them that there will be no new sanctions so long as Iran outsources key areas of their military modernization through Israel. Israel has traditionally been a conduit for restricted US military technology transfers to “listed” nations. Where it is assumed Trump made a huge error was when he stated he would consider backing Assad and Russia against Israeli backed terrorists. It is unlikely that Assad, who has long experience with Netanyahu breaking his word, cut the same deal with Netanyahu that Iran has. With a permanent Russian military presence in Syria and Assad rebuilding his nation after the defeat of ISIS, efforts will certainly return to removing Israel from the illegal occupation of the Golan Heights. You see, the deal cut to allow Israel to take the rest of the West Bank, unrestricted bulldozing of Palestinian homes and unrestricted ethnic cleansing across the rest of defacto Israel (including Judea and Samaria, designated by the UN as Palestinian homeland and making up 40% of pre-1967 Israel) is supported by everyone. The Saudi’s and Qatar are cutting down aid to the Palestinians, Jordan has long viewed them as the primary threat to their security, far more than Israel. (Jordan is an Israeli puppet) Where there has been significant change is how Assad now looks on the Palestinians who quickly joined ISIS, extending their payoffs to fund mercenary operations using Hamas against the Assad government. All of this is made possible by Israel’s free transit of Hamas fighters into Syria and into Jordan to CIA training centers. Netanyahu will now be able to use his newfound relationship with Iran, due to its clandestine nature, to manipulate financial markets at will, ramping up tensions for domestic consumption, and playing Donald Trump like a cheap fiddle. The real question is how Russia will deal with this over the long term. Despite the big talk from Trump, for America to ramp up ground forces inside Syria, while assisting Turkey in moves against the Damascus government, will not pass the “sniff test” in Moscow. Turkey is actively threatening the territorial integrity of both Iraq and Syria and Turkish moves into both nations is directly aimed at securing oil and gas reserves. With Russia and Iran blocking Turkey from seizing the massive gas fields near Aleppo, these are virgin finds, far larger than the offshore reserves Israel is currently accessing, Turkey will drive against the Euphrates oil reserves west of Raqqa and even as far south as Deir Ezzor, another oil rich region of Syria. In Iraq, Turkey is working closely with the Erbil government to seize the Kirkuk oil fields, some of the largest in the world. Peshmerga forces have been ethnically cleansing this area, which is nowhere near Mosul, as key to their efforts in support of the war on ISIS and the taking of Mosul, or so they claim. Despite initial announcements of Erbil backed Kurds, really surrogates of Turkey, advancing on Mosul, these forces have, in fact, turned East and are now driving into Iraqi Sunni areas, ethnically cleansing the Arab populations. What is revealed by this is the long hidden relationship between the Kurds in Erbil and ISIS and how both have been controlled by Erdogan. When Russia showed the world satellite photos of 12,000 oil trucks entering Turkey from Iraq, what was not told is that those trucks, for the last 200 miles of their journey were guarded by Peshmerga forces. Most ISIS oil stolen from Iraq was taken from Kurdish controlled regions, not by ISIS at all, marketed to the world out of the Kurdish capitol of Erbil and trucked to pipeline depots in Turkey through Kurdish, ISIS and even Turkish controlled regions of Iraq. ISIS in fact got very little of the oil revenue but in fact only facilitated transit of stolen oil by the Erbil Kurds and their Turkish partners including, according to reports, the son of Erdogan. The real question here is what will Russia allow? Will it allow Turkey and Saudi Arabia to dismember Syria? Will it remain silent on Turkish efforts to support ISIS while running military operations against them at the same time, or so the world is being told though no one has actually seen any of it. Sources in Damascus have long claimed that the ISIS occupation of areas of Northern Syria currently allegedly under Turkish assault were always controlled by Turkey. Will Putin allow Netanyahu to play his game, which includes betrayal of Russia? How far will Netanyahu get before Russia asserts herself militarily? What Netanyahu is also saying is that he has influence, even control, over the Kiev government. We don’t know if Netanyahu has promised to have Trump recognize Russia’s control of Crimea. This would give considerable leverage over Russia, perhaps enough to endanger Russian support of Syria, which Netanyahu must see as a threat. It will be necessary to watch events in the region. If Trump fails to confront both Turkey and Saudi Arabia over their support of ISIS against the Damascus government, this will represent a massive foreign policy defeat early in his administration. Note that Trump was elected under a cloud, with a significant electoral vote against him and a “win” based on statistical anomalies that are unprecedented, suggesting something that may well bring down his government at some time in the future.

Buchanan noted the biggest cheerleaders of Trump’s action were Sens. John McCain ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Marco Rubio ( ) which he deemed to be “the war party. ” However, argued that they would not “get the war they want” from Trump. “It’s McCain and Graham and Marco Rubio  —   the war party,” Buchanan said. “But let me say this, Laura  —   my view is they’re not going to get the war they want. If Donald Trump the president takes us into Syria’s civil war and he’s already made the first strike  —   it will consume his presidency.

4713,Videos Show Murder Suspect Shooting at Texas Border Town Cops,"Dramatic videos shot by bystanders to Friday’s gunbattle between Laredo, Texas, police officers and a wanted murder suspect show the gunman firing on police. The gunman shot three officers and injured another before responding officers shot and killed him. [One video by an unidentified cell phone videographer appears to be taken from a restaurant next door to the Stripes convenience store where the shooting took place. Antonio Gerado Rodriguez, 55, the man identified by police as a suspect in the murder of his girlfriend Friday morning can be seen shooting from behind his pickup truck. The video, posted by Facebook user Mike Taylor has been seen more than 300, 000 times on various Facebook posts as of this article’s posting. The videographer is was not identified in the post.  Rodriguez can be seen taking multiple shots at officers in different locations. A cloud of debris appears near his head as a bullet from police strikes his vehicle next to his head. At one point, he points his gun towards the bystanders in the restaurant and the witnesses duck for cover. The videographer quickly resumes the video coverage. A customer of the Stripes store can be seen running into the store for cover. Rodrigues shoots from multiple positions of cover as he moved around the front of his truck attempting to shoot police. In total, Laredo police say Rodrigues shot three officers during the gun battle. A fourth officer received a minor injury from flying debris during the gun battle. A second video, posted by Facebook user Chavez Santiago, shows the gun battle from a different angle across the street from the Stripes store. Rodriguez can be seen walking calmly up to what appears to be a wounded Laredo police officer. It appears he reaches down to take something from the person on the ground. The victim can be seen moving around in apparent pain.  As more officers arrive on the scene, Rodriguez again opens fire. He fires multiple rounds at the backup officers. “He’s not backing down!” a woman in the car can be heard saying. “The police are dead, no?” she asks. Rodriguez continues to fire as the woman tells the driver of her car to leave before they get shot. A third video posted by Ab Matias on Facebook shows the conclusion of the gun battle from down the street. More officers can be seen responding and engaging Rodriguez with gunfire. After a couple of minutes in this video, it appears Rodriguez is finally taken out and officers swarm the suspect.  Police had been searching for Rodriguez in connection to the shooting death of his girlfriend, according to a report by KSAT ABC12 in San Antonio. Police reports identified the murder victim as Reyna Gonzalez Zamora, 50. Laredo Police Department Investigator Joe Baeza told Breitbart Texas the suspect was spotted by three officers involved in the search. Rodriguez opened fire on the officers with a hundgun. The officers returned fire. Additional responding officers engaged the suspect and continued shooting until the suspect went down. Baeza confirmed three officers were shot and a fourth officer received an injury from flying glass during the shooting. An unnamed source within the department with knowledge of the situation told Breitbart Texas that one officer had been shot in the face. That officer has been airlifted by helicopter to San Antonio where the officer will undergo surgery.

4714,Legislature Reaches Deal to Extend Mayoral Control of New York’s Schools for a Year - The New York Times,"ALBANY  —   State lawmakers on Friday reached a   deal to conclude the 2016 legislative session that included a modest ethics package, state funding for supportive housing for the homeless, and a   extension  —   with major caveats  —   of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s control of New York City schools. Consensus on the ethics reform seemed to come quickly on Friday, the day after the last official day of the legislative session. The deal would, among other things, strip state pensions from public officials convicted of corruption and strengthen prohibitions on political campaigns’ ability to coordinate with independent expenditure committees. But a similar consensus kept lurching out of reach on the issue that mattered most to Mr. de Blasio: mayoral control. In the end, he ceded significant concessions to his Albany antagonists in exchange for an extension of a single year, down from the three years he had hoped for. Bowing to demands from the State Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Republican who is not disposed to be helpful to a mayor who has openly worked to flip control of the chamber to the Democrats, the mayor and his allies in the   Assembly agreed to disclose more information about city school districts’ spending and to accept a change to the oversight structure for more than half the city’s charter schools. A   extension, with few or no caveats, had seemed all but cemented when lawmakers went to bed on Thursday evening. But the morning found Mr. Flanagan pushing for the funding transparency requirement, followed by the   provision in the afternoon. It would effectively create a parallel system of charter schools within the city, allowing “  charter schools in good standing” to switch to join the State University of New York umbrella or the Board of Regents of the State Education Department. City Hall gritted its teeth. “This extension is a recognition of the unprecedented progress and achievements mayoral control has delivered for our school system,” Austin Finan, a spokesman for the mayor’s office, said in a statement. For people outside city education circles, however, there was plenty of meat in the agreement that Mr. Flanagan Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat and the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat, announced on Friday evening. Lawmakers also agreed to require school districts to test for lead in drinking water, with the state paying for some of the testing costs. The adoption of the lead testing bill was a victory for Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Queens Democrat, who heads the Education Committee and who had been criticized for blocking a previous bill that she considered too broad. Under the new bill, schools would be required to periodically test for lead  —   though some already do  —   and notify parents in the event the dangerous element is discovered. The state will also provide an additional $50 million in capital funding for SUNY and the City University of New York. But the governor’s announcement that the state would release $570 million in state resources to build and operate 1, 200 units of supportive housing for the homeless was immediately dissected and dismissed by advocates for the program, who said it fell far short of Mr. Cuomo’s initial commitment to pay for 20, 000 units. “Tonight’s plan would appear to be a betrayal of the most vulnerable New Yorkers and the latest broken promise from a governor who makes sweeping announcements that lead to paltry results,” the Campaign 4   Housing, a supportive housing group, said in a statement. Mr. Cuomo and the legislative leaders had already agreed to funding for 6, 000 units over five years as part of the state budget passed in March, but another deal was required to release the first infusion of money for spending. The $570 million figure included only $150 million of new state funding, said Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, the chairman of the Assembly’s Social Services Committee, with the rest coming from existing capital funds and tax credits. “In January, it was 20, 000 units,” he said. “In April, it was 6, 000 units. Now it’s 1, 200 units and it’s only $150 million in new money. All the rest is smoke and mirrors. ” Early Saturday morning, the lawmakers were in the process of passing the new legislation. At about 2:15 a. m. the Legislature finished its last remaining substantive task: the Senate passed a bill to legalize daily fantasy sports, which had been considered illegal gambling in New York. The Assembly had approved the measure on Friday afternoon. Other   bills won both houses’ backing on Friday. The Legislature passed a bill that aims to ensure equal access to legal representation for the poor by reimbursing counties for indigent legal services, drawing praise from the New York Civil Liberties Union. The hotel industry in New York City cheered the passage of legislation that would keep people from advertising stays shorter than 30 days in unoccupied homes, a measure that the bill’s supporters said would restrict commercial operators of illegal hotels, but that Airbnb  —   the company that prompted the bill  —   said would affect regular city residents. It is already illegal in New York to rent out an empty apartment for less than 30 days at a time. The Legislature also passed bills that would increase penalties for using software known as ticket bots to scoop up large numbers of tickets to concerts, games or other events, a practice that the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, highlighted in a recent report. Doing so is already illegal, but the bill would make it a misdemeanor. The agreement on Friday, which came after a flurry of deals at the March budget deadline, including an increase in the minimum wage and the establishment of a paid family leave program, did not please corporate leaders like Heather Briccetti, the president of the Business Council of New York State, who called it devoid of any “major   or cost reduction measures. ” Nor did it mollify government watchdogs and other advocates of ethics reforms who had high hopes that the convictions last year of Sheldon Silver, the former Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, the former Senate majority leader, would finally shame the Legislature into acting to prevent corruption. But of all the measures on ethics that lawmakers did discuss this session, pension forfeiture, a straightforward and broadly popular measure, was the only prominent one to survive. Mr. Cuomo had proposed but failed to win support for more ambitious proposals that included eight different bills for closing a   loophole that allows limited liability companies to donate to political candidates up to the limit for individual contributors, rather than for businesses. In order for pension forfeiture to become a constitutional amendment, two consecutively elected legislatures must approve it before voters consider the measure on the ballot. The announcement about the ethics agreement highlighted what were called strong protections against the independent expenditure committees empowered by the Citizens United ruling, the Supreme Court’s 2010 campaign finance decision. The governor had made a push to tighten restrictions on such committees over the past few weeks. The ethics package will also require political consultants who simultaneously advise elected officials or candidates and work with companies that have business before the state to register with the state and disclose their clients. It strengthens disclosure requirements for lobbyists and for   nonprofits that lobby the state to disclose financial support from other nonprofits that are not supposed to engage in political activity. Blair Horner, the executive director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said the deal was a “smorgasbord of elections, ethics and lobbying reforms” that nonetheless was “not focused at the heart of what’s wrong with Albany,” including the nearly unchecked flow of money through multiple limited liability companies. That said, Mr. Horner said the move to define coordination between independent expenditure committees and candidates was an improvement. “No one has defined what that means,” he said. “And this does. ” The greatest source of friction on Friday appeared to be the mayoral control issue. There was concern within City Hall that the charter school provision would significantly change how such schools in the city run. Charter schools can be authorized by three agencies  —   the State Education Department, the city’s Education Department and SUNY  —   but all operate according to the same state law. Although the announcement of the agreement did not offer details, the Senate’s proposal would exempt SUNY schools from the usual state standards and free to set their own rules, two officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations said. There are 111 charters authorized by SUNY in the city. Another 55 are authorized by the city’s Education Department, and 39 by the state department.",0
4715,"Harvard Law, Moving to Diversify Applicant Pool, Will Accept GRE Scores - The New York Times","Harvard Law School, moving to open its doors to a larger, more diverse pool of applicants, said on Wednesday that it would accept the graduate record examination, known as the GRE, for the admission of students entering its fall 2018 class. The law school, whose alumni include senators, chief executives, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and President Barack Obama, is the second accredited law school in the United States to accept the GRE for admission. It follows the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law, which made the change a year ago. At the time,  Arizona’s decision provoked a heated debate in the legal profession, which has long supported the Law School Admissions Test, or LSAT, over whether that test should be relied on as a single valid predictor of law school success. Since Arizona’s move, around 150 law school deans, including Martha Minow of Harvard Law, have expressed support for the change. Now Harvard Law is taking the same step. The school said it would start a pilot program in the fall, when students begin submitting applications for the   juris doctor program that begins in 2018. The change “will encourage more students in the United States and internationally from a greater degree of disciplines to apply,” said Jessica Soban, assistant dean and chief admissions officer. Applicants who want to can still submit LSAT scores. The GRE test is offered many times each year and in numerous locations around the world, Ms. Soban said in an interview. In addition, she said, “many prospective law school applicants take the GRE as they consider graduate school options. ” The decision to make the change came after a recently completed Harvard Law study that examined GRE scores of current and former students who had taken both the GRE and the LSAT. The study concluded that “the GRE is an equally valid predictor of   grades,” Ms. Soban said. It remains to be seen whether other schools follow Harvard. The law school, which admits about 560 students to each   class, has seen its applications increase in recent years, unlike many other law schools in the United States. A survey of 125 law schools last year by Kaplan Test Prep found that 56 percent had no plans to allow applicants to submit GRE scores instead of LSAT scores. Only 14 percent said they planned to amend their policies, but more than half also said they did not want the American Bar Association to explicitly require that law schools accept only LSAT scores. The bar association’s accrediting body will soon consider changes to the rules governing law school admissions. Barry Currier, managing director of the group’s section on legal education and admissions to the bar, said on Wednesday that “at this point we will defer for now any comment on any individual law school’s proposal or pilot program on testing of prospective students. ” When Arizona’s law school chose to accept GRE scores, it risked being expelled from the Law School Admission Council, which oversees LSAT administration and the common application process used by thousands of law school students. But after law school deans rallied around Arizona, the council backed off on quashing such experimentation. This year, the council’s spokeswoman, Wendy Margolis said, “schools have that right under the current A. B.
