2649,Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure,"Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close   Wakame Seaweed Salad May Lower Blood Pressure 
  
I used to think of seaweed as just a beneficial whole food source of minerals—like iodine, for which it is the most concentrated dietary source. And, indeed, just a half-teaspoon of mild seaweeds, like arame or dulse, or two sheets of nori a day, should net you all the iodine you need for the day. 
But, “the intake of seaweeds is advised” not only as a whole food source of iodine, but also, evidently, “for the prevention of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.” Based on what? 
Well, you’ll see this kind of reasoning; the Japanese live long, and they eat seaweed. And so, they speculate that seaweed might have something to do with it, based on suggestive reports. But, when you see lists, like this, of all the supposed biological activities some food has, you want to know is this based on clinical data (meaning on actual people) or so-called preclinical data (based on test tubes and lab animals)? When a study like this is published, talking about the “Effects of seaweed-reconstructed pork diets” on rats, what do you do with that information? Seaweed is one of the ingredients they’re trying to use to improve the “image” of meat products. So, they try to add grape seeds, or flax seeds, or walnuts, or purple rice or, whatever this is. I had to look it up: thong-weed. How’s that for an image booster? 
You can look at epidemiological studies (meaning looking at populations). And, indeed, Japanese preschoolers who eat seaweed tend to have lower blood pressures, suggesting seaweed might have beneficial effects—which would make sense, given all the minerals and fiber. But, you can’t prove cause and effect with that kind of study. Maybe it was the other components of the diet that went along with the seaweed-eating. 
It’s even harder to do these kinds of studies on adults; so many people are on high blood pressure medications. University of Tokyo researchers took an innovative approach by comparing the diets of people on low-dose, versus high-dose, versus multiple blood pressure medications. And, although they all had artificially normalized blood pressure, those that ate the most fruit and sea vegetables tended to be the ones on the lower doses—supporting a dietary role for seaweed. But, why not just put it to the test? 
A double-blind crossover trial found that seaweed fiber lowered blood pressure, apparently by pulling sodium out of the system. I know they couldn’t use real seaweed, because then you couldn’t fool people with a placebo; but, why not just, like, put whole powdered seaweed in pills? This was finally attempted, ten years later. 
Compared to doing nothing, they got beautiful drops in blood pressure. But, if you look deeper into the study, they desalinized the seaweed—meaning they took out two-thirds of the sodium naturally found in it. So, that still doesn’t tell us if eating seaweed salad is actually going to help with blood pressure. What we need is a randomized controlled trial with just plain, straight seaweed. But, no one had ever done that study—until this study out of Ecuador. 
Six grams of wakame, natural sodium and all, led to a significant drop in blood pressure, especially in those who started out high. Side effects were all minor, and what one might expect increasing fiber intake. And, the nice thing about whole food, plant-based interventions is you sometimes get good side effects as well, such as the resolution of gastritis—stomach inflammation that they’d been having—as well as the disappearance of chronic headaches.

I’ve read that only asians, for the most part, have the bacteria (macrobiome) to properly digest seaweed. And by properly digest I mean….”to properly breakdown the seaweed to allow usability of the nutrients and such in seaweed.” 
Some sort of genetic trait asians have? Evolutionary? 
Truth in this? Joe Caner 
It would seem that gut flora has more to do with what one eats as opposed to genetic factors. Asian populations are better able to handle seaweed in their diets precisely because they eat more seaweed so their gut flora adapts accordingly: 
“Recent studies analyzed the gut flora of people across multiple countries and continents and identified two enterotypes. Enterotypes correlate with our diet and can change as our diet changes. Diets rich in animal protein and saturated fat are associated with the Bacteriodes enterotype, while diets rich in healthy carbohydrates are associated with the Prevotella enterotype.” http://nutritionfacts.org/topics/microbiome/ Roxy 
So did the Okinawans have both of these types of enterotypes? How about some of the other cultures (longest lived) that include animal products/fish in their diet? Do they also have a healthy, varied enter type that of both baceriodes and prevotella? Roxy 
And, apparently, the seaweed/gut bacteria macrobiome evolved over thousands and thousands of years, unlike, I think, the enteretype issue you are referencing that has more to do with our gut bacteria changing quickly, daily, weekly, due to the diet. Apparently seaweed might be a different issue, and for whatever reason takes a culture thousands of years to adjust. Richard W 
Perhaps it is beneficial but, like fish oil, seaweed probably comes with a dose of pollutants too. Roxy 
I am curious about all the plastic-residue showing up in fish….and if seaweed would then accumulate these plastics-chemical residues. Ishay 
Unfortunately, most natural food will contain at least trace levels of pollutants, even those grown organically in ‘natural’ soil. It doesn’t mean, however, that this is always a palpable cause for concern. Theoretically, even though all seas and oceans are polluted to a degree, sea vegetables are low in the food chain, so there is less bio-accumulation of most contaminants. 
The biggest concern in seaweed is inorganic arsenic. Hijiki is known to have high, potentially harmful levels, but moderate consumption of most other sea vegetables, including wakame, shouldn’t pose a significant risk: 
I don’t know if seaweed that’s grown in indoor tanks is commercially available (similar to microalgae used for DHA/EPA pills), but that might become a safer alternative one day. Wade Patton 
I shared the transcript. nonyabizzz 
ok, but the seaweed salad shown obviously has a sizable amount of oil on it, possibly counteracting some of the health benefits… 
The frame rate seems off in this video? rjs 
  small study that hasn’t been replicated (with seaweed that hasn’t been desalinized). Given the high sodium content of commercially available seaweed, I still feel reluctant to try it. 
I’m already doing as many lifestyle things as I can to lower my BP such as eating a whole plant vegan diet, restricting sodium, drinking hibiscus tea, consuming fax seeds daily, avoiding BPA, doing daily aerobic exercise, and exercising with hand grips. Anyone have any other ideas? Matthew Smith 
Hello! You are doing everything exactly right. Dr. Greger suggests “beans, whole grains, other legumes, beets, beet juice, cocoa, flaxseeds, greens, hibiscus tea, purple potatoes, and the seaweed, wakame,” in his hypertension page. Have you tried Vitamin D and Magnesium (watch out for diarrhea)? How long have you been on a low sodium diet? Since they add Iodine to salt, I have avoided it, and I developed in my opinion low Iodine levels. I had just one half teaspoon of salt and could no longer feel my heartbeat in my chest. I have since fallen in love with some salt. It takes at least a gram of salt a day to be healthy. I love Iodine. Dr. Greger recommends it. Beware of its heart benefits. Doctors say it is ideal to not be able to feel your heartbeat. Perhaps it is Iodine that modulates this. Darryl

2650,Clinton's Policies Look Like a Death Sentence for Americans,"22 Shares
8 13 0 1
As Donald Trump gains more bad press, Hilary Clinton rides the political wave with quick responses, deflections and denials. Without question, and largely due to Trump's obnoxious candor and grandiose proclamations, she is working her way back into the favor of disgruntled democrats and even right wing firebrands like the notorious Glenn Beck. She is, without question, a wolf in sheep's clothing. While Trump is unbelievably hard to take, constantly, we need to focus on one simple question, which of these candidates will lead to world devastation first?
I suspect it would be Hillary Clinton who would be most inclined toward involving Americans in another military conflict, and she doesn't go small, as she constantly demonizes Russia with threats of military action. In Clinton's own words, ""You've seen reports, Russia has hacked into a lot of things, China has hacked into a lot of things, Russia even hacked into the Democratic National Committee, maybe even some state election systems. So we've got to step up our game, make sure we are well defended and can take the fight to those who go after us. As President, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.""
Military responses to a nation the US stood on the verge of war with for more than four decades? Military response against Russia? Over suspected hacking? Hillary Clinton betrayed her real mindset once and for all during the recent debate with Donald Trump when she spoke those words of war that would surely lead to only disastrous consequences.
It all stems from the Wikileaks release that included 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from leaders at the Democratic National Committee. Clinton says the Russians did it, the national mainstream media parroted those words. It's the American media's political conditioning system at its finest, convincingly reaching tens of millions of Americans, and yet nobody knows if the blame is properly attributed to the Russians. In a USA Today article from July 2016, Elizabith Weise wrote, ""Computer security researchers say it’s difficult to definitively say the cyber theft of files from the Democratic National Committee subsequently posted online by Wikileaks was the work of Russian hackers, as some media outlets have reported.""
Russia's leader, Vladmir Putin, says the US long ago tipped the scales in the wrong direction, well before the Cold War even ended. Peace with Russia should be a top priority for any US Presidential candidate. The truth is that American politicians, perpetually convinced they are making the right political moves, created a road block on the highway to peace during the Vietnam War. Putin said during the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2016, ""It is not in my nature to scold someone -- but when the United States unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty (in) 1972 they delivered a colossal blow to the entire system of international security. That was the first blow when it comes to assessing the strategic balance of power in the world"".
MORE... 10 Things to Expect with a Hillary Clinton Presidency Hillary Clinton must be indicted How Hillary Clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital Voting for the “Lesser Evil” Now we have Clinton warmongering over unfounded allegations.
World Rivals in the Air
There is a decades-old history of rivalry between eastern and western jet fighter design and technology. While American designs are more expensive and generally considered to be better, the fastest jet fighter ever made is the Russian MiG-25; it can break Mach III, more than three times the speed of sound. Such demands lessen the life of an aircraft. The MiG-25 is typically not flown at anything close to that speed. As an interceptor however, it was supreme, no allied fighter in the sky could outrun it.
The Korean War was the first test. Soviet MiG-15's initially dominated the skies. With Russian and Chinese pilots often at the controls, the MiG's were deadly.
On 1 November 1950, at least sixteen American F-51 fighters (P-51 Mustangs) were shot at by six Soviet MiG-15 interceptors led by Soviet WWII ace Mayor Nikolay V. Stroykov. The WWII ""prop"" planes like the Mustang, along with the U.S. F-80 Shooting Star and F-84 Thunderjet jet fighters, had a job on their hands fighting the robust and highly maneuverable MiG fighters.
Everything changed when the U.S. Air Force launched the F-86 Sabre. Wikipedia explains that the F-86 Sabre pilots enjoyed advantages they learned to exploit to the fullest. Foremost among those was a radar ranging gun sight on their six .50 caliber machine guns, which ensured that even short bursts of fire generally found their target. F-86 pilots were also equipped with G-suits, which prevented pilot blackout in high-speed turning maneuvers.
It is unlikely that anybody will ever fully agree on the casualties and ""kill"" ratios over ""MiG Alley"" during the Korean War.
The Soviets claimed 1,106 United Nations planes of all types shot down, including about 650 Sabres. (The USAF only admits to losing less than 200 aircraft in air combat.)
The F-86 pilots claimed 792 MiG-15s shot down, while B-29 gunners claimed a further 16. These numbers were later reduced to 379 MiGs. The Chinese air force claimed only 85 kills.
In Vietnam, the competitors varied. The MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters were widely used by the North Vietnamese Air Force. They fought planes like the F-100 Super Sabre, F-5 Tiger and the F-4 Phantom. Once again, if you believe western sources which are fairly reliable for the most part, the U.S. planes dominated in most air to air combat, though the other side had plenty of talented pilots and more aces overall than the Americans. During the end of the Cold War in the 1980's, the Soviet MiG-29 was the terror of the skies. There was more speculation about it than real knowledge at first. While MiG aircraft were only built in odd numbers, the movie Top Gun references the aircraft by calling them MiG-28's - ""MiG-28's, no one's been this close before!"" The planes used in the movie were actually American F-5 Tigers painted black with red stars applied to the tails. Today the United States spends obscene amounts on planes like the F-22 Raptor and these aircraft do not have any clear advantages over modern Russian planes like the SU-30. Both in this case, are capable of ""thrust vectoring"" which means the pilot can change the direction of the jet blast and create an entirely separate way to control the jet in flight. The ultimate western jet in the world of thrust vectoring is the AV8/b Harrier which can actually take off and land like a helicopter. Hopefully the world will not have to put these machines against each other in a future war, but with Clinton at the helm it is entirely possible and the advantages the US used to hold over the Russian military have evaporated into thin air.
Russia's Modern Approach to Warfare
During the decades-long Cold War, the Soviet Union operated under archaic rules that essentially prevented a commander, or a pilot, from knowing their mission until they were dispatched to carry out the order. Kemp Freund, a US Army sergeant major that I met while I was covering the war in Afghanistan, was Quote: d in my 2007 video report ""Camp Joyce: Remote Fire Base Near Afghanistan-Pakistan Border"" saying, ""We're trying to break the old Soviet methods that they use and the Soviet method had that Lt. Col. completely in the dark until he needed to move.” He added, “We're still working with the higher echelons to get that to move downhill."" The Soviet ways were detrimental and offered little freedom to a trained soldier or pilot but all that is over now. Today's Russian pilots not only fly superior aircraft that cost far less than US taxpayer funded military planes, they also utilize tactics of Western pilots. Hillary Clinton surely knows these facts but she wants to play with fire and be another ""war president"" which was so important to former President George W. Bush, and Obama too for that matter.
Other Looming Conflicts
Lest we forget, Hillary Clinton's unwavering support of Israel, the apartheid religious nuclear state that has long been protected by US taxpayer money and military hardware. The government of right wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to violate the human rights of Palestinians constantly, while building settlements which are completely illegal under international law. Then there are the attacks in Gaza that target schools and hospitals, leaving hundreds and hundreds dead and thousands severely injured. Never does Clinton speak out against the barbaric treatment Israel reserves for non-Jews, never does she refer to the fact that the country we now call Iran hasn't attacked a nation outside of its borders for more than three hundred years. Yet Iran has been savagely attacked by the United States both directly and indirectly. Maintaining her warmongering spirit, Clinton said, ""I want the Iranians to know that if I'm president we will attack Iran."" She added that, ""We would be able to totally obliterate them.""",0

RT spoke on the sidelines of the event with Yasar Yakis, former Foreign Minister of Turkey, for his opinion on a wide range of issues, including Russian sanctions and the ongoing Syrian conflict, which has driven a wedge between Russia and the US-led coalition. 
Later in this section, RT also talks with Wolfgang Schussel, former Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria (2000-2007). Russia not to blame for Ukraine crisis and sanctions won't work (Op-Edge by John #Mearsheimer ) https://t.co/BlykHOfU4o #UChicago #Valdai — RT (@RT_com) 26 октября 2016 г. 
RT: The Turkish–Russian relationship has had a lot of ups and downs over the last year or so. How do you see a future of the relationship particularly now with the regards to solving the Syria conflict, and now that the relationship appears to be at a better level than it was last year? 
Yasar Yakis: I knew that the Syrian crisis may help the Turkish–Russian relations to improve, because there are areas of cooperation. So far, Turkey and Russia agreed to cooperate on several specific questions. Both during the visit of President Recep Erdogan to St. Petersburg, and also during the recent visit of President Putin to Istanbul. 
Also at a later stage they talked on telephone to each other – I think it was exchange of concessions, if we may say so. Turkey was asked by Russia whether Turkey could mediate in order to persuade some of the opposition factions in Turkey to withdraw from Eastern Aleppo. If Turkey could do it, it would be a good service to Russia. And in exchange for it, I guess at least, Russia agreed to show understanding to the measures that Turkey is taking in the north of Syria in order to prevent the Kurdish factions to link the two Kurdish cantons. This is a new area of cooperation. 
The third area of cooperation is more specific, in my opinion. Now with the Kurdish question in the North of Syria, becoming more important than whether Bashar Assad should remain [in power] or not, because Turkey’s position at the beginning was that first priority has to be given to Assad to step aside, whereas now the Kurdish question has become more important, and which also requires that territorial integrity of Syria has to be preserved. If the Kurds declare their independence or autonomy, then the Syrian territorial integrity will be jeopardized. 
So Turkey is moving from: ‘Bashar Assad is going first’ to 'preservation of the territorial integrity of Syria' is a big step. At this point, Turkey’s national interest and the Syrian national interest are overlapping, they are coinciding. And Russia is also in favor of the preservation of the territorial integrity of Syria. These three countries can cooperate. Turkey has now a national interest in cooperating with Assad (…) 
RT: There has been some discussion in the West about new sanctions being put on Russia, in particularity because of Aleppo. They have been rejected for the time being. Do you view sanctions as an effective measure of achieving foreign policy goals, or should dialogue always come first? 
YY: Armed conflict is the worst thing. When armed could be avoided, the confrontation could be avoided by sanctions, it may be preferable; but no sanctions at all is the best. For the Aleppo question, the truth is not yet cleared out – who was wrong and why the ceasefire has collapsed etc. We do not know. We’re still waiting for a neutral body to find out what exactly happened in Aleppo and how the ceasefire collapsed. Before ignoring all these details, I don’t think that we should talk about the sanctions. And if possible the international community should not resort to sanctions, because it makes the tension in the international relations more acute. Tool to 'preserve the peace': #Valdai Club hosts intl speakers as tensions peak between Russia & West https://t.co/1pLwoD8HQZ — RT (@RT_com) 25 октября 2016 г. 
RT next spoke with Wolfgang Schussel, former Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria (2000-2007).RT: A new round of sanctions against Russia was rejected for the time being. However, the old ones remain in place. How do you see the future of those relations between Russia and the EU? Do you expect the sanctions to be lifted anytime soon? 
Wolfgang Schussel: I think the most important element was last week’s summit in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel, President [Vladimir] Putin, President [Petro] Poroshenko, and President [Francois] Hollande to find solutions or a road map for Ukraine to extend the ceasefire in Syria, and to recreate a kind of a feeling that a military solution is not possible neither in Ukraine, nor in Syria, or Iraq. What is needed are trust-building measures; a road map to bring about those units who are fighting against each other; to extend the ceasefire; to create an element where the relevant global and regional partners are sitting at the same table and finding a solution. This is the most important thing. The sanctions are always symbols. The symbol will remain. I am sure there is no short-term solution for that, because the problems as such are not disappearing. What is needed today is a return to the good old, as we say it in German, ‘Realpolitik.’ The soft power, economic development, the economic assistance, and diplomacy. This is the most important thing. 
RT: You mentioned the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. There are currently two operations going on: in Mosul – carried out by the Western-led coalition, and in Aleppo – by the Damascus government and Russia. While the first one is being praised in the western media, saying that any civilians killed in Mosul is just 'collateral damage,' whereas in Aleppo, Russia is being accused of actual war crimes repeatedly by Washington and some others. Why do you think there are such two different narratives here going with these two operations? 
WS: The main difference in Mosul – everybody is fighting and united against ISIS. This is quite clear. This is the common enemy, because what ISIS did in the last three years was terrible. They expelled, tortured, and killed civilians, mostly all the Christians had to leave the country, a country where they lived for centuries. The oldest part of identity and the Christian communities were living in these parts. And all of these parts are destroyed by ISIS. I hope, and I am not an expert what is really going on in Mosul there will be as few as possible civil causalities. 
In Aleppo, there are also radical parts, that is for sure, but also some other factors (...) I don’t deny the attempt of Russians to support President [Bashar] Assad – you can agree with that, or you can disagree. I think a military solution will not be possible in Syria. This is the difference with ISIS. In my opinion it is not helpful always to ask for regime change, but what is needed is to find a political solution to avoid civilian casualties. This is de facto today a very negative scenario. 
RT: In around two weeks we’ll found out the result of the US presidential election. Regardless of which candidate ends up in the White House, how do you see relations between the triangle of Russia, the US, and the EU evolving? And how do you feel cooperation over the key issues, such as the Minsk agreements and Syria will change after November 8? 
WS: First of all, I have seen a lot of very emotional election campaigns in American recent history – this is not the only one and not an outstanding one – this is a fight. This is a very personal fight, a very emotional fight. Whoever wins, foreign policy is more or less stringent and a continuous effort [for] all the major players: in America, in Russia, in Europe, in China. Everybody knows the problems, everybody knows the restrictions, the limits of power; nobody can act alone. I think what happens is the return to normal policy, to Realpolitik where the global players: America, Russia, China and Europe are sitting together, inviting also the regional partners to find cooperative ways, to find cooperation instead of confrontation. That is the only way. I think after the November elections, the Americans will return to normal business.

2653,Guy Fawkes effigy industry collapses,"November 6, 2016 
Just days away from what was traditionally its busiest day of the year, the Guy Fawkes effigy industry has finally collapsed after years of steady decline. All remaining effigy production stations on street corners have closed with immediate effect, with hundreds of 10 year-old street urchins laid off. 
Despite attempts at buy-outs by foreign effigy firms, it is thought the collapse was due to an unrealistic pricing structure, which completely failed to take account of inflation. 
Economist James Hampton told us: “I’ve looked through the figures and I have to agree that the fault clearly lies at the pricing level. Frankly, a ‘penny for the Guy’ barely covers the raw materials of the effigy. By the time you’ve factored in the wooden trolley, you’re actually making a loss.” 
“The tragic thing is that there is still a market need for life-size cloth dolls of Catholic terrorists from the 16th Century. However, taking account of production and marketing costs, a more realistic proposition would have been about £12.30 for the Guy, or in euros, €12.30.” 
The collapse comes at a time when foreign effigy manufactures have been taking increasing orders for effigies of presidents, prime ministers, book authors and cartoonists, while Apple has recently launched the iGuy, and self-combusting re-usable electronic effigy which can be connected to the iCloud to mutter heresy as it is consumed by the flames. 
The effigy workforce are today looking for work in industries with similar skill sets, such as working in Build-a-Bear Workshops, sewing together giant bean bags and producing dummies used for bayonet practice. Meanwhile, thousands of unbought Guy Fawkes’ now make up an ‘effigy mountain’ in the midlands, and are likely to remain there until someone can think of a way of destroying them. Share this story...

2654,Comment on Seattle council member proposes a MASSIVE fee hike for pot shops by Steven Broiles,"Posted on November 4, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment 
Seattle proggies love to push businesses out of their city. 
From MyNorthwest.com : Seattle City Councilmember Tim Burgess proposed a 241 percent business license fee hike for pot shops, citing inspection and enforcement costs associated with regulating the two-year-old retail marijuana industry. 
The proposed increase, introduced at Wednesday’s budget meeting, would raise the annual licensing cost within Seattle to $3,450 from the existing $1,000 . Cannabis retailers — and one council member — immediately questioned the proposal, saying that the math doesn’t make much sense. 
“So what justified the increase other than the fact that we can do it?” asked District 2 Councilmember Bruce Harrell, citing Mayor Ed Murray’s more modest proposal for a $500 increase. “We’ve done a cost analysis that actually reflects (the increase)? It seems like we’ve exceeded it quite significantly.” 
The city’s Finance and Administrative Services department defended the cost, saying that even with the mayor’s proposed increase, the licensing fee falls $430,000 short of the city’s cost to regulate pot. The finance department projected that pot retailers will cost the city more than $700,000 next year. 
Pot growers and retailers wondered why this industry, from a license fee standpoint, must pay for its regulation in a way that other businesses, such as pawn shops and strip clubs, do not. Moreover, the city finance estimate misses a key point, said KC Franks, owner of Stash pot shops. “What about the $2 million in new sales taxes to the city?” Franks asked. “Why doesn’t their math reflect that?” Seattle Council Tax-Raising-Advocate Tim Burgess 
Burgess, who said he has no independent confirmation of the sales tax figures, conceded that the pot retailers have, “raised some legitimate objections, so I’m sure we are going to look at all of that.” 
But, he added, the pot issue speaks to a larger policy discussion about how cities pay for the cost of regulating local businesses. Typically, he said, a city uses a blend of licensing fees and taxes to get the money for necessary inspections and enforcement. Pot, he said, costs Seattle about $1 million a year to regulate, an amount which he characterized as a big burden. “This proposal was made to try to offset some of those costs,” he said 
Burgess said the licensing fee likely will go up, but he is not sure if the full council will support his proposed increase. The measure, as it is or modified, could come to a vote next week. 
Franks and other marijuana retailers characterized the proposal as a simple cash grab directed at an industry without much political clout – or as much money as people seem to think. Philip Dawdy, of the Have a Heart pot shop, wondered why an industry that is a net contributor to city coffers doesn’t have more council support? 
When the city raised business license fees to help pay for more police, he said, they consulted retail business organizations first. The pot fee, he said, was a complete blindside. “We are actually helping to balance the city’s budget thanks to sales taxes,” he said. “Why are we not someone’s priority?”

And I thought Trump would be pretty good. But he’s kind of disappointed me in the first 100 days on those issues. ” Jenner added, “I’m not a   voter. I believe in limited government. I believe in our Constitution. I believe  —   I would rather convince the Republican Party to do a better job when it comes to all LGBT issues than to try to convince the Democrats to lower taxes and lower regulations and let our country thrive financially and economically. ” Jenner was then asked, “Isn’t there a lot of pressure, though, on you, specifically to be a   voter? And how you respond  —   how do you deal with that?” Jenner responded, “I totally agree with you. A lot in our community are, and they were very upset that I, you know, I was a Republican, and I said at the Republican National Convention, I said it was harder to come out as trans than it was to come out a member of the Republican Party. And so, yeah, from that stand, it’s been pretty tough. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
2656,Sessions Controversy Heightens Trump’s Feeling of Being Under Siege - The New York Times,"President Trump was still upbeat Wednesday night, as he settled into dinner in the White House residence with his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, some 24 hours after giving the most consequential speech of his brief presidency. But not long afterward, the glow from Mr. Trump’s best day in office began to fade with the breaking news that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had met with the Russian ambassador during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Sessions failed to mention those conversations in his Senate confirmation hearing, or, according to presidential advisers, to tell Mr. Trump at all. The story overshadowed Mr. Trump’s visit the next day to the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, a classic presidential opportunity to highlight his role as commander in chief. And by the time he got back to the White House on Thursday night, the president let his frustration show. In a statement repeating a familiar critique that Democrats were on a “witch hunt” over the administration’s ties with Russia, Mr. Trump offered a passing but pointed public jab at how Mr. Sessions had handled the matter. “He could have stated his response more accurately,” Mr. Trump said. For Mr. Trump, it was the latest unforeseen obstacle preventing him from gaining traction after a historically bumpy first month in office that has been marked by massive national protests, the dismissal of his national security adviser, and historically low approval ratings. The president was irritated that Mr. Sessions did not more carefully answer the questions he was asked under oath, according to people who spoke with him. His larger frustration, however, was not with Mr. Sessions, but with whoever revealed the meetings to reporters for The Washington Post. Mr. Trump, according to his advisers inside and outside of the White House, has felt besieged by what he regards as a mostly hostile bureaucracy, consisting in part of Democrats and people who opposed his election who are now undermining his presidency with leaks. He believes that they are behind the stories about confusion and dysfunction in his administration and, most of all, that they have made his relationship with Russia a recurring issue. “That is the real story,” said Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, when asked for comment on how the White House views the constant string of stories based on what they have called leaks. Several of those stories have raised questions about ties between the president’s 2016 campaign and Russian officials. Allies of Mr. Trump say his sense of being surrounded by hostile forces will be relieved once his own appointments fill the thousands of political jobs that have not yet been filled. But people close to Mr. Trump concede that the White House’s sluggish hiring process, in which insufficient work was done to tap people for key deputy roles at major agencies during the transition process, is a large part of the problem. “Any new administration takes a while to get their sea legs,” said Charlie Black, a veteran Republican lobbyist. But he added that for Mr. Trump’s administration, “a big part of it is the lack of personnel political appointees around the government. ” In the meantime, Mr. Black and other Republicans said that Mr. Trump had to avoid the trap of fighting all fights, no matter how small. “The Trump team needs to better stay on the offense with their reform agenda, take out the trash, and get on with governing,” said Scott Reed, the top political strategist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, in a typical critique. Mr. Trump’s aides were heartened by his relative calm even amid the flap around Mr. Sessions. And he stayed on message during his appearance on the Gerald R. Ford and on Friday in an appearance in Florida, declining to weigh in then as new reports emerged about previously undisclosed meetings between additional advisers and the Russian ambassador. Mr. Trump is not one to spare the blame when he has hit difficult patches in the past, and his rebuke of Mr. Sessions reflected that. So did his public jab at his press secretary, Sean Spicer, for his attempt to trace leaks from his communications staff members by examining their cellphones. Mr. Trump told Fox News that he personally would have done that type of search “differently. ” But the stories related to Russia are of a different order of magnitude. During the transition he publicly called out the intelligence community for being behind the leaks and at one point, he compared them to smears conducted by the Nazis in the 1940s. More recently, he has blamed Democrats bitter over the defeat of Hillary Clinton. But while Mr. Trump puts the blame on leakers for his administration’s rough start, it has not helped that the White House has been distracted by internecine skirmishes, partly dictated by lingering tensions between   advisers and aides to the Republican National Committee, who came to work for the president after he tapped the committee’s chairman, Reince Priebus, as his chief of staff. In the midst of it, Mr. Trump, who has a famously short attention span, has at times had trouble staying on course. He is pondering a broader response to the Russia issue, people close to him say, but he is so far stymied by opponents he can’t see, but who have clearly knocked him off track. On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to go back on the offensive with two Twitter messages, one about Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and the other about Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, and their meetings with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. Instead of the intemperate messages that Mr. Trump has often deployed, he had help from the White House social media team in crafting the Twitter posts. But in doing it, he ended the week by breathing more oxygen into the Russia issue. Such daily skirmishes might satisfy the need to fight back, but Republicans who want him to succeed caution that Mr. Trump’s fate as president will lie in his actual accomplishments. “If they get some legislative successes, they’ll be fine,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, “and if they don’t, that’s when the real trouble begins. ”",0
2657,"Trump Creates ""Department of War"" Cheney To Be Head","  HE'S BACK! 
Donald Trump said today that the term ""Defense Department"" is ""kind of PC but we'll keep the department going with Donald Rumsfeld at the helm."" He continued, ""During the campaign I said that I'd bomb the sh*t out of ISIS and kill the women and children in their families. That's a beautiful thing, being so militantly aggressive. It's making America great again and proclaiming we know we're at war. So we need a War Department."" 
Dick Cheney, who was primarily responsible for the U.S. invasion of Iraq which led to the creation of ISIS has agreed to be the Secretary of War. ""We need to finish the job I started. Part of that will be the use of torture 'beyond waterboarding"" as President Trump has recommended.""

2658,Mexican Nationals Plead Guilty in International Sex Trafficking Ring,"Eight defendants, including six Mexican nationals, forced young women and underage girls from Mexico and Latin America into prostitution in the United States. [The   Trafficking Organization operated as a   criminal enterprise that smuggled young women and girls into the United States for over a decade, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.  Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York originally charged defendants Jovan   33, of Mexico Saul   39, of Queens Guillermina   46, of Mexico Francisco   28, of Queens Jose   34, of Mexico Felix Rojas, 47, of Mexico Odilon   45, of Mexico and Severiano   52, of Mexico in 2015. Law enforcement officers in the U. S. and Mexico simultaniously arrested the suspects in a   operation in November 2015. Between April 5 and April 21, 2017, all eight defendants pled guilty to, “charges of Racketeering involving predicate acts of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion and sex trafficking of minors. ” In addition to the racketeering charges that all eight defendants pled guilty to, seven of the defendants pleaded guilty to additional charges. Court records indicate the   Trafficking Organization recruited girls from Mexico and illegally smuggled them into the United States. Once in the country, the girls were trafficked into New York and Georgia where the defendants forced them into prostitution as sex slaves. Jovan   Saul   Felix Rojas, Odilon   and Severiano   each pled guilty to “substantive offenses of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion. ” Jose   also pleaded guilty to sex trafficking of a minor while Francisco   also pled guilty to “interstate transportation for the purpose of prostitution. ” The defendants admitted during plea proceedings that they recruited young women and girls from Mexico on “false promises,” smuggled them into the United States and forced them into prostitution. Members of this criminal enterprise used “used force, threats of force, fraud, deception, and coercion to compel them to engage in prostitution. ” The defendants laundered the profits they made from prostituting the young women and girls back to Mexico. Two of the defendants, Odilon   and Severiano   were also involved in a separate sex trafficking case in Northern Georgia in 2013. Odilon   received a   prison sentence in 2014 while Severiano   remained a fugitive until November 2015. “The Department of Justice is committed to bringing to justice anyone who engages in the abominable crime of human trafficking,” said Attorney General Sessions.  “The defendants, in this case, preyed on vulnerable young women and girls, and brought them to the United States with the sole purpose of subjecting them to degradation that no person should have to endure. ” In total, the defendants admitted to sex trafficking nine women and two minor girls. The defendants also forced a twelfth woman into prostitution. When sentenced, all eight defendants will face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.   criminal organizations from Mexico can be found operating all throughout the United States. Breitbart Texas reported on Friday that authorities arrested and charged 17 alleged operatives for a Mexican drug cartel in Colorado.

2659,"Why the Election Is Close, and What Trump and Obama Have in Common - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump is in striking distance of winning the election with two days to go, and there’s really just one reason for that: He’s leading white voters without a college degree by a huge margin. In recent national surveys, Mr. Trump leads Hillary Clinton by 59 percent to 30 percent among that group. It’s larger than the   lead that Mitt Romney had with those voters in the final polls in 2012. On their own, Mr. Trump’s gains among this group have been enough to cancel out four years of favorable demographic shifts for Democrats among Hispanic and   white voters. He has even won supporters among some of the same white voters who backed Barack Obama in 2008. It suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have a little more in common than you might think  —   at least from a political standpoint. If Mr. Trump wins the presidency, that will ultimately be why. It has been a consistent pattern all year. Whenever Mr. Trump fights his way into a tight race with Mrs. Clinton, it’s because he manages to run up the score with   white voters. In the past week, analysis of the early vote has already made it clear that turnout will be more than high enough for a Democrat to win a presidential election. Latino turnout will be high. Black turnout may not reach 2012 levels, but it will not be so low that one could reasonably blame black turnout for a Clinton loss. But Mr. Trump’s strength among the white working class gives him a real chance at victory, a possibility that many discounted as recently as the summer. He could win enough Electoral College votes without winning the popular vote, through narrow victories in Midwestern and Northeastern battlegrounds like Wisconsin and New Hampshire, where Democrats depend on support among white   voters. Mr. Trump’s strength with that group could even be enough for him to win Florida, where Mrs. Clinton’s abundant support among Hispanic voters would otherwise all but doom a Republican. The conventional wisdom after 2012 held that Mr. Obama was a historically weak candidate among white   voters, and that there wasn’t much room for the Republicans to make additional gains. To the extent that there was an argument for how Republicans could make big gains among the group, it was that they could rally the support of missing white voters  —   a group that in reality appears more Democratic than the white voters who do turn out in elections. But exit polls tend to undercount the number of less educated voters, and the national exit polls obscured Mr. Obama’s strength among white voters in the North. They showed him faring worse among white voters than any Democrat since Walter Mondale, but that was exclusively because of his weakness in the South. In many Northern states  —   like Iowa and Ohio  —   Mr. Obama did better among white voters than past Democrats. There was a lot of room for Mrs. Clinton to fall. She’s proving it. For many, it was very hard to imagine that Mrs. Clinton  —   a white Democrat who excelled among white   voters in the 2008 Democratic primary  —   could lose voters who supported Mr. Obama in the 2012 election, or who approve of his performance today. It’s even stranger if one believes that racism is at the core of Mr. Trump’s appeal: If Mr. Trump’s supporters are animated by racism, then why did so many of them vote for Mr. Obama? Racism might well animate Mr. Trump’s base. But his appeal among some white Obama supporters suggests that Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama might have something in common. Mr. Trump has changed the story lines of the 2012 and 2008 elections  —   and tapped into many of the same issues and frames that helped Mr. Obama. In 2008, Mr. Obama depicted himself as an agent of hope and change: He ran against Washington, the establishment and special interests. In 2012, the Obama campaign attacked its Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, as a plutocrat who would outsource jobs and help the wealthy, not the middle class. Those are the kinds of reasons that white   Democrats in places like Scranton, Pa. and Youngstown, Ohio, remained with the Democrats. In this election, Mr. Trump flipped that frame. He ran against the establishment  —   and against a candidate who embodies it far more than John McCain or Mr. Romney. He depicted Mrs. Clinton as someone who supports corporate  —   even global  —   interests over the middle class on issues like trade and immigration. The various allegations against Mrs. Clinton neatly complement the notion that she’s not trying to help ordinary Americans. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has spent more time questioning Mr. Trump’s fitness for the presidency than emphasizing the traditional Democratic campaign message about the economy. Mr. Trump is expected to fall short of the presidency, in part because of his problems capitalizing on Mrs. Clinton’s deep weakness among white   voters. There are probably many young white men without a degree, for instance, who liked Mr. Obama and don’t like either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton. Regardless of the outcome, these voters will loom over American politics. Huge parts of the Republican Party’s establishment would undoubtedly prefer a candidate who’s friendlier to their views on immigration and trade. If Mrs. Clinton wins with strength among the well educated and Hispanic voters, much of the Republican establishment will conclude that those groups are in their electoral interest as well. But the voters receptive to Mr. Trump’s views on these issues would have pulled Republicans awfully close to victory, even with a deeply flawed candidate. They’re also among the voters likeliest to be skeptical of Mrs. Clinton in four years. It would be difficult for the party not to cater to them. Democrats would have the opposite challenge. Four years after demographic shifts were credited for Mr. Obama’s victory, the party would undoubtedly realize the extent to which they remain dependent on the support of voters whom they might have assumed they no longer needed. At the same time, their winning coalition would be better educated and more diverse than ever before. Without a Republican like Mr. Trump as a foil, it could be hard to devise an agenda and a message that would hold Mrs. Clinton’s coalition together.",0
2660,"A Dose of a Hallucinogen From a ‘Magic Mushroom,’ and Then Lasting Peace - The New York Times","On a summer morning in 2013, Octavian Mihai entered a softly lit room furnished with a small statue of Buddha, a box of tissues and a single red rose. From an earthenware chalice, he swallowed a capsule of psilocybin, an ingredient found in hallucinogenic mushrooms. Then he put on an eye mask and headphones and lay down on a couch. Soon, images flew by like shooting stars: a spinning world that looked like a   chessboard himself on a stretcher in front of a hospital his parents, gazing at him with aching sadness as he reached out to them, suffused with childlike love. Psilocybin has been illegal in the United States for more than 40 years. But Mr. Mihai, who had just finished treatment for Stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma, was participating in a study looking at whether the drug can reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Throughout that   session, a psychiatrist and a social worker from NYU Langone Medical Center stayed by his side. Published Thursday, the results from that study, and a similar small, controlled trial, were striking. About 80 percent of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in both psychological disorders, a response sustained some seven months after the single dose. Side effects were minimal. In both trials, the intensity of the mystical experience described by patients correlated with the degree to which their depression and anxiety decreased. The studies, by researchers at New York University, with 29 patients, and at Johns Hopkins University, with 51, were released concurrently in The Journal of Psychopharmacology. They proceeded after arduous review by regulators and are the largest and most meticulous among a handful of trials to explore the possible therapeutic benefit of psilocybin. Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, a past president of the American Psychiatric Association, and Dr. Daniel Shalev of the New York State Psychiatric Institute are among leaders in psychiatry, addiction medicine and palliative care who endorsed the work. The studies, they wrote, are “a model for revisiting criminalized compounds of interest in a safe, ethical way. ” If research restrictions could be eased, they continued, “there is much potential for new scientific insights and clinical applications. ” Although cancer patients will not have access to therapeutically administered psilocybin anytime soon, the findings add vigor to applications to expand research in a multicenter trial with hundreds of participants. Some medical professionals held the studies at arm’s length. Dr. William Breitbart, chairman of the psychiatry department at Memorial   Cancer Center, questioned this use of cancer patients. “Medical marijuana got its foot in the door by making the appeal that ‘cancer patients are suffering, they’re near death, so for compassionate purposes, let’s make it available,’ ” he said. “And then you’re able to extend this drug to other purposes. ” Psilocybin trials are underway in the United States and Europe for alcoholism, tobacco addiction and   depression. Other hallucinogens are also being studied for clinical application. This week, the Food and Drug Administration approved a   trial investigating MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, for   stress disorder.   psychological distress, which afflicts up to 40 percent of patients, can be resistant to conventional therapy. Mr. Mihai’s anxiety began when doctors finally told him he was in remission. He would keep touching the nodules on his neck, where the cancer had announced itself. He flew to Europe to celebrate the end of treatment and his graduation from college, but abruptly returned to New York, terrified to be away from oncologists. He began drinking daily, hard, jeopardizing his fragile health. Alarmed, doctors suggested the psilocybin study. He took the capsule and began tripping. After seeing himself on a hospital stretcher, he recalled: “I had an epiphany. ” “Why are you letting yourself be terrorized by cancer coming back? This is dumb. It’s in your power to get rid of the fear,” he told himself. “That’s when I saw black smoke rising from my body. And it felt great. ” Three years later, Mr. Mihai, now 25 and a physician assistant in Las Vegas, said, “I’m not anxious about cancer anymore. I’m not anxious about dying. ” The session, he added, “has made my life richer. ” In the 1940s and 1950s, hallucinogens were studied in hundreds of trials. But by 1970, when those drugs were placed in the most restricted regulatory category, research ground to a near halt. Since about 2000, investigators have begun studying them, mostly with private funding. These two studies built on a 2011 UCLA psilocybin pilot project with 12 cancer patients. Both share similarities. All volunteers had diagnoses of   anxiety or depression. Patients were randomly given a placebo or synthetic psilocybin, and not told which. Within seven weeks, they were given the other sample. All patients were educated about the drug, monitored by two people throughout the placebo and psilocybin sessions, and seen for   evaluation. Researchers created   music playlists, paced to the anticipated rhythms of the drug reaction. N. Y. U. leaned toward New Age and world music  —   Brian Eno sitars didgeridoos. Johns Hopkins favored Western classical. At N. Y. U. psychotherapists tried to layer the session into patients’ memories by asking them to write about their visions in a journal and discuss the experience in meetings. The Johns Hopkins study, led by Roland R. Griffiths, a psychopharmacologist, had monitors who urged participants to “trust, let go and be open. ” The N. Y. U. researchers assessed patients the next day and found the effects to be immediate in most of them. Dr. Stephen Ross, the lead investigator and chief of addiction psychiatry at N. Y. U. pointed out that antidepressants, by contrast, can take weeks to show benefit. “Cancer patients with anxiety and depression need help immediately,” he said, “especially if you consider that they are at elevated risk for completed suicide. ” Some experts questioned the reliability of the results. Dr. Breitbart said that because diagnoses ranged from   cancer to imminent terminal illness, it was impossible to know which patients might have come through their psychological ordeal without psilocybin  —   whether some might have adapted to the new norms of their disease felt stronger once chemotherapy side effects, including depression, had abated or even experienced an improvement in health. None of those possibilities fit Kevin, who had a   transplant for acute myeloid leukemia. It sent his cancer into remission, but left him with    disease. Suffering from chronic pain and fatigue, Kevin, 57, who lives in central Michigan and asked that his last name be withheld because he had been in law enforcement, had to retire. Four years after the transplant, he despaired. “Going through a   illness is similar to returning from combat,” he said. “It damages who you are, to the core of what it is to be human. ” “I was hoping to get out of this funk of waiting for the other shoe to drop,” he added. “You’re looking up to the heavens, saying ‘What else can I try?’ ” In 2013, Kevin entered the Johns Hopkins trial. During his session, he saw spirals of iridescent spheres that folded in on themselves. The experience did not restore him to his former life, he said, “but I have a greater sense of peace of what might come. I’m very grateful, beyond words, for this trial. But you have to approach the session with the right intentions of why you’re doing it. Because you’re going to meet yourself. ” Researchers do not know why psilocybin has worked in these settings. Neuroimaging scans of healthy volunteers show areas of the brain lighting up or resting during dosing. Hallucinogens activate a serotonin receptor that can lead to the alterations of consciousness reported routinely. One theory is that psilocybin interrupts the circuitry of   thinking that is so pronounced in depressed people, making way for a mystical experience of selfless unity. The studies received funding from the Heffter Research Institute, an alliance of scientists interested in the medical study of hallucinogens. Dr. George Greer, the   of Heffter, does not see a commercial future for psilocybin, even if it is eventually approved for therapeutic use, because these patients needed only one dose. Instead, he envisions a nonprofit manufacturer, with distribution restricted to specialized clinics. Researchers were emphatic that these results should not be interpreted as condoning hallucinogenic mushrooms for  . Dr. Griffiths noted that patients received extensive support, which may have deepened and secured their   transformations. “People will take psilocybin at a rave or at Burning Man”  —   the art and performance desert festival  —   “but the effect,” he said, “evaporates like water running through their hands. ”",0

Bill and Hillary Clinton just can’t stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill’s revealing nickname for his wife — but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Bill and Hillary Clinton (left), Photoshopped image of Hillary (right) 
It’s no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online , Dolly Kyle was behind the scene’s long enough to not only know the two’s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits – and now, she’s telling everyone. 
The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. Dolly Kyle (Source: Mail Online ) 
The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn’t married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the “right to be believed.” 
Knowing full well just what Hillary had done – between the threats and the lies – to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. 
According to Mail Online , Bill approached Dolly at their high school’s 35-year reunion to talk about “ the warden ” – a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. A very unhappy Bill and “the warden” Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. 
Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. “In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn’t gag when she got in my car,” she said. “The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.” Bill and Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
No wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his “sexual addiction,” as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when you’re married to a stinky woman who doesn’t shower and isn’t attracted to men anyways? Although an affair is never justified, it’s easy to sympathize with Bill on this one. But, I digress. 
The bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power. Most people know that you can’t trust Hillary as far as you can throw her – which isn’t very far – so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point. This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Let’s just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it’s too late and she can do any more damage than she already has.",0
2663,"Republican Party, Central Intelligence Agency: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. WikiLeaks’ latest release, if confirmed, appears certain to rock the technology world and deliver a serious blow to the C. I. A. The   Vault 7 documents offer details of what are described as highly classified C. I. A. hacking tools used to break into smartphones and computers, turn   TVs into spies and bypass encryption on messaging services like Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. WikiLeaks said the source of the leak was raising policy questions that “urgently need to be debated in public. ” _____ 2. “Obamacare Lite. ” That was Senator Rand Paul, who like many other conservatives is in revolt over the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. The legislation would end mandated coverage but maintains many of the basic benefits that critics  —   including the Club for Growth, Heritage Action for America and the brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch’s Americans for Prosperity  —   see as warping the free market. _____ 3. Senate Republicans rejected Democrats’ calls for a special counsel to lead the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. The sparring came at a Judiciary Committee hearing on Mr. Trump’s nominee to be deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. He would oversee any such inquiry since Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself. _____ 4. In the Netherlands, there’s also concern about foreign influence in coming elections  —   by American money. The     leader, Geert Wilders, is getting donations from American conservatives attracted to his   Union and   views. “We would not have thought that people from other countries would have been interested in our politics,” said a member of Parliament. “Maybe we underestimated ourselves. ” _____ 5. China warned of a nuclear arms race in Northeast Asia after the United States began delivering parts of an advanced missile defense system, known as Thaad, to South Korea. The system, meant to counter the growing threat from North Korea, could be operational as early as April. And North Korea blocked all Malaysians from leaving the country, deepening tensions over last month’s assassination of Kim  . _____ 6. Mr. Trump’s revision of the U. S. program for refugees reduces the number the country will accept by more than half. This year’s arrivals already approach the new ceiling of 50, 000. Thousands of Central Americans seeking to escape brutal gang violence may not make the cut, like two girls in El Salvador who saw their grandparents gunned down and who are themselves being hunted. “We got a call last weekend telling us that they’d find us under whatever rock we were hiding,” their aunt said. _____ 7. And some migrants in the U. S. are trying to make their way out. People from Yemen, Turkey and elsewhere have been streaming through a small town in upstate New York en route to Canada, driven by anxieties over the travel ban,   sentiment and frustration over the immigration process. It’s almost impossible to apply for asylum at border posts, so they slip by to get arrested on Canadian soil and try their luck from inside Canada’s legal system. _____ 8. Canada came in second in the annual U. S. News  World Report survey of the best countries in the world. The 2017 rankings prioritized countries that enjoy peace, quiet and prosperity, after surveys indicated widespread anxiety over social and geopolitical change. Switzerland took the No. 1 spot. Third? Britain. _____ 9. Travel advice: Cash redemption is often the worst value for your credit card points. We took a close look at the Chase, American Express and Citi rewards programs, and found better deals if you bank the points and use them to book flights through your card or partner sites. _____ 10. Finally, “huge news for refrigerators everywhere. ” That was a blogger’s take on the pending retirement of the longtime cartoon editor of The New Yorker, Bob Mankoff. We talked with him about some of his favorites from among the hundreds of his own cartoons that have appeared in the magazine. The one above was such a hit that he had the phrase trademarked. “One of the things you have to recognize about humor is that at its heart it’s stupid, and we should enjoy that stupidity,” Mr. Mankoff said.

2664,An Amateur vs. ISIS: A Car Salesman Investigates and Ends Up in Prison - The New York Times,"WYOMING, Del.  —   By his own account, Toby Lopez was a supremely ordinary guy. He sold Toyotas and lived with his mother in a tidy rancher here with a cherry tree out front. He was proud that he could connect with customers  —   anyone from a Superior Court judge to, as he put it, “Redneck Bill from down on the farm. ” What passed for excitement was the time his young niece won a beauty contest and he chauffeured her in a red Corvette in a local parade. Then a high school friend was killed in Afghanistan, and the Islamic State began beheading American journalists. Horrified, Mr. Lopez heard on CNN one day in the fall of 2014 that the Islamic State was active on Twitter, and he went online to see what he could find. “I was intrigued,” said Mr. Lopez, 42. “What could they possibly be saying on Twitter?” What followed was a radical break from his humdrum life. He was pulled into the murky world of Internet jihadists, sparring with them from his office at the car dealership and late into the night at home. Before long, he was talking for hours on Skype with a man who claimed  —   falsely, as it would turn out  —   to be a top ISIS military commander, trying to negotiate the release of hostages. Mr. Lopez contacted the F. B. I. and began a testy relationship with counterterrorism agents who came to believe he might pose a danger. In the end, he landed in federal prison, where he was held for nearly 14 months without trial. The story of one man’s deepening obsession with a terrorist group is a reminder of how the Internet provides easy portals to distant, sometimes dangerous worlds. It shows the complications for law enforcement agents who confront an overeager amateur encroaching on their turf. But it also underscores how lost a person can feel inside the criminal justice system. Deprived of his freedom, his sanity in question, Mr. Lopez found himself without a legal advocate he trusted or access to evidence he believed could free him. The hundreds of emails, text messages and recorded Skype calls that Mr. Lopez saved show him growing more and more frantic when F. B. I. agents did not see things his way. Believing American hostages’ lives were at stake, he sent an agent 80 increasingly overheated messages in 10 days. In one, he declared, “Just remember whatever ends up happening to you   …     You deserved it,” and added an expletive. On Feb. 11, 2015, a dozen police and F. B. I. cars surrounded the house with the cherry tree, arrested Mr. Lopez and charged him with transmitting a threat. He was shuttled among federal facilities in Pennsylvania, New York, Oklahoma and North Carolina. Without access to his records, prison psychologists assumed his tales of talking to Islamic State members were fiction, symptoms of a mental illness that made him incompetent to stand trial. Prosecutors sought a hearing to decide whether he should be forcibly medicated. The defense finally obtained a third mental health evaluation  —   the first one by a psychologist who had actually reviewed Mr. Lopez’s voluminous files. It found him competent, and he was released on bail late last month. “Without having the documents,” Kirk Heilbrun, a Drexel University psychologist, wrote in his March 2 evaluation, “I would have concluded that his account of this entire series of events sounded both grandiose and delusional. Having reviewed these documents, however, I would not describe his account as delusional. ” On Friday, the United States attorney’s office in Delaware said it had taken the “exceedingly rare” step of dropping the charges. “We have not hesitated to do so when the facts and law support such a decision,” a statement said. In an interview last week, Mr. Lopez’s voice broke as he described his prison ordeal. “Nobody deserves to get dragged through what I got dragged through, along with my family,” he said. “It’s sad that when someone does something with righteous intentions and gets treated by the government this way. ” By his own admission, Mr. Lopez knew almost nothing about the Islamic State before 2014. Athletic and   he had managed an Italian restaurant for years before becoming a car salesman. He became addicted to painkillers for a while, but he kicked the habit and has been off drugs for several years, he said. “Toby is your regular guy,” said Mary Roloff, who is married to Mr. Lopez’s half brother, Edward. At first, Mr. Lopez said, he started insulting people who praised the Islamic State on Twitter. Then he decided to learn more about his social media adversaries. He picked up a few Islamic terms online and began to engage the terrorist group’s supporters, even quoting the Quran to counter them. He found the anonymity of the Internet intoxicating. As he put it, nobody knew he was “little Toby, the car salesman from Delaware. ” On Google, Mr. Lopez discovered that one man who had engaged him on Twitter, calling himself @shishaniomar, seemed to be Omar   or Omar the Chechen, the nom de guerre of the military commander of the Islamic State. Soon the two were regularly chatting on Skype. By early November 2014, he had left his job, agreeing with his boss that his online life had become a distraction. The man who claimed to be the Islamic State commander regaled him with tales of battle, grumbled about condescending Arab bosses and called Mr. Lopez “brother. ” The man confided that he did not believe that Islam condoned the taking of women and children as slaves. Soon he asked Mr. Lopez to raise ransom to free hundreds of members of the Yazidi religious minority held hostage by the Islamic State. When relatives gathered for Thanksgiving in 2014 at the Roloffs’ home near Baltimore, Mr. Lopez showed them jihadist videos and text message exchanges with Islamic State fans. “We love ‘CSI,’” Ms. Roloff said. “We thought, ‘This is really cool.’ But some of what he shared with us  —   like videos of kids hanging from a tree  —   started to scare me. It was beyond our comprehension. ” Mr. Lopez contacted the F. B. I. and two agents visited his home and interviewed him, he said. Through Allan Ripp, a New York public relations specialist he found online, Mr. Lopez also contacted The New York Times. Two reporters visited him in January 2015 and spent several hours reviewing his emails, texts and audio recordings. But after checking with experts, the reporters concluded that Mr. Lopez was talking not to the real,   Mr. Shishani, but to an impostor. The actual commander did not speak fluent English, and the language overheard in the background of Skype calls was not Chechen, as the impostor claimed, but Kurdish. His multiple Twitter accounts had an antic tone he once posted a “Simpsons” cartoon about the Islamic State. “It’s definitely a fake,” Joanna Paraszczuk, a British journalist and researcher who tracks the Chechens fighting in Syria, said by email. She said the same man had duped an Australian radio station into interviewing him but later admitted that he was not the ISIS commander, but a Kurdish immigrant to Scandinavia. The man’s motive appeared to be money: He asked Mr. Lopez to bring the ransom to Sweden, supposedly to be forwarded to Syria. When the Times reporters told Mr. Lopez they did not believe he was dealing with the real Islamic State commander, he grew angry. He was hearing similar skepticism from the F. B. I. according to email exchanges with Jeffrey A. Reising, a senior counterterrorism agent based in Wilmington, Del. From the emails, it appears that Mr. Reising was exploring Mr. Lopez’s contacts even as he tried to persuade him to disengage from the online jihadist world. But Mr. Lopez connected with a second Twitter user claiming to be an Islamic State figure who could get American hostages released, and Mr. Lopez tried to contact several hostages’ families. At least one of them complained to the F. B. I. Convinced that he could save lives, Mr. Lopez brushed off Mr. Reising’s warnings. He wrote dozens of emails to the F. B. I. some proposing that he talk to the bureau’s director or even to President Obama. He focused on the case of Kayla Mueller, a    American aid worker being held by the Islamic State. His online contacts had suggested that she might be freed. Despite his doubts about Mr. Lopez’s exploits, Mr. Reising appeared to believe he might have stumbled across useful information. “Can you provide all contact information for the person on that chat?” he wrote to Mr. Lopez on Feb. 4, 2015, referring to an exchange with a purported Islamic State representative. Near midnight, Mr. Lopez excitedly emailed the F. B. I. agent. “I want to bring her home alive,” he wrote. “I know I can do it and I will look the PRESIDENT in his eyes and tell him exactly that   …     Anything else your fooling yourself and your in denial!! Good night!” The weary F. B. I. agent replied: “Toby  …    . Seriously. Get some sleep. ” When Ms. Mueller was reported killed two days later in an airstrike, Mr. Lopez was furious and blamed the F. B. I. for not cooperating with him. His messages to the bureau grew more defiant. “Any attempt to arrest me will be treated as a hostile act,” he wrote to Mr. Reising. By then, agents had been informed by the Delaware State Police that Mr. Lopez’s mother, Joyce Lopez, had told them that her son had a shotgun and was in a “poor mental state. ” Mrs. Lopez, 78, said recently that she had simply asked whether the gun had to be registered. By Feb. 11, the F. B. I. had had enough. Mrs. Lopez arrived home to find her house surrounded. “Cars all over the place,” she recalled. “Toby was standing there with his hands up. I said, ‘What’s wrong? ’” The authorities had interpreted Mr. Lopez’s heated emails as a “threat to injure” Mr. Reising, a crime with a sentence of up to five years. Mr. Lopez said later that he had threatened only to expose what he considered government bungling to the news media. He was locked up, and federal prosecutors soon sought a court order for a mental health assessment. At an initial court hearing in Wilmington, family members urged Mr. Lopez’s public defender, Daniel I. Siegel, to collect the records of his online contacts, which they thought showed his intentions were good. By their account, Mr. Siegel ignored their pleas. “He just said, ‘Your brother is very sick and he needs help,’” Ms. Roloff recalled. Mr. Lopez said Mr. Siegel never came to see him in the year that followed, as he cycled through the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan (where he surprised a few terrorism defendants with Arabic phrases) a medical prison in Butner, N. C. (where he played on the softball team) and three other facilities. The first two psychological evaluations found that Mr. Lopez was suffering from “delusional disorder, grandiose type. ” To Mr. Lopez’s distress, Mr. Siegel did not contest the findings. A year into Mr. Lopez’s imprisonment, after complaints from his family and reporters’ inquiries, Edson A. Bostic, the chief federal public defender in Delaware, took over the case. He quickly obtained from the family the files documenting Mr. Lopez’s online history and arranged for the third psychological assessment. Dr. Heilbrun, the Drexel psychologist, declared in his report that if Mr. Lopez had not been talking with the real Mr. Shishani (who was killed last month) then someone posing as the Islamic State commander had pulled off “a clever, detailed, and   hoax. ” In a statement on Friday, Mr. Bostic called the case “a complex matter” and praised Mr. Siegel’s record of representing indigent clients. But he said the complaints from Mr. Lopez and his family would be investigated. Mr. Siegel did not respond to emails seeking comment. Now that the charges have been dropped, Mr. Lopez, who missed two family weddings while in prison, is reconnecting with friends and relatives. “All over you see those billboards that say, ‘See Something Say Something,’” said Tana Stevens, Mr. Lopez’s sister. “He tried to do that. And they basically kidnapped him for 14 months. ” Mr. Lopez said he had consulted lawyers and was considering a lawsuit against the government officials responsible for his incarceration. “If I hadn’t gotten another evaluation, I might still be sitting down at Butner, with a needle in my arm,” he said. “This was the United States of America, flexing its muscles on me. ”",0

2666,Donald Trump News Conference Gets the ‘S.N.L.’ Treatment - The New York Times,"If Donald J. Trump’s first news conference as   was a raucous, chaotic affair on Wednesday  —   and it was  —   the parody of it on “Saturday Night Live” was somehow calmer and more organized than the actual event. Still, the “S. N. L. ” sketch pulled few punches as it swung at the show’s most powerful, persistent critic, mocking Mr. Trump on a range of subjects, including the perceived lack of star power at his coming inauguration his opaque plan to divest himself from his businesses and the possibility that Russia possessed unverified compromising information on him. Saturday night’s episode, the first new one of 2017, once again featured Alec Baldwin as Mr. Trump. He started off the faux news conference by vowing to answer what he said was “the question that’s on everyone’s mind. ” “Yes, this is real life,” he said. “This is really happening. On January 20, I, Donald J. Trump, will become the 45th president of the United States. ” He continued: “And then, two months later, Mike Pence will become the 46th. ” Listing the performers who are scheduled for his inauguration, he cited the rock band 3 Doors Down, “Jackie What’  ” from “America’s Got Talent” and “the one Rockette with the least money in her savings. ” (He also said the actors Angelina Jolie, Ryan Gosling and Jennifer Lawrence would be in attendance “courtesy of Madame Tussauds. ”) Turning to questions from reporters played by the “S. N. L. ” cast, Mr.    pointedly refused to answer questions about an alleged compromising videotape, because, he said, “it didn’t happen and it wasn’t as cool as it sounded. ” Asked by a reporter played by Sasheer Zamata how he planned to repeal and replace Obamacare, Mr. Baldwin said, “I actually do have a replacement plan, O. K.? I just read about it this week. It’s a terrific plan. Just great. It’s called the Affordable Care Act. ” When Ms. Zamata’s character said that repealing Obamacare meant that people could die, Mr. Baldwin replied, “Listen, sweetheart, I’m about to be president, we’re all going to die. ” As the   Mr. Baldwin went on to say that he was turning his companies over to his sons, “Beavis and  . ” (“You can tell they’re good businessmen because of how   their hair is,” he said.) Recreating another scene from the news conference, the “S. N. L. ” cast member Cecily Strong appeared as Sheri A. Dillon, a tax lawyer for Mr. Trump who spoke at the actual news conference. In a low monotone, Ms. Strong motioned toward a large pile of   papers in various folders that she said proved Mr. Trump was divesting from his companies. “If he wasn’t divesting, how could there be so many damn papers?” she said. The “S. N. L. ” sketch repeated Mr. Trump’s angry repudiation of the news media organization BuzzFeed, which he called “a failing pile of garbage. ” (In the sketch, Mr. Baldwin said he was dissatisfied with the results of a BuzzFeed quiz. “I’m not a Joey, I’m a Rachel,” he said, referring to the “Friends” characters.) There was also a gentle reenactment of Mr. Trump’s refusal to take questions from the CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta. “You’re fake news,” Mr. Baldwin said in the sketch. “I tried to watch your network last night, and there was just some crazy blond woman spouting lies. ” Bobby Moynihan, playing Mr. Acosta, answered: “That was Kellyanne Conway. ” Finally, after acknowledging to a reporter that Russia probably played a role in hacking the election, Mr. Baldwin took one last question from the cast member Beck Bennett. Though the   Mr. Bennett clearly appeared to be playing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, he said, in a thick Russian accent, “I am American journalist Wolf Blitzer. Are you sure Russia was behind hacking?” Then he held up a potentially incriminating videotape and asked, “But are you really, really sure?” Mr. Baldwin stammered in reply, “It was China. I mean Canada. It was Meryl Streep. ” Ever since Mr. Trump hosted the program in November 2015 while still vying for the Republican presidential nomination, he has made no secret of his dislike for how “Saturday Night Live” and Mr. Baldwin have portrayed him. After some sketches this season, Mr. Trump has gone on his Twitter account to air his grievances, writing, for example, that the show is “unwatchable,” “totally biased” and “not funny,” and that Mr. Baldwin’s impersonation of him “just can’t get any worse. ” At other times, Mr. Trump has not responded to the show. During Saturday’s opening monologue, Tina Fey, the “S. N. L. ” alumna and “30 Rock” star, offered some advice to the actress Felicity Jones, a   guest host. No matter how the show goes, Ms. Fey said, “The president of the United States will say that it’s sad and overrated. ” She added, “It’s fine, no one cares. ” And then TV viewers warily turned their eyes to Twitter to see what, if anything, would happen next. Late Sunday afternoon, Mr. Trump did respond with a tweet critical of the show, caling it “the worst of NBC,” adding, “Really bad television!”",0

2668,Clicks to Bricks: Online Retailers Find the Lure of a Store - The New York Times,"Online shopping gets all the attention these days. But sometimes, there’s still no beating a physical store. The British designer Lee Broom came to that realization last May after opening a monthlong   shop in Manhattan’s SoHo filled with his furniture and light fixtures, including lamps made from   marble tubes and cut crystal bulbs recalling cocktail glasses. He had already been selling his products through his online store and about 180 retailers worldwide, including major online players like Lumens. But his temporary store in New York helped his sales in the United States jump by about 50 percent over the 12 months through early October. “It went incredibly well, and massively exceeded our expectations,” Mr. Broom said. “People want to see the pieces in person, get the scale, look at the materials and touch them. ” So, last month, Mr. Broom opened his first permanent American outpost in an    storefront in SoHo, and plans to follow it up with a location in Los Angeles in the coming months. He is far from alone. Rather than crushing physical stores, the rise of online shopping is, in many cases, encouraging the development of new and innovative retail shops. [More in Shopping: Rise of athleisure | The sensuality of shopping] Companies of all sizes that once sold primarily through multibrand retailers are building on their experience running online stores by opening       locations. Established retailers are shifting their focus from basic transactions to offering compelling brand experiences and higher levels of personal service. Design stores that once catered to professionals are welcoming independent consumers, as Houzz, Pinterest and Instagram give rise to a legion of    decorators. And even companies that started as   enterprises are increasingly opening physical stores. To understand why, just follow the money. Online sales in the United States will reach about $394 billion this year, according to estimates by the research and advisory firm Forrester Research, a number representing less than 12 percent of total retail sales, which the firm expects will total $3. 4 trillion. But   sales in physical stores (when a consumer researches a product on a smartphone, for instance, and then buys in a store) are expected to account for an additional $1. 3 trillion, or about 38 percent of all retail sales. “Stores are still vitally important,” said Fiona Swerdlow, a vice president and research director at Forrester Research. “But the influence of digital touchpoints is huge. ” A decade ago, most websites run by designers and manufacturers were essentially digital pamphlets comprising images, descriptions and specifications of products you could buy somewhere else. But the online store soon followed, where the maker could sell direct. Now, pleased with becoming retail players while also establishing stronger relationships with their customers, many companies are taking it a step further by opening physical stores. Herman Miller, a modern furniture giant founded in 1923, is opening its first permanent American    retail store since 1967 (when it ran a small Textiles  Objects shop) on Nov. 22 in Manhattan’s Gramercy Park. The      space will also include accessories from other manufacturers and vintage goods to present a complete lifestyle vision for the contemporary home. It follows the debut of Herman Miller’s online store six years ago. With the online store, “what started as a relatively small experiment has grown very rapidly,” said Ben Watson, the executive creative director of Herman Miller. “The size of the business we do directly to consumers has been growing. That was a hint to us that there is a lot of untapped appetite for products from Herman Miller. ” Other companies are discovering the same thing. “In a lot of categories, you’re seeing a significant shift from wholesale, as a percentage of their total revenue, to direct channels,” said Al Sambar, a managing partner at the management consulting firm Kurt Salmon. In the expectation that digital tools and social media will continue to drive more consumers to individual companies, while bypassing traditional multbrand retailers, “brands are building their capability to sell direct,” he said. “It’s also a way to have a personal relationship with the customer, and to have them be really loyal. ” The fashion designer Thakoon Panichgul, who once sold his collections through upscale retailers like Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, switched exclusively to a    model in August, with a new Thakoon online store and a chic SoHo boutique. “We saw a shift in the way that the customer was shopping, or the way she wasn’t shopping anymore,” Mr. Panichgul said. “The customer was shopping online more, and questioning the price of everything. The designer also wasn’t able to control his own vision through and through. All of these components made me question the way we were doing business. ” At the same time, he began presenting collections in a     format, where    pieces are available to purchase online or in the store immediately or soon after being presented on the runway. The strategy, which capitalizes on the immediacy of social media while reducing the risk of knockoffs, is shaking up an industry where a   lag between runway and retailer is common. Many other brands, including Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Tom Ford and Burberry, have recently been experimenting with the same thing. At Saks Fifth Avenue Downtown, the department store’s    women’s store at Brookfield Place in Lower Manhattan, which opened in September, product displays are inspired by websites that encourage shoppers to browse. Where traditional department stores keep handbags separate from clothing, at Saks Fifth Avenue Downtown, an edited range of goods is organized by designer label, with handbags,    and jewelry commingling on a circular path intended to inspire surprise finds. “We wanted to   the department store,” said Marc Metrick, the president of Saks Fifth Avenue. “That’s not how she shops anymore. ” In some displays, “we lay things down flat on tables, just like you’d see on a website,” he added. But Saks’s embrace of technology is about more than mere surface treatment. The company has rolled out applications from the retail technology company Salesfloor that enable online saks. com visitors to   with a sales associate at a nearby physical store. After browsing product suggestions online, shoppers can make an appointment to meet their sales associates in person, to continue shopping. And even after the   visit, the shopper can follow up with the very same sales associate again, online. “Saks, overall, is transforming. We’re really pushing this   experience,” which blends the digital and physical, Mr. Metrick said. “The goal is to keep that interaction going. ” Other stores embracing a similarly mixed approach include Rebecca Minkoff in SoHo and the Polo Ralph Lauren flagship on Fifth Avenue, which have smart touchscreen mirrors in fitting rooms that suggest coordinating pieces for items a shopper is trying on, enable alternate sizes to be summoned from staff and can send links to products via text message so customers can purchase them later, online. At Brookfield Place, Saks is also offering highly personalized services, including its new Power Lunch program, which promises to deliver a style consultation, beauty treatment and lunch together in one hour. The service is free, except for the cost of products a consumer decides to purchase. “We’re seeing this convergence where it’s the best of both worlds,” said Steven Barr, the United States retail and consumer leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “It’s centered around extraordinary technology and extraordinary customer service. ” Rather than treating online and   sales as two separate channels, he said, “We’re finally entering that state where we can say there is a total retail experience. ” Other retailers are focusing on offering shoppers a chance to try products in a way they can’t online. Pirch, a    kitchen and bath store that opened in SoHo in May, encourages customers to turn on fully functional faucets and showerheads or take in live cooking demonstrations, rather than merely looking at disconnected fixtures and appliances. Sonos, the   company whose products are widely available through retailers like Amazon and Target, opened its first    retail store in SoHo in July. Shoppers can stream their own choice of music to test different configurations of speakers in a series of private listening huts. Many   showrooms were once the domain of professional designers and architects. Most homeowners either didn’t know they existed, or were purposely excluded. With the widespread availability of designer resources online, that has changed. Showrooms are increasingly fielding requests from individual homeowners who want to buy direct, and many are opening   retail stores to become more accessible. Poliform, an Italian manufacturer of streamlined kitchens, closets and furniture, has long had a showroom inside the AD Building in Midtown Manhattan, where it catered largely to design professionals. But at the end of September, it opened a      flagship store on Madison Avenue to have a larger retail presence. While the AD Building showroom remains, “it’s a destination for people who know we’re there, not really a retail location,” said Laura Anzani, the chief operating officer of Poliform USA. The Madison Avenue store, which is designed to resemble an extravagant, enormous apartment, “is a big billboard,” Ms. Anzani said. “It’s totally different being on the street. Before the store was even open, people came in and bought things. ” Exquisite Surfaces, a   stone and tile company that was also previously in the AD Building, moved into a   store in Manhattan’s Hudson Square neighborhood last month. The    space includes elements to make shoppers feel at home, like seating areas inspired by residential settings. The British designer Tom Dixon opened an expanded    store in SoHo in July, after establishing his first    American retail store last November. Previously, Mr. Dixon, who produces sculptural copper, brass and chrome light fixtures as well as furniture and tabletop objects, ran a New York showroom for professional designers that was open by appointment only. Perhaps one of the most surprising retail trends is the proliferation of physical stores opened by companies that started out as   enterprises. M. Gemi began last year as a      business selling its own line of     shoes that cost about half as much as similar luxury goods. With shoes ranging from about $150 to $600 per pair, the company describes its prices as “postluxury. ” In September, it opened its first    store in SoHo. “It’s to let her try shoes on, feel the fabric and experience the brand in a tactile way that she can’t experience digitally,” said Ben Fischman, the company’s chief executive and  . There is only minimal inventory in the store the vast majority of purchases are shipped directly to a shopper’s home, just like online purchases. And if shoppers do not want to make a purchase on the spot, store staff can add items to their online shopping carts for later consideration. “We want the   experience to really influence what your digital experience becomes,” Mr. Fischman said. “When she goes home and logs on, sitting there in her cart are the shoes she said she wanted to buy. ” M. Gemi follows in the footsteps of companies like the eyewear brand Warby Parker (whose latest store is due to open inside Grand Central Terminal this month) and the men’s wear brand Bonobos (which opened its fifth New York store in Midtown in September). Both started out as online retailers, but now have an extensive network of physical stores. None of these stores carry inventory. Shoppers can try products on, but then place orders to have purchases delivered. At Bonobos, “It was a really humbling discovery to learn that retail stores were going to be one of the core parts of what was originally conceived as a   brand,” said Andy Dunn, the company’s chief executive, who describes his business as “digitally native. ” After opening fitting rooms at New   Bonobos’s headquarters in 2011, Mr. Dunn said, he was amazed at how they accelerated sales, and hatched the idea of the company’s   guideshops. “The guideshops attract a really   customer,” Mr. Dunn said. “He spends more money, he’s more valuable in the long run, and he’s more engaged with more categories. He’s buying sweaters, suits, dress shirts and outerwear, in addition to our iconic   pants. ” Many new companies are now running with that model. AYR, a women’s fashion brand that Mr. Dunn helped start, opened a showroom on the eighth floor of 648 Broadway in NoHo in June, where customers can drop in or book a      session with friends for $100, which can be used as credit toward purchases. Next year, AYR plans to open a   store. Other digitally driven companies are opening physical stores that do have products in stock. AHA Front in Dumbo, Brooklyn, offers home and personal accessories, including sculptural ceramic vases and angular beer glasses. Pintrill in Williamsburg sells fashionably whimsical pins. And the outerwear brand The Arrivals is running a   shop in SoHo through the end of this month. Paradoxically, the rise of online shopping may just make this one of the most exciting times in recent memory for shoppers to get back out onto city streets.

2670,White House to Be Lit in Blue in Honor of Autism Awareness - Breitbart,"The White House will light up in the color blue Sunday evening in honor of World Autism Awareness Day. [“I invite all Americans to Light it Up Blue, which Melania and I will do at the White House,” President Trump said in an announcement Friday, according to The Hill.  “I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by those with autism spectrum disorders, and to do what they can to support individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families,” he added. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump promised “the late wife of his friend Bob Wright that he would illuminate the White House in blue if he won the election,” according to the Associated Press. Bob Wright and his wife Suzanne, who passed away in 2016, founded the Autism Speaks advocacy group in 2005, which has a blue logo. “Spicer says it’s in honor of the Wrights that the White House on Sunday will help draw attention to a ‘great cause,’” AP reports. “On World Autism Awareness Day, we highlight the importance of addressing the causes and improving the treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),” Trump said.",0
2672,Former Hillary Staffers Launch Campaign to Strip Trump of Twitter Following - Breitbart,"Two former staffers of Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful presidential run have launched a campaign to try and decrease Donald Trump’s sizeable Twitter following and promote progressive organizations instead. [On Sunday evening, Signal Boost, run by former Hillary Clinton staffers Jess McIntosh and Zerlina Maxwel, unveiled a “call to action,” where they encouraged their readers to unfollow both Donald Trump’s Twitter accounts and to instead “follow someone working towards the progress we all still believe in. ”  The newsletter asked people to announce via Twitter who they have chosen to follow instead of Trump, using the hashtag #MuteMonday, and was consequently endorsed by other former Clinton staffers, former Department of Labor Secretary Tom Perez, as well as actress Jamie Lee Curtis.

2673,Obama Unlikely to Vow No First Use of Nuclear Weapons - The New York Times,"President Obama, who has weighed ruling out a first use of a nuclear weapon in a conflict, appears likely to abandon the proposal after top national security advisers argued that it could undermine allies and embolden Russia and China, according to several senior administration officials. Mr. Obama considers a reduction in the role of nuclear weapons as critical to his legacy. But he has been chagrined to hear critics, including some former senior aides, argue that the administration’s   nuclear modernization plans, costing up to $1 trillion in coming decades, undermine commitments he made in 2009. For months, arms control advocates have argued for a series of steps to advance the pledge he made to pursue “a world without nuclear weapons. ” An unequivocal    pledge would have been the boldest of those measures. They contend that as a practical matter no American president would use a nuclear weapon when so many other options are available. Former Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in a recent interview, “It’s the right time,” noting that the pledge would formalize what has been America’s unspoken policy for decades. But in the end, Mr. Obama seems to have sided with his current advisers, who warned in meetings culminating this summer that a    declaration would rattle allies like Japan and South Korea. Those nations are concerned about discussion of an American pullback from Asia prompted by comments made by the Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Secretary of State John Kerry also expressed concern that new moves by Russia and China, from the Baltic to the South China Sea, made it the wrong time to issue the declaration, according to senior aides in the Defense and State Departments. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz, whose department oversees the nuclear arsenal, joined in the objections, administration officials confirmed. The New York Times interviewed more than a   administration officials involved in or briefed on the nuclear debate. All insisted on anonymity to describe internal administration deliberations on nuclear strategy. The United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan at the end of World War II in 1945  —   the only example in history of a first use, or any use, of nuclear weapons in warfare. Almost every president since Harry S. Truman has made it clear that nuclear weapons would be used only as a last resort, so the pledge would have largely ratified unwritten policy. Administration officials confirmed that the question of changing the policy on first use had come up repeatedly this summer as a way for Mr. Obama to show that his commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy  —   and thus the risk of nuclear exchanges  —   was more than rhetorical. But the arguments in front of the president himself were relatively brief, officials said, apparently because so many senior aides objected. Mr. Carter argued that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Kim   the North Korean leader, could interpret a promise of no first use as a sign of American weakness, even though that was not the intent. The defense secretary’s position was supported by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Moniz, two architects of the Iran nuclear deal, who cautioned that such a declaration could unnerve American allies already fearful that America’s nuclear umbrella cannot be relied upon. Mr. Trump talked explicitly in interviews about withdrawing military forces from Asia unless Tokyo and Seoul paid more for their presence, and said in March that he was willing to see them build their own nuclear arsenals rather than depend on Washington. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Kerry told Mr. Obama that a    pledge would also weaken the nuclear deterrent while Russia is running practice bombing runs over Europe and China is expanding its reach in the South China Sea. Mr. Obama and his national security team have rejected a second option: “ ” nuclear missiles ready to fire on short notice. The fear is that in a crisis, “ ” the weapons could escalate a conflict. Earlier, Mr. Obama and his aides also decided against eliminating one element of the “triad” of     and   weapons. The idea was to remove the missiles based in silos across the American West, which are considered outdated and vulnerable to a first strike. But the Pentagon argued strongly that the   missiles were the part of the system with which they had the most assured communications, and that it was too risky to get rid of them. In the past year, arms control advocates, including some of Mr. Obama’s former aides, have argued that Mr. Obama still has time to repair his reputation as an atomic visionary. “Let Obama be Obama,” Andrew C. Weber, an assistant secretary of defense for atomic programs from 2009 to 2014, said in an interview. Mr. Weber strongly opposes the White House’s recent approval of a nuclear cruise missile. “The defense complex is doing a   press, so things are going to be very hard to change,” he said. Mr. Obama’s favorite nuclear strategist in his first term, the retired vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. James E. Cartwright, wrote in a New York Times   article last month with Bruce G. Blair of Princeton University, a former Minuteman launch officer, that “nuclear weapons today no longer serve any purpose beyond deterring the first use of such weapons by our adversaries. ” “Our nonnuclear strength, including economic and diplomatic power, our alliances, our conventional and cyber weaponry and our technological advantages, constitute a global military juggernaut unmatched in history,” they concluded. Mr. Obama made the eventual elimination of nuclear arms a centerpiece of his 2008 presidential campaign. In contrast, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has said little this year about her nuclear plans, and Mr. Trump has argued for a major military buildup. Once Mr. Obama took office, his ambitions were frustrated. While he achieved a major arms control treaty, New Start, in 2010  —   driven through the Senate by Mr. Kerry  —   it came at a price: He won Republican votes by agreeing to a sweeping plan to modernize the American nuclear arsenal and build a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. In 2013, some of Mr. Obama’s former national security officials criticized the plan, saying his original vision was in danger of being turned on its head. The doubters included Philip E. Coyle III and Steve Fetter, who had recently left White House posts. One study estimated the modernization cost at $1 trillion over three decades. The Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, released an analysis showing that Mr. Obama had dismantled fewer nuclear warheads than any other   War president. Inside the White House, Mr. Obama asked for new ideas to advance his agenda before leaving office. In May, he went to Hiroshima  —   the first American president to do so  —   and reaffirmed his vision of a nonnuclear world. “We must have the courage to escape the logic of fear,” he said at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial. “We may not realize this goal in my lifetime. But persistent effort can roll back the possibility of catastrophe. ” Ten days later, Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, outlined possible efforts in a speech to the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington. His list included putting more nuclear material under tight security, reaffirming a global ban on nuclear testing and revisiting the administration’s plans to modernize the nuclear arsenal. It was an agenda sure to please his audience, but one that would largely fall to the next administration to execute. The president, Mr. Rhodes said, “will continue to review these plans as he considers how to hand the baton off to his successor. ” That review included the    pledge. Behind the scenes, Mr. Carter argued that a ban on first use would be unwise. If North Korea used biological weapons against the South, he and other Pentagon officials said, the United States might need the option of threatening a nuclear response. Mr. Kerry argued that Japan would be unnerved by any diminution of the American nuclear umbrella, and perhaps be tempted to obtain their own weapons. The same argument, he said, applied to South Korea. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Carter have not taken public positions in large part because they do not want to appear to influence Mr. Obama as he makes a decision. Had Mr. Obama issued the    declaration, officials conceded, the next president could have rejected it. In an interview this year, Mr. Trump bristled at the idea, saying he would never want to weaken America’s leverage. Mrs. Clinton has not spoken on the issue during her campaign. But a    policy would have been hard for either to undo. Military experts say the next president would hesitate to reverse such a decision since the quick reversal would confuse allies and possibly fray important coalitions.",0
2674,"At Momofuku Nishi, David Chang’s Magic Shows a Little Wear - The New York Times","Searching for money, for love and for food, we strike bargains. We may be content with one for years until we begin to be shadowed by the suspicion that the terms aren’t working out in our favor anymore. That doubt nagged me at Momofuku Nishi, which the chef David Chang opened in Chelsea in January. Early in his career, with Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, Mr. Chang and his customers struck a deal that made decades of dining tradition look obsolete. He and his cooks could make Asian ingredients bend in new directions. The cooking could be gloriously unwholesome or willfully esoteric or stunningly precise, but it was never quite like anything else out there. In return for tasting these new sensations, Mr. Chang’s customers gave up amenities that used to be automatic at restaurants hoping to be taken seriously. When it comes to inflicting discomfort, Nishi still holds up its end of the bargain. You can make reservations, but not for a table, most of which are long and low you’re likely to share yours with strangers. Instead, you reserve a chair, which, strictly speaking, is a seat built like a hard, flat crate. Ssam Bar has similar seating, but the lighting is more seductive and the noise level is less throttling. At Nishi, highly sensitive microphones seem to be placed directly above all the loudest people, picking up and amplifying their every screech. Mr. Chang told the Eater restaurant critic Ryan Sutton in March, when Nishi was two months old, that the acoustics “have to get better. ” Reading that, I stayed away for six weeks, hoping for improvements. When I returned, the only obvious change was that more   tiles had been affixed to the ceiling. If they helped, I couldn’t tell. In a phone interview, Mr. Chang told me he is “going crazy about the sound, but we are working actively to do the best we can. ” Nishi is still as loud as the opening   of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. Temporary soreness of the butt and throat were always potential downsides of a Momofuku meal. Back when we first agreed to the bargain, though, the food was so distractingly original and good that you wouldn’t have minded eating it while leaning up against a Dumpster in an alley sharing your chopsticks with GG Allin. At Nishi, you mind. The strongest dishes are exquisitely controlled plates of cold vegetables or protein that could easily fit into the lineup of a marathon menu at Momofuku Ko, the tasting counter where Nishi’s executive chef, Joshua Pinsky, cooked for more than five years. Shavings of watermelon radishes and raw beef veined with white fat are sprinkled with   dashi and a Spanish olive oil that really stands out. Threads of celery curl around raw mackerel, given a breath of char and bathed in a soy analogue fermented from rye, with a precise flicker of yuzu. Sea scallops dusted with salted, dried kelp rise from a green juice that tastes like cucumbers, peppers and herbs  —   or maybe it’s just wheatgrass? These dishes and others like them are extraordinarily good because the ingredients are allowed to speak quietly. But when the kitchen reaches for the throttle, the results can be muddled or muted. Snails and anchovies seemed to be straining to keep a $55 prime rib from seeming ordinary and slightly dry. Where was the salted crust? Where was the invitation to give in to fleshy temptations held out by Ssam Bar’s rotisserie duck or its pork shoulder? Mackerel was almost perfectly cooked, but nothing about it made me want to come back for more, not the lukewarm daikon hiding under it nor the barbecue sauce spread on top, a blend so complex and balanced it canceled itself out. Allegedly, Nishi is Mr. Chang’s foray into Italy, although that’s not at all apparent until you dip into the noodles. The clams grand Lisboa is, I guess, a twist on spaghetti alle vongole. The fun of it is the way skinny chow mein noodles have been toasted before cooking, so you get some soft strands and some crackly ones in the same bite. Footnotes on the right side of the menu provide cryptic references to source materials. The one for the chitarra points toward the chef Mark Ladner’s pasta with crab meat and jalapeños. That dish is memorable. The Nishi version is not. Mr. Ladner’s bright clarity is replaced with a confusion of dried squid, XO sauce, fermented chiles and chile paste. One time it was spicy but too sweet another time it was less sweet but not spicy enough. The dish everybody talks about is called ceci e pepe, a takeoff on cacio e pepe made with chickpea hozon, a fermented paste made and sold in tiny amounts by Momofuku. Hozon does taste a bit like cheese, but not like the pecorino used in a classic cacio e pepe  —   it’s missing that wild pasture flavor of sheep’s milk. The dish is also missing a few degrees of heat like some of the other noodles, ceci e pepe has a habit of arriving lukewarm. A homage this far off the mark would be fine if the goal were to avoid animal fats, but butter slips around the strands of   bucatini. I don’t know why this dish exists, except to find a use for a proprietary Momofuku product. Too much of the cooking at Nishi is   inward looking and so concerned with technique that you can’t help being conscious of it. In his early days, Mr. Chang served the kind of food chefs like to eat: intense, animalistic, O. K. with messiness, indifferent to prettiness. Nishi serves the kind of food chefs cook to impress one another. As Mr. Chang’s operation has grown into a global concern with branches in Australia and Canada, his restaurants started to offer amenities that were once unimaginable. The cocktails at Nishi, like the margarita with an absinthe rinse, are clever in the right way. There is satisfying range on the wine list, too the nuanced Farrside pinot noir from Australia is a far cry from the sparkling shiraz that was one of the only bottles Ssam Bar carried in its first year. If dinner in Changland now includes intelligent drinking, why can’t it also encompass seating and acoustics that won’t leave your lower back in knots and your eardrums in shreds? When we made our original deal with Momofuku, we were all kinds of swept away by the rush of flavors we had never encountered before. Now that Mr. Chang has a dozen years’ worth of protégés and copycats, now that he even seems to be copying himself, now that the rest of us have cooler heads and other options, it’s time to take another look at that bargain.",0
2676,Columbia Suspends Wrestling Season Over Lewd and Racist Text Messages - The New York Times,"Columbia University’s wrestling team, which bills itself as the nation’s oldest intercollegiate program, has had its season suspended by the university while officials investigate text messages sent by team members that included the frequent use of racist, misogynistic and homophobic terms. On Monday, Columbia released a statement saying that the university’s athletic department “has decided that Columbia wrestlers will not compete until we have a full understanding of the facts on which to base the official response to this disturbing matter. ” A university official confirmed late Monday that the team was still practicing, which raised the possibility that the season would continue once the investigation was completed. Columbia withdrew from a meet on Sunday at Binghamton after the university announced it would have “zero tolerance in its athletics programs for the group messaging and texts sent by several members of the men’s varsity wrestling team,” messages that the university described as “appalling. ” The team’s next meet is scheduled for this Sunday at the New York State championships at Cornell, but Monday’s announcement made it unclear if the team would make the trip. Screengrabs of the texts were first published Thursday by Bwog, an independent,   Columbia news website. The lewd texts were sent over the last three years by wrestling team members through the messaging app GroupMe, Bwog reported. The revelations at Columbia came one week after the Harvard men’s soccer team’s season was canceled after The Harvard Crimson, the university’s student newspaper, reported that players on that team had a history of creating sexually explicit “scouting reports” about members of Harvard’s women’s soccer team. At Columbia, which in recent years has been at the center of a nationwide discussion on how colleges handle sexually aggressive behavior, some students wanted the university to take a similar stance if the accusations against the wrestling team were substantiated. “Seeing that dialogue happening behind closed doors with our classmates and our peers was very, very shocking,” Claire Fry, a Columbia sophomore, said Sunday, adding that she hoped canceling Sunday’s   meet was “a first step and not the end of the discussion. ” On Friday and Saturday, students protested outside the fraternity house of Kappa Delta Rho, which counts wrestlers among its membership. A Change. org petition calling for the expulsion of wrestlers had 875 supporters Monday evening. Other students were planning to spread fliers throughout campus Monday to “protest the culture that permeates Columbia’s men’s athletics teams,” according to the description of a Facebook group. Almost 500 students were listed as interested in or planning to attend the event. Rachel Deal, a junior and Bwog’s editor in chief, said that some athletes in Kappa Delta Rho who were not wrestlers were “really upset with the comments” and “personally hurt” by the language used. “That made me pretty hopeful that it isn’t as much of a culture on other teams,” Deal said. James Fast, a sophomore who is Bwog’s publisher, said he was encouraged by the university’s quick response and its investigation, including its decision Thursday to cancel the wrestling team’s participation in its first match. Deal and Fast said they received the text messages from an anonymous source early last week. They said that Bwog had additional screengrabs that were not published because they contained targeted insults against specific students. “They were sent to us by an anonymous tipster who felt this conversation had no longer become entertainment,” Fast said. The university’s statement last week called the language used in the texts “appalling” and said they were “at odds with the core values of the university, violate team guidelines and have no place in our community. ” Columbia’s wrestling coach, Zach Tanelli, and Peter Pilling, the university’s athletic director, have not been made available for interviews. Columbia and Harvard are not the only universities dealing with the exchange of controversial messages in what members thought were private group chats. Last week, black students at the University of Pennsylvania were unknowingly added to a GroupMe chat where racial slurs and lynching images proliferated. It led to an F. B. I. investigation, and a student at the University of Oklahoma was suspended for being involved in the chat.",0
2677,"Mexico, Syria, Trump: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump issued new guidelines to rescind   protections for transgender students, overruling his education secretary, who had pushed to keep them in place. The issue caused a cabinet rift between Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. Mr. Sessions was adamant that the administration move quickly to reverse an order from the Obama administration that allowed transgender students to use the restroom of their gender identity. Ms. DeVos, faced with the choice of resigning or defying the president, dropped her objections, according to insiders. _____ 2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is en route to Mexico, accompanied by John Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, for talks with Mexican officials on trade, security, aid and migration. The meetings are not expected to be pleasant, as Mexico reels from the announcement, a day earlier, of Mr. Trump’s tough new immigration policies. Today’s episode of our podcast, The Daily, focuses on the new immigration policies. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 3. Most of the activists protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline left their longtime encampment under orders from the state. Some lit fires as they departed. A handful remained and there were several arrests by nightfall. The protesters had been camped out near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota for months, calling for a halt to construction of the nearly completed pipeline. They say it will imperil the water supply. Construction resumed this month with Mr. Trump’s backing, and barring court intervention, oil could be flowing through the pipeline by this spring. _____ 4. We unearthed a lawsuit that reveals an A. T. F. operation that existed on a murky frontier  —   between investigating smuggling and being complicit in it. Records and interviews show that agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who were fighting cigarette smuggling filled a secret bank account with millions from their own    operation  —   which revolved around cigarette sales. Tobacco farmers who say they were swindled out of $24 million filed a lawsuit that has been kept nearly entirely sealed for years. _____ 5. The U. S. commander for the Middle East said more American troops would speed the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. In recent weeks, the Iraqi government recaptured the eastern part of Mosul, a major victory against the Islamic State in Iraq. A New York Times reporter describes a city torn in half. Military figures carry a great deal of weight in the Trump administration, with veterans in the top three security jobs, all from a generation of leaders from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. _____ 6. The Supreme Court ruled for the defendant in a Texas death penalty case because of testimony laced with “a particularly noxious strain of racial prejudice. ” The court required a new sentencing for the defendant, Duane Buck, who was convicted of the murder of a former girlfriend and one of her friends. The testimony came from a psychologist who said black defendants were more dangerous than white ones. _____ 7. The president of Iceland ignited an international debate with a joke about pineapple on pizza. Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson, above right, was visiting a high school when he joked that the topping should be outlawed. Internet outrage ensued, and it reached such proportions that the president issued a statement on Facebook.

Secretary Clinton’s leadership on Libya 
HRC has been a critical voice on Libya in administration deliberations, at NATO, and in contact group meetings — as well as the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya. She was instrumental in securing the authorization, building the coalition, and tightening the noose around Qadhafi and his regime. 
February 25 — HRC announces the suspension of operations of the Libyan embassy in Washington. 
February 26 — HRC directs efforts to evacuate all U.S. embassy personnel from Tripoli and orders the closing of the embassy.

February 28 — HRC travels to Geneva, Switzerland for consultations with European partners on Libya. She gives a major address in which she says: “Colonel Qadhafi and those around him must be held accountable for these acts, which violate international legal obligations and common decency. Through their actions, they have lost the legitimacy to govern. And the people of Libya have made themselves clear: It is time for Qadhafi to go — now, without further violence or delay.” She also works to secure the suspension of Libya from membership in the Human Rights Council. 
Early March — HRC appoints Special Envoy Chris Stevens to be the U.S. representative to Benghazi

She is instrumental in setting up a rotating chair system to ensure regional buy-in. 
April 14 — HRC travels to Berlin for NATO meetings. She is the driving force behind NATO adopting a communiqué that calls for Qadhafi’s departure as a political objective, and lays out three clear military objectives: end of attacks and threat of attacks on civilians; the removal of Qadhafi forces from cities they forcibly entered; and the unfettered provision of humanitarian access.

2679,5 minute video: Clinton Foundation 10% to charity scam + OBVIOUS election fraud + lying US military into illegal empire wars = White Hat insider lawful revolution for justice?,"Bill Still’s 5-minute report : 
No colleague I know of, nor I, have objectively verifiable factual information on a possible “white hat” recapture of lawful government. That said, what is easy to document and prove: When Americans are told an election is defined by touching a computer screen without a countable receipt that can be verified, they are being told a criminal lie to allow election fraud . This is self-evident, but Princeton , Stanford , and the President of the American Statistical Association are among the leaders pointing to the obvious (and here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here ). Again, no professional would/can argue an election is legitimate when there is nothing for anyone to count. President Kennedy , Martin King , Robert Kennedy (and here ), and dozens of others were assassinated by the .01% “Deep State.” The evidence is overwhelming in each case. The US is a literal rogue state empire led by neocolonial looting liars. The history is uncontested and taught to anyone taking comprehensive courses. If anyone has any refutations of this professional academic factual claim for any of this easy-to-read and documented content , please provide it. US ongoing lie-started and Orwellian-illegal Wars of Aggression require all US military and government to refuse all war orders because there are no lawful orders for obviously unlawful wars. Officers are required to arrest those who issue obviously unlawful orders. And again, those of us working for this area of justice are aware of zero attempts to refute this with, “War law states (a, b, c), so the wars are legal because (d, e, f).” All we receive is easy-to-reveal bullshit . And, duh, corporate media are criminally complicit through constant lies of omission and commission to “cover” all these crimes. Historic tragic-comic empire is only possible through such straight-face lying, making our Emperor’s New Clothes analogy perfectly chosen. The top three benefits each of monetary reform and public banking total ~$1,000,000 for the average American household, and would be received nearly instantly. Please read that twice. Now look to verify for yourself . More on the $2 billion Clinton Foundation giving just 10% of their money to charity. The categories of crime include: Wars of Aggression (the worst crime a nation can commit). Likely treason for lying to US military, ordering unlawful attack and invasions of foreign lands, and causing thousands of US military deaths. Crimes Against Humanity for ongoing intentional policy of poverty that’s killed over 400 million human beings just since 1995 (~75% children; more deaths than from all wars in Earth’s recorded history). 
US military, law enforcement, and all with Oaths to support and defend the US Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, face an endgame choice: Demand arrests , with those with lawful authority to enact it. An arrest is the lawful action to stop apparent crimes , with the most serious crimes documented here meaning the most serious need for arrests. Watch the US escalate its rogue state crimes that annually kill millions, harm billions, and loot trillions. 
In just 90 seconds , former US Marine Ken O’Keefe powerfully states how you may choose to voice “very obvious solutions”: arrest the criminal leaders (video starts at 20:51, then finishes this episode of Cross Talk ): Solutions worth literal tens of trillions to ‘We the People’: 
Again: The top three benefits each of monetary reform and public banking total ~$1,000,000 for the average American household, and would be received nearly instantly. Please read that twice. Now look to verify for yourself . We can quantify the end of the lie-started and illegal Wars of Aggression quickly into the trillions, and that said, it’s worth a lot more than what we quantify. Truth : a world in which education is expressed in its full potential to only and always begin with good-faith effort for objective, comprehensive, and verifiable data.

If Mr.Trump is elected president, he must purge the federal government of the militarists who have usurped the federal republic in the “soft coup d’etat” that was perpetrated by them on September 11, 2001. He must be aggressive, firm, and not deterred by any rancor that may rise from legal challenges, the corporate media, civil rights groups and foreign State lobbyists who have a vested interest in the neoconservative polity. He must do what Recep Erdogan did in Turkey but on a larger scale, with the panache that only the “Donald” can pull off, American style. He must charge them all with endangering the national and economic security of the United States. 
He must open a federal investigation of the coverup of the 9/11 commission perpetrated by the Clinton and Bush (Bush 41 and Bush 43) regimes and restore the U.S.Department of Justice’s reputation as the standard bearer for equal justice under the rule of law. No person is exempt, not a member of the U.S. Congress former or incumbent, member of the United States Military active or retired, Wall Street financier, corporate CEO including the national media or lobbyists for a foreign State. The pursuit of these persons will be ongoing, thorough, and not be restricted by any statute of limitations. 
All the illegal wars in foreign lands made in the name of the American people will be reconciled by trial and recompense made to the victims from the assets confiscated by all the accused and their conspirators who are found guilty.

2680,Tim Tebow Homers in First At-Bat (and Finishes 1 for 6) - The New York Times,"Tim Tebow stepped to the plate Wednesday for his first   as a professional baseball player and took a swing at the first pitch he saw. Naturally, he hit a home run. Tebow is a polarizing figure in the sports world. As a Heisman Trophy winner while at the University of Florida and, briefly, as an N. F. L. quarterback, he attracted both adulation and scorn for his overt Christian faith and his habit of Tebowing, or bowing in prayer after successes. On the field, some saw a quarterback with anemic passing statistics while others saw a player who always seemed to find a way to win. He faced considerable skepticism when, with his football days seemingly over, he announced plans to try for a baseball career at age 29. He had not played the game since high school. Still, scouts from 28 teams attended an open workout, and the Mets saw enough to sign Tebow to a minor league contract and send him to the Florida Instructional League. Game No. 1 came Wednesday against the St. Louis Cardinals’ team in front of about 250 fans in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Tebow batted second and played left field. His first   ended in seconds with the homer to  . The pitcher was John Kilichowski, drafted out of Vanderbilt by the Cardinals in the 11th round in June. He posted a 2. 70 E. R. A. in Class A with the Peoria Chiefs and the State College Spikes this past season, giving up four home runs in 11 games. Tebow’s teammates rushed out to greet him at home plate after the   bash. At that point, his career stats looked like this: batting average 1. 000,   average 1. 000, slugging average 4. 000. And let’s make up a stat. Ratio of pitches seen to home runs delivered: 1:1. Barry Bonds? Babe Ruth? Tim Tebow was surpassing them all, and making the skeptics look pretty foolish. In his second   Tebow grounded into a double play, dropping his batting average to a merely superhuman . 500. Then he was 1 for 3, and 1 for 4, and he finished the day 1 for 6.",0
2681,What Does it Mean to be an American Liberal Today?,"B y Danny Haiphong Originally posted on 06/07/2016 L iberalism is “an ideology rooted in a nation founded upon imperial conquest and rabid capitalist exploitation.” Its main proponent in is the Democratic Party, which “has become the engine of US imperial rule.” Hillary Clinton is a twin of Barack Obama. “While Obama intensified imperial war, austerity, and domestic repression, liberal supporters sat on the sidelines and watched.” Liberals wage fake wars on Republicans and real wars on the world. It’s no wonder that the complacent liberals and liberal media, despite the pious posturing, did not stop any of the big postwar crimes of subversion and intervention, such as Korea, Vietnam, Iran, Chile, Guatemala and many others. “An American liberal is the arbiter of a more effective politics of exploitation and oppression.” If anything, the 2016 elections have exposed the steep descent into bankruptcy of liberal politics in the US. The concluding years of the 1970s began a right-wing, authoritarian process in the US that grew from the roots of a capitalist economic base in decline. Historians and left academics framed this process not as a sign of decline but as a right-wing backlash. The term neo-liberalism was created to describe the backlash. However, “neo-liberalism” was less new than it was an exposure of what has always been true about American liberalism. American liberalism has always been an ideology created by and for the interests of the American capitalist empire, regardless of the period. 
A house of concentrated infamy, for the most part the world’s foremost assembly point for crooks and outright criminals. To be a liberal in America has meant being a participant in the highest form of opportunism. Liberals have historically championed the freedoms of American capitalist society and defended developments like the enslavement of Africans as a necessary evil. Once these evils become unmanageable, liberals jump ship and look to support more palatable forms of exploitation. For example, during the Civil War, many American liberals did not oppose slavery. It wasn’t until the combined force of African rebellion and industrial capitalist development dug the slave-ocracy’s grave that many liberals warmed to the idea of abolition. “It was the bankrupt liberal leadership of the labor movement that collaborated with President Roosevelt to “stabilize” capitalism.” During the Great Depression, US capitalism was on the verge of collapse. A recovery in the system seemed nowhere in sight. Socialists played a key role in organizing unions across industries to strengthen the position of the working class in this time of crisis. It was the bankrupt liberal leadership of the labor movement that collaborated with President Roosevelt to “stabilize” capitalism. This leadership proceeded to settle for legislative gains and purge socialist elements. And so began the labor movement’s descent into the back pockets of the Democratic Party. American liberalism has thus historically been able to fester and thrive in the US political landscape in periods of reforms in the capitalist order. The transition from chattel slavery to industrial capital, and subsequently from industrial capital to the so-called age of social welfare, gave American liberals political space to adjust their bourgeois principles to fit the needs of the time. In the current period of capitalist decline, this is no longer possible. The rule of capital has reached its highest stage and it must eliminate all that stands in its way of unfettered profit accumulation. This period of capitalism has stripped liberalism naked of its supposedly “progressive” veneer. US capitalism has no room for welfare politics. The system’s rate of profit is falling and its corporate debt is mounting. Finance capital has speculated the economic base of US society into a hole it cannot crawl out of. It is under these conditions that liberalism has revealed itself for what it really is: an ideology rooted in a nation founded upon imperial conquest and rabid capitalist exploitation. “Finance capital has speculated the economic base of US society into a hole it cannot crawl out of.” I n the US, the home base for liberal politics resides historically in the Democratic Party. During the height of anti-communist hysteria and Black liberation insurgency in the mid 20th century, the Democratic Party was compelled to promote itself as a force of progress. To this day, the Democratic Party takes credit for Civil Rights reforms and anti-poverty programs that were pressured into existence by grassroots movements. However, the wheels of reform have reversed. No longer able to deceive the masses with crumbs, the Democratic Party has become the engine of US imperial rule. Liberals have been instrumental in this political shift. The Obama era has been the quintessential example of what liberal bankruptcy looks like in the age of neo-liberal, capitalist decline. While Obama intensified imperial war, austerity, and domestic repression, liberal supporters sat on the sidelines and watched. In some cases, liberal forces cheered on Obama’s policies (like the intervention in Libya) and decried Republican “obstructionism” as the primary reason for why social conditions continued to worsen under his rule. Yet these same liberals refused to acknowledge that it was Obama who sidestepped a Democratic Party majority in the House and Senate in 2009 and 2010 to push through the corporate Affordable Care Act and dash any hopes of universal healthcare being instituted in the US in the near future. “While Sanders is no revolutionary force, his brand of liberalism is now outmoded by the world capitalist system that he sought to manage.” The case of Bernie Sanders in particular and the 2016 elections have broadly exposed the Democratic Party and its bourgeois liberal base for the agents of Empire they’ve always been. Hillary Clinton and her supporters have tirelessly attacked Sanders throughout the duration of his campaign. The reason for the attacks is simple. While Sanders is no revolutionary force, his brand of liberalism is now outmoded by the world capitalist system that he seeks to manage. Finance capital cannot back a candidate that calls for universal healthcare, affordable public university, or higher taxation of the rich. These policy proposals run in contradistinction to neo-liberal capital’s need to turn everything into a profitable market to ensure its survival. When one asks what an American liberal is today, it is important to be honest. An American liberal is the arbiter of a more effective politics of exploitation and oppression. The American liberal supports the Democratic Party by waging a fake war with the Republicans while the entire establishment moves ever more rightward. The American liberal is no less an enemy of social progress than the right-wing, Republican oriented populace. The American liberal must be combated or its ideological stranglehold over emergent movements now and in the future will continue to lead them astray. APPENDIX The U.S. liberal – the real greater evil. Liberalism: the hard and soft sides of the coinage of social control Submitted by Orwellian Ghost on Thu, 06/09/2016 E xplaining liberalism to North Americans is a thankless and possibly futile task, but it is one that must be attempted for clarity’s sake. Liberalism is a theory of political economy that arose in Great Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its principal inspirations were Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and John Locke (1632-1704). It emphasizes individualism, human avarice, the “virtue” of competition and the “justice” of the marketplace. It opposed feudalism and mercantilism. It sought to replace the traditional landowners with the rising commercial and manufacturing classes. It sought to liberate capital, not people (and especially not women, slaves and propertyless males). Liberalism is the foundational ideology of the United States. American Conservatives (aka Tories or Loyalists) were expelled to Canada, the Caribbean or sent back to England. The USA (a few southerners excepted – until the Civil War) began, and remains a homogenously liberal society. What, exactly, is liberalism? Here’s what classical liberal economist Adam Smith (1723-1790) said: “Whenever there is great property, there is great inequality. For one very rich man, there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the rich supposes the indigence of the many, who are often driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. … Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.” Liberal utilitarian Jeremy Benthan (1748-1832) added this: “In the highest state of social prosperity, the great mass of citizens will have no resource except their daily industry; and consequently will always be near indigence … uman beings are the most powerful instruments of production, and therefore everyone becomes anxious to employ the services of his fellows in multiplying his own comforts. Hence the intense and universal thirst for power; the equally prevalent hatred of subjugation. … When security and conflict are in conflict, it will not do to hesitate a moment. Equality must yield.” This means that, in liberal societies, the rich are pitted against the poor, gaining their wealth by appropriating the work of others; and it means that government is in “business” to protect the ruling class. Today, of course, there are two kinds of liberals. Soft-hearted liberals live mainly in the Democratic party. They sometimes toss crumbs to working and middle class people. In a pinch, they will do bad things reluctantly, but they will do bad things nonetheless, to protect the ruling class. Hard-hearted liberals live mainly in the Republican party. They do bad things gleefully, and never toss crumbs. They try to get racists and religious fundamentalists worked into a frenzy to oppose soft-hearted liberals, to protect the ruling class. They are the good cops and the bad cops, the soft and hard sides of the coinage of social control.

2682,DNC Renews Lawsuit Against RNC Over Voter Intimidation (VIDEO),"DNC Renews Lawsuit Against RNC Over Voter Intimidation (VIDEO) By Lisa Bonanno on October 29, 2016 
According to a document filed in federal court this past Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee is taking Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee to task over their plans to “monitor” the polls. 
The filing says that the RNC is violating a consent decree by: “… Supporting and enabling the efforts of the Republican candidate for President, Donald J. Trump, as well as his campaign and advisors, to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the 2016 Presidential Election. Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ‘rigged’ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ‘certain areas’ or ‘certain sections’ of key states. Unsurprisingly, those ‘certain areas’ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.” 
The document goes on to name some of the specific quotes and directives that Donald Trump has given supporters. It also mentions that: “Following the third presidential debate, Trump’s campaign manager told a reporter that the campaign was working to combat purported voter fraud by ‘actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.'” 
This shows that the RNC is involved in this effort, which has already begun . Trump ally Roger Stone organized “Vote Protectors,” who are instructed to conduct “exit polls.” Initially, the volunteers were asked to upload video of voters, create ID badges and wear red shirts at specific polling places. After journalistic inquiry , Stone said he would change his tactics. He simply created a new website, but that’s another story. 
The Democratic National Committee is going after Trump and the RNC for violation of a consent decree signed in 1982. At that time, the RNC was involved in voter suppression in targeted areas known to vote predominantly Democrat. They hired off-duty sheriffs and police officers to go to polling places in those areas displaying a sign stating “This area is being patrolled by the National Ballot Security Task Force.” There were other activities, such as the challenge of individual voter registrations in certain communities. 
The consent decree forcing the RNC to cease its 1982 “ballot security” activities resulted from a successful DNC suit. The decree expires next year. In the current suit, the DNC seeks to renew it for another eight years. 
34 years later, we have an old tactic re-branded by the same party to do the same thing: intimidate minority voters. The DNC opens fire against RNC voter intimidation tactics

2683,As American as Apple Pie? The Rural Vote’s Disproportionate Slice of Power - The New York Times,"In 1920, for the first time, the Census Bureau counted more people living in urbanized America than in the countryside. This hasn’t been a rural nation ever since. Yet the idea of Thomas Jefferson’s agrarian America has receded slowly despite demographic change. We still romanticize the family farm, though relatively few of them exist anymore. We view even suburbia in pastoral terms  —   the “crabgrass frontier,” as the historian Kenneth T. Jackson put it. And, as the recent Electoral College results make clear, we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly   bias, by design. The Democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections. But in part because the system empowers rural states, for the second time in that span, the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president. Rural America, even as it laments its economic weakness, retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength. Rural voters were able to nudge Donald J. Trump to power despite Hillary Clinton’s large margins in cities like New York. In a House of Representatives that structurally disadvantages Democrats because of their tight urban clustering, rural voters helped Republicans hold their cushion. In the Senate, the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before. And the growing unity of rural Americans as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent Republican advantage. “If you’re talking about a political system that skews rural, that’s not as important if there isn’t a major cleavage between rural and urban voting behavior,” said Frances Lee, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland. “But urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power. “And it’s not just in terms of policy outcomes,” she continued. “This pervasively advantages Republicans in maintaining control of the U. S. national government. ” The Electoral College is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past. Today, states containing just 17 percent of the American population, a historic low, can theoretically elect a Senate majority, Dr. Lee said. The bias also shapes the House of Representatives. It exists, as a result, in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets Homeland Security dollars. It exists in state capitols, where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to  be rejected. Today, the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who should have power in America. Jefferson and James Madison argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil. “They had this vision of what they called the ‘yeoman farmer’: this independent,   person who owed nothing to anybody, who didn’t receive any payments from the government, who didn’t live by a wage, but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed  —   and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of democracy,” said Gerald Gamm, a political scientist at the University of Rochester, describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this year’s election. When the framers of the Constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have today, 95 percent of America was rural, as the 1790 census classified the population. The Connecticut Compromise at the time created the Senate: one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the House, where more populous states spoke louder. And they made sure the compromise stuck. Today, equal state representation in the Senate is the only provision in the Constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment process no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission. But even as a deliberately undemocratic body, the Senate has slipped further out of alignment with the American population over time. The Senate hasn’t simply favored sparsely populated states politicians in Washington created sparsely populated states to leverage the Senate’s skewed power. “When we talk about   bias, all of that was an intentional policy choice,” said Jowei Chen, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. Republicans in Congress passed the 1862 Homestead Act, offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states  —   creating more Senate seats and Electoral College votes for a Republican Party eager to keep government control away from Southern Democrats. They even managed to divide the Dakota Territory into two states, worth twice the political power. As the Plains later depopulated and American cities, then suburbs, swelled, the Senate became even more unrepresentative. Jeffersonian suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state capitals: Albany and not New York Jefferson City and not St. Louis Springfield and not Chicago. Political scientists at the University of California, Davis, have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state  —   typically closer to the geographical center of the state, and not the place where the most people already lived, breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals. The state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as America urbanized. In 1961, when lawyers in Tennessee brought what would be a seminal case before the Supreme Court challenging the practice, the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in 60 years. Maryland was still using districts drawn in 1867. Even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them. Florida, Georgia and New Mexico gave small counties 100 times the voting power of the most populous ones. Decades ago in California, Amador County (population 14, 294) had the same representation in the state’s Senate as Los Angeles County (with a population over six million). “They justified it because that was a cultural norm it was just the way things were,” said Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard professor of government. Rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them. “They just let it keep getting worse. You’re in power. Why change?” By the   century, no state approximated majority rule. America at the time, Dr. Ansolabehere and James M. Snyder Jr. wrote in their book “The End of Inequality,” had some of the most unequal representation in the world. A series of Supreme Court cases beginning with that Tennessee complaint upended this system and established the standard that equal representation means “one person, one vote. ” Not one town, one vote. Or one county, one senator. Only the United States Senate, protected by the Constitution, remained unchanged. Still, the House retains a rural bias. Republican voters are more efficiently distributed across the country than Democrats, who are concentrated in cities. That means that even when Democrats win 50 percent of voters nationwide, they invariably hold fewer than 50 percent of House seats, regardless of partisan gerrymandering. The Electoral College then allocates votes according to a state’s congressional delegation: Wyoming (with one House representative and two senators) gets three votes California (53 representatives and two senators) gets 55. Those two senators effectively give Wyoming three times more power in the Electoral College than its population would suggest. Apply the same math to California and it would have 159 Electoral College votes. And the entire state of Wyoming already has fewer residents than the average California congressional district. In Washington, these imbalances directly influence who gets what, through   minimums (no state can receive below a certain share of education funding) and through formulas that privilege rural states (early road spending was doled out in part by land area and not road use). There are policy reasons that the country might want to disproportionately spend resources on places with few people. Repairing an interstate highway in rural Oklahoma keeps national commerce flowing. And when the private market won’t build essential infrastructure, public investments like the New Deal’s rural electrification help fight poverty. But even when you control for policy need, Dr. Lee’s research has found that a significant rural bias in resources persists. You can see it in Homeland Security funding that gave Wyoming, for example, seven times as much money per capita as New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. You can see it in Alaska’s proposed “bridge to nowhere. ” “In that case,” Dr. Ansolabehere said, “Alaska has so much disproportionate power in the negotiation over funds that in order for California to get some, Alaska gets a lot  —   to the point of not knowing what to spend the money on. ” These calculations also mean that populous states subsidize less populous ones, which receive more resources than the tax dollars they send to Washington. The challenge for rural voters now is that their electoral strength, and even these funding formulas, have not translated into policies that have fixed the deep economic problems they face, from high unemployment to declining wages. And it’s unclear how Mr. Trump will do that for them, either  —   even if his major infrastructure proposal comes to pass and helps rebuild their roads. If he can’t, rural voters may stray from his party again. In that future, the rural bias in American politics would persist. But Democrats might yet have a chance to blunt its effects.",0

2687,FBI SHOCKER: Hillary’s WEINER Database Exposed As More MASSIVE Than We Thought,"The FBI found something, but no one had any idea it would be THIS BIG! Huma Abedin clearly never knew what Anthony Weiner had been up to on his electronic devices. That, perhaps, is the understatement of 2016. Allegedly, he was sexting countless women, some of them underage. Some of the pictures that he sent to other women were selfies that revealed his family life. The revelations are disturbing and merit investigations of their own. Given the bizarre nature of Anthony Weiner’s digital habits, who would have ever dreamed that the 2016 Presidential Election would be rocked by the far out notion of critical governmental information on a pervert’s device. No wonder Huma was seen crying on Hillary’s airplane. Huma Abedin, reportedly, says that she has no idea how the emails ended up on her estranged husband’s devices. Could Huma, and her boss, Hillary, be setting Anthony Weiner as a scapegoat? It sounds like something they might do. Perhaps more shocking is the massive amount of emails found on Weiner’s laptop. According to The Washington Post, FIVE DIGITS worth of emails are being researched. That indicates a minimum of 10,000 messages that could implicate Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton, and their new best friend, Anthony Weiner. Oddly enough, Abedin was not a regular user of the device in question. Perhaps the messages were moved there as part of a backup process? Maybe Huma did not have her device family sharing settings configured properly. At this time, Officials do not believe that any of the messages are duplicates. The FBI will certainly use programs designed to “dedup” or weed out duplicates. Any email messages that remain will be examined to determine criminality. Is this new investigation enough to bring down the person who many believe is on course to be the first female President of the United States of America? The irony of a female Presidential candidate being investigated because of a pervert male former Congressman is not lost on me.",0

When asked if President Trump should fire Mueller Gingrich said, “I don’t think Trump should do anything, but the congressional Republicans ought to look into this. Mueller first four hires were all Democrats. One of them had worked for the Clinton Foundation, one of them had in two cases deliberately hid evidence from the defense, one of which was repudiated by   by the Supreme Court. These are bad people. ” Stephanopoulos said, “Bad people?” Gingrich added, “Bad people.

2689,Ann Coulter: All We Need Is Love ... and Deportations - Breitbart,"In Britain, as in the U. S. when an Islamic terrorist is said to be, “known to law enforcement,” the translation is: “He is being actively ignored by law enforcement. ”[After the latest terrorist attack in Britain  —   at least as of this writing  —   Prime Minister Theresa May bravely announced, “Enough is enough!”  What is the point of these macho proclamations after every terrorist attack? Nothing will be done to stop the next attack. Political correctness prohibits us from doing anything that might stop it. Poland doesn’t admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. Japan doesn’t admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. The United Kingdom and the United States used to have very few Muslims: They used to have almost no terrorism. (One notable exception was chosen as the National Freedom Hero in this year’s Puerto Rican parade in New York!) Notwithstanding the lovely Muslim shopkeeper who wouldn’t hurt a fly, everyone knows that with every tranche of   Muslims we bring in, we’re also getting some number of   killers. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair dumped millions of Third World Muslims on Britain to force “multiculturalism” on the country. Now Britons are living with the result. Since the   attack, every U. S. president has done the same. President Bush admitted Muslim immigrants at a faster pace after   than we had been doing before  . Whatever the   attackers intended to accomplish, I bet they didn’t expect that. Now we can’t get rid of them. Under the rules of political correctness, Western countries are prohibited from even pausing our breakneck importation of Muslims, much less sending the recent arrivals home. In defense of the poor saps responding to every terrorist attack with flowers, candles and hashtags, these are people who have no ability to do anything else. Western leaders are in full possession of the tools to end Islamic terrorism in their own countries, just as their forebears once ended Nazi Stormtroopers. Unable to summon the backbone to defeat the current enemy, the West is stuck constantly reliving that glorious time when they whipped the Nazis. In almost every Western country  —   except the one with an increasingly beleaguered First Amendment  —   it’s against the law to deny the Holocaust. Are we really worried about a resurgence of Nazism? Isn’t Islamic terrorism a little higher on our “immediate problems” list? How about making it illegal to make statements in support of ISIS,   female genital mutilation, Sharia law or any act of terrorism? The country with a First Amendment can’t do that  —   the most that amendment allows us to do is ban conservative speakers from every college campus in the nation. But if our elected representatives really cared about stopping the next terrorist attack, instead of merely “watching” those on the “watch” list, they’d deport them. To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews. But we can’t manage to deport hearty young Muslims who post love notes to ISIS on their Facebook pages. If the Clinton administration had merely enforced laws on the books against an Afghani immigrant, Mir Seddique Mateen, and excluded him based on his   list of terrorist affiliations, his son Omar wouldn’t have been around to slaughter 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year. If Secretary of State John Kerry, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson or anyone else in our vaunted immigration vetting system had done his job, Pakistani Tashfeen Malik never would have been admitted to this country to commit mass murder in San Bernardino a year after she arrived. Before being warmly welcomed by the U. S. Malik’s social media posts were bristling with hatred of America and enthusiasm for jihad. We’re already paying a battery of FBI agents to follow every Muslim refugee around the country. When they find out that one of them lists his hobby as “jihad,” we need them to stop watching and start deporting. Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the rest of the useless GOP  —   and obviously every Democrat  —   have the blood of the next terrorist attack on their hands if they don’t make crystal clear that admiring remarks about Islamic terrorism is a deportable act. But they won’t do it. That’s “not who we are,” as Ryan famously said. True, most Muslims are peaceful. Guess what? Most Nazis were peaceful! We didn’t knock ourselves out to admit as many of them as we could, screening out only the Nazis convicted of mass murder. Before we were even formally involved in World War II, the FBI was all over the German American Bund. No one worried about upsetting our German neighbors. (Perhaps because they knew these were Germans and wouldn’t start bombing things and shooting people.) But today, our official position is: Let’s choose love so as not to scare our Muslim neighbors. Isn’t that precisely what we want to do? Facing an immobile government, two British men  —   by which I mean British men  —   were sentenced to PRISON for putting bacon on a mosque in Bristol last year. One died in prison just after Christmas, an ancient religious holiday recently replaced by Ramadan. If we can’t look askance at Muslims without committing a hate crime, can’t we at least stop admitting ever more “refugees,” some percentage of whom are going to be terrorists and 100 percent of whom will consume massive amounts of government resources? No, that’s “not who we are. ” Until any Western leader is willing to reduce the number of Muslims in our midst, could they spare us the big talk? “We surrender” would at least have the virtue of honesty.",0
2690,Report: Ben Affleck’s ’Live By Night’ a $75M Bomb for Warner Bros,"Warner Bros. is expected to take a $75 million bath on Ben Affleck’s pricey gangster drama Live By Night, according to a report. [Sources close to the film and rival studio executives told Variety that the film  —   a passion project for Affleck, who wrote, produced, starred in and directed  —  was shaping up to be a bona fide box office bomb for Warners after bad reviews and poor box office crippled the film’s financial prospects.  According to Box Office Mojo, the film has grossed a paltry $10 million in the United States and another $6. 5 million in international receipts since its wide release on January 13, a disappointing result for a film that reportedly cost $65 million to produce, not counting the studio’s marketing and distribution costs. The film couldn’t crack the Top 10 in its opening weekend, opening to just $5. 1 million from 2, 822 theaters for a   average of $1, 809. Live By Night  —   based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane  —   stars Affleck as   gangster Joe Coughlin, who spars with bootleggers and Ku Klux Klan members in 1920s Florida. The film also stars Elle Fanning, Sienna Miller, Brendan Gleeson, Chris Messina, Zoe Saldana and Chris Cooper. Variety reports that Warner Bros. is shielded from some part of its financial liability on the film through its partnership with   Entertainment. Live By Night was Affleck’s directorial   to his 2012 smash hit Argo, which won the Best Picture Oscar. The   is next set to helm a standalone Batman film, tentatively titled The Batman. Affleck played the character in Warner Bros. Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and will reprise the role in this year’s Justice League.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
2691,Vladimir Putin Is Ready To Restore Relations With The US,"Share on Facebook Russia is ready and looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, commenting on the news of Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. “We heard [Trump's] campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States,” President Putin said, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors' letters of credentials in Moscow. “We understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment,” he added. Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the president once again stressed that “it is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.” Earlier today, in a message to Donald Trump the Russian President expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other's views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some “burning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,” RIA Novosti reported. On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that “building a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other's positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.” Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump's victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington. “The current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,” he said. “The Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,” Volodin added on Wednesday. Commenting on Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia will judge the new US administration by its actions and take appropriate steps in response. “We are ready to work with any US leader elected by the US people,” the minister said on Wednesday. “I can't say that all the previous US leaders were always predictable. This is life, this is politics. I have heard many words but we will judge by actions.” According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia's relations with the US “was not our choice,” however. For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia's interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. The US will have to negotiate with Russia on finding solutions to international issues as no state is now able to act alone, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week, adding that problems in bilateral relations began to mount long before the Ukrainian crisis broke out in 2014.

2692,Candace Cameron Bure Dishes on the Main Conservative Issue Driving Her to the Polls,"Getty - Tibrina Hobson 
Candace Cameron Bure has never been shy about voicing her opinions on social and political issues — a trait that has made her an exceptionally good fit at ABC's “The View,” as she stood out in contrast to the decidedly liberal viewpoints of many of her co-hosts. 
But aside from praying (with Whoopi, no less) for the election cycle to be over soon: A video posted by Candace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure) on Oct 26, 2016 at 9:35am PDT 
Bure has kept her 2016 voting plans under her hat, noting earlier this summer that although she wasn't exactly thrilled with the remaining choices, she absolutely planned to vote: 
""I've talked about how conflicted I am. I'm not happy with the ultimate choices that we're left with, but I'm still going to go out there and vote because I do believe that it's my right. And I think there are other things we have to consider. 
And then there's the congressional power. There's also the seats in Congress. And I think a lot of people who don't show up to vote for the president then forget that there's all these other people we get to vote into Congress. So you're giving up so much just because you don't like the candidate choices."" 
She did reveal the issue that has her most concerned this election cycle , however, in a recent podcast with “The Church Boys”: 
""The biggest thing for me is the Supreme Court justices… because, no matter who wins this election, it’s four years, maybe eight, if they’re reelected, but that’s the maximum. 
The Supreme Court justice seats will be until those people die — and that could be a very long time."" 
A number of Americans share Bure's concern, noting the age of several sitting justices. 
According to ballotpedia , with the increasing likelihood that Justice Scalia's seat will remain empty into the next president's term, the next president could potentially appoint four justices: 
“The average age at which a Supreme Court justice retires is 78.7 years old. Justice Kennedy will be 80 when the next president takes office, Justice Ginsburg will be 83, and Justice Breyer will be 78.” 
Bure explained her concern by noting that she has spent time recently studying the “bigger picture” and the principles outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution: 
“If we get too far away from what our Founding Fathers wrote up for us in how this country will be different from all other ones, then we will lose it.” 
But in order to hold on to what we have, Bure says that it's not about putting faith in Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton — or any candidate, for that matter. 
Instead, she says her faith remains unshakable in Jesus Christ, and that she will pray for the wisdom of whomever wins the election. ",0

2694,"Review: That ‘Sunset Boulevard’ Close-Up, Finely Focused - The New York Times","The scenery may have shrunk, but that face  —   oh, that face  —   looms larger than ever. So does the ego that animates it, both indomitable and irreparably broken. “With one look,” indeed, to borrow a song lyric that describes such unsettling presence. That outrageous,    desperate old lady shedding sanity on the stage of the Palace Theater still has the poetry in her gaze to break every heart. Yes, Hollywood’s most fatally narcissistic glamour girl, Norma Desmond, is back in town, in the   revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Sunset Boulevard” that opened on Thursday night. It is a show that exists almost entirely to let its star blaze to her heart’s content. The light she casts is so dazzling, this seems an entirely sufficient reason to be. Miss Desmond is embodied by Glenn Close, the   movie actress who won a Tony in the same part 22 years ago. And what was one of the great stage performances of the 20th century has been reinvented, in terms both larger and more intimate, that may well guarantee its status as one of the great stage performances of this century, too. Ms. Close is even better than when I first saw her  —   more fragile and more frightening, more seriously comic and tragic. Part of this presumably involves the insights an artist accumulates over the decades. It is also to Ms. Close’s advantage that she is no longer required to compete with an elephantine,   set. For this latest incarnation of “Sunset Boulevard,” directed by Lonny Price and first seen in London last year, is a close cousin to the   productions from Encores! of vintage musicals in concert at City Center. As in such presentations, the orchestra (40 pieces strong) is onstage and visible. James Noone’s set, anchored by tiered industrial scaffolding, conjures 1950s Hollywood through suggestive visual accents  —   a giant chandelier here, a floating corpse there  —   rather than   scenery. Yes, a car still shows up onstage. And our Miss Desmond still gets a workout walking up and down the stairs. But the   opulence of John Napier’s original designs has been scrubbed away. Such relative minimalism allows us to see Norma and “Sunset Boulevard” plain. The good news is that Norma has never looked bigger. (And no, I’m not forgetting about Gloria Swanson, who immortally created the part in the 1950 Billy Wilder film on which this show is based.) The musical, on the other hand, seems and sounds thin, despite the velveteen lushness of its excellent orchestra. Don Black and Christopher Hampton’s book is just fine when it hews to the   dialogue of the original screenplay. But “Sunset,” being a musical, spends most of its time singing, and Mr. Black and Mr. Hampton’s lyrics have a way of turning   cynicism into taunting schoolyard jingles, with rhymes that land as emphatically as children on hopscotch squares. (“You know I’m right.  It’s there in black and white. ”) Mr. Lloyd Webber’s music often inhabits a similar zone of singsong insistence, with certain melody lines repeated so often you fear surgery may be necessary to have them removed from your memory. Only the swirling, ominous overtures evoke the shades of noir of Franz Waxman’s original film score. For long stretches, you may even forget you’re inhabiting one of the darkest visions that Hollywood ever summoned of itself. This is a story, after all, that begins with a talking dead man. That’s Joe Gillis, the    screenwriter who narrates in sustained flashback. On the lam from a collection agency, Joe (Michael Xavier) winds up in a scary old mansion at 10086 Sunset Boulevard, playing editor, house pet and eventually lover to the reclusive Miss Desmond, a nearly forgotten   diva, who is planning her comeback. We also spend far too much time with Joe in the less exotic world of Hollywood hopefuls, where he falls for an ambitious studio worker, Betty Schaeffer (Siobhan Dillon) his best friend’s girl. Betty, to put it bluntly, is a bore, and so is Joe when he’s with her, since she has the effect of making them both sing like sweethearts out of Victor Herbert. Mr. Xavier is glib, handsome and charmingly  . But he’s lightweight, lacking the tortured conscience that William Holden brought to Wilder’s movie. Fred Johanson, looking like Lurch from “The Addams Family,” finds more substance and shadow as Max, Norma’s fanatically loyal  . The large ensemble, choreographed into flailing friskiness by Stephen Mears, is serviceable. But we’re just marking time until Norma’s back. Whenever she makes an entrance, the adrenaline that surges through the house is palpable. Swathed in   ensembles of sequined black, shimmering gold and assorted animal prints (the great Anthony Powell did Ms. Close’s costumes) her face as white and exaggeratedly expressive as Marcel Marceau’s, Norma should by rights be merely a drag queen’s fantasy. And, yes, on one level, the lady is a camp. But Ms. Close deploys the declarative physical vocabulary of   acting to convey a genuine grandeur of spirit and an equally outsize force of will. Watch Norma watching herself onscreen in a state of mimetic rapture, or seesawing violently between little girl coquettishness and iron imperiousness with her captive lover. The audacity of this performance is matched by its veracity. This is   acting of a singularly sophisticated and disciplined order, one of those rare instances in which more is truly more. Her singing voice is reedy and at times  . But her delivery, her stance, her very presence are operatic in the richest sense of the word. I won’t even try to describe the brilliant spiderlike dance  —   superhuman and pathetically human  —   with which Ms. Close concludes the show. You have to (and I mean have to) see it in person. Her interpretation of the show’s one great song, “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” in which Norma visits her old studio lot, is a  . Watching it from its beginning (when a set worker trains a spotlight on Norma’s face) to its end (when she steps to the edge of the stage to absorb the applause like an unquenchable sponge) is to understand with all your senses the addictiveness of stardom. “Feel the magic in the making,” sings Norma. You can only nod your head in   agreement.",0
2695,California Governor Signs Legislation Limiting Assault Weapons - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   Gov. Jerry Brown on Friday signed legislation that would impose new restrictions on assault weapons and regulate the sale of ammunition in California, cementing the state’s reputation for enacting some of the most stringent gun regulations in the country. Propelled by the reaction to mass shootings in San Bernardino, in Southern California, and Orlando, Fla. the gun regulations are the latest example of how this state, where the Legislature is under Democratic control, has been able to enact a legislative agenda on issues that have deadlocked Congress. The legislation in Sacramento was passed with overwhelming Democratic support, and was largely opposed by Republicans who make up a small minority in the Senate and the Assembly. Even as he signed six measures, Mr. Brown, a moderate Democrat with a history of resistance to some measures of gun control, vetoed five others that he described as overly regulative. Among them was a bill that would have restricted gun purchases to no more than one per person in a   period. “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of   gun owners,” Mr. Brown, who himself owns guns, said in his signing message. The enactment of the legislation leaves little doubt to the standing of California, which in 1989 became the first state to ban assault weapons, as a leader in gun control at a moment when Congress has rebuffed such efforts and numerous   states are moving in the other direction. States like Texas, in the name of promoting safety, have in recent years expanded the locations where people can carry concealed weapons, including bars and college campuses. “This makes California the most   state in America,” said Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. In a statement, she called the legislation a “a draconian gun control package that turns California’s   gun owners into   citizens. ” “The governor and Legislature exploited a terrorist attack to push these measures through even though the state’s   laws did nothing to stop the attack in San Bernardino,” she said. Amanda Wilcox, legislative advocate for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, hailed the governor’s action as a step forward in efforts to curb gun violence. She highlighted one bill sponsored by Senator Kevin de León, the Senate’s Democratic leader, requiring background checks for ammunition purchases as particularly crucial. “It is really   and bold, and really has the potential to save a lot of lives,” Ms. Wilcox said. “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state, as well as limiting access to ammunition by dangerous people who may have illegal guns. ” The new laws would prohibit the possession of   magazines  —   those holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition  —   for assault weapons. “These     magazines are not for target shooting or hunting,” said Senator Loni Hancock, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Their sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time. ” A separate bill banned semiautomatic weapons with “bullet buttons,” which make it easy to quickly remove a magazine and replace it with another. Among the bills Mr. Brown vetoed was one that would have expanded the definition of a firearm. “While I appreciate the author’s intent, the actual wording of the bill is unduly vague and could have   and unintended consequences,” Mr. Brown wrote in his veto message. Shannon Grove, a Republican Assembly member who spoke out against the bills during the debate, said that none of those signed would reduce gun violence or prevent mass shootings. Instead, she said, the restrictions compromised the rights of California families to protect themselves. “I think it’s death by 1, 000 paper cuts for our Second Amendment rights,” she said. “Nowhere in this nation do you give up your rights under any other amendments. ” The signing was not the end of gun control measures that might be enacted here in the wake of a wave of violence that has traumatized the world and the nation, including the shooting  in San Bernardino that killed 14 people at a holiday party in December. A separate set of gun control measures will appear before voters in November some of them have been passed by the Legislature, but Mr. Brown vetoed those, saying they should be left to voters to decide. That initiative is being championed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is running for governor after Mr. Brown’s final term ends in 2018. His initiative would, among other things, make firearm theft a felony and require ammunition vendors to report lost or stolen supplies within 48 hours. “Today’s steps in the right direction will grow into a giant leap forward for public safety if voters pass the Safety for All initiative to keep guns and ammo out of the wrong hands,” Mr. Newsom said. Gun death rates fell 56 percent in California from 1993 and 2010, a larger decline than in the nation as a whole, according to a study by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Gun control advocates pointed to that as evidence that such laws were effective. “Gun laws work,” Ms. Wilcox said. “California gun sales are really high. We are not deterring   people from buying guns. We’re doing a better job of making sure dangerous people don’t have guns. ” But Ms. Grove pointed to the ammunition law as an example of a measure that would hurt the interests of gun owners without doing anything to curb gun violence. “Criminals who are not authorized to have firearms in the first place are not going to register to buy ammunition,” she said. “It’s absurd. ”",0
2696,With Larry Wilmore Before the White House Correspondents’ Dinner - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   It was midafternoon on Saturday, and Larry Wilmore was doing a sound check in the empty International Ballroom of the Washington Hilton, where he was to be the featured comedian of that night’s annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. The ballroom, a forbiddingly cavernous space, can be a comedy slaughterhouse. Bombing there means hearing a sad symphony of the HVAC system and clinking silverware, or maybe seeing Henry Kissinger nodding off at Table 27. (I saw it happen during Rich Little’s set in 2007, in the middle of Mr. Little’s Nixon impersonation no less.) But the   gig can also give a topical comedian like Mr. Wilmore a chance to stitch his name into the   fabric of America, before an audience that includes the president and some 2, 700 powerful people in government, media, politics and show business. “Stephen’s was the bravest,” Mr. Wilmore told me as he looked out from the stage at the ballroom. He was referring to the seminal performance that Stephen Colbert gave in 2006. Playing his   Comedy Central character, an egotistic conservative talk show host, Mr. Colbert mockingly defended the Iraq war and the Washington press corps’ coverage of it. The act, typical of his show, wilted inside the hall. But it was a hit out in the world because it tapped the growing perception that a   relationship between journalists and government officials produced credulous reporting that helped start a war under false pretenses. It was the perfect pairing of a comedian and the moment. Mr. Wilmore, whose “Nightly Show” occupies Mr. Colbert’s old 11:30 time slot on Comedy Central, knew he was part of a similar pairing, “one of those accidents of timing,” he said. Yes, he was a leading black comedian performing at the last correspondents’ dinner for the nation’s first black president. But his appearance was also coming during a national conversation about race and law enforcement race and the news media  —   including at The New York Times  —   and race and economic injustice. Mr. Wilmore has branded this year’s political campaign “The  ” of the White House. And now here he was, getting ready to address an overwhelmingly white crowd of reporters  —   a sign of how far journalism has to go in achieving meaningful diversity  —   in the middle of a party weekend that can give official Washington the same sense of remove that the decadent capital city has in the “Hunger Games” movies. I asked him if there would be any “White House Correspondents’ Dinner So White” jokes. No, he said. He hinted at an inner tension between going for a big political statement and going for laughs. “That’s why I say Stephen did the bravest thing I’ve ever seen, you know?” he told me. “Because you want to go and have a good time, get laughs and have everybody say, ‘Yeah, you killed. ’” Before the dinner, Mr. Wilmore’s hotel suite was a show business version of a groom’s room before a wedding. Pacing around the living area were his manager his agent his publicist one of his writers, Robin Thede friends like Kenya Barris, who created the TV sitcom “ ” and his parents, Betty and Larry Wilmore. The whole group was to meet the president and first lady before heading into the hall. Mr. Wilmore was in his tuxedo  —   he is a necktie man, not a bow tie man  —   and staying quiet, getting into the zone. “I’ve always been proud of him,” Betty Wilmore told me as we all headed to the elevator. Mr. Wilmore seemed to cringe a little  —   as a son would  —   when she remembered showing up as the sole cheering section for his high school basketball team in California. “Why do I have to remember this?” Mr. Wilmore said. Mr. Wilmore said he was ready, but he and his producer had one fear: that President Obama, who would go first, would step on Mr. Wilmore’s act. That’s what he did to Seth Meyers at the 2011 dinner, by releasing his birth certificate that afternoon (“Thanks for the timing on that,” Mr. Meyers had said then, holding up pages of birth certificate jokes.) But Mr. Obama’s typically commanding performance on Saturday left Mr. Wilmore’s jokes more or less unscathed. And Mr. Wilmore came forward with a routine that gave his audience some uncomfortable moments that clearly came through on   (which is how I watched it because The New York Times stopped going to the dinner starting in 2008). Calling the dinner “Negro night,” Mr. Wilmore said Fox News would cover the speech from him and Mr. Obama as “Two thugs disrupt elegant dinner in D. C. ” He joked that MSNBC now stood for “Missing a Significant Number of Black Correspondents,” a reference to its cancellation of a show hosted by Melissa  . “Some of our finest black journalists are here tonight,” he said, and then added, “Don Lemon is here too,” a reference to the black journalist on CNN. (Mr. Lemon responded with a   salute.) His high notes included telling the president to butt out of comedy, seeing as how Mr. Wilmore doesn’t go around “signing executive orders, pardoning turkeys, not closing Guantánamo. ” But sometimes the crowd groaned or fell silent, prompting him at one point to say, “You guys are tough, man. ” But at the end he got serious, speaking about how proud he was that Mr. Obama had proved “a black man can lead the entire free world,” and ended by saying “Yo, Barry, you did it,” and referring to Mr. Obama with an affectionate twist on the  . They embraced. As Mr. Wilmore made his way through a light rain to the Vanity Fair and Bloomberg News   at the French ambassador’s residence  —   where Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. mingled with stars like the actresses Helen Mirren and Rachel McAdams  —   the reviews started trickling in. Brian Lowry’s synopsis on CNN Money carried the headline “Larry Wilmore gets groans and grimaces. ” “Wilmore Underwhelms,” The Hollywood Reporter reported. But then the counternarrative emerged, suggesting that his routine played better outside the bubble. A Daily Beast review likened his act to Mr. Colbert’s, and The Drudge Report gave him a screaming headline: “Comedian Eats the Press!” Leaning against a doorjamb at the party, Mr. Wilmore told me the whole experience was “surreal. ” The motto of his show is “Keep it 100,” as in keep it real, and, he said, “If I’m going to keep it 100, I gotta do the jokes. ” Reality can be in short supply every year during this weekend. The Correspondents’ Association deserves credit for having a comic like Mr. Wilmore at its dinner. And regardless of whether you liked Mr. Wilmore’s act, you can’t say he didn’t keep it 100. Bad things happen in Washington when people don’t.",0
2697,"A Remote Pacific Nation, Threatened by Rising Seas - The New York Times","TARAWA, Kiribati  —   One clear bright day last winter, a tidal surge swept over an ocean embankment here in the remote,   island country of Kiribati, smashing through the doors and windows of Betio Hospital and spewing sand and debris across its maternity ward. Beero Hosea, 37, a handyman, cut the power and helped carry frightened mothers through the rubble and water to a nearby school. “If the next one is combined with a storm and stronger winds, that’s the end of us,” he said. “It’s going to cover this whole island. ” For years, scientists have been predicting that much of Kiribati may become uninhabitable within decades because of an onslaught of environmental problems linked to climate change. And for just as long, many here have paid little heed. But while scientists are reluctant to attribute any specific weather or tidal event to rising sea levels, the tidal surge last winter, known as a king tide, was a chilling   call. “It shocked us,” said Tean Rube, a pastor with the Kiribati Uniting Church. “We realized, O. K. maybe climate change is real. ” Pacific island nations are among the world’s most physically and economically vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events like floods, earthquakes and tropical cyclones, the World Bank said in a 2013 report. While world powers have summit meetings to negotiate treaties on how to reduce and mitigate carbon emissions, residents of tiny Kiribati, a former British colony with 110, 000 people, are debating how to respond before it is too late. Much of Kiribati, a collection of 33 coral atolls and reef islands scattered across a swath of the Pacific Ocean about twice the size of Alaska, lies no higher than six feet above sea level. The latest climate models predict that the world’s oceans could rise five to six feet by 2100. The prospects of rising seas and intensifying storms “threaten the very existence and livelihoods of large segments of the population,” the government told the United Nations in a report last year. Half of the   village of Bikenibeu, for instance, could be inundated by 2050 by   rises and storm surges, according to a World Bank study. The study lays out Kiribati’s future in apocalyptic detail. Causeways would be washed away, crippling the economy degraded coral reefs, damaged by warming water, would allow stronger waves to slam the coast, increasing erosion, and would disrupt the food supply, which depends heavily on fish supported by the reefs. Higher temperatures and rainfall changes would increase the prevalence of diseases like dengue fever and ciguatera poisoning. Even before that, scientists and development experts say, rising sea levels are likely to worsen erosion, create groundwater shortages and increase the intrusion of salt water into freshwater supplies. In response, Kiribati (pronounced    in the local language) has essentially been drawing up plans for its demise. The government has promoted “migration with dignity,” urging residents to consider moving abroad with employable skills. It bought nearly 6, 000 acres in Fiji, an island nation more than 1, 000 miles away, as a potential refuge. Fiji’s higher elevation and more stable shoreline make it less vulnerable. Anote Tong, a former president who pushed through the Fiji purchase, said it was also intended as a cry for attention from the world. “The issue of climate change is real, serious, and we’d like to do something about it if they’re going to take their time about it,” he said in a recent interview. But packing up an entire country is not easy, and may not be possible. And many Kiribati residents remain skeptical of the need to prepare for an eventuality that may be decades away. The skeptics include the rural and less educated residents of the outer islands who doubt they could obtain the skills needed to survive overseas, and Christians who put more faith in God’s protection than in climate models. “According to their biblical belief, we’re not going to sink because God is the only person who decides the fate of any country,” said Rikamati Naare, the news editor at Radio Kiribati, the   broadcaster. As President Tong became a   celebrity, invited to speak at conferences around the world, opponents accused him of ignoring problems back home, such as high unemployment and infant mortality. They derided the Fiji purchase, for nearly $7 million, as a boondoggle dismissed his “migration with dignity” as a contradiction in terms and called his talk of rising sea levels alarmist and an affront to divine will. Mr. Tong, having served three terms, was not allowed to run for   this year, but in March elections the opposition defeated his party. The new president, Taneti Maamau, said he planned to shift priorities. “Most of our resources are now diverted to    development, but in fact there are also bigger issues, like population, the health of the people, the education of the people,” he said during an interview at Parliament, which sits on reclaimed land at the edge of a turquoise lagoon. “Climate change is a serious issue, but you can’t do very much about it, especially if a big hurricane comes,” he added with a hearty laugh. The Fiji purchase was not the first effort to address Kiribati’s perilous future. The World   Kiribati Adaptation Program, begun in 2003, developed   plans, built coastal sea walls, planted mangroves and installed   systems. The bank says the project, which cost $17. 7 million, has conserved fresh water in Tarawa and protected about one mile of Kiribati’s 710 miles of coastline. But a 2011   report cast doubt on whether the World Bank project helped Kiribati prepare for climate change. And while the mangroves and water management plans have helped, a 2014 study said the first round of sea walls, made of sandbags, had proved counterproductive and caused more erosion. “Adaptation is just this long, ugly, hard slog,” said the study’s lead author, Simon Donner, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. “The idea that an outside organization can just come in with money, expertise and ideas and implement something easily is naïve. What you need is consistent,   funding  —   the type of stuff that’s hard to pull off with development aid. ” Denis   Jordy, a senior environmental specialist at the World Bank, acknowledged that “we had some issues” with the first sea walls but said subsequent ones made of rock were better designed. There is no shortage of ideas to avert Kiribati’s environmental fate. China’s construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea shows the promise of sophisticated   technology, experts say. Mr. Tong commissioned a study on raising Kiribati’s coastline. But such measures are financially unrealistic for a     country like Kiribati. “It’s not about the place going underwater,” Professor Donner said, noting that some of Kiribati’s islands had actually grown in recent years because of land reclamation or natural coastal dynamics. “It’s about it becoming prohibitively expensive to live in. That’s the real challenge for Kiribati. ” The parallel freshwater crisis is also fixable, at a cost. Clean drinking water is already scarce on several islands, and saltwater from high ocean tides has infiltrated some wells. Many residents of South Tarawa, home to half the country’s people, now get their drinking water exclusively from rainwater tanks. Experts worry that as sea levels rise, Kiribati’s fragile groundwater supply will face even greater risks, while the next drought could quickly exhaust the municipal supply and household rainwater tanks. Kiribati could invest in desalinization equipment or ship in drinking water, but this is a country with only one paved road. “It’s all doable,” said Doug Ramsay, the Pacific Rim manager at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand. “It’s just going to be a very expensive exercise. ” Another novel response gaining attention lately is the idea of applying international refugee law  —   largely drafted after World War II to protect people fleeing political, religious or racial persecution  —   to those forced from their homes because of climate change. In 2012, a migrant worker from Kiribati, Ioane Teitiota, applied for asylum in New Zealand, arguing that he was unable to grow food or find potable water in Kiribati because of saltwater intrusion. His lawyer, Michael Kidd, said the distinction between environmental and political refugees was arbitrary. “You’re either a refugee or you’re not,” he said in an interview. The courts rejected the argument, and Mr. Teitiota was deported from New Zealand last year. Mr. Kidd said he had appealed to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Still, migration may become increasingly important. Mr. Tong said he hoped to prepare his people to move with   programs that would meet standards recognized in Australia and New Zealand. “The science of climate change is not 100 percent precise,” he said in the interview. “But we know without any argument that, in time, our people will have to relocate unless there are very, very significant resources committed to maintain the integrity of the land. ” Coastal threats are increasingly clear to residents of Buariki, an oceanside village of   huts and towering coconut palms on the island of North Tarawa. Erosion along the beach has already toppled dozens of coconut trees. The World Bank estimates that 18 to 80 percent of the village, which sits on a peninsula not more than a few hundred feet wide, may be underwater by 2050. Some villagers said they were resigned to leaving. “Our government already has land in Fiji for the Kiribati people, so if there are more high tides here, they’ll bring people to live there,” said Kourabi Ngauea, 29. “But it depends on the government, and if they can support us. ” Others see no need to leave. “This is where I belong,” Aroita Tokamaen, 76, said as she peeled a coconut on her patio. “I would rather stay. ” The tide that damaged the hospital here last winter was an exceptionally strong king tide, a surge that occurs twice a year when the moon is closest to the Earth. The waves also flooded the   outdoor meeting space of the local branch of the Kiribati Uniting Church. While some people were alarmed, the pastor, Ms. Rube, said she refused to accept the idea that Kiribati could disappear. “We are Christians,” she said. “So we don’t believe that God could have given us this world and then take it away. ”",0
2698,Standing Rock Protesters Sprayed With Water in Freezing Temperatures,"Police fired water cannons on peaceful protesters in freezing temperatures in North Dakota on November 20th. At least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital, and some were treated for hypothermia. 

Police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and water hoses keep protesters from pushing past a blockaded bridge on a state highway on Sunday and early Monday morning. 

Temperatures in Cannon Ball, North Dakota dropped into the 20s while police in riot gear sprayed activists with a hose mounted on top of an armored vehicle. Protesters were also pelted with rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades during the standoff. 

Police have set up wire and concrete barriers on the bridge, which is about a mile south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. Protesters argue that this barricade prevents emergency services from reaching the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and a nearby camp they have been using as a staging ground for demonstrations. 

Protest organizer, Dallas Goldtooth, claims that protesters started small fires in the area to help warm people who had been sprayed with water in freezing temperatures. Law enforcement officials claim to have used water to put out those waters, yet there is evidence they were using water to spray and disperse protesters. 

The road itself is public, yet according to Tara Houska, another protest organizer, over 200 people were hit with tear gas, pepper spray, or water. 

Protesters and organizers are using the Cannon Ball gym as an emergency relief center with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes. People who were injured in the standoff are being treated there. Physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council are calling on authorities to stop using water cannons against the protesters, saying that below-freezing temperatures can cause hypothermia. They claim that the techniques used by militarized police are potentially lethal and controversial, especially since protesters have been peaceful.

2699,"A ‘Hoop Dreams’ Sequel, Written by Gun Violence - The New York Times","CHICAGO  —   The first truly great American sports documentary, it’s universally agreed, was “Hoop Dreams. ” Released in 1994, it garnered immediate critical acclaim Roger Ebert later called it the best film of the decade and “one of the great moviegoing experiences of my lifetime. ” Its failure to be nominated for an Academy Award caused such an outcry that the process for nominating   documentaries was eventually revamped. “Hoop Dreams,” you’ll perhaps recall, followed two promising basketball players from Chicago’s West Side from the eighth grade through high school. One of them, William Gates, became a star guard for suburban St. Joseph, where Isiah Thomas went to high school the other, Arthur Agee, began at St. Joseph but ultimately wound up at his local public school, Marshall High, where in 1991 he led the team to a surprise   finish in the Illinois state championships. Like thousands of poor families in disadvantaged neighborhoods all over the country, the Gateses and the Agees yearned for William and Arthur to make it as professional basketball players, in no small part to catapult them out of the poverty that permeates the West Side. But there were so many obstacles. William damaged his knee just as he was approaching stardom. Arthur and his family had to deal with the city shutting off their power because they could not pay their bills. The film touches on issues of addiction and domestic violence. Indeed, as I watched “Hoop Dreams” recently, I thought there was only one obvious obstacle that didn’t make it onto the screen: gun violence. “The reality is, it wasn’t what we really saw a lot in their lives,” recalled Steve James, the filmmaker who wrote and directed “Hoop Dreams. ” This was the case even though the crack epidemic was at its peak and the murder rate in Chicago was reaching a record high. “It was different then,” James said. So it would appear. Shawn Harrington was one of the bit players in “Hoop Dreams. ” A sophomore point guard at Marshall who moved from the junior varsity to the varsity during that glorious 1991 tournament run, he had his own star turn a few years later. After bouncing around several colleges  —   during which time he both got a degree and became a   Division II    —   Harrington returned to the West Side, where he raised a daughter and eventually became an assistant coach for the Marshall basketball team. His first year as an assistant, 2008, Marshall won the state championship that had eluded the “Hoop Dreams” team. “When I left for school,” he told me when I met him this week, “my mom said she hoped I would never come back. She was happy that I was away. She didn’t have to worry. ” “I had the dream like any other player in Chicago to play in the N. B. A. ,” he added. “But God had another plan. ” Then he pushed his wheelchair up a small ramp and joined me by the dining room table in his small,   apartment. Harrington, 41, originally returned to the West Side because he had just fathered a daughter and he wanted to be a real parent  —   not an absent father as his own dad had been. By 2014, he had etched out a life he was happy with: In addition to his assistant coaching duties, he worked with   students at Marshall, and operated a small “scouting service” that was meant to help Chicago basketball players land college scholarships. He viewed his life’s work as helping youngsters in the neighborhood where he grew up, and he became a proselytizer for the importance of education in achieving a better life. Like many former athletes, he saw sports as a means to that education. Eleven years earlier, Harrington’s mother had been killed when she mistakenly walked into a house that was being robbed. “That was a rough patch,” he recalled. “I donated mom’s organs, which helped three people. God was preparing me for this. ” By “this,” Harrington was referring to his own shooting. One of his daily rituals was driving his daughter, Naja, to high school. Early one morning in late January in 2014, with Harrington’s car in a repair shop, they set out together in a rented white sedan. At the corner of Augusta Boulevard and Hamlin Avenue, in the West Side neighborhood of Humboldt Park, a shooting had just taken place involving a white sedan. When Harrington and Naja drove into that same intersection, the men who had been shooting at the other white sedan opened fire, thinking it was the same car. Harrington lay on top of his daughter, trying to protect her. “Daddy, I don’t want to die,” she cried. By the time the shooting stopped, she was unharmed, but he had been hit twice one bullet went through his back and damaged two vertebrae, causing him to lose the use of his legs. He has used a wheelchair ever since. The person who brought Shawn Harrington to my attention was an assistant professor at New Mexico State, Rus Bradburd. A former college basketball assistant coach, Bradburd had recruited Harrington to New Mexico State from a junior college. Harrington left the school after one year, and the two men had lost touch. But when he heard about the shooting, Bradburd visited Harrington and has since been a constant in his life, helping him in innumerable ways. (Bradburd is also writing a book about Harrington, which is to be published in 2018 and is tentatively titled, “All the Dreams We’ve Dreamed. ”) In the course of our conversations, Bradburd made me aware that Harrington was not the only former Marshall High basketball player to have been shot in recent years. Most of them had been coached by Harrington. Tim Triplett, star of the 2014 Marshall team, was killed in April 2015  —   just a few years after his brother had been killed. Martin Satterfield, shot six times in the spring of 2014, is now paralyzed. Shawn Holloway was killed in early 2015. Marcus Patrick and Keon Boyd were killed this year. And two months ago, Edward and Edwin Bryant,    twins who were sophomores at Marshall, met the same fate. Edward, a talented    forward, was becoming a star of the basketball team, and Edwin played football for Marshall. “The violence has always been there,” Harrington told me. “When I was in high school, it was bad. But back then, gang members protected the athletes. They’d say: ‘Get out of here. Go back to school. ’” Indeed, that’s why Steve James didn’t focus on gun violence when he was filming “Hoop Dreams”  —   athletes, especially basketball players, had a   on the street. Regular newspaper coverage of high school basketball turned players into celebrities. Gang members, some of whom had once played basketball themselves, wanted to see them succeed. There was an “unspoken alliance” between gang members and basketball players, said Bradburd, who grew up in Chicago and spends his summers there. And sometimes not so unspoken: “Hoop Dreams” has a remarkable scene at a sporting goods store where Agee and a friend are buying clothes, paying with a thick wad of bills. Agee explains to the camera that they got the money from drug dealers. “They’re thinking they can give us stuff and keep our career going,” he says. In 1984, when Benji Wilson, a heralded high school player, was shot and killed, the news was shocking not only because Wilson was considered the next great Chicago talent, but also because it simply didn’t happen: Basketball players were supposed to be immune to the violence that was so prevalent in the city’s poorer neighborhoods. So what has happened? First, the nature of gun violence on the West Side has changed. Twenty years ago, the gangs were fewer in number and better organized, and most of the shootings were among gang members. “These were   gangs who were mostly fighting over turf,” said Alex Kotlowitz, the great chronicler of Chicago’s poor. Today, gun violence feels much more random, and people can be killed over the tiniest slights, including insults on social media. “The morality has changed,” said Dorothy Gaters, Marshall’s athletic director and Hall of Fame girls’ basketball coach. “People are getting shot for blowing their horns. ” Harrington told me that Marshall itself is a safe haven for students during school hours, and Gaters agreed. But the school can’t protect the students once they leave the building. Second, athletes no longer seem to be protected the way they once were. Gang members simply don’t seem to care anymore whether or not athletes succeed. Vince Carter, who coaches the Chicago Demons, a youth traveling team that Edward Bryant played for, told me that the Bryant twins were standing on a corner not far from Wrigley Field around 3:15 a. m. (The Cubs had lost a World Series game that night.) Although the hour was late, the neighborhood was relatively safe. They were gunned down in a   shooting. The killers have not been apprehended, and no one has any idea what the motive might be  —   if there even is a motive. That’s why even though Chicago had 928 homicides in 1991, the city felt safer than it does in 2016, a year in which it had 739 homicides as of Wednesday. “Even though there were more murders, and the gun violence was greater, it felt more circumscribed,” said James, who in 2011 made a film with Kotlowitz about gang violence called “The Interrupters. ” (Gates and Agee escaped Chicago’s gun violence, but they each had close relatives who were killed after “Hoop Dreams” came out.) Even if you survive being shot, it changes your life irrevocably  —   and never for the better. Harrington’s circumstances today are pretty dire. He hasn’t been able to return to work at Marshall because the school does not have accommodations for wheelchairs it does not even have a freight elevator that might allow him to go from floor to floor. He is essentially confined to his apartment unless someone takes him out. He lives on $300 a month in Social Security, $175 from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (a. k. a. food stamps) and the generosity of family. Although he says he is still coaching Marshall players, it is a volunteer gig now. “He’s been abandoned,” Bradburd said. “It is a failure of America. ” Not completely abandoned, though. Dale Brown, the former basketball coach at Louisiana State University, heard about Harrington and took up his cause. In 2015, Harrington was named coach of the year by the National Consortium for Academics and Sports. This year, during the Final Four, he spoke on a panel with Brown and Shaquille O’Neal at the National Association of Basketball Coaches convention. During the event, O’Neal and Brown gave him a check for $40, 000 to buy a   van. Harrington remains relentlessly upbeat. He has a machine in his apartment that allows him to stand and put weight on his legs, and he firmly believes that he will walk again someday. He corresponds regularly with Bradburd and Brown. He is trying to shepherd a group of    basketball players  —   “teaching them,” he says, “to be student athletes, and use it to get an education. ” He checks in from time to time with Martin Satterfield, the former Marshall basketball player who is also paralyzed. Ever since he returned to the West Side all those years ago, Harrington’s goal has been to help young people find a better life. Even from a wheelchair, that hasn’t changed. “I’m glad to have the opportunity to help kids in my community,” he told me. To help them succeed and achieve, yes.

2700,Farage: Not Worth Getting Angry About ’Sad and Pathetic’ Hillary - Breitbart,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox  Friends,” former United Kingdom Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said it was time to ignore 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the heels of her remarks at a tech conference in California criticizing voters.  Farage called Clinton a “sad and pathetic” and a “bad loser” now worthy of being ignored. “I mean, Hillary said the same things about me when I came across and supported Donald Trump in his campaign,” he said. “I don’t think it’s worth getting angry about Hillary. I just think she looks sad and pathetic. There is nothing worse in life than a bad loser, nothing worse than somebody who blames absolutely everybody else for their own failings. And let’s face it, you know, she represented an       establishment. She almost appeared as if it was her right to become the president and I’m very pleased she didn’t. I’ll tell you what  —   let’s just from now ignore her. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0

2702,He Didn’t Like ‘Homeland.’ Now He’s Advising It. - The New York Times,"A sharply dressed lawyer represented his   clients before a   panel in New York recently, claiming that because federal authorities tried to coerce them into becoming informants, they had the right to receive monetary damages. The argument took place in a federal appeals court in Manhattan, before a gallery of a few dozen people. But a similar version of a lawyer and his community’s concerns are now starring on the small screen, in the sixth season of the thriller, “Homeland. ” The lawyer Ramzi Kassem, a professor at the City University of New York School of Law, became the model for Reda Hashem, who runs a nonprofit legal clinic advocating for   rights, together with the   officer Carrie Mathison played by the show’s star Claire Danes. Mr. Kassem, the founder of the CUNY Clear clinic, which stands for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility, served as more than just   inspiration. He became, in a way, Homeland’s paid conscience consultant. “Initially I said, ‘Look, I’m probably not your guy because I really don’t like your show,” Mr. Kassem said, explaining that he felt “Homeland” exploited the stereotype of all Muslims as terrorists, and all people of color as threats. He agreed with the artists who subversively decorated the set last season with Arabic graffiti that read: “Homeland is racist. ” Alex Gansa, the   and showrunner, wanted to confront these claims. “What better way to do it than hire somebody as a consultant who would call you out on a weekly basis?” he said. The television lawyer, played by Patrick Sabongui, represents a young   man, Sekou Bah (J. Mallory McCree) arrested for links to overseas terrorists, after he posted videos sympathizing with terrorists. Ms. Danes’s character, a C. I. A. officer, shouts to an F. B. I. agent that their client was “just another Muslim kid you entrapped” by using an informant who posed as a friend. Reviews have been mixed for this season, which is being broadcast at a particularly resonant period: President Trump has heightened attention on potential domestic terrorist threats by his executive orders restricting immigration from   countries with links to terrorism. Spoiler alert  —   Mr. Kassem said he was pleased, if not relieved, that the producers took some of his suggestions. “Is it a perfect depiction? Absolutely not  —   because they have to dramatize it,” Mr. Kassem said. “I think as far as mainstream cultural production goes, it is, so far, the single work that most accurately reflects how these predatory prosecutions go, how informants are used and pressured and how these cases get packaged. ” Reading and redlining every script became Mr. Kassem’s weekend job, and he continued to point out inaccuracies and tendencies toward what he felt were racist depictions. “He did it in a wildly entertaining fashion,” Mr. Gansa said, adding it wasn’t typical Hollywood obsequiousness, which was refreshing. “His notes were astonishing in their bluntness, in their lack of convention. ” The show’s media materials describe Reda Hashem as a “C. U. N. Y. law professor,” although the school and clinic are not mentioned by name. The dean of the Law School, Mary Lu Bilek, sent a note before the current season of “Homeland” was broadcast to faculty and students touting Mr. Kassem’s involvement and his directorship of both the Clear project and the Immigrant and   Rights Clinic. Mr. Kassem said he was paid a standard fee, but declined to say how much that was. Last week, the Clear clinic earned a settlement in its lawsuit brought with the American Civil Liberties Union against the New York Police Department for its unwarranted surveillance of Muslims. And on March 1, Mr. Kassem represented four   citizens or green card holders who claimed that by refusing to cooperate with the government, they were put on a federal No Fly list, causing lost wages. “This takes us one step towards establishing the law,” he said in court, “so in the future, agents will not overstep boundaries. ” Mr. Gansa said that he can hear Mr. Kassem’s cadence in Mr. Sabongui’s performance, though Mr. Sabongui, in an interview, laughed and said he did not intend to do a “biopic on Ramzi Kassem. ” The two met before the season and discovered they had a bit in common, each speaking French, Arabic and English. Mr. Sabongui, 42, grew up in Montreal, the son of Egyptian parents who are Coptic Christian. Mr. Kassem, 38, was born in Beirut, and grew up in several countries in the Middle East. He earned a law degree from the Sorbonne after graduating with both an undergraduate and law degree from Columbia University. “When we first met, Ramzi and I would both drop a couple of bars of Arabic, just to see, ‘what’s your accent? What’s your dialect?’ Then we did the same thing in French,” Mr. Sabongui, 42, said. “That moment felt like a moment of home. ” Mr. Kassem brought Mr. Sabongui to his favorite Senegalese coffee shop, Les Ambassades in Harlem, where he spoke to his fellow regulars in French, holding court. During the filming of a jail scene, at the Westchester County Correctional Facility in Valhalla, N. Y. Mr. Kassem was just as commanding. “He just took over the set,” Mr. Gansa said, “he showed us exactly what the lawyer would be doing, exactly where the meeting would take place, who would be waiting for whom. It made it feel verisimilar in a way we never could have done on our own. ” Mr. Kassem first became involved in defending   against government overreach shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks when Muslims were being investigated and detained in New York. He works with clients detained at Guantánamo, as well as   whose passports were revoked and leads Know Your Rights sessions with his students. “It’s personal, it’s not just a principled impulse,” Mr. Kassem said. “I grew up in wartime in different places in the Middle East where there was a complete absence of any kind of order or fairness or justice, or in other countries that were under authoritarian rule. ” In working with the “Homeland” producers, Mr. Kassem approached it as his duty to change the Muslim narrative. He gave them all homework. He sent the writers the case of four   men in Newburgh, N. Y. convicted of attempting to blow up synagogues in the Bronx in what originated as a government sting operation. He also included the sentencing statement of Tarek Mehanna, an   Muslim convicted of conspiring to provide material support for terrorists. Mr. Mehanna watched jihadi videos and expressed his views online. Citing history lessons he learned as a student in suburban Boston, he said he had only exercised his First Amendment rights. In the fictional case of Sekou Bah, “we really pushed the limits of protected speech and how much protected speech we could tolerate in the age of terror,” Mr. Gansa said. He added of Mr. Kassem: “It’s not to say that we always agreed with him, or we always took his advice. ” Mr. Gansa said he also spoke with New York Police Department counterterrorism officers who worked with the unit that conducted surveillance in Muslim communities. Although it did not end well for Mr. Bah in Episode 4, he seemed to be a pawn in a much more sinister governmental game. If Mr. Kassem wanted to leave “Homeland” executives with one message, it was that the show had a social responsibility because judges and juries and prosecutors all watch. “That idea really resonated for us and we wanted to get it right,” Mr. Gansa said. “And in a way, Ramzi laid down a marker and we tried to honor it. ”",0
2703,"Luis Gutierrez Whines: Breitbart News Coverage of Illegal Immigrants, Muslim Refugees Too Harsh - Breitbart","Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) whined about Breitbart News’ coverage of illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees during his recent commencement address at Cambridge College.  “Breitbart and Fox News didn’t invent their opinions on Mexicans and Central Americans or Muslims,” he claimed the day after the London Bridge terror attacks. “They’re just recycling them. ” He told Cambridge College’s graduates, “I say lift the Muslim ban and tell the Supreme Court to say it’s unconstitutional and  . ” Gutierrez called President Donald Trump an “unqualified game show host” and said he saw “in our country great hope and great enthusiasm for resistance against Trump’s America and what it stands for. ” After the London Bridge attacks, Trump called for the “Travel Ban” as an “extra level of safety” and added that “we must stop being politically correct” or “it will only get worse. ” “We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!” Trump tweeted. “We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse. ” We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017,  We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don’t get smart it will only get worse,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  Gutierrez said when it comes to immigrants, religious and ethnic groups, “whatever group is coming right now,” there is “always a chorus” of people saying “they are the wrong kind of people, they are criminal, they are disloyal, and they will ruin everything for the rest of us in America. ” He said they were “wrong about the Irish Catholics that fled Ireland” and they are “wrong about the Syrian refugee Muslims that come to America seeking a place of refuge. ” He told graduates that when he was growing up, the New York Times said Puerto Ricans like his parents “were bringing tropical diseases” to New York and would be on welfare and “lead a life of crime. ” He also said there was “no one to stand up for my parents,” or the “Chinese when they were excluded,” or the Irish, or the “Japanese when they were put in internment camps, or the Jews when they were turned back to certain death, or the Italians everyone made fun of. ” He blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, claiming Sessions wants to “roll back voting rights and basic civil rights” and to “reignite the war on drugs. ” “I ask you to never forget as they try to roll back voting rights and civil rights that people were murdered, churches were bombed, people were lynched, they were beaten and brutalized so we can have these voting rights and civil rights,” he said. Gutierrez also claimed Sessions wants to deport as many people as possible and “use the law to paint all immigrants as criminals. ” He called on Trump’s administration to leave illegal immigrant laborers, parents, and those working in the fields alone and “go after the criminals that are in our neighborhoods, not after the decent people trying to make a better future in America. ” He told the audience that he became active in politics after realizing that his fellow establishment Democrats were “bigoted. ” Gutierrez told the graduates that in the 1980s, Democrats in Chicago asked him to vote for a Republican candidate for mayor because the Democrat, Harold Washington, was black. After Washington won the Democratic primary, “the Democratic Party of Chicago didn’t like it one bit because he was black,” Gutierrez said, adding that some Chicago Democrats wanted him to “vote against Harold Washington because a black person might move on your block, or went to school with your kids, or maybe married your daughter or your son. ” He said he was not “very political” at the time and just thought Washington, who would later endorse Gutierrez’s candidacy for Congress, was the best person for the job. Gutierrez said “these guys from the Democratic Party” were proving that “racism ran deep” and “something awoke in me. ” He said he told his neighbors “what racist bigots they were” and urged them to not let “fear and bigotry” determine their votes. Gutierrez told the graduates that they will have to play a role in “repairing the country from the damage that is being done today” and urged them to stand up “against the people who are surrounding the president and drawn from the most discredited corners of white nationalism, corporate greed   rights,   rights,       rights, and extremists who are anti almost everything that should be top tier in America. ” He implied that Trump, Sessions, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon would be uncomfortable with the “different ethnicities” and “different languages” in the crowd of “different colors. ” “You are the flavor of America,” he said. “You are building a stronger America. ” Gutierrez is   for his    rhetoric, histrionics, and outlandish predictions. When House Republicans passed the American Health Care Act last month, Gutierrez compared the passage of “Trumpcare” to Pearl Harbor, Fort Sumter, and the invasion of Iraq. “Attacking Pearl Harbor, firing on Fort Sumter and invading Iraq looked like good ideas to the perpetrators at the time,” Gutierrez said. “But in the end, they were huge blunders that harmed America and came back to haunt those who to took those actions. That is how I see this health care vote for Republicans. ” Gutierrez also predicted on the House floor in 2014 that George W. Bush would be the last Republican president if Republicans did not work with his fellow Democrats to pass a massive comprehensive amnesty bill. Two years after the bipartisan effort to ram through amnesty failed —  largely because of Breitbart News’ relentless reporting on the matter —  Trump was elected president.",0
2704,Awakening from the Living Dream,"Leave a reply 
Frank M. Wanderer – While dreaming, it has been proven that vital signs are influenced by the occurrence within the dream and that our bodies respond in some ways to what we’re witnessing. 
Allow me to draw your attention to an apparently surprising thing. If I told you that now, when you are reading these lines, you are in fact asleep, you would certainly believe that I have gone mad. 
You are awake , you are concentrating your attention to reading, and you are aware of your environment as well. You can see the furniture of your room, you can hear the call of the birds from the nearby forest. You are also aware of your thoughts and emotions. How can anyone claim that you are asleep at this very moment? 
Naturally, you – just like everyone else – sleeps at night. Yes, sometimes you see dreams while you sleep, but right now it is daytime, you are awake. So how could you see dreams? You Imagine a Whole World Around Yourself 
I believe that you do not only sleep at night, but also during the daytime. I believe that in your present state of consciousness, your greatest illusion is that you think you are awake. I believe that in your present existence, your greatest illusion is when you think that you are alert. What I see is that in your present state of consciousness you are asleep, and at present you are dreaming, and what you see and hear are all parts of your dream. 
Your nighttime sleep is only different from your daytime sleep in that in the night your dreams are less active. During the day, you imagine a whole world around you, and you play an active role in that dream. Your personal history takes place in that world, and identifying with that world shapes your personal identity. 
At present, you are dreaming that as a part of your personal history you are reading these lines while identifying with the role of the spiritual seeker, and you are outraged by what you are actually reading. 
The question may arise, ‘why do I claim that you are asleep and dreaming now?’. Well, from the state of consciousness I call Alertness, I can see that you are asleep, you believe yourself to be a separate self, you are a captive of the works of your mind. You are not Present 
What is the evidence for me to say that you are now asleep and, as a citizen of a dreamland, you are dreaming that you are awake? 
It is because you are not present. To be present means that you are fully alert, attentive, and conscious in the present moment. Whatever you do, you do that fully consciously, you focus your entire attention on that particular activity. 
Do you feel free to declare that you are present in every moment of your life? 
What does it mean to be awake? It has happened to all of us that we have come under the spell of a moment, at some time during our life. A beautiful landscape, a sunset, a beautiful piece of art, the rhythm of music enchanted us. It may even happen that we are just lost in the silence of a peaceful moment. The identification with the forms and shapes loosens a little bit for a short while, and in that instant, we may experience an entirely different state of Consciousness. You Live in a Separate World 
How deep you sleep may depend on how realistic you find your dreams, how much you identify with your identity embedded in your personal history. The less alert you are, and the deeper you submerge into your dreams , the more isolated, solitary and individualistic you will become. 
Every sleeper –including you– has a separate world, only those who exist in the state of Conscious Alertness (the true Lucid Dreaming) have a common, shared reality. All those different and separate worlds are created by the mind, which generates the state of separateness: the Ego, which appears as the focus of our identification with our thoughts and emotions. Thus everybody has a separate identity, personal history, individual world view and methods of action. 
Sometimes suffering alarms you from your sleep, but then you hasten to return to it, and start a new dream, a new objective in life, new ideals, passion, ambition that confirms your connection with your identity, rooted in your personal history. The Reasons of Your Sleep 
The reason of you sleeping is that you are not alert, only awake. Only one dimension of Alertness is present in you. Although you are able to focus your attention on your internal emotions and your environment, in your present state of Consciousness you are still powerfully identified with your mind and its functions. 
You are therefore drifting on the stormy ocean of your thoughts and emotions day by day, and the space necessary for the emergence of a contemplating Witness is missing from you. You still identify with your thoughts and emotions. These generate the dreams of the Mind , in which you live as a separate self, and try to find the ways of safely navigating your life on the stormy sea. Longing for Freedom 
In this separate state of Consciousness, the lack of Alertness may appear as a desire for freedom. This desire emerges from your real self, as your mind remembers its origins. This atavistic memory of the ancient past is the quiet attraction that will eventually take you back to Silence. 
This deep desire will only cease if you become alert again, that is, you will not be awake but also alert. Then the Consciousness awakens to its own existence in the human form you at present call yourself. 
Only giving up the struggle with the thoughts and emotions and the recognition of the futility of insisting on them will bring you the real freedom, The freedom of independence of the functions of the mind. 
Alertness, the awakened Consciousness , the world of internal silence are all beyond the functions of the mind. If you wish to reach beyond the identification with your thoughts and emotions, if you recognize the functions of the mind and the intensity of your identification with them loosens, you may become alert again, in the quiet, pure space of Consciousness. 
In this way, the third dimension of Alertness, that is, the contemplating Consciousness, appears in your life. This the original state of our existence, the pure Consciousness, the state of the witnessing Presence. SF Source Dreamcatcher Reality Nov. 2016 Share this:",0
2705,Nearly All Wild Animals Face Mass Extinction By 2020,"  Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , World // 0 Comments 
A disturbing new report suggests that over two-thirds of wild animals living on Earth are set to become extinct by the year 2020. 
The comprehensive report by the WWF and Zoological Society of London says animal populations across the globe will continue to plummet by 67% by 2020 due to a mass extinction that is killing the natural world. 
Thegaurdian.com reports: 
The creatures being lost range from mountains to forests to rivers and the seas and include well-known endangered species such as elephants and gorillas and lesser known creatures such as vultures and salamanders. 
The collapse of wildlife is, with climate change, the most striking sign of the Anthropocene, a proposed new geological era in which humans dominate the planet. “We are no longer a small world on a big planet. We are now a big world on a small planet, where we have reached a saturation point,” said Prof Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, in a foreword for the report. 
Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, said: “The richness and diversity of life on Earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it. Life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation. Lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems, as we know them today, will collapse.” 
He said humanity was completely dependent on nature for clean air and water, food and materials, as well as inspiration and happiness. 
The report analysed the changing abundance of more than 14,000 monitored populations of the 3,700 vertebrate species for which good data is available. This produced a measure akin to a stock market index that indicates the state of the world’s 64,000 animal species and is used by scientists to measure the progress of conservation efforts. 
The biggest cause of tumbling animal numbers is the destruction of wild areas for farming and logging: the majority of the Earth’s land area has now been impacted by humans, with just 15% protected for nature. Poaching and exploitation for food is another major factor, due to unsustainable fishing and hunting: more than300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction, according to recent research. 
Pollution is also a significant problem with, for example, killer whales and dolphins in European seas being seriously harmed by long-lived industrial pollutants. Vultures in south-east Asia have been decimated over the last 20 years, dying after eating the carcasses of cattle dosed with an anti-inflammatory drug. Amphibians have suffered one of thegreatest declines of all animals due to a fungal disease thought to be spread around the world by the trade in frogs and newts. 
Rivers and lakes are the hardest hit habitats, with animals populations down by 81% since 1970, due to excessive water extraction, pollution and dams. All the pressures are magnified by global warming, which shifts the ranges in which animals are able to live, said WWF’s director of science, Mike Barrett. 
Some researchers have reservations about the report’s approach, which summarises many different studies into a headline number. “It is broadly right, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts,” said Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University in the US, adding that looking at particular groups, such as birds, is more precise. 
The report warns that losses of wildlife will impact on people and could even provoke conflicts: “Increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon, increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources.” 
However, some species are starting to recover, suggesting swift action could tackle the crisis. Tiger numbers are thought to be increasing and the giant panda has recently been removed from the list of endangered species. 
In Europe, protection of the habitat of the Eurasian lynx and controls on hunting have seen its population rise fivefold since the 1960s. A recent global wildlife summit also introduced new protection for pangolins, the world’s most trafficked mammals, and rosewoods, the most trafficked wild product of all. 
But stemming the overall losses of animals and habitats requires systemic change in how society consumes resources, said Barrett. People can choose to eat less meat, which is often fed on grain grown on deforested land, and businesses should ensure their supply chains, such as for timber, are sustainable, he said. 
“You’d like to think that was a no-brainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable, then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business,” Barrett said. Politicians must also ensure all their policies – not just environmental ones – are sustainable, he added. 
“The report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are,” said Barrett. “My hope though is that we don’t throw our hands up in despair – there is no time for despair, we have to crack on and act. I do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the Anthropocene, but the will has to be there to do it.”",0
2706,5 Lifesaving Security Measures to Secure Your Home From Intruders,"Many believe burglaries are crimes that occur out of desperation, but this isn’t always the case. In fact, the motivation that drives many criminals is simply opportunity. Such is the case for why home break-ins occur around Christmas time while homeowners are away at work. All a criminal needs to do is make a quick entry, grab all the gifts perfectly surrounded by a Christmas tree and they are out the door faster than you can blink. Here are some facts to gain a better perspective on what you are facing:
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, every 15 seconds a home in America is burglarized and the homeowner typically suffers a loss of nearly $2,000 in stolen goods or property damage. Most burglaries take place between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. The majority of break-ins are committed by burglars who live nearby. Burglars tend to avoid homes with security systems. Most criminals can burglarize a home in less than ten minutes. Almost 30% of burglars enter a home through an unlocked door or window. An astonishing 34% of burglars enter through the front door. Burglars usually go to the master bedroom first. The average property dollar loss per burglary is a staggering $2,251. Someone is home during nearly three out of every ten burglaries. Only 13.6% of burglaries in 2014 resulted in arrests. Given these startling statistics, break-ins can be avoided altogether by using common sense and mindfulness. Here are some simple security measures to take to ensure your home stays out of the watchful eye of an intruder.
1. Keep security layers in mind Having security layers in place is the best possible preventative measures to deter possible criminals from marking your home as an easy target. These security layers will advertise to intruders that they should avoid your home altogether. Designing a home defense system that includes multiple security layers is a proactive way to protect your home, family, and belongings. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools at your disposal for keeping your property safe. Most of them cost significantly less than an alarm system, and all together can provide several layers of security to your home. Below are seven awesome tools for keeping your place safe during the holiday season. These affordable items are a great start to beefing up your home security.
Door club Wireless LED spotlight Fake TV burglar deterrent Digital lamp timers Sentry security bolt safe Hidden safes Security system Curtains and/or blinds on windows Use a wooden dowel on sliding doors and windows Read more about these 
2. Keep security supplies near vulnerable areas Those that are preparedness-minded are always vigilant about ensuring the safety of their family members. In that same vein, children should know the basics of the family emergency plan and safety rules like not opening the door to strangers.
As well, having some basic safety/security supplies near the most vulnerable areas of the home (key entry points, garages, etc.) would be advantageous if you find yourself face to face with someone attempting to break-in. For examples, near the entry points in my home, we have a decorative basket that blends into the decor but has items such as flashlights, an emergency whistle, multi-tools and/or a knife. As well, if you do not have children in the home, you can also strategically place a handgun, clips or a non-lethal weapon if you choose. You can strategically place these items near vulnerable spots of the home.
The front door The backdoor The bedroom Living room Another vulnerable part of the home is windows. Burglars love to “window shop”. If you keep your curtains or blinds open, this will give them an opportunity to take a peek into the home. Moreover, if you have picturesque bistro tables and chairs, they can easily be used against you. Criminals will throw them against windows for fast entry. Installing shatter-proof window film on windows will help prevent this.
While we love a beautifully landscaped yard with shrubs and bushes cut low, this can also make for easy entry into the home. You can add bushes and landscaping to help deter criminals from marking your home. Plants with thorns such as roses, bougainvillea or blackberry bushes are great choices for securing the outer perimeter of the home. At the very least, secure the windows from becoming entry points with window alarms to alert you or your neighbors to a break in.
Speaking of yard and landscaping, how many of you have a ladder that you forgot to bring in? Criminals will look around for tools they can use to gain entry. The second story of a home is typically more lax when it comes to security. If you are guilty of this one, lock up your ladder in your garage.
3. Focus on the entry points The most common way for an intruder to get into your home is through the door. Make this your first priority in reinforcing your security. The best method is to install door frame and hinge reinforcements on the front and back doors. This security solution is made of galvanized steel and can prevent single entry door kick-ins and stop intruders before they are inside. Moreover, you might also want to consider installing a deadbolt . Even the strongest reinforced steel door can be neutralized by one swift kick if your lock does not extend deep enough into the door frame.
As well, gaining entry into a garage is another essential entry point to secure. It takes less than six seconds to break into a garage if the criminal knows how. Here are step-by-step instructions on how to prevent this.
3. Be aware and know thy neighbors Having a pleasant relationship with neighbors who stay at home is a beneficial relationship to have. They can keep an eye on your home while you are at work and you can reciprocate in a way that helps them out. Knowing who your neighbors are, what type of cars they drive and usually the time they are home, creates a neighborhood that is actively practicing OPSEC and awareness .
4. Don’t draw unwelcome attention to your home We typically assume those living around us are respectful of property, but this isn’t always the case. Those living in residential areas bring unwanted attention to themselves when they rid their home of the large boxes marked with brand names or pictures of products. This happens frequently during Christmastime. That new flatscreen television box or video game system packaging will scream, “Come steal me!” to criminals. Be mindful and load up boxes and drop them off at a recycling center. This will reduce the eyes on the prize. As well, boxes are one the easiest items to repurpose . On a personal note, I have broken down boxes and used them to create a lasagna-style garden . This cut down on my trash load and helped me create a more sustainable lifestyle.
5. Let there be light! Illuminating the perimeter is single-handedly one of the easiest security measures to take. Simply put, dark or poorly lit areas make it easier for burglars to go unseen. Motion sensing security measures will quickly signal you to trouble if it’s out there. As well, indoor timers for lamps and indoor lighting can help to fool anyone creeping around where they shouldn’t be. Remember, the main goal of burglars is to get in and get out unseen. If they think someone is home, they will think twice before entering.
Everyone wants to believe that they are safe and sound when they latch the windows and lock the doors. With the increase in crime, jobless rates, and increased food prices, home break-ins are likely to be on the rise. Take some incentive to review your family preparedness plans and beef up your home security measures! The investment in your home security will pay off for years to come.

“The issues are being investigated… We are very clear that the only solution that is going to work for Yemen is actually to make sure that we have the political solution that will give stability in Yemen,” May told Corbyn and the parliamentarians. 
Instead of answering the direct question, May spoke about the UK government’s contribution to the humanitarian aid provided to the crisis-torn country. 
Corbyn also questioned May’s support for Saudi Arabia’s membership in the UN Human Rights Council. A crucial vote on the membership of Riyadh in the council will take place later this month. 
London has repeatedly been blamed by human rights groups, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, for fueling the Yemeni war by supplying Saudi Arabia with weapons. 
Since the conflict began last year, the British government has approved more than £3 billion ($3.7 billion) in arms sales to the Saudis and military contractors hope more deals are in the pipeline. 
Yemen has been under almost daily airstrikes by Saudi Arabia since March 2015. International sources put the death toll from the aggression at almost 10,000. 
Rights groups have also condemned the Kingdom’s crackdown on dissent and prosecution of pro-reform activists.",0

2709,T.S.A. Offers New Measures Intended to Cut Airport Gridlock This Summer - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   With anger boiling over as passengers wait an hour or more at airport checkpoints, Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, said on Friday that he had authorized steps to ease the lines, including more overtime for screeners, faster hiring and increased use of   dogs. Mr. Johnson, standing next to Peter V. Neffenger, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, said at a news briefing at Reagan National Airport that although the moves would reduce waiting times, they would not eliminate them. “Our task is to keep passengers moving, but also, and most importantly, keep passengers safe,” Mr. Johnson said. The long lines in recent months have led airlines to delay hundreds of flights and passengers to miss many more. Airlines and airports are fearing gridlock during the summer travel season. The T. S. A. has attributed the lines, in part, to tightened security procedures and budget cuts that have produced a shortage of screeners. Some members of Congress, however, have pointed to what they call management problems at the agency. Many airports have threatened to replace T. S. A. screeners with workers from private companies if the agency cannot reduce waiting times. Senators Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, both Democrats, have called on airlines to lend a hand in reducing waiting times by waiving the fees for checked baggage. “Without charges for checking their bags, passengers will be far less likely to carry them on, which snarls screening checkpoints and slows the inspection process,” they said in a letter to a dozen major airlines. Mr. Johnson urged travelers to sign up for T. S. A. Pre, an expedited screening procedure that allows passengers to leave their shoes on and keep computers in their bags. Enrollment in the program has fallen short of expectations, exacerbating the long security lines. The T. S. A. and its congressional supporters note that budget cuts have left the agency with 10 percent fewer screeners than it had in 2013. At the same time, the number of people flying is expected to increase by 12 percent this year, reaching a record. “The long wait times we’re seeing now are a direct result of Congress’s failure to give T. S. A. the money it needs to do its job,” said J. David Cox Sr. the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents airline screeners. Congress has given the agency the authority to hire 768 additional screeners. But Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, a longtime critic of the agency, said during an impromptu news conference of his own at the airport that the problem was not a lack of money or people. “The problem is a huge government bureaucracy,” he said. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy International Airport, La Guardia Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, recently sent a letter to the T. S. A. saying that security waiting times had “risen dramatically in recent months,” leading to delayed and missed flights. The Port Authority threatened to hire private security workers if the T. S. A. did not increase the number of screeners at the airports. Officials at   International Airport in Atlanta sent a similar letter in February. Other airports, such as Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, N. C. are also considering using private security contractors. Under the T. S. A. ’s Screening Partnership Program, 22 of the approximately 450 commercial airports in the country, including San Francisco International Airport, use private screeners. But some transportation experts point out that airports with private screeners are also experiencing longer waiting times as passenger volume increases. Private screeners still have to follow T. S. A. security procedures. And even if larger airports like the ones in New York and Atlanta moved to switch to private screeners, they could not do so in time for the increased summer travel. The T. S. A. review process takes about a year on average. The complaints about longer waiting times add to continuing problems at the T. S. A. which consistently ranks in employee surveys as one of the worst places in the government to work. The agency has been racked by accusations of mismanagement and misconduct, including the awarding of bonuses to supervisors who ignored warnings about security lapses and accusations that employees who reported problems were reassigned to other airports.",0
2710,"Utah's Evan McMullin Endorses Hillary Clinton, Says His Only Goal is to STOP TRUMP","
This is what we expected all along.
The #NeverTrump independent candidate Evan McMullin is working to eliminate Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton.
The #NeverTrump Republican candidate last week told reporters all Republicans are racist.
The #NeverTrump movement hopes McMullin will steal enough votes from Trump for Hillary to win Utah.
McMullin told reporters this week his goal is to take down Trump.
McMullin: What weâ€™re trying to do is earn enough electoral votes is to block Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump… If not they then we will be happy to have prevented someone who I believe is a true authoritarian from taking power in the United States and that’s Donald Trump.
Now what is it will all those Democrats saying “Trump is dangerous”? Dangerous to what? To their nest of corruption of course. Sure he is dangerous to that, they will go to jail most likely. Evan McMullin who looks like an E.T. with that ugly bold head of his used a different wording though, which is basically the same. He said he doesn’t want a “true authoritarian to take power in the US”. Umm sure he doesn’t, he doesn’t like the authority, the rule of law. Nope, he likes the rule of jungle where everybody can be corrupt in peace and be left alone.
According to his Wikipedia page, he is a former CIA operative who also worked at Goldman Sachs.
Those Democrats are so despicable. Its as if the USA fell in the hands of the organized Mafia.
Its obvious now this douchebag is a Hillary plant. Perhaps Republicans should have done something similar in California. Have some paid SJW agent trying to steal California away from the Democrats.

2711,Fugitive Italian Mobster Caught Hiding Illegally in Mexico,"REYNOSA, Tamaulipas  —   A   member of the Italian mafia was arrested by federal law enforcement officials in this Mexican border state. The mafia leader is expected to be sent back to Italy to serve a prison term from a prior conviction. Authorities discovered the man hiding in the country illegally. [Following an intelligence drive operation, Mexican authorities arrested    Giulio Perrone in the Mexican port city of Madero, Tamaulipas. Perrone is described as a   member of the mafia in Naples who has been on the run for 10 years following a drug trafficking conviction. He received a prison term of 20 years and 11 months.   Italy listed Perrone as one of its   fugitives for more than 10 years. Since he had entered Mexico illegally, at the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized multiple fake ID’s the fugitive had in his possession. Perrone has no pending legal matters in the U. S. Mexican authorities did not disclose if Perrone had been living in Mexico or if he was trying to get to the U. S. Officials turned the fugitive mobster over to Italian authorities for extradition. Breitbart Texas previously reported on a similar case where another Italian mobster was arrested in Arizona after entering the country illegally. In that case, Salvatore Marciante was arrested in January by U. S. Border Patrol agents in Nogales, Arizona after entering the country illegally. Marciante had been an Italian mobster living as a legal resident in New York who was convicted on various organized crime charges in 1995.

2713,Trump Said It Would Be Rigged,"Thursday, 10 November 2016 Don't ask me how I did it. 
He said it would be rigged. He blatantly announced that the presidential election would be rigged. The squirrels supporting his presidential election promised the election would be rigged. 
They would have poll monitors at various neighborhoods to police the possibility, and the various neighborhoods were in the predominately black areas of the country. Granted, he has questionable integrity, but why is no one taking him at his word? 
Did Trump rig the election? 
""We must support our new president,"" Hillary Clinton patriotically announced in her concession speech. 
Hold it. Back up a couple of weeks. 
Remember when the KGB was hacking into the Democratic National Committee, and Wiki-leaks published over 300 emails from John Podesta's computer? Seventeen US national security agencies announced that the hacking was traced to Russia. The former head of the KGB, Vladimir Putin, also had announced he was supporting Trump. 
Then there was the Director of the FBI, James Comey's fiasco. First Hillary was guilty of original sin! Ten days later, in a perfect example of a Governor Rick Perry 'whoops', James Comey announced, ""There is nothing there, there!"" 
So there! 
Back up again. Wringing his hands, Comey feared that mutinous members of the FBI were about to reveal new evidence against Hillary Clinton found in Anthony Weiner's computer. Weiner is the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's chief of staff. 
Long story to short: the new evidence was suggested in a book, Clinton Cash , written by Breitbart News senior editor-at-large Peter Schweizer. Breitbart News is a conservative website and the executive chairman, Stephan Bannon, is also the chief executive of the Donald Trump campaign. 
The dots are easy to connect: the smear campaign, drop in polls, catch up game and the votes were cast. 
""This election is going to be rigged."" 
Hillary Clinton never regained the advantage she had before the Comey fiasco. The down ballot was definitely compromised. 
Quoting someone from Wisconsin. ""Wisconsin went for Trump and we don't know how that happened. At least she got the popular vote."" 
The election was rigged. He said it would be. This time, believe him.

2714,Putin Begins Banning Clinton Cabal From Russia,"Vladimir Putin has begun banning members of the corrupt Clinton cabal from Russia, just days after Vladimir Putin told President-elect Donald Trump he hopes the two nations can rebuild their relationship. 
Via YourNewsWire 

Michael McFaul, a close Clinton ally and former US ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, is the first of many to be banned from entering Russia, according to Russian Foreign Ministry sources.
Mr McFaul, US ambassador in Moscow from 2012-2014, said he had learnt of the ban when applying for a visa to Russia last week. Asked what the purpose of his visit was, McFaul said it was to help presidential candidate Hillary Clinton prepare for what he assumed would be her transition to the White House.
Now McFaul, currently a Stanford University professor, is banned from Russia and Kremlin sources say he is the first of many Clinton allies to be banned.
Mr McFaul said: “I have hundreds of friends in Russia. I’m really sorry that these sanctions will make communicating with people harder. “I was told that I am on the Kremlin’s sanctions list because of my close affiliation with Obama.”
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not publicly confirm the ban, but ministry sources told Russian news agencies McFaul had been added to the sanctions list.
He was not banned because of his support for President Obama, a Foreign Ministry source told the TASS and RIA news agencies, but because of his “active participation in the destruction of the bilateral relationship and relentless lobbying in favour of the Clinton campaign to destabilize Russia.”
President Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Donald Trump following his election victory, telling the tycoon that he had followed the election closely.
Russia is hoping for a “new understanding” and “restored Russian-American relations” according to Kremlin sources, with President Putin said to be “encouraged” by the American people voting to back themselves and reject the prospect of a New World Order totalitarian world government.
According to sources, Putin believes that the result of the U.S. election proves the globalists’ destructive agenda is deeply unpopular with real people, and when given a chance they will instinctively reject it out of hand.“The American people stood up against the media, the banks, the establishment, everything was against them, but they said enough. They want change.”

2715,US support emboldens Israel to defy intl. law: Author,"Interviews A Palestinian woman searches through her belongings after her family home was demolished by Israelis in the mostly Arab East Jerusalem al-Quds neighborhood of Beit Hanina on October 26, 2016. (AFP photo) 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has passed a second resolution to endorse the fact that Jerusalem al-Quds is a Muslim city and the so-called Temple Mount is an Islamic site called Haram al-Sharif. The UNESCO adopted the first resolution to reaffirm the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound on October 18. 
John Steppling, author and commentator, told Press TV that the Israeli authorities “have been getting away with the violations of international law for 50 years,” as a result of the US’ all-out support for their crimes. 
“They (the Israeli authorities) pretty much do what they want because the United States protects them,” he added. 
According to the author, “Israel doesn’t care what the UN says, what do they care [about is] that the United States gives them three billion dollars a year in military aid regardless of anything.” 
The analyst also expressed concern about “what will happen once Hillary Clinton becomes president, as she has a very close relationship with Israel, [and] very close relationship with Netanyahu, and Israel may very well feel empowered to take even bolder steps in what has been frankly incremental genocide against Palestinians.” 
The occupied territories have been the scene of increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
Over 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October. Loading ...",0
2716,Steven Mnuchin: ’Regulation Is Killing Community Banks’ - Breitbart,"The highlight of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s confirmation hearing so far was his rousing defense of community banks against overbearing federal regulations. [“Regulation is killing community banks,” he declared, and if the process is not reversed, we could “end up in a world where we have four big banks in this country. ” He went on to offer examples of how regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis had some unexpected negative consequences.   Mnuchin ran through a list of regulatory agencies  —   “the OCC, the FDIC, Consumer Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve” —   and noted that “in certain cases, there is overlapping regulation. ” “My biggest concern, and I fully support regulation for banks with FDIC insurance, but my biggest concern is that this regulation is killing community banks,” he said. “We’re losing the community banking business. We’re losing the ability for small and   banks to make good loans to small and   businesses in the community, where they understand those credit risks better than anybody else. ” “I think that we all appreciate the engine of growth is with small and   businesses. In my role at FSOC, in working with the different regulators, I would make sure that we did what we could to have proper regulation, but eliminate overlap, as well as make sure that the banks are lending to small and   businesses, and we don’t end up with a world where we only have four big banks in this country,” Mnuchin said. He was referring to his prospective chairmanship of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a new regulatory body created by the   regulations to decide which private institutions are vital to the stability of the U. S. financial system, and so merit enhanced federal oversight. Senator Mike Crapo ( ) noted the importance of Mnuchin’s role within FSOC, which he criticized as “heavily focusing on some of its statutory mandates while ignoring others” since its inception.  Crapo highlighted the statutory mandate to “advise Congress and make recommendation in such areas that will enhance the integrity, efficiency, competitiveness, and stability of U. S. financial markets. ” “To date, frankly, I’m not aware of FSOC fulfilling that role,” he said. “We don’t get a lot of advice from FSOC. We get a lot of directive in the country. Will you pledge, as the chairperson of FSOC, that you will ensure that the council considers ways to make the U. S. financial markets more efficient, and then advise and work with Congress to achieve those outcomes?” “I absolutely will, Senator,” Mnuchin replied. “Let me just comment on, for instance, the Volcker Rule as an example. I do support the Volcker Rule. I think the concept of proprietary trading does not belong in banks with FDIC insurance. ”  The Volcker Rule is another artifact of the   legislation, which as Mnuchin indicated limits bank ownership of hedge funds and private equity funds. In essence, it prevents banks from using the money they’re holding for investments that benefit the bank instead of its customers, which is the sort of activity that contributed to the immense losses in the 2008 financial crisis. “The Federal Reserve just put out its own report that the Volcker Rule has completely limited liquidity in many markets,” Mnuchin continued. “The Federal Reserve is concerned that the interpretation of the Volcker Rule doesn’t allow banks to create enough liquidity for customers. So that’s something I would absolutely want to look at. ”",0
2717,The Doubt Machine: Inside The Koch Brothers’ War on Climate Science,"[Photo: Before and after mountain top removal for coal extraction. Devastation brought to you by the Koch Brothers. Credit: Earth Justice.] =By= The Real News Network Editor's Note 
We are at the point in Earth history, the breaking point. Humanity, (let’s be fair shall we?) western “civilization” has virtually killed the only home we have. There is no place for homeless humanity to go when this home becomes habitable only for cockroaches and similarly hardy beasts. Those in the worst offender nation, the United States, have allowed themselves to be pacified into disbelief that we are, or even can, destroy the only home we have. Much of that willing disbelief is founded on a welll orchestrated propaganda campagn carried out by the fossil fuel industry and the owners of it such as the Koch Brothers. The video below examines this decades long campaign that has been waged to lead a willing populace to the graveyard of humanity. 
We are literally at a point where days matter in reversing course. We (humanity) does not have centuries to address this problem. We don’t even have decades. Some argue that if something significant is not done by 2017 to radically reduce the production of global warming gasses that it will be too late to avoid the worst that is coming at us. We are talking months – not years. Recognizing the urgency, many organizations and publications are devoting major effort to addressing the destruction of our world. The Real News Network is starting a Global Climate Change Bureau. The Greanville Post and Uncommon Thought Journal are dedicated to bringing you consistent news, analysis, and engagement opportunities focused on ACD ( Anthropogenic Climate Disruption ) – as Dahr Jamail argues, ACD clear puts the blame for the problem on humans. Please join us in this effort and send pertinent materials to Rowan Wolf at managing.ed@greanvillepost.com . 
From The Real News Network 
Scientists say Temperatures Will Rise to Critical 2° by 2050 
The Real News Network is Building a Global Climate Change Bureau 
2014 and 2015 each set the record for hottest calendar year since scientists began measuring surface temperatures over 150 years ago, and 2016 is shaping up to be even warmer. This will be the first time that we’ve seen three consecutive years with record-breaking temperatures. 
A temperature increase of two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels will now be reached much sooner than earlier predicted according to a report by seven leading climate scientists. 
“The 1.5°C target could be reached by the early 2030’s and the 2°C target by 2050” says the report that included Sir Robert Watson, former Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The scientists say that even if all the pledges made by the signatory countries to the Paris agreement are fully implemented, climate will pass this dangerous mark in 34 years. 
This is a threshold that most scientists have warned cannot be crossed without dire consequences, including a rise in sea levels of several feet that would flood many coastal cities in the U.S., longer droughts, more intense heat waves that cause a major disruption in the world’s food supply, and large migrations of people from countries of the global south. 
It is also a point where it becomes far more difficult to reverse the warming trend. Some scientists suggest temperatures by the end of the century could rise as much as 4-6°C above pre-industrial levels. [1°C equals 1.8°F, so this is a temperature rise of 7.2-10.8°F] 
The report titled The Truth About Climate Change says, “Much of the public believes that climate change is only going to happen by the end of the century,” and that this is a misunderstanding of the urgency. Unless there is a dramatic change in current public policy, most people alive today will live to see the 2°C threshold crossed. 
The report continues: “Climate change is happening now, and much faster than anticipated.” Climate change related floods, droughts, more intense storms, heat waves, and wildfires have already had devastating effects on livelihoods, infrastructure, and lives.” 
If the 2°C threshold is to be avoided, the report calls for far more aggressive targets than those set by the Paris Agreement and for that action to begin immediately. The report says, “To meet the 2°C target, global CO2 emissions should be net zero by 2060-2075.” 
The threat is catastrophic, the science overwhelming. So why aren’t solutions to the climate change crisis at the top of the political agenda? 
Why don’t we see millions of people in the streets demanding decisive action? Why isn’t this a major issue in the election debates? Why are politicians who deny the existence of human-caused climate change even elected to office? 
The lack of American public engagement in the climate crisis is a global concern. If U.S. policy doesn’t change, human life as we know it and thousands of other species will not survive. 
According to a Yale survey, 70% of Americans now believe global warming is real. If so, why isn’t there more political pressure to face up to the crisis? 
Dig further into the numbers and the state of public opinion is more fully revealed. Of those who believe climate change is real, only half (53%) think that global warming is mostly human caused. One in three (34%) believe it is due mostly to natural changes in the environment. Only about one in ten Americans understand that nearly all climate scientists (more than 90%) are convinced that human-caused global warming is happening. Over half of Americans (58%) say they are at least “somewhat worried” about global warming, but only 16% say they are “very worried.” 
Why are only 16% of people surveyed very worried about what 90% of scientists think is a catastrophic threat? 
The Koch Brothers’ war on science certainly plays a major role in promoting doubt about the overwhelming scientific evidence of human-caused climate change. They spend millions financing witch hunts against climate scientists and funding “research” designed to confuse public opinion. 
The Kochs and other billionaires with a vested interest pour hundreds of millions into the coffers of politicians willing to obstruct legislation that would regulate fossil fuel and promote a green sustainable economy. 
Perhaps as responsible for the gap between public opinion and scientific evidence is corporate television news, “The gatekeeper of public consciousness.” 
Firstly, they ignore the crisis. The report cited above was not the lead story on television newscasts. We can’t find evidence it was carried by any U.S. television news outlet at all . 
According to a Media Matters report, the four major corporate TV networks aired a total 146 minutes of climate change coverage in 2015. ABC only aired 13 minutes of coverage and Fox’s coverage consisted mostly of “criticism of efforts to address climate change.” 
The report continues: CNN aired almost five times as much oil industry advertising as climate change-related coverage in the one-week periods following the announcements that 2015 was the hottest year on record and February 2016 was the most abnormally hot month on record. 
Only 16% of Americans are “very worried” about global warming because corporate TV news doesn’t want us to worry about it. 
Larry Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell, says: While US foreign policy is mostly responsible for the growth of militant terrorist groups, the threat of a nuclear terrorist attack is existential. Think about what we’ll do when 500,000 people are killed in New York City. We will declare martial law nationwide. We will be the most draconian tyranny you’ve ever seen on the face of this earth. But still I consider climate change a greater danger because it is a threat to the very survival of the human race. 
What are the reasons for corporate TV’s lack of interest in the major news story of the century?The obvious answers are pressure from certain advertisers, the interests of corporate ownership, and the political intrigues of the fossil fuel industry. 
But I think it goes even deeper. 
In 2009, two years after the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report said, “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal,” TV coverage of climate change was at its height – a whopping 205 minutes for the entire year. Even former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich appeared in an ad with Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi calling for action on climate warming. 
Then something happened. 
A large section of the elites looked at what it would really take to meet the target scientists said was necessary to mitigate and stop the terrible consequences of climate change. They said, “No way.” 
The transformation required to drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels and move to a green economy would change who has power and how business is done. There is no way to achieve the necessary reduction in carbon emissions without serious government regulation, a strengthening of the public sector, and massive public investment. All this requires a reduction in the political power of the fossil fuel industry and the financial elites associated with it. 
Gingrich renounced the Pelosi ad in 2011. 
The majority of the billionaires who control the commanding heights of the economy and politics are more interested in short-term profits and immediate personal gratification than some “long-term” threat. They either fight against all climate change legislative action or support relatively weak measures to reduce carbon emissions – better than nothing, but far from what scientists say is required. 
For most people of wealth it comes down to a simple calculation: My family and I will be ok . As the IPCC puts it: “Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.” 
People who understand the scale of the systemic risk are marginalized by corporate media and thus are marginalized in politics. 
A critical task in engaging large numbers of ordinary people in fighting and voting for a rational climate change policy is breaking the corporate monopoly on daily video news. We must create an independent, uncompromising source of global climate change news and investigative reports. 
The very first story ever produced by TRNN in 2007 was an interview series with George Monbiot on the urgent climate change threat. We produced a series titled “Who Cares About Bangladesh” soon afterwards. 
We reported directly from the COP21 Climate Conference in Paris. 
We did in-depth interviews with climatologists like Dr. Alan Robock and Dr. Michael Mann who both worked on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
Economist Robert Pollin has appeared in numerous interviews with specific proposals for a transition to a green economy. 
We recently interviewed the esteemed actor Emma Thompson while she was onboard a Greenpeace vessel in the Arctic. 
We’ve reported on environmental activism from all over the world. 
We will soon be releasing the documentary “The Doubt Machine: The Koch Brothers War on Climate Science” narrated by Emma Thompson. 
With our limited resources we have produced more than 535 reports on climate change since the fall of 2007 when we started our service. In 2015, we produced 1029 minutes of programming about climate change. That’s more than seven times of all the major networks combined . 
We have produced more than 10,000 reports and interviews overall since we began our daily production. We also cover international and national news and now have a bureau in Baltimore reporting on the problems and solutions to the crisis of urban America. Millions of people have watched. We average 1.5 million views per month. 
While we have worked hard to keep a focus on climate change, what we have accomplished is far from enough. We need a Climate Bureau with sufficient resources to become a major daily video climate news service for online and TV. 
The power of daily video news is what shapes most people’s world view and the field is dominated by news organizations that will not seriously address the problem or are in fact, part of the “doubt machine.” 
It is clear that a radical change in the way the world produces and uses energy is required. Currently, about 82% of energy produced in the world is obtained by burning fossil fuels. How we produce energy without burning fossil fuels will be critically important as the world population is expected to grow by 40% to 10 billion by 2050.

2719,F.D.A. Agrees to New Trials for Ecstasy as Relief for PTSD Patients - The New York Times,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   After three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, C. J. Hardin wound up hiding from the world in a backwoods cabin in North Carolina. Divorced, alcoholic and at times suicidal, he had tried almost all the accepted treatments for   stress disorder: psychotherapy, group therapy and nearly a dozen different medications. “Nothing worked for me, so I put aside the idea that I could get better,” said Mr. Hardin, 37. “I just pretty much became a hermit in my cabin and never went out. ” Then, in 2013, he joined a small drug trial testing whether PTSD could be treated with MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy. “It changed my life,” he said in a recent interview in the bright, airy living room of the suburban ranch house here, where he now lives while going to college and working as an airplane mechanic. “It allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward. ” Based on promising results like Mr. Hardin’s, the Food and Drug Administration gave permission Tuesday for   Phase 3 clinical trials of the drug  —   a final step before the possible approval of Ecstasy as a prescription drug. If successful, the trials could turn an illicit street substance into a potent treatment for PTSD. Through a spokeswoman, the F. D. A. declined to comment, citing regulations that prohibit disclosing information about drugs that are being developed. “I’m cautious but hopeful,” said Dr. Charles R. Marmar, the head of psychiatry at New York University’s Langone School of Medicine, a leading PTSD researcher who was not involved in the study. “If they can keep getting good results, it will be of great use. PTSD can be very hard to treat. Our best therapies right now don’t help 30 to 40 percent of people. So we need more options. ” But he expressed concern about the potential for abuse. “It’s a   drug, and we know people are prone to abuse it,” he said. “Prolonged use can lead to serious damage to the brain. ” The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a small nonprofit created in 1985 to advocate the legal medical use of MDMA, LSD, marijuana and other banned drugs, sponsored six Phase 2 studies treating a total of 130 PTSD patients with the stimulant. It will also fund the Phase 3 research, which will include at least 230 patients. Two trials here in Charleston focused on treating combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and police and firefighters with PTSD who had not responded to traditional prescription drugs or psychotherapy. Patients had, on average, struggled with symptoms for 17 years. After three doses of MDMA administered under a psychiatrist’s guidance, the patients reported a 56 percent decrease of severity of symptoms on average, one study found. By the end of the study,   no longer met the criteria for having PTSD.   examinations found that improvements lasted more than a year after therapy. “We can sometimes see this kind of remarkable improvement in traditional psychotherapy, but it can take years, if it happens at all,” said Dr. Michael C. Mithoefer, the psychiatrist who conducted the trials here. “We think it works as a catalyst that speeds the natural healing process. ” The researchers are so optimistic that they have applied for   breakthrough therapy status with the Food and Drug Administration, which would speed the approval process. If approved, the drug could be available by 2021. Under the researchers’ proposal for approval, the drug would be used a limited number of times in the presence of trained psychotherapists as part of a broader course of therapy. But even in those controlled circumstances, some scientists worry that approval as a therapy could encourage more illegal recreational use. “It sends the message that this drug will help you solve your problems, when often it just creates problems,” said Andrew Parrott, a psychologist at Swansea University in Wales who has studied the brains of chronic Ecstasy users. “This is a messy drug we know can do damage. ” Allowing doctors to administer the drug to treat a disorder, he warned, could inadvertently lead to a wave of abuse similar to the current opioid crisis. During initial studies, patients went through 12 weeks of psychotherapy, including three   sessions in which they took MDMA. During the sessions, they lay on a futon amid candles and fresh flowers, listening to soothing music. Dr. Mithoefer and his wife, Ann Mithoefer, and often their portly terrier mix, Flynn, sat with each patient, guiding them through traumatic memories. “The medicine allows them to look at things from a different place and reclassify them,” said Ms. Mithoefer, a psychiatric nurse. “Honestly, we don’t have to do much. Each person has an innate ability to heal. We just create the right conditions. ” Research has shown that the drug causes the brain to release a flood of hormones and neurotransmitters that evoke feelings of trust, love and   while also muting fear and negative emotional memories that can be overpowering in patients with   stress disorder. Patients say the drug gave them heightened clarity and ability to address their problems. For years after his combat deployments, Mr. Hardin said he was sleepless and on edge. His dreams were marked with explosions and death. The Army gave him sleeping pills and antidepressants. When they didn’t work, he turned to alcohol and began withdrawing from the world. “I just felt hopeless and in the dark,” he said. “But the MDMA sessions showed me a light I could move toward. Now I’m out of the darkness and the world is all around me. ” Since the trial, he has gone back to school and remarried. The chemist Alexander Shulgin first realized the   traits of MDMA in the 1970s, and introduced it to psychologists he knew. Under the nickname Adam, thousands of psychologists began to use it as an aid for therapy sessions. Some researchers at the time thought the drug could be helpful for anxiety disorders, including PTSD, but before formal clinical trails could start, Adam spread to dance clubs and college campuses under the name Ecstasy, and in 1985, the Drug Enforcement Administration made it a Schedule 1 drug, barring all legal use. Since then, the number of people seeking treatment for PTSD has exploded and psychiatry has struggled to keep pace. Two drugs approved for treating the disorder worked only mildly better than placebos in trials. Current psychotherapy approaches are often slow and many patients drop out when they don’t see results. Studies have shown combat veterans are particularly hard to treat. In interviews, study participants said MDMA therapy had not only helped them with painful memories, but also had helped them stop abusing alcohol and other drugs and put their lives back together. On a recent evening, Edward Thompson, a former firefighter, tucked his twin    girls into bed, turned on their night light, then joined his wife at a backyard fire. “If it weren’t for MDMA   …     ” he said. “He’d be dead,” his wife, Laura, finished. They both nodded. Years of responding to gory accidents left Mr. Thompson, 30, in a near constant state of panic that he had tried to numb with alcohol and prescription opiates and benzodiazepines. By 2015, efforts at therapy had failed, and so had several family interventions. His wife had left with their children, and he was considering jumping in front of a bus. A member of a conservative Anglican church, Mr. Thompson had never used illegal drugs. But he was struggling with addiction from his prescription drugs, so he at first rejected a suggestion by his therapist that he enter the study. “In the end, I was out of choices,” he said. Three sessions with the drug gave him the clarity, he said, to identify his problems and begin to work through them. He does not wish to take the drug again. “It gave me my life back, but it wasn’t a party drug,” he said. “It was a lot of work. ”",0

2721,The FBI Can’t Actually Investigate a Candidate Such as Hillary Clinton.,"Posted on November 4, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse, originally posted at strategic-culture.org The power above the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is the U.S. Attorney General, and, above that person, the U.S. President. That’s whom the FBI actually serves — not the U.S. public. This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton: Not only is she the current President’s ardently preferred and designated successor — and overwhelmingly supported also by America’s artistocracy and endorsed by the aristocracy’s press — but the top leadership of the FBI have terms-in-office that (unlike, for example, the term of the U.S. Attorney General) do not end with the installation of the next President; and these people will therefore be serving, quite possibly, the very same person whom they are now ‘investigating’. This is the reason why James Comey, the FBI’s Director, let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th, when he declined to present the case to a grand jury: he and the rest of the FBI’s top management violated three basic principles of trying white-collar-crime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person — he (and they) wanted to keep their jobs, not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss. If America were an authentic democracy, there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the U.S. President doesn’t want it to. According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter, the U.S. federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy. This was reluctantly reported by the researchers, whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government. They found that the U.S., at the federal level, is not a democracy but an “oligarchy,” by which the researchers were referring to an “economic elite,” America’s billionaires and centi-millionaires who control America’s international corporations and the ‘charities’ (such as think tanks) that are dependent upon them — including many that directly affect U.S. politics, such as the think tanks or other way-stations for former U.S. government employees to become hired by private firms. The authors of the only empirical scientific research-study that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy , or instead a dictatorship, excluded the very term “aristocracy” (or “collective dictatorship” such as an “economic elite” is if that “elite” actually is in control of the given nation’s government) from their article. They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the U.S. public. In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists, aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power, not (like in former eras) display their power by crowns and other public symbols of ‘the nobility’. The closest the study’s authors came to using that term, “aristocracy,” was their only sentence that employed the pejoritave term for an aristocracy, “oligarchy.” That obscure lone sentence was: “Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of ‘Oligarchy,’ in which the wealthiest citizens — even in a ‘civil oligarchy’ like the United States — dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection.11″ Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy , by Jeffrey A. Winters, which stated the ‘theory’ that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case. Their article mentioned the book — and the “oligarchy” — only in this one footnote, so that the authors of the article (whose own careers are dependent upon America’s ‘oligarchs’) won’t be able to be accused by oligarchs (or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors — America’s aristocrats) to have called the U.S. an “oligarchy” (a collective dictatorship by the few super-rich and their agents). To apply either term — “aristocracy” or “oligarchy” — to one’s own country, is now viewed as negative, an insult to the country’s controlling elite. Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders. This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social ‘scientists’ who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public. Doing it this way is safer for them, because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate, against them or else against the institutions that hire them, by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support (such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an “expert”). (This type of fear prevents theory in the social ‘sciences’ from being strictly based upon the given field’s empirical findings: it’s not authentically scientific. The physical sciences are far less corrupt, far more scientific. The biological sciences are in-between.) One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the U.S. government an “aristocracy,” is that everyone knows that the Founders of the U.S. were opposed to , and were engaged in overthrowing, the existing aristocracy, which happened to be British, and that they even banned forever in the U.S. the use of aristocratic titles, such as “Lord” or “Sir.” Consequently, within the U.S., the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats, is “oligarchs,” which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries , and so is considered safe by the aristocrats’ writers (including scholars and political pundits) to use. Everyone knows: in accord with the clear intention of America’s Founders , the U.S. should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat (any self-enclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government), but Americans naturally accept the existence of “oligarchs” in other countries (and “good-riddance to them there”), typically the ones in countries U.S. foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion (any form of conquest, such as in 2003 Iraq, or 2011 Libya). It’s fine to refer to other countries’ aristocracies as ‘oligarchies’, because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and ‘deserving’ of overthrow. Thus, any aristocracy that is opposed to America’s aristocracy (especially one that’s opposed to being controlled by the U.S. aristocracy), and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation, can acceptably be overthrown by coup (such as Ukraine 2014 was) or invasion (such as Libya 2011 was). Thus, calling a foreign aristocracy an “oligarchy” is supportive of, not oppposed to, the U.S. aristocracy — and, so, “oligarchy” is the term the authors used (on that one occasion, and they never used the prohibited term “aristocracy”). Nonetheless, despite the cultural ban on describing the U.S. as an “aristocracy,” the authors were — as obscurely as they were able — proving that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no authentic democracy at all. Or, again, as they said it in their least-obscurantist phrasing of it: “Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis, even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites. Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans — though useful, and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases — is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups. Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure. The real-world impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater.” ‘Greater’ than what? They didn’t say. That’s because what they were saying (as obscurely as possible) is that it’s probably ‘greater’ than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them, and upon which data their clear finding is that the U.S. is an aristocracy, no democracy at all. Or, as they also put it: “Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis.” But, actually, “Economic Elite Domination theories” (virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires — and centi-millionaires — and their corporations, and their think tanks, and their lobbyists, etc.) did phenomenally well, in their findings, not just ‘rather well’ — they simply can’t safely say this. Saying it is samizdat, in the U.S. dictatorship. They were allowed to prove it, but not to say it. So, that’s what they did. They didn’t want to “upset the applecart” from which they themselves are feeding. The simplest (but no less accurate) way of stating their finding is: the U.S., at least during the period the researchers probed, which was 1981-2002, was an aristocracy, no democracy at all. The U.S., in other words, was (even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people) a country of men (and women — that’s to say, of individuals ) not of laws; it’s a dictatorship, in short; it is not a country “of laws, not of men” . America’s Founders have finally lost. The country has been taken over by an aristocracy. And one of those “men” now, is actually Hillary Clinton, even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power. They know she soon might be. That’s why, the FBI cannot really, and seriously , investigate her. It’s not for legal reasons at all. It’s because of whom she is. In fact, purely on the basis of U.S. laws, she clearly ought to be in prison . Any honest lawyer, inside or outside the FBI, has long known this, because the actual case against her is ‘slam-dunk’ , even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its ‘investigation’ only to peripheral ‘national security’ issues. (The #2 person at FBI, Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, right below Director James Comey, specified this limitation to his ‘investigators’. They simply weren’t allowed to investigate her, except on the hardest-to-prove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do. The slam-dunks were just off-limits to them. McCabe’s wife’s political campaign had received $675,000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe , a close friend of the Clintons, who chaired Hillary’s 2008 Presidential campaign. And, even on the harder-to-prove matters, which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue, they stood a strong chance of winning, if only Comey hadn’t prevented their moving forward to try — but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her, anyway.) There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms. Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system, and intent isn’t even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted — the actions themselves convict her, and the only relevance that intent might have, regarding any of these laws, would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be. I have already presented the texts of these six laws (and you can see the sentences for each one, right there), and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes, unambiguously without any doubt, what she now admits having done. Most of these crimes don’t require any intent in order to convict (and the ones that do require intent are only “knowingly … conceals,” or else “with the intent to impair the object’s … use in an official proceeding,” both of which “intents” would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public — but others of these laws don’t require even that); and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved, at all . It’s just not an issue in these laws. Thus, conviction under them is far easier. If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone, he’ll be aiming to get indictments on the easiest-to-prove charges, first. That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual plea-bargain. As Alan Dershowitz said , commenting on one famous prosecution: “They also wanted a slam-dunk case. They wanted the strongest possible case.” Comey simply didn’t; he wanted the hardest -to-convict case. His presentation was a brazen hoax. That’s all. That’s the real scandal, and nobody (other than I) has been writing about it as what it is — a hoax. But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House. Either she gets a term in the White House, or else she gets a (much longer) term in prison — or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law, even though not serving as a federal official. Even if she is convicted only on these six slam-dunk statutes (and on none other, including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5th that, “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case”), she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison (73 = 5 + 5 + 20 + 20 + 3 + 10 + 10). Adding on others she might also have committed (such as the ones that Comey was referring to, all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information), would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still, but what’s important in the email case isn’t that; it’s to convict her on, essentially, theft and/or destruction of U.S. government documents by means of transferring them into her private email and/or smashing hard drives. No one, not even a U.S. federal official, can legally do that, and those six laws are specifically against it. Motive is important in Ms. Clinton’s email case, because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the U.S. Secretary of State: was it because she didn’t want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the U.S. State Department’s policies in return for their million-dollar-plus donations to the Clinton Foundation , and maybe even selling to them (and/or their cronies) U.S. government contracts, or why? However, those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office, not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself; and those other crimes (whatever they might have been) would have been explored only after an indictment on the slam-dunks, and for further possible prosecutions, if President Obama’s people were serious about investigating her. They weren’t. Clearly, this is selective ‘justice’. That’s the type of ‘justice’ an aristocracy imposes. Why, then, did Comey finally switch to re-open the Clinton case? It wasn’t merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener, husband to Hillary’s closest aide Huma Abedin. As Politico on October 28th reported , “Another former Justice official said Comey’s letter [announcing the re-opening of Hillary’s case] could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons. ‘He’s come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how he’s handled this. He’s trying to gain back some of their respect,’ former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. ‘His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks.’” Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th, “The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation” , and reported: “Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened. DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI, Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation. … Finally, diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Friday’s interview. An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, both wrongly granted immunity , were not destroyed after all as previously reported, but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the in-house whitewash.” In other words: Comey was between a rock (the resignation-letters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law) and a hard place (his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below). The U.S. wasn’t yet that kind of dictatorship — one which could withstand such a public disclosure. In order for it to become one, the aristocracy’s control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is. Also on the 30th, Ed Klein in Britain’s Dail Mail bannered : EXCLUSIVE: Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was wrong: Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation James Comey revived the investigation of Clinton’s email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents, sources say The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim [Comey] announced last July that he wouldn’t recommend an indictment against Hillary He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents So, does this now mean that, finally, the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing and/or trying to destroy federal documents? There has never — at least since 1981 — been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is (as those researchers found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002) an “oligarchy.” However, a serious criminal prosecution of Ms. Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship. The present writer will make no prediction. However, obviously, the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome. Since I think that anyone but a complete fool can recognize this much, I’m confident enough to assert it — a conditional about the future.",0

2724,The Latest Celebrity Diet? Cyberbullying - The New York Times,"The reality TV star Rob Kardashian had a family matter to discuss, so naturally, he turned to Twitter. “Didn’t invite the Mother of my child to a baby shower you all were trying to throw for me! !?” he tweeted late last month, reigniting the feud between the   clan and his model fiancée, Blac Chyna. “You all must have lost your damn minds. ” In retaliation for the slight, he tweeted out his little sister Kylie Jenner’s phone number. Mr. Kardashian, in internet parlance, had doxxed Ms. Jenner  —   he published personal, private information about her online, seemingly without her consent. It’s a maneuver harassers use to humiliate, intimidate or silence their targets. It also helped Mr. Kardashian score his most popular tweet ever. Lately, celebrity feuds have taken on the contours of cyberbullying, with famous rivals integrating the tactics of online harassers into their P. R. offensives. What looks like a public display of immaturity can actually be part of a sophisticated image management strategy. Retweet counts and Instagram followers are the new Billboard 100, and celebrities can gin up their numbers by instigating feuds with one another in increasingly nasty or technologically intriguing ways. But the game can have a dark side, especially for the losers. The modern celebrity arsenal incorporates these other digital bullying tools: SECRET RECORDINGS The celebrity squabble of the summer exploded when Kim Kardashian West released a surreptitiously recorded Taylor Swift talking on the phone with Ms. Kardashian West’s husband, Kanye West  —   a bid to prove that Ms. Swift had preapproved his controversial lyrics about her in his song “Famous. ” Ms. Kardashian West posted the video evidence to Snapchat in July. (Such recordings are illegal in some states, including California, and run afoul of YouTube’s harassment rules.)  SEXUAL HUMILIATION When the rappers Wiz Khalifa and Mr. West tussled on Twitter in January, Amber Rose, their mutual ex, stepped in to tease Mr. West about their sex life. And when Justin Bieber’s   Selena Gomez waded into his Instagram comments to scold him for posting pictures with a new girlfriend and to accuse him of cheating on her, he struck back by accusing her of using the relationship for attention. REVENGE PORN After the teenage actress Chloë Grace Moretz tweeted dismissively about the   feud, yet another Kardashian  —   Kim’s sister Khloé  —   responded by posting a photo of a woman resembling Ms. Moretz. She had jumped onto a young man’s back on the beach, and her bikini bottoms were yanked to the side, revealing everything underneath. Ms. Moretz tweeted back to debunk the depantsing, writing that Ms. Kardashian had instead exposed “some girl who was wrongfully photographed. ” MOB DEPLOYMENT For celebrities with the most rabid fandoms, even an oblique nod from the star can set off a fan stampede. After Ms. Kardashian West posted the Snapchat video of Ms. Swift’s phone call, Kanye fans and allies  —   many aligned with her spurned   Calvin Harris  —   gathered under the #KimExposedTaylorParty hashtag to shovel out cruelly exultant GIFs and memes. (A commemorative   reading “In Memory of Taylor Swift, RIP, 1989 to 2016” was soon offered for sale online.) And when Ms. Kardashian West cryptically tweeted a line of snake emoji, revelers bombarded Ms. Swift’s Instagram with snake after snake after snake. It’s no coincidence that a Kardashian fingerprint can be lifted from many of the most   incidents. While most celebrities use the internet to promote their mainstream careers  —   movies, albums  —   Ms. Kardashian West’s core product is herself. Stirring up dramatic personal narratives on her reality television show and social media accounts is her main event. Ms. Swift, who studiously avoids confrontation while writing veiled riddles about her   and frenemies into her songs, didn’t stand a chance. Ms. Kardashian West’s assault was part of a multiplatform offensive. On Twitter, she leveraged Ms. Swift’s phone call to advertise her new Snapchat account. And she went on to milk the publicity by posting another Snapchat video of herself singing along to the “Famous” lyrics in question. Her clip became an internet blockbuster not only because of the story it told but also because of the tactics it deployed. In the polished world of celebrity P. R. it’s exceptional to see a celebrity exposed in a private moment, especially by one of her own kind. Meanwhile, Ms. Swift was put on the defensive, left to quibble about the details of the exchange in a   message that she typed on Apple’s Notes app. She then took a screen shot of it and posted it to Instagram. Her   response to Ms. Kardashian West’s raucous exposé  —   “I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative”  —   soon curdled into a mocking meme. Who was in the right didn’t matter  —   Ms. Kardashian West won the game. Blac Chyna, who recently clawed her way into the Kardashian universe through her relationship with Rob, has proved a quick study. A few days after Mr. Kardashian doxxed his sister, Ms. Chyna posted his number to Twitter, too, then toggled over to Snapchat to explain that she’d done it to compel her fiancé to change his number  —   and flush out all the women who had been texting him. It was a strategic move, both personally and professionally  —   it locked down her man, drew attention to her suite of social accounts and stirred interest in the couple’s E! reality series, “Rob  Chyna. ” You’d think that the utter savageness on display here would horrify fans. Online celebrity feuds capitalize on some of the most vile and destructive social ideas: that sexual shaming is an acceptable response to a stated opinion that women are manipulative liars and that a person who missteps in a private dispute deserves to be punished by the crowd. And these days, nearly everybody has a story about being subjected to similar abuse online. Occasionally,    attacks backfire: In May, the rapper Azealia Banks posted a racist tirade against the pop star Zayn Malik and soon found herself booted from Twitter for violating its harassment policy. But most of the time, salty celebrities have little to lose and millions of followers to gain. “Bullying” and “harassment” are amorphous categories, and the seriousness we attach to these tactics varies considerably depending on the power dynamics at play. Unlike the muscled jock who picks on the scrawny nerd, the straight teenager who harasses the gay kid or the jilted boyfriend who uses the cover of the internet to mar his ex’s reputation, these celebrity cases can make us feel like mere mortals peering up at a couple of Greek gods shooting lightning bolts at each other. For some fans, their own experiences with harassment may fuel their desire to see the rich and famous get dragged down to their level. Instead of pity and concern for the targeted party, celebrity harassment produces in fans feelings of both fascination and schadenfreude. For the famous person caught in the cross hairs, though, it’s not always so fun. Just ask Ms. Swift, who called Ms. Kardashian West’s stunt “character assassination. ” Or the pop star Demi Lovato, who announced a career hiatus last week after getting dragged across Twitter over dismissive comments about Ms. Swift she made in a magazine interview. (“Taking a break from the spotlight,” Ms. Lovato tweeted last week. “I am not meant for this business and the media. ”) Or Ms. Moretz, who did not deserve to be sexually humiliated for subtweeting Ms. Kardashian West. It’s a P. R. game, until it’s a real thing.",0
2725,Top Hillary Official Leads Prayer Chain Hoping To Save Imploding Campaign,"Top Hillary Official Leads Prayer Chain Hoping To Save Imploding Campaign Posted on October 31, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This 
Democrats are constantly attacking Christianity while fighting to have God completely removed from our institutions, and evidence of their godless agenda was on full display during the Democratic National Convention, when they removed all references to God. However, now that Hillary’s campaign is imploding, Democrats are evoking the name of God, as a last-ditch effort to save her campaign. 
It doesn’t take a brain surgeon to see that Hillary and her presidential race is going down in flames. She continues to drop in the polls, while many of her previous supporters are now ditching her and flocking to early voting stations to cast their votes for Trump. As things progressively spiral out of control in the aftermath of the FBI reopening their investigation, chairwoman for the DNC is now calling on Hillary supporters to evoke the name of God and pray for “divine intervention” to save crooked Hillary’s deteriorating presidential campaign. 
Shortly after news broke of the FBI’s decision, chairwoman Donna Brazile immediately jumped on Twitter, leading liberals in somewhat of a social media prayer chain for Hillary. As evidenced by the heart and retweet buttons, Hillary’s supporters echoed the sentiments of Brazile’s desperate plea for God’s divine intervention to save Hillary’s imploding campaign. Please God, let this end soon

Unfortunately, Brazile wasn’t done mocking God quite yet. It looks like she even dusted off her Bible to find a verse she could twist for her political use, as she then blasted lines from the book of Psalms, accompanied with a frantic message to Hillary supporters to get out and vote. Exhaling every time I get distracted. Let's work until the midnight hour. Are you fired up and ready to vote? Keep you eyes on the prize! https://t.co/wnSixsJYu3

Now, I’m no Biblical scholar, but I do know that God explicitly states in the Bible that he will not be mocked. Being that the Democratic Party is the epitome of evil as the original proponents of slavery and abortion, it’s truly asinine that these idiots think God is suddenly going to have their backs and assist them with getting the evilest and vilest person on planet earth elected into the White House. 
Trump supporters were quick to catch the absolute irony of Brazile’s Twitter antics and immediately began firing back with some hilarious responses of their own: @donnabrazile Please golden, sweet Jesus… #DrainTheSwamp quickly!! Let's all #MakeAmericaGreatAgain and get these criminals out of here! pic.twitter.com/wsf3zx26LL

Nice try, Democrats. Maybe if you hadn’t made it your number 1 priority to erase God from our schools and governmental institutions in recent years, He might look down favorably upon you now, in your darkest hour. 
As for me, I will continue to get on my knees every night, begging for God’s mercy and asking not for my will but for His will to be done. Being that God is on the side of justice, I seriously doubt that if Hillary does manage to win, that He would have had anything to do in assisting in that devastating outcome!",0

Trump may have done some stupid things years ago, but he doesn’t have a history of covering up scandals and playing insider politics to promote his career. Advertisement - story continues below

2727,Re: Why Donald Trump Must Shut Down The Federal Reserve And Start Issuing Debt-Free Money,"Why Donald Trump Must Shut Down The Federal Reserve And Start Issuing Debt-Free Money By   16th, 2016 
If Donald Trump truly wants to fix the economy, he must shut down the Federal Reserve. If he just tries to patch up our current system, he will fail, because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning. A little over a century ago, very powerful forces on Wall Street convinced Congress to completely restructure our financial system. An immensely powerful central bank known as the Federal Reserve was created, and the goal was to transform the U.S. dollar into a debt-based currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape. Sadly, they were successful on both counts. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined by approximately 98 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger . 
Americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the U.S. economy to our presidents, but the truth is that an unelected, unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does. The Federal Reserve has become known as “ the fourth branch of government “, but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the Fed’s decisions are “above politics” because they are “too important”. Fed officials fiercely guard their “independence”, and they fiercely resist any “interference” from Congress, the President, or the American people. 
Donald Trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations, but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the Fed wields. The Fed controls interest rates, the Fed controls the money supply, and the Fed regulates the banks. 
To give you an idea of how enormously powerful the Fed is, I want you to pull out a dollar bill. 
As you look at that dollar bill, I want you to notice that it says “Federal Reserve Note” right at the top. 
In the financial world, a “note” is an instrument of debt, and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible. 
So why are we using debt-based “Federal Reserve Notes” in the first place? Shouldn’t Congress have control over our currency? 
According to Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , it is Congress that has the authority to “coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures”. 
So how did the Fed get involved? 
Well, it is a very long and convoluted story, and if you are interested in the history behind it I would commend to you an excellent book by C. Edward Griffin entitled “ The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve “. Basically, big money interests on Wall Street got their hooks into the White House and Congress, and they rushed through legislation right before Christmas in 1913 that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the American people and put it into their hands. 
Sadly, most Americans don’t even realize that we have a debt-based currency, nor do they understand where our money comes from. In a previous article , I discussed how money is normally created by the Federal Reserve under our current system… 
When the U.S. government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have, it does not print up a billion dollars. 
Rather, the U.S. government creates a bunch of U.S. Treasury bonds (debt) and takes them over to the Federal Reserve. 
The Federal Reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the U.S. Treasury bonds. 
The Federal Reserve takes the U.S. Treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the “Federal Reserve Notes” that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder . But of course this process always creates more debt than it does money… 
The U.S. Treasury bonds that the Federal Reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the Federal Reserve system. 
But wait. 
There is a problem. 
Because the U.S. government must pay interest on the Treasury bonds, the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created. 
So where will the U.S. government get the money to pay that debt? 
Well, the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really, really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt. 
But that never actually happens, does it? 
And the creators of the Federal Reserve understood this as well. They understood that the U.S. government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt. They knew that the U.S. government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game. 
So our debt just keeps going up and up and up. While Barack Obama has been in the White House our national debt has risen by more than 9 trillion dollars, and at this moment it is sitting just under the 20 trillion dollar mark . 
But we shouldn’t be surprised by this, because this is precisely what the Federal Reserve system was designed to do to us. 
Many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday, but as I have shown in a previous article, this is mathematically impossible to do . 
If the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt, and of course we have   of household debt,   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well. 
Under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt. 
And of course it isn’t just the United States that is in this predicament. At this point, almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank. 
Even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else, somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption. 
As you read this article, well over 99.9% of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank. 
Do you think that is just a coincidence? 
Of course there are still a few very small countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia that do not have a central bank, but the only big nation not to have one is North Korea. 
And you would literally have to be insane to want to live in North Korea. 
But now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system. The truth is that we don’t have to have a central bank. In fact, the greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history was when there was no central bank . 
We don’t need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply. They will never admit this, but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts. 
Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions : 1918, 1920, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1937, 1945, 1949, 1953, 1958, 1960, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001, 2008. 
Considering their track record, isn’t it time for a change? 
And we don’t have to have a debt-based currency. In fact, not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debt-free “United States Notes”. 
Back in 1963, President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order 11110 which authorized the U.S. Treasury to issue debt-free “United States Notes” which were directly created by the U.S. government. 
He was assassinated shortly thereafter. 
Most Americans don’t realize this, but many of the debt-free United States Notes that were issued under President Kennedy are still in circulation today , and President Trump could do something similar. 
But will he? 
It has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender, and the Federal Reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves. 
Debt is a form of social control, and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet. The total amount of debt in the world just hit   of 152 trillion dollars , and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become. 
  here in the United States that starts with shutting   issuing debt-free currency. It would take someone very bold to make a move like this, and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task.",0
2728,Dems File Complaint w/DOJ Against FBI for Investigating Hillary,"Dems File Complaint w/DOJ Against FBI for Investigating Hillary   
It's an obviously absurd move, but considering that the DOJ has become a transparently political organization that abuses and attacks law enforcement on a regular basis including, in the Eric Garner case, the FBI, this is just how things work in the hall of mirrors that the left has made . 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility on Friday against FBI Director James Comey for interfering in the Presidential election, following the FBI’s decision to open up an investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails this close to Election Day. Federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the Hatch Act. 
“It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” 
It's silly grandstanding and seems easy enough to dismiss.Except that bizarre and unlikely tactics, no longer are. There was outrage over MoveOn's attack on Petraeus and even most Dems thought that it was unhelpful. This attack on Comey I suspect will meet with little criticism. Some Dems will consider it a helpful preemptive move even though with his track record, Comey is as likely to hurt Hillary as he is himself.",0
2729,Prince Died From Accidental Overdose of Opioid Painkiller - The New York Times,"Prince, the music icon who struggled with debilitating hip pain during his career, died from an accidental overdose of   fentanyl, a type of synthetic opiate, officials in Minnesota said Thursday. The news ended weeks of speculation about the sudden death of the musician, who had a reputation for clean living but who appears to have developed a dependency on medications to treat his pain. Authorities have yet to discuss how he came to be in possession of the fentanyl and whether it had been prescribed by a doctor. Officials had waited several weeks for the results of a toxicology test undertaken as part of an autopsy performed after he was found dead April 21 in an elevator at his estate. He was preparing to enroll in an opioid treatment program when he died at 57, according to the lawyer for a doctor who was planning to treat him. The Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office, which conducted the autopsy, declined to comment beyond releasing a copy of its findings. The Carver County Sheriff’s Office is continuing to investigate the death with help from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. The sheriff’s office had said it was looking into whether opioid abuse was a factor, and a law enforcement official had said that painkillers were found on Prince when investigators arrived. “The M. E. report is one piece of the whole thing,” said Jason Kamerud, the county’s chief deputy sheriff. Fentanyl is a potent but dangerous painkiller, estimated to be more than 50 times more powerful than heroin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report did not list how much fentanyl was found in Prince’s blood. Last year, federal officials issued an alert that said incidents and overdoses with fentanyl were “occurring at an alarming rate throughout the United States. ” Weeks before his death, Prince postponed a concert in Atlanta, saying that he had the flu. A week later, he made up the show, but on the flight home to Minneapolis, he fell unconscious and his private jet made an emergency landing in Moline, Ill. There, emergency medical personnel treated him with Narcan, a drug typically used to counteract the effects of an opioid overdose, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter. Prince told his friends and associates after that emergency that he was O. K. His publicist said he had the flu and that this was what had led to the emergency landing. But a concerned friend later reached out to a   doctor who specializes in treating opioid addictions, in hopes of getting him into treatment, according to William Mauzy, a lawyer for the doctor, Howard Kornfeld. On April 20, Dr. Kornfeld sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, who is not a doctor but works at his father’s clinic, on a   flight to Prince’s Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen, Minn. Mr. Mauzy said. But when Andrew Kornfeld arrived on the morning of April 21, he and two members of Prince’s staff found the singer lifeless. He then called 911. Andrew Kornfeld was carrying a drug used to treat opioid addiction, but Mr. Mauzy said he hoped his client, who was not authorized to dispense medications, would not be charged with any crime, in part because of a good Samaritan law that allows people to call 911 to get someone help without worrying about criminal consequences. Mr. Mauzy said neither Kornfeld had given Prince any medication. The medical examiner’s report listed Prince, who was    as weighing 112 pounds and said he had been dressed all in black that morning, including a black cap. His death came at a time when an opioid addiction epidemic has been sweeping the United States. Studies showed that more than 28, 000 people died from opioids, which includes heroin and painkillers, in 2014, and 4. 3 million people were taking pain medication for nonmedical purposes that year. Fentanyl can be consumed in a variety of ways, including through patches, injections, smoking and a lollipop. It is unclear what method Prince used. Dr. Torin Finver, an addiction medicine specialist at the Jacobs School of Medicine at the University at Buffalo, said it can be easier to overdose on the drug because its effects last shorter than they do for other opiates, thus leading users to dose more frequently and possibly consume too much. The illicit shipment of fentanyl into the United States has become a major concern for federal officials, who say the substance has become an increasingly popular product of drug cartels in Mexico and is often mixed with heroin. Prince’s body was worn down from decades of taxing performances, in which he often did splits or jumped from heights in platform shoes, several people close to him said. One person who knew him said that Prince had hip surgery in the   but it did not completely alleviate his pain. The medical examiner’s report noted a scar on Prince’s left hip as well as one on his lower right leg. To some of Prince’s closest friends and colleagues, his struggle with pain medication came as a surprise because the musician had become a Jehovah’s Witness and strove, friends said, to live such a clean life. He was averse to drinking alcohol and frowned on the use of recreational drugs. He typically ate a vegan diet, and would not allow meat in his house. “It doesn’t matter what people say after you are gone,” Cassandra O’Neal, Prince’s keyboardist for the last seven years, said after being told of the overdose report. “What matters is what they meant to you when they were here. Prince is still a genius and one of the most gifted artists I ever worked with. ” Investigators have used search warrants as they look for evidence in the case and collected records from medical personnel who treated him in the final months of his life, including one Minnesota doctor, Michael Schulenberg who had seen him the day before he died. It was unclear what Dr. Schulenberg saw Prince for, but he had also seen him weeks earlier, the same day that Prince had postponed the Atlanta show. Dr. Schulenberg also prescribed medications for Prince, according to an affidavit filed by an investigator in support of a search warrant, though it did not specify the drugs. There has been no indication from investigators that Dr. Schulenberg prescribed opiates to Prince. “He was interviewed on April 22,” said Amy S. Conners, the doctor’s lawyer, “and fully cooperated and has received no further requests from any investigators. ”",0
2730,Tech Billionaires Create Fund to Prevent Robot Apocalypse - Breitbart,"Some of the tech world’s elites have come together to fund research that hopes to protect humanity from the rise of artificial intelligence. [LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman and eBay Founder Pierre Omidyar’s Omidyar Network have each donated $10 million dollars to the “Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund. ” The Knight Foundation has contributed $5 million to the cause, while Raptor Group founder Jim Pallotta and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation have made respective donations of $1 million.  This fund will focus on research into the inevitable ethical quandaries posed by the very nature of complex AI. As the Knight Foundation explains: Even when we don’t know it, artificial intelligence affects virtually every aspect of our modern lives. Technology and commerce will ensure it will impact every society on earth. Yet, for something so influential, there’s an odd assumption that artificial intelligence agents and machine learning, which enable computers to make decisions like humans and for humans, is a neutral process. It’s not. Even algorithms have parents, and those parents are computer programmers, with their values and assumptions. Those values  —   who gets to determine what they are and who controls their application  —   will help define the digital age. In summary, AI will only be as neutral or objective as the people who create it which is to say, probably not at all. The Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund will allocate portions of its $27 million to people dedicated to addressing this issue, and the ever more complicated questions that will arise as we move toward a future guided in large part by the intelligent constructs that already know our names, our addresses, our incomes, our children, and even our favorite foods. Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center and the MIT Media Lab will serve as “founding anchor institutions” in an effort at “bridging the gap between the humanities, the social sciences, and computing by addressing the global challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) from a multidisciplinary perspective. ” MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito outlined the “tough challenges” that “AI’s rapid development” brings with it: For example, one of the most critical challenges is how do we make sure that the machines we ‘train’ don’t perpetuate and amplify the same human biases that plague society? How can we best initiate a broader,   discussion about how society will   with this technology, and connect computer science and social sciences to develop intelligent machines that are not only ‘smart,’ but also socially responsible? According to the MIT Media Lab statement, the fund will be managed by “a small board, consisting of leadership from each participating foundation and institution,” as well as members of their faculty and “a number of other individuals from a wide range of disciplines and organizations. ” With the concept of truly intelligent artificial beings climbing even as far as the European parliament, this research seems especially relevant. According to the Berkman Klein Center, the participating organizations “welcome public engagement,” but are not currently seeking further investment from the general public. They do, however, “welcome discussions with all institutions and individuals engaging in research related to developing ethical AI in the public interest. ” Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",0
2731,"Time Saving, Common Sense Rules Proposed by Golf’s Governing Bodies - Breitbart","The two leading organizations that govern the sport of golf worldwide have proposed rule changes that could dramatically alter the game for both professional and amateur golfers. [The USGA and RA, who oversee two separate jurisdictions, but share a single code for the rules of golf and equipment standards, aim to simplify, eliminate, and bring a more common sense approach to the current rules of golf.  Incredibly, many of golf’s precepts defy logic and are arcane to the point that your most experienced amateur players, and even professionals, do not know the rules of the game. This reality prompts many golfers to carry the rule book in their golf bags to help avoid incurring penalty strokes during their rounds. Having played golf for 4o years and caddied as a teenager, I’ve always thought it kind of random that if you hit your ball into a pond you may play it where it entered the hazard and are penalized 1 stroke. Yet, if you hit your ball into the rough just off the fairway and can’t find the ball, you take a 1 stroke penalty and you have to go all the way back to where you first struck the ball, effectively making it a two stroke penalty. This one hasn’t been addressed in the latest round of proposed changes, nevertheless, there are some good ones. The USGA and the RA, determined to streamline the rules, have come up with several modifications, revisions, and eliminations, that may help make the sport played by millions around the globe more enjoyable.  Below are a few of my favorite rule changes proposed by the USGA and the RA:  —  A Player who accidentally moves one’s ball during a search for it does not incur a penalty. Current rule 1 stroke penalty.  —  A player who accidentally moves his ball or his ball marker on the green no longer would suffer a one stroke penalty.   —  A new rule dictates that when taking a drop, a player needs only to hold the golf ball one inch above the ground. The current rule of dropping a ball from shoulder height often increases the balls chances of rolling too far and forcing the golfer to  . This is   and often gives a player an opportunity to actually place the ball after three unsuccessful drops, giving him an unfair advantage.  —  One can replace a ball on the putting green when it moves from its spot after it already had been lifted and replaced. Current rules dictate golfers have to putt a ball from where it stops for instance if it is blown further from the hole by the wind. The new rule allows for the golfer to replace the ball where it was before it moved. Makes sense to me.  —  The old rule of incurring a   penalty if you sink a putt from the green with the pin in the cup would no longer apply. The player can now elect to putt with the pin in the cup at any time from any distance without incurring a penalty. Again makes sense. Why should a golfer be allowed to keep the pin in when putting off the green’s apron and not be allowed the pin when on the green.  —  Players should make each stroke in no more than 40 seconds, and usually in less time. No penalty strokes are ascribed to this recommendation, but it is by far my favorite rule for amateurs. Nothing is more exasperating than playing with or following a high handicap golfer, who takes eight practice swings, then stands over his ball for another minute before he   his   120 yards down the fairway.  As the saying goes, “rules were made to be broken. ” And you can bet these proposed ones will be broken too. That being said, click on the list to read about the explanation of all the proposed rule changes.  ",0
2732,Michael Moore Calls for ’100 Days of Resistance’ to Fight Trump,"Filmmaker Michael Moore will attend the Women’s March on Washington to protest Donald Trump’s inauguration later this month, and has called for political groups to go further  —   by staging protests and resistance actions through the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency. [In an appearance this weekend on MSNBC’s The Last Word, the    Trumpland director encouraged those opposed to Trump’s presidency to join the Women’s March on Washington scheduled for January 21, the day after the presidential inauguration.  “It’s important that everybody go there,” Moore told MSNBC’s Ari Melber. “This will have an effect. We need to throw everything at this. This man is slightly unhinged, if I can say that, and he’s a malignant narcissist. He cares very much about what people think of him. He wants to be the popular guy. And he’s going to be very upset if there’s a lot of people there. ” Moore  —   one of the first and only celebrities to predict Trump’s victory  —   also urged protesters to “get up off the couch” and organize during the first three months of Trump’s presidency. “We are gonna be busy, busy, busy,” Moore said, adding a call of support to “a hundred days of resistance. ” The filmmaker said he was encouraged to hear the hair and makeup employees at MSNBC talking about going to the Women’s March backstage before he appeared on the program. “That’s the new Americana. That’s what’s going to happen. And people are going to be relentless about this, so I’m optimistic,” he concluded. Moore worked hard to persuade voters to vote for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the general election. He released a surprise documentary critical of Trump  —   Michael Moore in TrumpLand  —   just weeks before Election Day, but a portion of the film in which Moore extols Trump’s appeal to Rust Belt voters was subsequently cut from the film and posted online, where it went viral among Trump supporters.

2733,"Julian Assange Makes VERY Suspect Post Election Announcement, Seeks Pardon From Trump","0 122 
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange’s lawyers have suggested that the globally detested, thorn in the side social figure will keep at, and even perhaps intensify, efforts to be fully pardoned by the United States once President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. 
Assange’s lawyers made the announcement after the controversial global “whistleblower” spoke with Swedish authorities who had come to consult with him within the neutral territory of the Ecuadorian embassy in the U.K. over rape charges which Assange faces in Sweden. 
Assange has been holed up in the aforementioned embassy for years in an effort to escape facing the diverse set of global charges which have been lobbed against him. 
And, as for a pivoted effort for Assange to escape the charges he faces, one directed at attempting to garner a Trump signed, U.S. presidential pardon, Assange’s lawyers said, according to London’s Evening Standard , “Through U.S. counsel, we had reached out to the Obama administration, most recently just a few months ago, and we will continue to do so with future U.S. administrations until the investigation is closed.” 
These efforts at a presidential pardon for Assange began, as noted, under the Obama administration, but with Obama’s own federal appointments and the soon to be former president himself as the ones to ever begin an investigation into Assange in the first place, efforts for an Obama pardon of Assange unsurprisingly never got anywhere. 
The U.S. investigation was first prompted by Assange’s publication of classified documents related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan delivered to him by Army whistleblower Bradley/Chelsea Manning — who, mind you, is still in American custody and doesn’t seem to have much of a hope of release anytime soon. 
Assange’s more recent work, during the lead up to Election Day, quickly turned into an elaborate anti-Clinton campaign, one viewed by American intelligence officials as backed by the Russian government in the interest of seeing their preferred candidate — Trump — elected to the presidency. 
WikiLeaks published in this time frame a huge cache of emails hacked from key members of the Democratic Party leadership and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, targeting figures from the now former party chairperson and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks also released many thousands of emails taken from Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state serving under President Obama. 
The credibility of the emails has been occasionally questioned. Indeed, even if the organization only received and hacked actual emails and the like that had actually come from Democratic Party officials. WikiLeaks was still found, on multiple occasions, to have been improperly spinning the email contents. Such as the time a mundane email about then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s UN translation providing earpiece, was spun into a fake story about Clinton using an earpiece to be fed what she was supposed to say. 
Trump is far from predictable enough for any observer to definitively suggest his course of action regarding Assange once he takes office.

2734,Re: Why Is Obama Threatening Russia With World War 3 Right Before The Election?,"Why Is Obama Threatening Russia With World War 3 Right Before The Election?   October 16th, 2016 
It sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with Russia. As I write this, we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in U.S. history, and Barack Obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the Russians. As I wrote about on Friday , Reuters is reporting that Obama is contemplating “direct U.S. military action” against Syrian military targets, and the Russians have already indicated that any assault on Syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves. The rapidly deteriorating crisis in Syria has already caused tensions with Russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the Cold War, but now Obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering “an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia”. Apparently Obama believes that Russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback. The following comes from an NBC News article entitled “ CIA Prepping for Possible Cyber Strike Against Russia “… 
The Obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against Russia in retaliation for alleged Russian interference in the American presidential election , U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News. 
Current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the CIA has been asked to deliver options to the White House for a wide-ranging “clandestine” cyber operation designed to harass and “embarrass” the Kremlin leadership. 
The sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the CIA was considering, but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors, selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation . 
Somebody should tell Obama that he is not playing a video game. A cyber attack is considered to be an act of war, and the Russians would inevitably retaliate. And considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is, I don’t know if that is something that we want to invite. 
At the end of last week, Vice President Joe Biden also publicly threatened the Russians … 
On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden met “Meet the Press” host Chuck Todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in Russia. 
Without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims, Todd took the allegations of Russian hacking at face value, opening his interview with a loaded question: “Why haven’t we sent a message yet to Putin?” 
After a moment of stunned silence, Biden responded, “We’re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing, and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact.” 
When Todd asked if the public will know a message was sent, Biden replied, “Hope not.” 
The Russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking, and so far the Obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the Russians were behind it. 
Perhaps the Obama administration privately has some evidence, but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the American public. 
So for Joe Biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing. The Russians are taking these threats very seriously, and they are preparing to protect their interests … 
‘The threats directed against Moscow and our state’s leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the US vice president. 
‘To the backdrop of this aggressive, unpredictable line, we must take measures to protect (our) interests, to hedge risks,’ a Kremlin spokesman said, according to RIA Novosti news agency. 
Here in the United States, most people don’t even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with Russia. 
But over in Russia things are completely different. Talk of war is everywhere, and the potential for war is the number one topic in the Russian media right now. Just check out some of the recent Russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations… 
-“ In Contrast to Clinton, Trump Has No Appetite for War With Russia ” 
And one Russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the United States and Russia suddenly erupts… 
A terrifying Russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war. 
One apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on Moscow’s state-owned TV channel NTV: “If it should one day happen, every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is. It’s best to find out now.” 
I don’t believe that the Russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming. 
To me, it almost seems as though Obama wants one. 
Could it be possible that a conflict with Russia will be used to alter, change or influence the upcoming election in November? 
The truth is that it isn’t going to take much for the shooting to begin. If Obama orders airstrikes against Syrian forces, the Russians have said that they will shoot back … 
Ash Carter has threatened Russia with “consequences”. After blowing up the ceasefire, the Pentagon – supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff — now is peddling “potential strikes” on Syria’s air force to “punish the regime” for what the Pentagon actually did; blow up the ceasefire. One can’t make this stuff up. 
Major-General Igor Konashenkov, Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman, sent a swift message to “our colleagues in Washington”; think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a “shadow” hot war against Russia. Russia will target any stealth/unidentified aircraft attacking Syrian government targets – and they will be shot down. 
The only serious question then is whether an out of control Pentagon will force the Russian Air Force – false flag and otherwise — to knock out US Air Force fighter jets, and whether Moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them. 
I discussed the potential for war with Russia in my latest video . Hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with Russia will be put off… 
But without a doubt the crisis in Syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess. Most people don’t realize that the Syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam from the very beginning. Jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by Saudi Arabia and Turkey are fighting Hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by Iran. And now Turkish forces have invaded northern Syria, and this threatens to cause a full-blown war to erupt between Turkey and the Syrian Kurds. Of course ISIS is right in the middle of everything causing havoc, blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesn’t believe in their radical version of Sunni Islam. 
It is absolutely insane that the United States and Russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict. Both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are, and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery. 
The American people very foolishly elected Barack Obama twice, but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting. 
However, right here at the end of his second term Obama is facing a moment of truth. If he ends up dragging us into a war with Russia, the American people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the White House. Drowning In Debt: 35 Percent Of All Americans Have Debt That Is At Least 180 Days Past Due » Guest 
“If he [Obama] ends up dragging us into a war with Russia, the American people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the White House.” 
Oh, I doubt it. Most Americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized Putin and other foreign leaders. Where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing Libya and other sovereign nations in the Middle East? Where is the outrage over what the Bush administration did in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
There is a video on Youtube with General Wesley Clark discussing how the Pentagon planned to attack 7 countries in 5 years. Google it. JC Teecher

Nothing liked a lame duck traitor to recklessly stick his nose in the affairs of others, and then leave office in a few months. 
This traitor should have been impeached after one year of his first term…..but the American sheeple demanded the “change you could believe in”. So, the way I see it, we are bearing the fruits of allowing a traitor to occupy the white house, and a apethetic population that is not united and sat back and did nothing to protest. If Hitlery gets in, she will gladly continued the change that Obama (global elite masters) has been determined to accomplish, and will transform this nation into a nation unrecognizable to most who call this nation home.

But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep. For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; … Lester Holt

For what it is worth; would it not be an easy task, for the Odrama/liberal/Industrial War Machine, to pull off a strike of instant war of immediate reaction, with the powers of the Iranian/Russian regimes, in light of a Donald Trump win next month. 
Easily, it could be the catalyst for a chaotic event of stock market crashes and world wide chaos to invoke a martial law edict. Which, would prevent Trump from becoming potus, and keep the NWO wheels turning. 
Even with a liberal win, it could be the one thing that prevents a psychopath from actually taking the reins, and continuing a program that is soon to take a hold of the whole world, anyway.

Locker Room Banter Versus Treason – There is no comparison! 
First, any guy who says that they have never participated in locker room banter or said something sexually explicit when they had a reasonable expectation of privacy is either Jesus or a liar. There is no comparison between natural male human behavior and treasonous activities. 
Additionally, this low-life ploy by the Progressive Liberal Democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us. JFK was having an ongoing affair with Marilyn Monroe and I’m sure his Secret Service Agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions. But you know what? Neither JFK’s Secret Service Agents nor the Mainstream Media said anything about the affair, much less JFK’s private conversations about it because they had dignity, respect for the office of POTUS, and respect for JFK. Any ONE of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the Mainstream Media from happening around the whole institution of the POTUS, including the potential POTUS candidates. However, we see that neither the democrats nor the Mainstream Media have any honor, truth, or journalistic integrity remaining. 
General George S. Patton and Prime Minister Winston Churchill were both as crude as they come in private, and often in public, but they got the job done when they were called upon. Maybe you don’t consider Donald Trump in the same ranks as the above three men. Maybe you don’t think Donald Trump can get the job done. Either way, I couldn’t care less. What I do care about is the poor state of our country, the damage that Barack Obama & the democrats have done, and the damage that Hillary Clinton is sure to do. For Pete’s sake! Look at the shell of a city that used to be Detroit, MI. Look at Chicago with double-digit murders just about every week. If you want the US to look like these long-time democrat-run cities, by all means, vote for Hillary Clinton. If not, then the ONLY other VIABLE option is Donald Trump. 
If the worst thing that the democrats, the Mainstream Media, and the Progressive Liberal Useful Idiots have on Donald Trump is locker room banter by a man acting like men do, then that’s nothing to see, in my opinion. It might actually be beneficial to our country to have an alpha-male as POTUS, for a change. Lynn Bowling Cosentino

How come word of God has so many versions. Which one is true and which is false. Jerry C 
The Dead Sea Scrolls found in 1947 prove the accuracy of translation for almost 2,000 years, based on the Textus Receptus texts; otherwise known as the Received Texts. All modern perversions go by texts found much later in Alexandria, Egypt, so all those are corrupt. Hope that helps you. By the way, you should study the book of Esther in original Hebrew using acrostics since that book was almost not included in the canon because God’s name (God of Abraham) was not written (technically, not written on the textual level). May the God of the Holy Bible lead you to the Truth. Abba Father. Amen. Donna 
They are all true, the old testament was written before Jesus’s birth, after Jesus was born and died for us on the cross a lot of things changed because we are forgiven through his blood on the cross. All we have to do is sincerely ask for his forgiveness and obey the commandments, and live an obidient life. Study his word and apply it to our daily lives. Don’t just take someone’s word, go to church and even then back it up with his word and prayer. gfmucci 
The huge difference you choose to ignore, Ali, is that the founder of Islam, Muhammad, unlike the founder of Christianity, Jesus, practiced jihad, violence, intolerance, supremacism, and conquest as written in his book, Qur’an. Christ was opposite. So of course faithful Muslims attempt to emulate the life of Muhammad as Christians attempt to emulate Christ. So, naturally, good Islamic leaders want their followers to emulate Muhammad in all his violent and conquering overt jihad and stealth jihad ways as well. 
Even the ratio of Jews today shooting, beheading, igniting and terrorizing people in the name of their ‘Old Testament” religion, compared to Muslims, is 1 to 1 million. 
Nope, the “moral equivalency” argument you attempt is BS – it is a ‘uuuge stretch, aka “lie”, obfuscation, distraction, vain attempt, etc. But I know you will persist because Islam promotes illogic to attempt to prevail and conquer. ali 
I am not here to argue. But if you go into historical facts, you will see that all the battles fought by Muhammad were in Self defense. I love Jesus as I consider him also Prophet of God. But then again you can choose to believe in what you want to believe in. 
I do agree that concept of Jihad has been demolished by retarded extremists but I am not here to defend Islam or Muslims. Jihad means to struggle. Remember Muhammad also said Jihad of Pen and Jihad of Self control over desires and bad virtues is much bigger than Jihad of sword GSOB

President Zero and his NWO handlers are on the wrong side of history. I am with Putin on this one. tacoma 
The American War Machine, consisting of POTUS (of both parties), the Pentagon, the CIA/NSA, the neo-con politicians, who have been fighting some kind of war non-stop around the world since WW2, is today mad as hell. See, they are not doing what they want with expected impunity all over the Middle East, the Russian front and the Chinese front. They expected to go in and simply take over the regions. With Pentagon massive Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, these were initial success of conquest and plunder. U.S. forces are today running these countries, ensuring there are daily suicide bombers for entertainment in American TV. But projects to take over Libya, Ukraine, Georgia, Syria, even Egypt ran into resistance. All such resistance can be traced to the strategy and actions of Russian president Putin. 
Mr. Putin said he opposes American military conquest of countries on Russia’s border. Perhaps he feels this encirclement is not to Russia benefit? Perhaps Washington would feel the same way if Russia took over Mexico and Canada? Well, why do you think the American War Machine spent so much effort, blood and treasure, the latter two items come not from the Machine, but from ordinary citizen mass of fools. 
Time again Mr Putin played a superior hand. The War Machine is not used to being out-played. It is used to American Impunity, American Exceptionsim, American Power, American Superiority. 
And so, with only a few months left in the current regime of war, this gang of devils is talking big war. Not the kind of ‘routine’ war America fight every single year since the founding of this military state. But Vietnam War II, even global nuclear war. 
The Syrian government is winning its country back from the rebels and terrorists. This is bad news for the American War Machine. The Machine is deciding that the only way to stop their project of conquest and hell is to declare war on Russia and Syria. This will drag China in on Russia’s side, meaning a war will break out in the South China Sea. 
But you know what if war is what the American War Machine wants then war is what it will get. History will record who comes out alive. 
The Russian military already stated publicly that if Russia is attacked then the next war will not be fought on Russia soil alone as it was when Napoleon and Hitler attacked. Russia have lost dozens of million of people in these attacks from the West. It has proven it can survive, win, even prosper. It will do so again. 
The only question is if America is wiling to put up the cost of attacking Syrian/Russian forces. On its own soil. Big time. I don’t think Obama/Hillary gang dares to ask such a question to the public. The public will detracted from its non-stop tweeting and celebrity worshiping suddenly to find out a certain American city just disappeared. And it ain’t a video game. Scott Comin

New Obama Executive Order Hints At Devastating Space Event: “Could Disable Large Portions Of The Electrical Power Grid… Cause Cascading Failures”

I would dare to say this has nothing to do with ‘space weather’ and everything to do with an anticipated EMP attack on the power grid by Russia as WW3 commences. The severity of the loss of power would mean in real terms never having electricity again for a couple of years if not forever depending on whether or not peace terms are sought early in the conflict. Enjoy the stone age. A thousand years from now we may be a conspiracy theory about a lost civilization.

“…… the Syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam from the very beginning. ” 
That is the absolute truth, and whoever says that Islam is a religion of peace is either lying through their teeth, or is so ignorant, they probably believe the Keebler Elves are baking all those cookies. lol. 
The fact is that the two Superpowers of the world, Russia, and USA, via their “appointed/chosen/selected” leaders, are using this ongoing feud between the Muzzies, as to achieve their goals of “feeding” their respective war machines. 
It just so happens, that the new Vietnam, is Syria. It just so happens, that the refugee issue was a planned one, to further the goals of spreading the Arabian bloodlines throughout the world, to weed out all caucasian races of different countries. 
The plans of the devil, to eradicate the caucasians, that came from Adam and Eve, called Hebrews, then Israelites, then, the House of Israel (ten tribes to the North) that migrated to western Europe, and then later to North America; and, the House of Judah, tribes of Judah and Benjamin (plus some Levites and a few mixed in from the others) that were also part of the migrations; the plans have evolved to what we see now via Islamic peoples. 
What was, the plan back in the beginning of this Earth Age, to eradicate the pure bloodline. through which Christ would come (be born), is still a problem for Satan. Albeit, the problem for him has now grown to include peoples from all races and bloodlines, (grafted in), via true Christianity. We were a thorn in his side back then and still are. 
Now we see that hatred manifested via the liberal minds of ignorant, and possessed people (most unknowingly), to help further the agenda of Satan, because……..Rev 12:17“And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” 
Can anyone, as a Christian grasp that concept, of what is taking place? Satan is behind this whole mess, and uses those that are “useable” to obtain his goal of trying to punish Christians. 
If left to Putin, and Obama, and all their pawn regimes of rogue nations, they would kill off all peoples that were Christian, and have a following of robotic peoples, so that they could “control” them. 
It will backfire on them eventually, and the soon coming of their leader, Satan, will not have enough time to get his agenda of hatred to come to it’s full potential against Christians; thanks to our Saviour and King, the Lord Jesus Christ. Rick 
Michael, Just a minor detail, but I do not believe the “American” people elected Obama, at least not the second time. There’s great proof the election and electronic ballots were rigged for him. I travel the country for my job, and other than a very few brain washed lefties, I heard of no one that actually pulled the lever for him, or were willing to admit it.

It’s not cryptic at all. If no one exists to experience the Universe, the Universe, and time, does not exist. Without subjective experience, objective experience is meaningless.

There are a number of possibilities besides the very real threat of all nuclear war. 
It could be that this is just a way of shutting up the warmongers who are pressing Obama to exact revenge on Russia for when Syria retakes Aleppo. Putin and Obama may just be putting on a show. 
Or perhaps this just another way of rigging the election. If Trump somehow pulls out a win, Obama might say Russia hacked the election, declare the election invalid and go on to serve another six months or so. Or perhaps, Obama wants Russia to make an aggressive move that would make Trump look bad. 
It is too simple to say that this is between Sunni and Shia. Saudi Arabia would not be assisting ISIS without the USG approval. The USG has been saying for years that “Assad must go”– something that will be painful to back away from even if a referendum supports Assad after Syria is retaken. Bashar Assad is not a Shia either. He is a secular Alawite married to a Sunni. Most Sunnis in Syria have supported him. 
Or this could be just another case of imperial hubris. Given that NATO’s population is 6 times Russia’s and its GDP nearly 20 times Russia’s, these guys may just think they have checkmate on Russia, not believing that Russia would dare resort to the unthinkable. Problem is, conventional war might be worse for Russia, once its air defenses are gone and NATO bombers have a free sky from which to carpet-bomb Russian cities. If this is the case, then we should all be asking ourselves where to go to be safe from nukes. Oregon is the best possibility in the US – not many targets and radiation-free winds from the Pacific. Maybe it’s time to pack and go. df NJ 
We survived the 70s without nuclear war. We will survive the teens without nuclear war. 
The last thing people in power want is to lose their power. If a nuke goes off anywhere in the world the people in power will be disposed by right or left wing reactionary totalitarian regime changes. This is not going to happen. wootendw 
“We survived the 70s without nuclear war. We will survive the teens without nuclear war.” 
The Soviet Union had a credible ‘conventional’ defense – perhaps offense – back then. It does not now, especially when compared to NATO. 
As for “This is not going to happen”, such disasters happen when people least expect them. When people expect nuclear war, as in the Cuban missile crisis, they act to prevent it. When everyone believes nothing bad will happen – as in the aftermath of the Bear Stearns collapse – something bad does happen. Lazarovic

Obama and Hillary blaming the Russians could be to provoke them into a confrontation, maybe because they want America to fall and the NWO to rise? Many people have seen visions of Russia and China invading America. Tony Bennett says it will happen after our economy collapses. Everyone really needs to prepare for all scenarios. df NJ 
If we let our fears drive what actions we take in our life then we will have a very poor quality of life. I would rather be brave int he face of fears and have a better quality of life. My gut feeling tells me I will be long dead and gone before the economy collapses or we experience the second coming of Jesus. If Jesus were here, he would not be able to win a Republican primary. He’s just way too liberal. SpecialK 
No one said anything about letting fear drive our actions. God gave us the Bible, for one reason, to prepare us for what’s to come. So we shouldn’t be afraid when it happens. Also, you can hope you’re dead before all this happens but looking at whats going on in the market, geopolitically, etc, something could happen next week for all we know. Lazarovic 
Jesus still wouldn’t win a Republican primary, he’s way too liberal… df NJ 
People who seek God through the Bible are doing it out of fear and not because of love. Fear is the driving motivation behind the Bible. Nobody has proven eternal damnation exists. It’s all based on imaginary fears. Why would an omnipotent God who needs absolutely nothing from us care if we are sinners or not. It makes absolutely no sense. God needs nothing from us. There is no cosmic scoreboard. God is omnipotent whether we choose to have faith in God or not. 
If God truly loves us then he would use his omnipotent powers of forgiveness to allow everything through the gates of heaven to experience eternal bliss. What difference does it make to God? It’s not like it will diminish God’s omnipotent powers to forgive Hitler. God loves Hitler because other than Hitler’s mother, God is all Hitler has! 
Not accepting God’s omnipotent powers of forgiveness will be given to everyone no matter what indicates you have a lack of faith in an all-powerful all-loving God. What sins you’ve committed or how you practice your religion makes no difference to an all-powerful all-loving God. Are you willing to risk eternal damnation by putting all your faith in an all-power all-forgiving God? Is your faith strong enough? Are you brave enough? Now that’s a real test of faith! 
It think a better way to be is to worship a loving God not out of fear but just out of faith. So rather than be afraid I choose to believe God will allow me through the gates of heaven no matter what sins I commit or how I practice my religion during my time on earth. You may think I’m wrong and crazy. But I would rather put my faith in all-loving all-forgiving God as opposed to your dark twisted idea of a hateful vengeful God. Your vengeful angry petty God is based on your twisted ideas of right and wrong. What is a sin and what is not sin is constantly changing. The big ones don’t change much. But there are thousands that are constantly being debated as being right or wrong. 
There is only one true God and that God is God. The Bible is not God. Your twisted ideas about Jesus are not God. Or the twisted ideas about Jesus written by men in the Bible are not above God. The disciples are not above God. The disciples are men and nothing more. The disciples are not Gods. You can’t tell me that each disciple did not describe the teachings of Jesus based on their own world view and interpretation of Jesus’s teachings. What is written in the Bible is the ghost of teachings of Jesus as seen through the eyes of each disciple. 
There is only one true God and his name is God. My faith is in God above all other words of men that were written in the Bible. 
If you are not talking about God then you are NOT talking about God. It’s so obvious yet most of you are so twisted with ideas about God that your ideas about God eventually have nothing to do with God. 
For example, talking about Jesus is not talking about God. Jesus was a Jewish rabbi who was talking about God. But when you are talking about Jesus you are not talking about God. 
If you want to seek God where do you look? You don’t need to look in the Bible to find God. I don’t need a disciple to tell me where God is or how to look. God is everywhere around us. God is infinite. God does exist outside the Bible. You don’t need a Bible to find God. You just have to have faith in God while you are looking. Bill G Wilminton NC

Will you bring them[a] before you for judgment? 4 Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one! 5 A person’s days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed. 6 So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired laborer. 7 “At least there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail. 8 Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil, 9 yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant. 10 But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more. 11 As the water of a lake dries up or a riverbed becomes parched and dry, 12 so he lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, people will not awake or be roused from their sleep. 13 “If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me! 14 If someone dies, will they live again?

2000 was an historic election: 
“THE COURT STEPS IN The Supreme Court actually interposed itself into the election contest three times. Only the last two are known as Bush v. Gore. In the first of these cases, Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, the Court hoped to end the election crisis by putting a stop to the Florida Supreme Court’s decision to extend the time for certifying the vote past the period set by state law. But by the time the Court began hearing arguments in the appeal on December 1, the certification had already occurred. The embarrassed justices sent the case back down to the Florida Supreme Court, instructing the lower court to rewrite its opinion so that it would not create a conflict between state and federal law. 
A week later, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide recount of ballots. Unlike its earlier decision, however, this one was not unanimous. With the Florida justices split 4-3, the U.S. Supreme Court once again exercised its discretionary appellate review jurisdiction and granted certiorari, or review, to Bush v. Gore. The day after the Florida Supreme Court had ordered a recount, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay, or delay, in enforcing the Florida Supreme Court’s order. The U.S. Supreme Court justices, too, were narrowly divided, 5-4. The five justices voting in favor of the stay were the same five conservatives who had been moving the Rehnquist Court to the right for more than a decade. The first hearing of Bush v. Gore telegraphed to the nation what would happen if the Court took further action in the case. 
The Court’s third and final intervention in the 2000 presidential election came just days later. In its unsigned opinion, the Court explained that it had voted 5-4 to put a stop to the Florida recount. Allowing the recount to go forward, the Court said, would violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court sent the case back down to the Florida Supreme Court, which had no alternative but to dismiss it. The presidential election of 2000 had been decided, in essence, by the vote of one Supreme Court justice. “ mtntrek3 
Yep, I remember that election…… counting and recounting, hanging chads, confusing ballots, etc. Some say that this election will be a landslide one way or the other. I’m not sure about that.

2735,Obama Illegally Transferred DOJ Money To Clinton Campaign,"  Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , US // 0 Comments 
Barack Obama has been accused of using the Department of Justice (DOJ) to illegally funnel money into left-wing groups such as the Clinton Campaign. 
According to Clinton Cash author and Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President Peter Schweizer, a new GAI report indicates that the DOJ, under direction from Obama, used money obtained by fining financial institutions to fund left-wing liberal causes. 
Breitbart.com reports: 
Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and SiriusXM host Alex Marlow described the report as exposing the Justice Department of “quite literally extorting companies to fund left-wing activists.” 
“When I first joined Breitbart,” Schweizer recalled, “There was a scandal called Pigford where the federal government was basically taking taxpayer money and giving it to people who were claiming to be victims who were not victims and giving them billions of dollars. This is in that tradition.” 
He explained: 
What’s really happening here is simple. You’ve got large financial institutions on Wall Street, you’ve got banks like Bank of America, who have in some cases committed financial crimes. I think some of them are real, some of them may not be, but set that aside for a minute. The Department of Justice has gone after them and basically said, ‘You committed these offenses, you’ve got to pay restitution in the form of billions of dollars.’ Okay, they committed the crime, they ought to pay that. 
Now, ostensibly that money, those billions of dollars, are supposed to go to the victims of their financial crimes. If your Wall Street broker committed fraud, you’re supposed to be made whole with this money, and the rest of it is supposed to go to taxpayers. 
The problem is the Obama Justice Department has been diverting literally more than $650 million to left-wing groups. They do it under the guise of, “Well, you know, if this bank discriminated against lenders racially, we’re going to give this money to these left-wing quote-unquote housing groups to help deal with the problem.” 
But that’s not what’s going on. These housing groups are advocacy groups. They’re left-wing organizations. They are registering voters and getting voters out to the voting booth. And they specifically target what they call quote-unquote progressive voters. 
So this is taking the Department of Justice, which we’ve experienced so much in recent years has been politicized by this Administration, even further to where now the Department of Justice is transferring money to left-wing groups — in an effort, frankly I think, to influence this election.",0

He’ll touch on the same themes that propelled him to the White House. Look for an emphasis on America First  —   with the phrase “buy American and hire American” as his administration’s policy lodestar.  Capitol Hill is looking for any indication of Trump’s preference on the various Obamacare replacement proposals. Politico, however, reports that Trump is unlikely to embrace any specific plan. Breitbart’s Sean Moran offers a primer on the various Obamacare replacement plans. Trump’s budget is also being hotly debated. Jonathan Swan at Axios reports that Trump is not expected to explicitly endorse Speaker Paul Ryan’s border adjustment tax tonight, which, Swan reports, Trump’s team is “divided on. The nationalist wing of the White House  —   led by Steve Bannon  —   supports the plan to raise $1 trillion by hiking taxes on imports. Officials closer to corporate America, including top economic advisor Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, are said to be deeply skeptical. ” Ryan wants the border adjustment tax to offset any Trump tax cut proposal. Swan has updated his initial story to note the White House talking points about the address state: “We must have fair trade for our workers  —   foreign countries can no longer be allowed to tax our exports while shipping goods into our country for free. ” This language might suggest an openness to the border adjustment tax concept or simply signal a willingness to use tariffs. The budget debate is also expected to be contentious in the coming weeks with Sen. Lindsay Graham ( ) declaring the president’s budget “dead on arrival” because of Trump’s proposed cuts to the State Department. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Trump might be open to “an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides. ” As Breitbart’s Neil Munro points out, take these reports with a grain of salt until further details of such a deal are hashed out. We can also expect the usual D. C. partisan drama tonight. Some Democrat lawmakers are boycotting the address, including Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Others are bringing illegal immigrants with them as their guests. First Lady Melania Trump’s guests, on the other hand, reportedly include Jessica Davis, Susan Oliver, and Jamiel Shaw, Sr.  —   each of whom lost loved ones to illegal immigrant criminals. Stay with us throughout the evening as we offer live updates. All times eastern. Watch the speech live on Breitbart’s Facebook here. *** 12:09 am  —   Watching the cable news replay of the speech one is struck again by the impolite manner in which Democrat lawmakers refused to even clap as a show of acknowledgment or greeting to the president at the beginning of his address. Republicans were never this impolite to President Obama during his State of the Union addresses. The closest thing that comes to mind is South Carolina Congressman Joe Wilson’s infamous “you lie!” outburst during Obama’s address to Congress in 2009, but even that was widely condemned by his fellow Republicans, which is the sort of   you’ll never see Democrats do among themselves and certainly not for any slight given to this president. 11:31 pm  —   America liked it.

The time for trivial fights is behind us   …     I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  —   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. ” 10:06 pm  —   Trump is concluding his address on a positive, upbeat message of American greatness. “When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. ” 10:05 pm  —   Trump articulates a foreign policy message that harkens back to George Washington. “America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. ” 10:03 pm  —   Big applause for this: “My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. ” Trump called for NATO to pay their fair share.  10:01 pm  —   Sustained applause for this: “We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  —    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.’  Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. ”  Ryan’s wife, standing next to Ivanka Trump, holds back the tears. Trump ad libbed: “Ryan is looking down right now, and I think he’s very happy, because he just broke a record. ” Trump continues: “The Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  —    we will never forget him. ” 9:53 pm  —   Trump says: “I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  —    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. ” He then points out the stories of Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis  —   whose families were victims of illegal immigrant criminals. Very emotional reception for families who were forgotten for so long.  There was, however, an audible groan from Democrats when Trump mentioned VOICE.  Groans and murmurs in the Democratic crowd as Trump announces new VOICE program for victims of illegal immigrant violence,  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:52 pm  —   Trump calls for support of the men and women of law enforcement and the victims of crime. “We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  —    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. ” 9:49 pm  —   Trump repeats a line that former President George W. Bush often said, “Education is the civil rights issue of our time. ” He calls for school choice. He highlights another guest  —   Denisha Merriweather, who attended a private center of learning and “with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. ” The pride on Denisha Merriweather’s face as @POTUS tells her story of perseverance  success at private school is just amazing #trumpaddress,  —   Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) March 1, 2017,  9:47 pm  —   Trump introduces Megan Crowley, who was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, but her own father “founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.  Today she is 20 years old  —   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. ” Trump highlights the story in order to call for reform of the Food and Drug Administration.  9:46 pm  —   This isn’t the sort of thing you’d expect to see from a Republican president, but it’s very much a populist message: “My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. ” 9:42 pm  —   Trump lays out his vision of Obamacare replacement. It still includes coverage for   conditions, health savings accounts, tort reform, taking on big pharma to bring down price of drugs, and allowing the ability to purchase insurance across state lines in order to create “a truly competitive national marketplace. ” House Democrats give Trump “Thumbs down” after he says he will repeal and replace Obamacare pic. twitter.   —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:41 pm  —    Corporate America may not like this speech, but focus groupers of both parties do not want them to leave the country. #JointAddress pic. twitter.   —   Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) March 1, 2017,  9:39 pm  —   Huge applause when Trump says he’s calling on Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. And he comes out against the individual mandate! “Mandating every American to buy   health insurance was never the right solution for America. ” 9:38 pm  —   Trump on his infrastructure plan: “To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  —   financed through both public and private capital  —    creating millions of new jobs. ” 9:36 pm  —   Trump addresses immigration reform: “Switching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families  —    including immigrant families  —    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws. ” 9:35 pm  —    . @POTUS: We’ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross. https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) March 1, 2017,  9:32 pm  —   Trump gets a laugh when he mentions his meeting with Harley Davidson executives. He makes the case for fair trade to protect American workers. “I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people. ” 9:33 pm  —   Sad.

He points out that Maureen Scalia, the late Justice Scalia’s wife is the guest of First Lady Melania Trump. Applause at the mention of his SCOTUS nominee Judge Gorsuch. 9:26 pm  —   No equivocating in this language: “As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  —   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. ” 9:25 pm  —   He makes the case for vetting: “We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  —   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. ” 9:22 pm  —   Here is the Trump who won the election: “We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. ” He calls out Dems directly: “To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?” 9:20 pm  —   Sad  …     Democrats laughing and hollering when Trump says he has begun to ”drain the swamp of government corruption”  —   Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) March 1, 2017,  9:18 pm  —   Trump gets applause for mentioning he cleared the way for the Dakota Access Pipeline, and we’ll be using American steel on all the pipelines. 9:16 pm  —   He explains what he has already done to keep his promises to bring jobs back to the U. S. He also mentions the stock market bump and the cost cutting savings he’s already done. He notes the hiring freeze and the efforts to “drain the swamp” by putting a   ban on lobbying for former government officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments. He also mentions his order to cut regulations. 9:13 pm  —   Trump sounds the same themes of his inaugural address and campaign  —   explaining the movement of the forgotten men and women who propelled his victory in order to “Make America Great Again” by putting Americans first. He gets a standing ovation. 9:10 pm  —   Trump opens with a unifying statement condemning the recent acts of   and hatred with the desecration of Jewish graves. 9:04 pm  —   And here he is. President Trump enters the Chamber. No applause from some Democrat lawmakers, just standing in stony silence. The Democrat women in white are notably silent. 9:00 pm  —   Here is the text of the prepared remarks: TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation’s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.  Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  —    in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world  —   friend or foe  —   will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding  —   250 years since the day we declared our Independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we’ve watched our middle class shrink as we’ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We’ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit  —   and so many other places throughout our land. We’ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross  —   and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we’ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds   —   families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus  —   as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake  —   and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first   …     because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford,   General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new   jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on   and   Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials  —    and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines  —   thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs  —   and I’ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the     Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth  —   and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  We want all Americans to succeed  —    but that can’t happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for   offenses since   came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home   —   from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  —   we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe  —   and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  —   a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court  —   from my list of 20 judges  —   who will defend our Constitution.  I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.   million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. We’ve lost more than   of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we’ve lost 60, 000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy  —   making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes  —   but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company,  .  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it’s good.  I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.  They told me  —   without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it  —   that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren’t even asking for change.  But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the “abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people. ” Lincoln was right  —   and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others  —    have a   immigration system.  It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of   immigration, and instead adopting a   system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families  —    including immigrant families  —    enter the middle class. I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security, and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the   of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program  —    the building of the interstate highway system.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country  —    twice.  And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States  —   financed through both public and private capital  —    creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles:  Buy American, and Hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. Mandating every American to buy   health insurance was never the right solution for America.  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State  —   it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges  —    leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing  —    and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  Action is not a choice  —    it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with   conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts  —    but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government. Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance  —   and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines  —    creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more  —    so why not join forces to finally get it done?  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan’s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan’s life.  Today she is 20 years old  —   and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan’s story is about the unbounded power of a father’s love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan’s life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind  —    and the souls  —    of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of   and Latino children.  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest   increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4, 000 people were shot last year alone  —    and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a   job. But to create this future, we must work with  —    not against   —   the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust  —    not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community.  They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters  —   and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they’ll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE  —    Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel’s    son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands  —    Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis  —    were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna:  I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica:  I want you to know  —    we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and  —    if they must  —    to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation  —    and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great.  But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U. S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero  —    battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, “Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. ”  Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity.  For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom  —    we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific  —    to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people  —    and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict  —   not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past  —    we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only   solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America’s centennial.  At that celebration, the country’s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America’s 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear  —   schools where children learn in peace  —   and jobs where Americans prosper and grow  —   are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears  —    inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past  —    and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and  —   Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States. 9:01 pm  —   Some pregame talking points from Rep.

Rosie O’Donnell also headlined the event where she called for continued resistance against the president.  O’Donnell read from the Declaration of Independence, saying, “Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government. ” She added, “That is why we are here. ”  “This is not Russia.

We have seen what you have done, sir. We have seen your connection with Russia. The game is over. The Internet rules,” O’Donnell said.  She added, “He lies! He lies! He lies! He lies!” O’Donnell chanted, until several other women in the crowd repeated her words.  “And it’s about time they all started saying that, instead of it appears as if he hasn’t been speaking the truth.

One at his wedding to Marla Maples where she said Trump “shook the hands of the guests at the wedding as he walked down the aisle to take his vows. Warning! Warning! Warning Will Robinson!” O’Donnell said.  She added, “We will get him out!

2738,Toys “R” Us Stores Offering Quiet Shopping Hours for Kids with Autism,"posted by Eddie Toys “R” Us stores in the UK are offering a “quiet hour” for shoppers with autism this holiday, and we’d love if U.S. retailers did the same! Remember that part in The Grinch Who Stole Christmas when the kids of Whoville play with dozens of toys and the Grinch grimaces and moans about all the “Noise, noise, noise, noise?” Yep. I think of that moment every time I try to take my two kids shopping during the holidays. Yes, they both love toys and, yes, they both adore toy stores—but they both have sensory issues and my oldest is non-speaking and autistic. This means that going to big toy stores like Toys “R” Us just isn’t an option for us during the holiday season (or even most days). Crowds, fluorescent lights, loud music, and many other sensory triggers overwhelm both my kids (and me, if I’m being honest) and we usually leave within minutes of stepping into the store. Toys “R” Us locations throughout the U.K. will be hosting a quiet hour on Sunday, November 6, for those with autism and their families. Stores will be opening an hour earlier with special accommodations meant to make holiday shopping easier for individuals on the spectrum. As part of the shopping experience, lights will be dimmed and fluorescent lighting will be limited. In-store music will also be muted, and no announcements will be made. Stores will be offering quiet-zones for shoppers. These adjustments are all an effort to make sure children on the autism spectrum and their family members can have a comfortable and enjoyable shopping experience, regardless of their disabilities, Toys R Us representatives told the Telegraph . “For many autistic people and their families a simple trip to the shops, which should be an enjoyable experience, can be fraught with difficulty,” Cadey says. We’re hoping Toys R Us locations in the United States will adopt this idea too. Parents have petitioned for sensory-friendly aisles in Target and ShopRite with local success, but children on the autism spectrum and their parents deserve a place to shop comfortably year-round, no matter where they live. After all, Toys R Us is a place where a kid can be a kid, right? Source:",0
2739,Ultimate White Knight Destroys Trump’s Walk of Fame Star to Help Lying Slut Hoaxers,"Deadline : 
Donald Trumpâs star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker wielding a sledgehammer and pickax. The man, who told Deadline his name was Jamie Otis, said he was trying to extract the star to auction it off and raise funds for the women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them over the decades. 
The embedded terrazzo and brass star, dedicated in 2007 in recognition of the now-GOP presidential candidateâs days as host of NBCâs The Apprentice, was smashed to bits, with shrapnel flying everywhere in the early-morning hours at the starâs sidewalk home at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. near the Dolby Theatre. Check out Deadlineâs exclusive video above. 
The incident occurred around 5:45 AM with a few bystanders stopping to watch. An LAPD police cruiser showed up around 6:15, but Otis already had left the scene. 
He wanted to give money to lying sluts. 
smdh. 
None of these stupid bitches have any evidence for their retarded claims. And they must have been put up to this by someone agreeing to pay their legal fees, because they’re all going to get sued, whether Trump wins or loses. 
And this man wants to give them free money. Just because. My princesses. 
The Evolutionary Roots of White-Knighting 
White-knighting has a biological explanation. Women have far more reproductive value than men do. And they are productive for a much shorter period of time. So a young fertile woman is of extreme value to the tribe, the nation, the race. This is why we all have these super-strong instincts to protect women. 
Technically, a society where the overwhelming majority of men had been killed, but the women were still alive, could recuperate. It takes a man five minutes to produce a child, while it takes a woman about three years (from conception to the point where it could exist without its mother). 
So, in a naturally functioning society, the white knight instinct is a good thing. 
However, we don’t live in naturally functioning society. We live in a totally jewed-out nightmare dystopia where nature itself has been turned on its head and women have been given authority to rule over men. We have also been systematically brainwashed to believe that women are the same as men, and thus possess a similar morality to men – for example, we are taught that women don’t lie constantly as a matter of course (they do), we are taught that they have the capacity to feel guilt (they don’t, they only feel shame) and we are taught that they can use logic to evaluate situations (they can’t). 
Basically, women do not have the physical strength to acquire necessary physical resources, so they have to use other methods to get what they need. 
Historically, though there was always a strong desire to protect women, women were not considered an authority on reality and there was an understanding that the basic biological nature of women is to survive on lies, manipulation and various schemes. So, while we would certainly hang a rapist if we found a rapist to have violently raped a woman, we didn’t take women at their word whenever they said anything. 
We also didn’t have these new forms of rape, such as “date rape.” If a woman went to the cops and said “I was in this man’s bedroom and he raped me,” the cops would say “well what were you doing in his room? Did he kidnap you?” 
We also would have been extremely skeptical of women accusing a rich man of sexual impropriety, as it is clear she has a whole lot to gain from doing so. 
So, even while the natural instinct is to come rushing in like a valiant knight whenever a woman cries that a man has disrespected her honor, this instinct was tempered by a logical understanding of the natural behavior of women. 
Another interesting element here worth noting is that while alpha males are much less prone to take the histrionics of women seriously, it is not because alpha males have less of a drive to protect women. It is because alpha males generally have more experience with women, and are thus much more likely to be aware of their tricks. Beta males also have the (presumably subconscious) belief that white-knighting will get them laid (protip: it does not), but this is also mainly due to a lack of understanding of female behavior due to a lack of exposure. 
There is also the fact that beta males have less testosterone, generally, and so are more likely to associate with females. You will notice that men who have “female friends” that they are not having sex with or trying to have sex with tend to be non-masculine. You also find this among men who will spend too much time with their girlfriends. 
Men who take the opinions of women seriously on any level whatsoever tend to exhibit signs of femininity. For masculine men, a woman expressing her opinion on anything is either cute or repulsive. 
Maximizing Male Exploitation 
Women instinctively understand this current backward situation, and are using it to maximum effect. Historically, women would have been ashamed to do what they are doing now. But because they know they can get away with it – and they know society won’t shame them – they are pushing it as far as they possibly can. 
And that is what we see with the Clinton campaign’s use of these “woman abuser” allegations against Trump. 
They are attacking both the male white-knight instinct, as we see this poor dumb bastard who smashed the star responding to, and they are attacking the instinct of women to unify as a collective group against men for their own protection (which is a separate phenomenon which I will go into another time – basically, women had to get along with each other in nature to raise each other’s kids, and they often used this unity amongst themselves as a lobbying bloc against the men of their tribe/clan/village). 
The psychological elements of this election are absolutely fascinating. But most people don’t understand psychology. If everyone understood psychology, then in some way, psychology itself would cease to exist, as we would all be perfectly rational robot-like beings.",0
2740,"As New York Fights Zika Virus, Officials Turn Their Focus to Sex - The New York Times","One by one, the women paraded into the research center in Midtown Manhattan. There were about 40 of them, pregnant or of reproductive age, brought together by New York City health officials for   sessions in English and Spanish. They were there to discuss the Zika virus. But not the mosquitoes known to carry it. They were there to talk about sex. Specifically, public health officials were trying to devise the most effective way of communicating the growing threat posed by sexual transmission of the virus  —   a threat that could significantly alter the course of the epidemic. After two days, they had their message, aimed at men as much as women: “Do not put your child at risk. ” While mosquitoes are the primary carriers of the virus, which has swept across the Americas and the Caribbean, infecting tens of thousands of people and causing devastating birth defects in more than 1, 800 newborns, health officials are concerned that the threat of sexual transmission remains little understood, largely underpublicized and worryingly underestimated. Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an article published this week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, said Zika represented “an unprecedented emergency. ” “Never before, to our knowledge,” Dr. Frieden wrote, “has a   virus been associated with human birth defects or been capable of sexual transmission. ” With 491 cases so far, four believed to have been contracted through sex, New York City’s total now accounts for about a quarter of all Zika cases in the United States, according to health care officials briefed on the latest test results. More than 3, 000 pregnant women have been screened for the virus. While sustained local transmission by mosquitoes is considered unlikely in the city, it has both a large population of people who travel back and forth to Zika hot zones and sophisticated public health surveillance systems, making it one of the best places to closely study the virus’s alternate means of transmission and how to prevent Zika from spreading through those means. Because much about the virus is unknown, just how great the threat sexual transmission poses remains contested. As long as mosquitoes that thrive in warm tropical environments are the primary carriers, Zika’s spread will be somewhat limited by geography and   efforts. Experts agree, however, that if sex becomes a common means of spreading Zika, the already difficult challenge of containing the virus will become exponentially harder. It could also further stoke a debate about family planning and the availability of birth control, even as the risk to pregnant women increases. All men and women who travel to places where Zika is spreading are now told either to abstain from sex for at least eight weeks or to use barrier protection  —   if they have symptoms or not. Men with symptoms should abstain from sex or use condoms for at least six months. Pregnant women who live where the disease is present or whose partners have been to a Zika zone should have their partners use condoms or abstain from sex for the duration of the pregnancy, health officials say. “Those recommendations come as a pretty big shock to our patients,” said Dr. Gary Mazer, director of emergency management at the CityMD   urgent care centers in New York City. “Many people have no idea. ” In a recent survey by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, people seemed aware of the risks of traveling to places where Zika is spreading and the need to take precautions from being bitten by mosquitoes. But when asked what steps they could take to prevent contracting the disease, only 5 percent named using condoms or abstaining from sex with someone who lives in or travels to a Zika area. Getting doctors and patients to talk openly about sexually transmitted diseases is often difficult, and part of the challenge with Zika is that it exploded so suddenly and that so much remains unknown. Only seven months ago, there was a debate over whether sexual transmission was even a real concern. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a news conference on Thursday that understanding of the virus kept changing. When sexual transmission first was established, Dr. Fauci said, it was predominantly men infecting women. “No sooner did we say that than there was a case of woman to man,” he said. While the one known case of    transmission may currently be an outlier, he said, it cannot be discounted. The bottom line: “The efficiency of sexual transmission is still unknown. ” In two studies published on Thursday in a European journal of infectious diseases, scientists described two cases in which the semen of men who contracted Zika in Haiti early this year continued to test positive for the virus past six months, raising questions about the current guidelines. The semen of one man tested positive 188 days after he first experienced symptoms of the illness, the other on Day 181  —   twice as long as previously documented. William Smith, the head of the National Coalition of S. T. D. Directors, said he had heard concern from health departments across the country. “There has been an   across the board and a lack of leadership in talking about and educating people  —   both citizens and providers  —   that sexual transmission is a real threat,” he said. He pointed to the posters distributed around the country by the C. D. C. and mirrored by local health departments, with big pictures of mosquitoes but no mentions of condoms. In addition, the emergence of the virus is coming at a time when public health departments are strained and the three most commonly sexually transmitted diseases  —   syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia  —   are on the rise for the third year in a row in the United States, an indication that messages about protected sex are falling short. The city is planning to start its new campaign in two weeks, building on its current educational effort that focuses largely on travel and mosquitoes. It will include fliers, posters, and radio and television advertisements drawing on suggestions from the focus group and years of battling other sexually transmitted diseases. Community outreach workers will spread out to gathering places like street fairs and transit hubs to communicate the risks of sexual transmission. Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city’s health commissioner, said that even as the city addressed concerns about sexual transmission, it did not want to lose focus on what remained the primary threat to women in New York: travel to places where Zika is spreading. “What we do know right now is that mosquitoes are the most important source of transmission in   areas,” Dr. Bassett said. “We do need every New Yorker to know that Zika can also be sexually transmitted, and we have adapted our messaging to reflect this. “For New Yorkers, the two best ways to prevent Zika are to avoid traveling to   areas and to use barrier methods when having sex with someone who traveled to a   area. ” Pamela Perez, 25, and Emmanuel Espinal, 35, both born in the Dominican Republic, are part of the target audience. Walking in Highbridge Park in Upper Manhattan recently, they said they had been infected with other   illnesses like chikungunya and dengue, and were not all that concerned about Zika. Mr. Espinal said the disease would not change his plans to travel between New York and the Dominican Republic. But asked if he knew the disease could be transmitted via sex as well as mosquitoes, Mr. Espinal was taken aback. “I didn’t know that,” he said, pausing. “Now I have to be more careful. ”",0

2742,Rise in Infant Drug Dependence Is Felt Most in Rural Areas - The New York Times,"As the opioid epidemic sweeps through rural America, an   number of   newborns are straining hospital neonatal units and draining precious medical resources. The problem has grown more quickly than realized and shows no signs of abating, researchers reported on Monday. Their study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, concludes for the first time that the increase in   newborns has been disproportionately larger in rural areas. The rising rates are due largely to widening use of opioids among pregnant women, the researchers found. From 2004 to 2013, the proportion of newborns born dependent on drugs increased nearly sevenfold in hospitals in rural counties, to 7. 5 per 1, 000 from 1. 2 per 1, 000. By contrast, the uptick among urban infants was nearly fourfold, to 4. 8 per 1, 000 from 1. 4 per 1, 000. “The problem is accelerating in rural areas to a greater degree than in urban areas,” said Dr. Veeral Tolia, a neonatologist who works at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and was not involved in the new report. Other recent studies have underscored the breadth of the problem. The hospital costs associated with treating addicted newborns rose to $1. 5 billion in 2013, from $732 million in 2009, according to a study in the Journal of Perinatology. Some neonatal intensive care units, called NICUs, now devote 10 percent of their hours to caring for infants who have withdrawal symptoms. Hospitals in the eye of this storm are commonly underresourced, experts said. “Typically, rural hospitals that deliver babies have traditionally focused on the   population in areas they serve,” said Dr. Alison V. Holmes, an associate professor of pediatrics at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. “But when you’re getting to a point of having a substantial proportion of mothers taking opioids and babies at risk for opioid withdrawal, it becomes a strain on the regional system. ” Using data from 2012 and 2013, a recent federal study found states like West Virginia, Maine and Vermont had particularly high rates of what is known as neonatal abstinence syndrome. It includes such symptoms as irritability, breathing problems, seizures and difficulties taking a bottle or being  . In the 1970s, withdrawal symptoms affected mostly babies of   mothers in cities such as Philadelphia and New York, Dr. Tolia said. “What this study shows is this has totally flipped,” he added. Babies may be born with symptoms of withdrawal from any number of drugs, including certain antidepressants or barbiturates, after prolonged use by their mothers during pregnancy. But the new report found that rates of infant drug dependency are rising in tandem with maternal opioid use in particular. Doctors frequently prescribe opioids to    to treat back pain or abdominal pain. Nearly 42 percent of pregnant women in Utah on Medicaid were prescribed opioids, and roughly 35 percent in Idaho, a 2014 study found. Maternal opioid use was nearly 70 percent higher in rural counties than urban ones, the new report found. Last year, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that neonatal intensive care units nationwide that used to spend less than 1 percent of their days caring for these infants now must devote 4 percent of their staff hours to the task. Indeed, eight intensive care units reported spending more than 20 percent of their time caring for these vulnerable babies. The strain has prompted a debate about whether the NICU is the best place to treat these infants. A study in Pediatrics found that allowing mother and child to stay together in the same hospital room reduces the amount of drugs babies need, and overall costs, too. “Rooming is important for smaller, rural hospitals,” said Dr. Holmes, the first author on the Pediatrics study. “Then they know they can care for these babies without needing a neonatal care unit. ” Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital and an author on the JAMA Pediatrics study, finds the evidence on   convincing. In their intensive care unit, he said, “some of the babies we see are not in drug withdrawal. It’s mom withdrawal. ” The study found that rural infants and their mothers were more likely to be poorer and to rely on public insurance like Medicaid, but it did not address other factors behind the increase in babies born dependent on opioids. Women who are already addicted “may not be getting the help they need before they get pregnant,” said Dr. Nicole Villapiano, a pediatrician at C. S. Mott Children’s Hospital at the University of Michigan and the lead author of the new study. They also might have trouble finding medical assistance to treat opioid addiction once pregnant, too, she suggested. For many, the logistics can be difficult. Methadone, a drug commonly used in treatment programs, must be distributed at a clinic every day, which is “very challenging if you’re talking about a rural community where there isn’t much local health care,” Dr. Tolia said. Pregnant women may also be treated with buprenorphine, available at certain pharmacies. In theory, Dr. Tolia said, it could be more easily distributed to rural areas. “Our solutions need to be focused on where the disease is happening in communities,” he said. Once a baby arrives in a neonatal intensive care unit, “it’s too late. ” In July, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA. It stipulated that federal officials should give priority to funding programs in rural areas to improve treatment for pregnant women. “It’s the first time to my knowledge that that population has been recognized as being underserved, and was targeted specifically, and I think it’s real progress,” said Mark Dunn, the director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers. Shame is another reason pregnant women shy away from getting help. “It affects their ability to come forward for treatment,” said Dr. Anne Johnston, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Vermont, whose program aims to be nonjudgmental in order to “bring people out of the woodwork. ” Several experts said that focusing on the babies alone is shortsighted: To stem the rise in infant addiction, they noted, it is critical to treat the mothers’ opioid abuse. “One has to appreciate that behind every incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is relatively easy to recognize and relatively easy to treat,” Dr. Johnston said, “there’s a case of a mother dependent on opioids, and that’s complex to treat. ”",0
2743,Turkey’s Suspicious Mind-Set Has Been a Century in the Making - The New York Times,"Conspiracy theories about Western plots to undermine Turkey run so deep in the nation’s collective psyche that only the language of psychology is suitable to understanding them. The phenomenon is known as the Sèvres Syndrome, harking back nearly 100 years to a treaty that was never carried out but that would have divided Anatolia, the Asian landmass that makes up the bulk of modern Turkey. The syndrome is named for the French city where Western powers, at the conclusion of World War I, signed a treaty that brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Analysts have used the terms “phobia,” “trauma” and “syndrome” to describe the country’s   as if Turkey were a patient on a psychologist’s couch. Ever since Sèvres, they have said, Turkey as a nation has been suffering from   stress disorder. One way the syndrome is believed to have manifested itself is in Turkey’s denial of the Armenian genocide. More recently, Turks have blamed the United States and Western allies for huge street protests, a corruption scandal and this summer’s  failed military coup. The Turkish government has accused followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric in   exile in Pennsylvania, of plotting the coup. But rather than talking about how President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had allowed Mr. Gulen’s supporters to gain a foothold in the nation’s military, the Turkish public has been consumed with blaming the United States. “They say, well, it was the Americans who worked with Gulen to get in these positions,” said Fatma Muge Gocek, a   sociologist at the University of Michigan. “Why? Because they are out to get us. ” She added: “When you are constantly blaming others for what happens to you, you can never, therefore, heal. ” Dietrich Jung, a professor of Middle East studies at the University of Southern Denmark, said the actions of Europeans sometimes underscored suspicion about the Turks. He pointed to a recent debate in Denmark about whether that country’s royal family should meet with Mr. Erdogan during a visit to Turkey, given concerns about the Turkish leader’s growing authoritarianism. “They visited Saudi Arabia,” Mr. Jung said. “They visited China. Nobody talked about authoritarian politics. Why Erdogan?” Why indeed, many Turks would say, suspiciously.",0
2744,"Anonymous American Donor Funds ’Some Girls Have Penises, Some Boys Vaginas’ Poster Campaign","A poster campaign depicting naked children with genitalia of the opposite sex has hit cities across northern Spain thanks to an anonymous American donor. [The posters, which declare that some girls have penises and some boys have vulvas, have appeared at bus stops and metro stations across the Basque Country and Navarre.  Created by transgender advocacy group Chrysallis Euskal Herria, the images have appeared in major cities such as Pamplona, San Sebastián, Bilbao and Vitoria, with the backing of local government. They show four naked children holding hands, including one boy with female genitalia and one girl with male genitalia. Underneath, a slogan reads: “There are girls with penises and boys with vulvas. It’s as simple as that. ” Beatriz Sever, the group’s press officer, said they were designed to “raise social awareness about transgender children and for these children to feel represented”. “There is an evident gap in society’s ability to approach the issue of transgender children in a normal way,” she told El País. “The more we talk, the easier it will be for some parents to detect what is happening to their own children. Many of them deny their kids’ real identity simply out of ignorance. ” The poster campaign was made possible by a 28, 000 euro donation from an anonymous New York businessman. The organisation said he donated the money after reading about an earlier campaign where they handed out educational material in eight different languages. Ms. Sever defended the group’s depiction of naked children, saying: “It makes all the difference between children either being accepted or not. We need to make people understand that nature is not a photocopying machine. Those who deny their identity typically use genitals as an excuse. I myself, as a mother, once used that same argument, until I finally understood what was going on. ” The ongoing drive to push transgender ideology onto children is causing concern from some quarters. A report by two   psychiatrists last August found most children and teenagers who claim to be transgender change their minds as they grow up. It also warned parents and officials not to impose   surgery or treatment on children, saying: “There is no evidence that all children who express   thoughts or behavior should be encouraged to become transgender. ”",0
2745,The Euro Is Murdering Europe     : Information," The Euro Is Murdering Europe
By F. William Engdahl
November 13, "" NEO "" - The Euro is murdering the nations and economies of the EU quite literally. Since the fixed currency regime came into effect, replacing national currencies in transactions in 2002, the fixed exchange rate regime has devastated industry in the periphery states of the 19 Euro members while giving disproportionate benefit to Germany. The consequence has been a little-noted industrial contraction and lack of possibility to deal with resulting banking crises. The Euro is a monetarist disaster and the EU dissolution is now pre-programmed as just one consequence.
Those of you familiar with my thoughts on the economy will know I feel the entire concept of globalization, a term which was popularized under the presidency of Bill Clinton to glamorize the corporativist agenda that had just come into being with creation of the World Trade Organization in 1994, is fundamentally a destructive rigged game of the few hundred or so giant global players. Globalization destroys nations to advance the agenda of a few hundred giant, unregulated multinationals. Its based on a disproven theory put forward in the 18 th Century by English free trade proponent David Ricardo, known as the Theory of Comparative Advantage, used by Washington to justify removing any and all national trade protectionism in order to benefit the most powerful Global Players, mostly US-based.
The faltering US project known as Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership or the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, is little more than Mussolini on steroids. The most powerful few hundred corporations will formally stand above national law if we are foolish enough to elect corrupt politicians that will endorse such nonsense. Yet few have really looked closely at the effect that surrender of currency sovereignty under the Euro regime is having.
Collapse of Industry
The nations of what today is misleadingly known as the European Union follow a concept ratified by a then-far-smaller number of European memberstwelve versus 28 states todayof what had been the European Economic Community (EEC). A European version of giganto-mania appeared during the EEC Commission presidency of French globalist politician Jacques Delors when he unveiled what was called the Single European Act in February 1986.
Delors overturned the principle established by Frances Charles de Gaulle, the principle which de Gaulle referred to as Europe of the Fatherlands. De Gaulles concept of the European Economic Communitythen six nations including France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux threewas one in which there would be periodical meetings of the premiers of the six Common Market nations. There, with elected heads of states, policies would be formulated and decisions made. An assembly elected from members of national parliaments would review the actions of the ministers. De Gaulle viewed the Brussels EEC bureaucracy as a purely technical administrative body, subordinate to national governments. Cooperation should be based on the reality of state sovereignty. Supranational acquisition of power over individual nations of the EEC was anathema for de Gaulle, rightly so. As with individuals so with nationsautonomy is basic and borders do matter.
Delors Single Act proposed to overturn that Europe of the Fatherlands through radical reforms to the EEC aimed at the destructive idea that the diverse nations, with diverse histories, cultures and diverse languages, could dissolve borders and become a kind of ersatz United States of Europe, run top down by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. It in essence is a Mussolini-style corporativist or fascist vision of a non-democratic, non-responsible European bureaucracy controlling populations arbitrarily, answerable only to corporate influence, pressure, corruption.
It was an agenda developed by the largest multinationals of Europe, whose lobby organization was the European Roundtable of Industrialists (ERT), the influential lobby group of Europes major multinationals (by personal invitation only) such as Swiss-based Nestle, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Vodafone, BASF, Deutsche Telekom, ThyssenKrupp, Siemens and other giant European multinationals. The ERT, not surprisingly, is the major lobby in Brussels pushing adoption of the TIPP trade deal with Washington .
The ERT was a major driver for the 1986 Delors Single Act proposals that led to the Frankenstein Monster called the European Union. The idea of the EU is creation of a top-down central unelected political authority that would decide the future of Europe without democratic checks and balances, at heart a truly feudal notion.
The concept of a single United States of Europe, dissolving national identities that went back more than a thousand years or more, can be traced back to the 1950s when the Bilderberg Meeting of 1955 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, first discussed the creation out of the six member nations of the European Coal and Steel Community of a common currency, and this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority . De Gaulle was not present.
The project to create a monetary union was unveiled at a 1992 EEC conference in Maastricht, Holland following the unification of Germany. France and Italy, backed by Margaret Thatchers Britain, forced it through over German misgivings in order to contain the power of a unified Germany. British Tory press railed against Germany as an emerging Fourth Reich, conquering Europe economically, not militarily. Ironically, this is what has very much de facto emerged from the structures of the Euro today. Because of the Euro, Germany economically dominates the entire 19 Eurozone countries.
The problem with the creation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) prescribed in Maastricht Treaty is that the single currency and the independent European Central Bank were launched without being tied to a political single legal entity, a genuine United States of Europe. The Euro and the European Central Bank is a supranational creation without answerability to anyone. It was done in absence of a genuine organic political union such as that created when 13 states, with common English language and following a commonly-fought war of independence from Great Britain, created and adopted the Constitution of the United States of America. In 1788 the delegates from the 13 states agreed to establish a republican form of government grounded in representing the people in the states, with separation of powers between the legislative, judicial and executive branches. Not so the EMU.
The EU bureaucrats have a cute name for this disconnect between unelected central bank officials of the ECB controlling the economic destiny of the 19 member states with 340 million citizens of the so-called Eurozone. They call it the democratic deficit. That deficit has grown gargantuan since the 2008 global financial and banking crisis and the emergence of the not-sovereign European Central Bank.
Collapse of Industry
The creation of the Euro single currency since 1992 has put the Euro member states into an economic strait-jacket. The currency value cannot be changed to boost national exports during economic downturns such as that experienced since 2008. The result has been that the largest industrial power in the Eurozone, Germany, has benefited from the stable euro while weaker economies on the periphery of the EU, including most notably, France, have endured catastrophic consequences to the rigid Euro rate.
In a new report, the Dutch think-tank, Gefira Foundation, notes that French industry has been contracting since the adoption of the euro. It was not able to recover after either of the 2001 or 2008 crises because the euro, a currency stronger than the French franc would be, has become a burden to Frances economy. The floating exchange rate works like an indicator of the strength of the economy and like an automatic stabilizer. A weaker currency helps to regain competitiveness during a crisis, while a stronger currency supports consumption of foreign goods .
The study notes that because of this currency strait-jacket, ECBs policy has created a Euro too high versus other major currencies to enable France to maintain exports since the economic downturn of 2001. The Euro has led to increased imports into France and because France had no exchange rate flexibility, her industry could not regain international competitiveness in the worlds market after the 2001 crisis, so its industry has been slowly dying ever since. They lost the economic stabilizing tool of a floating exchange rate .
Today, according to the Eurostat, industry makes up 14.1% of the French total gross value added. In 1995 it was 19.2%. In Germany it is 25.9%. Most striking has been the collapse of a once-vibrant French car industry. Despite the fact that world car production almost doubled from 1997 to 2015 from 53 million to 90 million vehicles annually, and while Germany increased its car production by 20% from 5 to 6 million, from the time France joined the Euro in 2002, French car production almost halved from nearly 4 million to less than 2 million .
Euro Bail-in Laws
The same Euro strait-jacket is preventing a serious reorganization of troubled banks across the Eurozone since the 2008 crisis. The creation of the supra-national, non-sovereign European central Bank has made it impossible for member countries of the Eurozone to resolve their banking problems created during the excesses of the pre-2008 period. The case of Italy with its request to make a state bailout of its third-largest bank, Monte dei Paschi, is exemplary. Though draconian layoffs and closings have for the moment eased panic, Brussels refused to permit a $5 billion Italian state rescue of the bank, instead demanding the bank revert to a new EU banking law called Bail in. While they may not yet dare to implement bail-in just yet in Italy, it is EU law and will certainly be the instrument of choice by the unelected Eurogroup when the next banking crisis hits.
Bail-in, while it sounds better than taxpayer bailout, actually requires that a banks depositors be robbed of their deposits to rescue a failed bank, if Brussels or the unelected Eurogroup decides such a bail-in of deposits is needed after bank bond holders and stock holders and creditors have not been able to meet the losses. This bail-in confiscation was applied in Cyprus banks in 2013 by the EU. Depositors there with over 100,000 either lost 40% of their money .
If you are a depositor in, say, Deutsche Bank, and the stock shares are tanking, as they have been, and legal troubles threaten their existence, and the German government refuses to talk bailout, but rather leaves the bank to potential bail-in, you can be sure every depositor with an account over 100,000 will begin to look to other banks, worsening the crisis for Deutsche Bank. Then all other remaining depositors would be vulnerable to bail-in as was initially proposed by the Eurogroup for Cyprus banks.
Surrender of monetary sovereignty
Under the Euro and the rules of Eurogroup and ECB, decisions are no longer sovereign but central, taken by not-democratically appointed faceless bureaucrats like Holland Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, President of Eurogroup. During the Cyprus bank crisis Dijsselbloem proposed confiscating all depositor money, big or small, to recapitalize the banks. He was forced to back down at the last minute, but it shows what is possible in the coming EU bank crisis that is pre-programmed by the defective Euro institution and its fatally flawed ECB.
Under current Eurozone rules, effective January, 2016, EU national governments are prohibited from taxpayer rescue of their banks, preventing orderly resolution of bank liquidity problems until too late. Germany has adopted a bank bail-in law as have other EU governments. The new bail-in rules are the result of a bureaucratic directive from the unelected, faceless bureaucrats of the EU Commission known as the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive ( BRRD ).
In 1992 when Swedish banks went into insolvency as a real estate bubble popped, the state stepped in with Securum, a bad-bank/good bank rescue. The bankrupt banks were temporarily nationalized. Non-performing real estate loans in billions were put into the state corporation, Securum, the so-called bad bank. The risk-addicted bank directors were dismissed. The nationalized banks, minus bad loans, were allowed, under state management, to resume lending and return to profit before being reprivatized as the economy improved. The non-performing real estate became again profitable as the economy recovered over several years, and after five years the state could sell the assets for a total net profit and liquidate Securum . Taxpayers were not burdened.
ECB Prevents Bank Resolutions
Now, as the EU faces a new round of bank solvency crises with banks like Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and major banks across the Eurozone facing new capital crises, because the EU lacks a central taxation power, no flexible tax-payer or bank nationalization is possible. New national bank rules adjusted to local circumstances are not possible. Measures to give troubled banks time such as allowing a temporary moratorium on foreclosures and repossessions if people fall behind on their payments, outsourcing national electronic payment system to commercial banks, are not possible.
The EuroZone has no central fiscal authority, so such solutions cannot be implemented. Banking system problems are only being solved by monetary authorities, by the insane ECB policy of negative interest rates, so-called Quantitative Easing where the ECB buys endless billions of Euros in dodgy corporate and state debt with no end in sight, and in the process making insurance companies and pension funds insolvent.
The answer is definitely not that proposed by the kleptocratic George Soros and others, namely to give the unelected Brussels super-state the central fiscal power to issue Brussels Euro bonds. The only possible solution short of destroying the economies of the entire Eurozone in the coming next European bank solvency crisis, is to dismantle the Frankenstein Monster called the European Monetary Union with its ECB and common currency.
The individual countries in the 19 country Euro Zone do not form what economists call an optimum currency area, never did. The economic problems of a Greece or Italy or even France are vastly different from those of Germany, or of Portugal or Spain.
In 1997 before his death, one of my least-favorite economists, Milton Friedman, stated, Europe exemplifies a situation unfavorable to a common currency. It is composed of separate nations, speaking different languages, with different customs, and having citizens feeling far greater loyalty and attachment to their own country than to a common market or to the idea of Europe. On that, I have to say, he was right. Its even more so the case today. The Euro and its European Central Bank are murdering Europe as effectively as the Second World War did, only without the bombs and rubble.

Paul also said she should be asked about former President Barack Obama’s knowledge of these alleged activities. “For years, both progressives and libertarians have been complaining about these backdoor searches,” Paul said. “It’s not that we’re searching maybe one foreign leader and who they talk to we search everything in the whole world. There were reports a couple of years ago that all of Italy’s phone calls were absorbed in a one month period of time. We were getting Merkel’s phone calls we were getting everybody’s phone calls. But by rebound we are collecting millions of Americans phone calls. If you want to look at an American’s phone call or listen to it, you should have to have a warrant, the old fashioned way in a real court where both sides get represented. ” “But a secret warrant by a secret court with a lower standard level because we’re afraid of terrorism is one thing for foreigners but both myself and a Progressive Ron Wyden have been warning about these back door searches for years and that they could be politicized,” he continued. “The facts will come out with Susan Rice. But I think she ought to be under subpoena. She should be asked did you talk to the president about it? Did President Obama know about this? So this is actually, eerily similar to what Trump accused them of which is eavesdropping on conversations for political reasons. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
2748,PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million – TruthFeed,"PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million PAY TO PLAY : Hillary’s Two Big Favors For Morocco Netted Her $28 Million Breaking News By TruthFeedNews October 31, 2016 
By Richard Pollock – DailyCaller 
Hillary Clinton did two huge favors for Morocco during her tenure as secretary of state while the Clinton Foundation accepted up to $28 million in donations from the country’s ruler, King Mohammed VI, according to new information obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group. 
Clinton and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Lisa Jackson tried to shut down the Florida-based Mosaic Company in 2011, operator of America’s largest phosphate mining facility. 
Jackson’s close ties and loyalty to the Clintons were revealed when she joined the Clinton Foundation’s board of directors in 2013, just months after she left the EPA. Jackson is also close to John Podesta , Clinton’s national campaign chairman. 
Morocco’s state-owned phosphate company, OCP, would ostensibly have benefited from Jackson’s move to shut down Mosaic. Mohammed donated up to $15 million to the Clinton Foundation through OCP. 
Clinton also relaxed U.S. foreign aid restrictions on Morocco, thus allowing U.S. funds to be used in the territory of Western Sahara where OCP operates phosphate mining operations. The aid restrictions stemmed from Morocco’s illegal occupation of the territory since 1974. 
Morocco is repeatedly condemned for seizing the territory and for unilaterally extracting the country’s valuable minerals, impoverishing what’s left of the local Sahrawi Arabs. 
No nation recognizes Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara and the United Nation’s Security Council legal office and the International Court of Justice both demand that Muhammed withdraw his claim over the territory and end illegal extraction of minerals. 
An email WikiLeaks made public last week illustrated how Clinton, while acting as secretary of state, negotiated an additional $12 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from Muhammed in return for holding the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. Another $1 million payment came from OCP to cover the expenses of the CGI meeting. 
The regulatory assault against the U.S. phosphate industry began in earnest when Jackson launched a barrage of intimidating regulatory initiatives against Mosaic. Environmental concerns about phosphates date from 1979 but the EPA did little to address concerns related to phosphate mining until Jackson’s 2011 moves. 
The regulatory assault on the U.S. phosphate industry encompassed several agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS aircraft flew at low altitudes over Mosaic’s central Florida operations in search of environmental problems. The EPA also threatened large Superfund penalties, which could have bankrupted Mosaic. 
Phosphates are essential ingredients in fertilizers used in American farming. Closing or reducing Mosaic’s output would have cost tens of thousands of American jobs and injured the country’s agricultural productivity. 
It also would leave the U.S. dependent upon foreign phosphate producers, but particularly Morocco’s OCP. The only other countries that mine phosphates are Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. 
Rep. Dennis Ross, a Republican congressman who represents the Florida district where Mosaic operates, told TheDCNF he now sees why the EPA went after Mosaic. 
“The tactics makes perfect sense as to why the EPA, under Lisa Jackson’s tutelage, targeted Mosaic’s phosphate operations in my district. I was never given any answers when I questioned Lisa Jackson about the EPA’s deliberate actions against Mosaic,” Ross told TheDCNF. 
“Now I know why. An environmental concern never existed. This targeting was all done as a payback to Morocco for donating millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,” Ross said. 
An uproar from Florida regulators push-back from the state’s congressional delegation and the agency’s tenuous legal position all forced the EPA to end its threats against Mosaic. 
Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who is vice-chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and a vocal critic of the Clinton Foundation, agreed with Ross, saying “these facts seem to reveal the possibility of more pay-to-play activities at the Clinton Foundation.” 
“It would be especially troubling if the Clinton Foundation was working with the EPA to suppress the American phosphate industry in favor of Morocco. The EPA and Clinton Foundation should be forthcoming about their dealings with the Moroccan government and the American phosphate industry.” 
Clinton’s 2012 support of a rider on the U.S. foreign aid bill permitting foreign aid to be sent to the Western Sahara arguably legitimized Moroccan occupation of territory and depopulated the Sahrawi Arabs. Native Moroccans were sent into the country by the government to extract the minerals. 
The rider approved by Clinton said that U.S. foreign aid funds “may be used in regions and territories administered by Morocco,” meaning, the Western Sahara. The Western Sahara is classified a “Non-Self-Governing Territory” under international law. 
“Previously, United States excluded Western Sahara from bilateral assistance to avoid seeming to endorse Moroccan control,” said Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at Northwestern University School of Law, in a legal review of occupied territories around the world. 
Hans Corell, the U.N. Security Council’s Under-Secretary for Legal Affairs, said in January 2002 that “if further exploration and exploitation activities were to proceed in disregard of the interests and wishes of the people of Western Sahara, they would be in violation of the international law principles applicable to mineral resource activities in Non-Self-Governing Territories.” 
A Dec. 10, 2015 report by the International Court of Justice ruled that “the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognized by the European Union or its Member States, or more generally by the UN, and the absence of any international mandate capable of justifying Moroccan presence on that territory.” 
But none of that mattered to former President Bill Clinton, who said nothing about the world’s condemnation of Morocco’s exploitation of the area for its phosphate industry, while speaking at the Clinton Foundation’s 2015 Marrakech CGI conference. Instead, he praised it. 
“The Moroccans who are here will tell you that in the last several years, they have become the Saudi Arabia of phosphates, and what they have done with it, to diversify their economy and to make it part of a comprehensive strategy instead of another example of resource curse, is very impressive indeed,” Clinton said. 
“Hillary Clinton sold her soul when they accepted that money,” reported Politico the day after the Marrakech CGI conference.

2749,Abortion Foes Aim to Compete With Turnout for Women’s March - The New York Times,"Opponents of abortion watching the women’s march on their televisions last Saturday stewed as they saw the Planned Parenthood logo over the stage and the actress Scarlett Johansson praising the group for the gynecological care she received as a teenager. But for these viewers, there was an even bigger problem. The women’s march had drawn an estimated   people to Washington, and many more to simultaneous demonstrations around the country, dominating the nation’s news coverage just six days before abortion foes were holding their annual march. Since then, the organizers of that march have been telling their followers: You’d better turn out on Friday. This year’s   march in Washington  —   the 44th annual March for Life  —   was expected to be a celebratory event at which abortion opponents could finally savor a few victories. The new president, Donald J. Trump, is already delivering on his promises to sign a slate of   measures. He has promised to nominate a Supreme Court justice who could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion 44 years ago. And a Congress dominated by Republicans is poised to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider. But a new sense of urgency, anxiety and maybe a little envy has accompanied this year’s event, with   organizers suddenly realizing they had a tough act to follow. “We’re definitely pulling out all the stops this year to try to get people to come,” said Amelia Irvine, president of Georgetown Right to Life at Georgetown University in Washington. National organizers of the March for Life said that while they were hopeful of a large turnout on Friday, they did not have any way to gauge how many would attend. This year’s event will have two major draws: Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway, who managed Mr. Trump’s campaign and is now a White House counselor, are scheduled to speak. No president or vice president has ever addressed the march in person. Last year, many marchers were deterred by a snowstorm that trapped some buses en route and stranded some marchers in town for days afterward. Organizers said that since so many had to cancel last year, there is   energy this year. One of the largest turnouts was in 2013, the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the march itself. Some abortion opponents claimed that as many as 650, 000 marchers showed up. But for this and every year, the March for Life organization itself played it conservative, estimating that the marchers numbered in “the tens of thousands. ” “I don’t think that these numbers are the most important,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, in a telephone interview. “The number most important for us is 58 million, which is the number of Americans that have been lost to abortion. ” She said that calls and emails began pouring into March for Life’s offices last Sunday from women who are opposed to abortion and were disturbed to see the strong abortion rights message coming from the stage of the women’s march in Washington. “We are hearing from a lot of women who felt like their voices weren’t represented last weekend,” said Mrs. Mancini, who called in volunteers to handle the deluge. But it is unclear whether that anger will translate into attendance at the March for Life. Though many marchers come to the city by car or train, one gauge of expected attendance  —   bus parking permits  —   suggests the event will be smaller than last weekend’s women’s march. As of Wednesday only 92 permits had been issued for the March for Life, according to Events DC and the city’s Department of Transportation, which handle the permits. Some 1, 800 permits were issued for the women’s march, and 450 for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the transportation department said. The march has become an increasingly youthful event, attracting busloads of college, high school and middle school students from across the country, many from Catholic and evangelical Christian schools. This year, the University of Notre Dame, the famed Catholic college in Indiana, is sending 700 students on 13 charter buses, one of the largest campus contingents, said Emily Burns, vice president of communications with Notre Dame Right to Life. She said that she and many of her club members shared many of the feminist goals of the women’s march, such as preventing sexual assault and violence against women, and were uncomfortable being seen as in competition with the women’s march. “This definitely is not a competition for us,” Ms. Burns said. “But we are hoping that with the numbers we bring year after year, maybe we receive a bit more coverage this year. ” There is widespread resentment in the   movement that the media has not devoted much coverage to the March for Life in the past, perhaps because it happens every year. This year, a large coalition of   groups have banded together to pressure television and cable networks to devote the same kind of media coverage to the March for Life as they devoted to the women’s march. Still, compared with   supporters, organizers of Friday’s march may have a smaller base of people to draw from. A survey released by the Pew Research Center in October found that 59 percent of Americans said that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 37 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Although there were wide gaps between Democrats and Republicans, overall support for legal abortion was at its highest level since 1995, the survey found. At Georgetown University, which is a Catholic and Jesuit college, Ms. Irvine is expecting only 30 to 40 students to attend the March for Life, despite her group’s efforts. Some students who would have wanted to attend could not, she said, because Friday is a class day and the university would not excuse absences from classes or labs to attend the march. The numbers appear far lower than Georgetown’s turnout for the women’s march, said Ms. Irvine: “Our entire school basically went. ” She said it would be unfair to compare the size of the two marches, however, because Washington is a liberal city in which a vast majority of residents voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Trump. “I do think there will be comparison,” she said, “but I don’t think it will be an accurate representation of what the public actually thinks. ”",0
2750,Chickens Come Home to Roost: Massive Layoffs Predicted for ESPN Broadcasters - Breitbart,"As reported extensively by Breitbart News, ESPN has suffered severe losses in cable subscriptions over the last few years, the repercussion of which will rear its ugly head in the form of significant cutting of   talent in the near future. [According to comments made Thursday by ESPN’s Jim Miller on SI Media Podcast with Richard Deitsch, dozens of employees will soon join the unemployment lines.  “The way that I’ve heard it —  and I’ve kind of run the numbers on it, I think we’re looking at between 40 and 50 people,” Miller said. “And look, there’s a lot of uncertainty about who it’s gonna be and why. Remember, this is not quantum physics, so it’s not an exact equation. ” The plight of ESPN is no trivial matter for entertainment giant Disney, the parent company for the “Worldwide leader in sports entertainment. ” In February, The Wrap reported, “Cable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disney’s stock price even as the company’s two other major prongs, movies, and theme parks, continue to perform well.  “As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100. 1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disney’s profits during fiscal 2016. ” Miller presented a potential revised line up for the beleaguered network: 6 a. m.  —     of Neil Everett and Stan Verrett’s SportsCenter from the night before,   a. m.  —   Mike Greenberg’s newly announced show, which, as Miller points out, will feature only one   personality, 10 a. m.   —   First Take, presumably still featuring Stephen A. Smith, Max Kellerman and Molly Qerim,   p. m.  —   A widely rumored but     show featuring Bomani Jones and Pablo Torre,   p. m.  —  ”The normal kind of coverage of what they’re doing, and Around the Horn and PTI, 6 p. m.  —   SC6 with Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, Evening  —   Live sports, 11 p. m.  —   SportsCenter, Midnight  —   Scott Van Pelt’s SportsCenter show, 1 a. m.  —   Everett and Verrett’s SportsCenter show, Miller went on to say, “If you’re ESPN talent and you’re looking at a schedule that’s something like that, based on the commitments they’ve made, if you’re not on that, then you’re starting to feel a little shaky. ” But, he caveated,  “That’s not to say everyone else is gone, but I think those are the people that should take a deep breath, and those are the people that should feel immune. ” Deitsch responded, according to his sources at ESPN, “If you are part of the SportsCenter unit right now but not one of the special talents where management has tapped on the shoulder and given the golden ticket, if I were one of those people I would be talking to my agent and my representation of how management thinks of me. ” Both Deitsch and Miller agreed that the most popular sportscasters will keep their jobs, however, they might be subject to substantial pay cuts.",0
2751,Frank Ocean Ends His Long Silence With a Variety of Works - The New York Times,"In this time of relentlessness and ubiquity, there is no art more potent, or shocking, than the art of disappearance. Silence may not be Frank Ocean’s greatest gift, but it’s one the RB singer has wielded effectively for most of the four years since his last album, “Channel Orange. ” The reactions to his evaporation from public life have been most intriguing to watch  —   his denial has been seen as a necessary balm against the scrutiny of fame, and then, after a while, a sort of insult, and finally, in the   to his   projects, a possible sign of failure on the horizon. Lest you mistake the silence of creative gestation for the silence of lethargy, Mr. Ocean has now swapped scarcity for abundance. Since Thursday, he has released, in effect, two new albums  —   “Blonde” and a “visual album” called “Endless,” both exclusive to Apple Music  —   a video for the song “Nikes,” and an oversize art magazine, Boys Don’t Cry, which includes a CD version of “Blonde” and was made available free at   shops in four cities. Though “Endless,” with its meaningfully slow   video of Mr. Ocean building a staircase, came first, the pairing of “Blonde” and Boys Don’t Cry captures the range of Mr. Ocean’s ambitions and gifts. “Blonde” is dewy, radiant and easeful, with an approach to incantatory soul that evolves moment to moment. It’s feverish but unhurried, a slowly smoldering set that’s emphatic about loneliness. “I couldn’t gauge your   can’t relate to my peers,” Mr. Ocean sings on “Seigfried. ” Mr. Ocean writes impressionistically, and sings with a casual sternness, as if sauntering into the studio, smearing out an idea running through his head, then retreating. That’s reflected in the range of vocal approaches he takes on “Blonde”:   exhalation, digitally manipulated childlike singing, forceful spoken word,   rapping, obscured conversation. Mr. Ocean’s previous projects  —   the 2011 mixtape “Nostalgia, Ultra” and the 2012 album “Channel Orange”  —   were products of an intuitive songwriter and a singer just getting comfortable with the outer boundaries of his power. “Blonde” and “Endless” show someone willing to forsake that progress in service of perfecting a mood. He excels on the ecstatically relaxed “Pink + White” and the mildly    “Self Control. ” On the puppyish “Solo,” he’s as close to content as he gets here mostly, he labors over romantic scenarios that leave him vexed, or worse. So often on this album, he’s pleading for recognition: “I’ll sleep between y’all, it’s nothing” (“Self Control”) “I’m not him but I’ll mean something to you” (“Nikes”). “Blonde” is also not precious about the sanctity of Mr. Ocean’s perspective. It includes a scolding voice mail from a mother (possibly Mr. Ocean’s) to a son a story narrated by the French producer Sebastian about the paranoia of the digital age and a kinetic,   verse from André 3000 on “Solo (Reprise)” that swallows all the air around it. Yet at the same time, Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar are here, in largely ceremonial roles. (A list of album collaborators appears in the magazine, but full writing and production credits were not immediately made available.) In 2016, the condition and circumstances of an album’s release are integral to its reception. For Beyoncé, the sudden drop of “Lemonade” underscored her militaristic precision for Kanye West, the   album “The Life of Pablo” reflected his artistic restlessness for Rihanna, the stumbled rollout of “Anti” matched her confident indifference. From a distance, Mr. Ocean’s return came in fits and starts, with release plans hinted at, then abandoned. But what Mr. Ocean has achieved with the complexity of this rollout  —   as well as his ability to mold corporate motives to his benefit  —   is an almost complete reframing of his public narrative. Mr. Ocean is now a photographer. A screenplay writer. An essayist (his Tumblr posts after the Orlando shooting and Prince’s death have been cleareyed and devastatingly felt). And in the video of “Endless,” a carpenter. (One of the more fun artifacts of Mr. Ocean’s absence  —   and there are many  —   was a tweet, recently rediscovered, written in March by a woman who met a man at a bar who boasted of teaching Mr. Ocean how to build a staircase. He wasn’t lying.) Much of this comes in Boys Don’t Cry, which is an impressively polished and elaborate data dump of Mr. Ocean’s nonmusical taste. The aesthetic is decidedly indebted to the peak Tumblr era of a few years ago, a jumble of ideas inspired by the curiosity fostered and satiated by the internet. Over 300 pages long, it includes a   printed with Jenny Holzer’s “Truisms” (which he wears in the “Nikes” video) a photo spread of Kanye West picking up McDonald’s at a   in a Lamborghini another photo spread detailing what appear to be the   specifications in the studio of the artist Tom Sachs and what look like internet search histories collected from Mr. Ocean and some of his collaborators. Much of the magazine is given over to the eroticism of the automobile  —   there are photos of Mr. Ocean looking blissful around cars, a spread of racecar drivers deep in thought, a striking photo shoot of nude young Chinese men draped on and in a compact sedan. In an essay at the beginning of the magazine, Mr. Ocean suggests his car fixation might be part of “a deep subconscious straight boy fantasy,” but then adds, “Consciously though, I don’t want straight  —   a little bent is good. ” Mr. Ocean announced on his Tumblr in 2012 that when he was 19 he fell in love with a man. Sexual fluidity and ambiguity play key parts in the new projects. The magazine features both nude men and women, and there are small references to gender nonconformity throughout these works: a shot of Mr. Ocean wearing strong eyeliner in the “Nikes” video, and another in the middle of a   photo shoot in the magazine or a sample of the drag icon Crystal LaBeija, taken from the documentary “The Queen,” on “Endless. ” And most vividly, his album is called “Blonde,” but its cover reads “blond,” alongside a photo of Mr. Ocean, his short hair dyed neon green  —   the feminine, the masculine, the none of the above. This elasticity extends to the music, which avoids easy formatting, in terms of structure. On this record, there is nothing like “Thinkin Bout You,” his biggest hit  —   no song that centers Mr. Ocean’s very real gift for melody. Instead, Mr. Ocean moves from feeling to feeling, hurt to hurt, not stopping long enough to privilege any one moment. On iTunes, you can only buy “Blonde” as a whole, conveniently both a comment on its unity and also a clear commercial tactic  —   with four years in the shadows, Mr. Ocean has perfected the navigation of the intersection of corporate and emotional concerns. This is perhaps the truest way to release music in 2016, especially for an artist who inspires fervor at the level Mr. Ocean does: Use the available tools to fill the vacuum of your own making, not the one made for you. On “Futura Free,” he tells off the world: “I ain’t on your   ain’t on no schedule. ”",0
2752,US Army to Upgrade Stryker Vehicles With Missile-Crushing Laser Weapon,"Get short URL 0 6 0 0 Amid escalating tensions in Eastern Europe, the US Army will soon arm its Stryker combat vehicles with a laser weapons system. 
The laser, developed by General Dynamics Land Systems, is currently being tested and is expected to be ready within the next 11 months. © AP Photo/ Alik Keplicz US General Reveals Details on NATO Troops Deployment in Poland 
""The idea is to provide a solution to a capability gap which is an inability to acquire, track and destroy low, slow drones that proliferate all over the world,"" said Tim Reese, director of strategic planning, according to Business Insider . 
Mounted on US Army Stryker vehicles, the lasers will likely be used to shoot down enemy drones. The weapon could also be fine-tuned to target incoming munitions. 
""The energy of the laser damages, destroys and melts different components of the target,"" Reese said. ""We’ve clearly demonstrated you can take out UAVs pretty effectively,"" Mary Miller, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Research and Technology, added. ""Now we are not only working on how we take out UAVs but also mortars and missiles – and eventually cruise missiles."" Scared of Russian BMPs, US Strykers in Europe to Get 30mm Guns 
Laser weapons offer a number of benefits. Ammunition, for instance, is virtually unlimited, so long as enough power can be generated to create a beam. The USS Ponce was one of the first US military units to be fitted with a mounted laser weapon, since a ship can easily mobilize the large power generators necessary. Stationary laser weapons have also been placed at military bases for the same reason. Shrinking these power sources to fit a vehicle as small as a Stryker was a unique challenge. 
Even with the high-energy requirements, lasers are comparatively cost-effective. 
""The shot per kill (with lasers) is very inexpensive when the alternative is sending out a multi-million dollar missile,"" Miller said. 
A number of US Strykers are based in Europe as part of the US Army’s 2nd Cavalry Regiment. Those units have already undergone upgrades to the 30mm cannon, at a cost of $3.8 million per vehicle. © REUTERS/ Agencja Gazeta/Adam Stepien 
The Stryker squadron, based in Germany, will play a role in NATO’s increased presence in Poland and the Baltics. 
""This is credible deterrence,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday, according to Stars and Stripes. ""Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond."" 
Since 2014, NATO has been building up its military presence in Europe, especially in Eastern European countries neighboring Russia, using Moscow's alleged interference in the Ukrainian conflict and its potential for ""aggression"" against neighboring states as a pretext. 
Moscow has repeatedly denied the claims and warned NATO that the military buildup on Russia's borders is provocative and threatens the existing strategic balance of power. ...",0

2755,After all the hype & scaremongering the Washington Post now admits the Zika virus doesn't cause brain deformities,"March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades, with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects...Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post - a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people - continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. Instead, nothing happened. No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post 's own graphic: (partial list) Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections... ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections... TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections... ZERO birth defects From the WashPost article: Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, ""we are not seeing a big increase."" Gee, really? The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil You don't have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk. If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers - who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America -- mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil. ""...[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,"" says WashPost . Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that's the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. Apparently, there isn't a single ""official"" scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW... Let's throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don't deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They're all so incredibly stupid, they couldn't survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren't giving up hope just yet... science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post , which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults. Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can't wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC.(Yippee?) And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika ""scientists"" goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief. Via the WashPost: ""Now we've settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don't know who pulled the trigger,"" said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn't even make any sense. Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: ""Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,"" he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. ""We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don't know who it is,"" Marques said. Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I'm a real scientist saying all this As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world's leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that's the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post . It's all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another. The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science As you've also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn't interested in legitimate scientific solutions. They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They've got an agenda to push, and it doesn't matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, there's no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you. So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official ""science"" was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health ""officials"" were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child. Red more unintentional scientific comedy at this Washington Post article . Comment: More interesting articles about the Zika freakout:",0
2756,Britain looking forward to bonfire night because it can’t afford to put the heating on,"Britain looking forward to bonfire night because it can’t afford to put the heating on 05-11-16 
BRITAIN’S enthusiasm for firework displays is really about avoiding extortionate heating bills, it has been confirmed. 
Researchers discovered that, rather than being excited about synchronised explosions, most attendees are actually looking forward to getting the feeling back in their extremities without laying awake worrying about money. 
Zero-hours courier Sarah Smith, 33, said: “It’s not just the bonfire, there’s the body heat from the crowd too. What a treat.” 
Nurse Tom Logan, 27, added: “I couldn’t give a shit about fireworks. 
“I’d rather be at home watching Luther , but it’s so cold that I have to wear gloves and a hat inside. If getting warm means standing in the mud, in the dark, listening to people go ‘ooh’, that’s a small price to pay – and much better value than EDF.” 
Both said that they would be leaving before the finale, however, as it would inevitably be soundtracked by Katy Perry’s Firework , like every display since 2010.

2758,Выкинуть хлам и жить по фэншуй,"Общество » Практика » Как отдохнуть Как изменить жизнь к лучшему с помощью фэншуй? Как организовать домашнее пространство так, чтобы вещи работали на ваше благо? Почему специалисты по фэншуй против стеклянных столов и с осторожностью относятся к зеркалам? В какую сторону света все же лучше спать головой? Секреты фэншуй для Pravda.Ru раскрыла мастер фэншуй Татьяна Мизгирева. 0 комментариев 1 поделились 
— Фэншуй — это наука? 
— Да, фэншуй - это наука. Но это не наука с точки зрения какой-то западной доказательной базы, это наука с точки зрения восточного взгляда. Разные школы фэншуй, традиции, передачи развивались тысячелетиями - и развивались за счет наблюдений. У каждой из них создалась огромная накопительная статистическая база. То есть, когда что-то одно повторяется десять раз, вы думаете, что в этом есть какая-то закономерность. Но если сто, тысячу раз этот эффект повторился, то это уже можно назвать научной статистикой, но в восточном ключе. 
— Давайте рассмотрим домашнее пространство. Начнем с прихожей. Какие ошибки чаще всего делают люди в оформлении своей прихожей? Каких вещей там не должно быть в принципе, а какие вещи или цвета, наоборот, благоприятно влияют на жизнь хозяев этой квартиры? 
— Самая частая и распространенная ошибка — это расположение зеркала напротив входной двери, в особенности если прихожая небольшая. Если прихожая огромная и где-то вдали находится зеркало, то это не так страшно. Но если у нас от входной двери до ближайшей стены напротив полтора-два метра и сразу же висит зеркало, то это будет серьезно обесточивать квартиру. Потому что зеркало на сто процентов отталкивает все входящие воздушные потоки, а с ними и жизненно важную энергию Ци, которая приходит вместе с потоками воздуха. Таким образом, квартира обесточивается, и это проявляется в жизни людей, возникают проблемы, такие как трудности в получении работы, новых проектов, невозможность реализовать себя, трудности в общении. Как будто бы пространство стоит спиной к нам, и вся жизнь отвернулась, и все приходит с колоссальным трудом. 
Стоит только убрать это зеркало и перевесить его таким образом, чтобы оно перенаправляло вглубь квартиры все эти воздушные потоки, и можно почувствовать сразу же, в течение нескольких дней, что жизнь кардинальным образом поменяется. Как будто все снова повернулось к вам лицом и начинает помогать. Это очень важно. 
Еще одна ошибка, которую очень часто можно встретить в прихожих, - это недостаточно яркий свет. Все-таки прихожая — это так называемая ""янская зона"". Там должна быть сильная активность, и там должен быть яркий свет. Нужно не поскупиться на хорошую лампочку, которая будет все хорошо освещать. Известно, что яркий свет привлекает яркие, сильные энергии. 
Также в прихожей надо добавить простора. То есть чем менее заставлена входная зона, тем легче воздушным потокам войти в квартиру и наполнить ее. 
Кроме того, хорошо здесь использовать какие-то позитивные красивые символы — то, с чем мы бы хотели отождествляться. Потому что когда мы входим в квартиру, мы видим первый символ, с которым мы отождествляемся. И если мы входим и перед нами, например, находится картина ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"", то это посылает определенные импульсы, это то, чего следовало бы избегать. 
— Теперь предлагаю поговорить о гостиной. Это место, где отдыхает вся семья, собирается вечерами, общается, смотрит телевизор. Какие предметы будут благоприятно влиять на людей в гостиной? 
— Я бы сказала, что здесь нет какой-то одной общей рекомендации. Это зависит и от того, в какую сторону света смотрит гостиная, и какие люди там живут. Это очень индивидуально. Главное, чтобы это было комфортно для людей. 
Другие рекомендации, которые я могла бы дать, - это то, что здесь надо избегать обилия острых углов, которые были бы направлены на диванную группу, или нависающих полок. Мне встречались такие квартиры, где стоит диван и над ним висят тяжелые полки. Конечно, в таком месте особо сильно не расслабишься и не восстановишься, потому что то, что нависает, будет давить и бессознательно вызывать чувство угнетения. 
Еще часто в гостиной располагают перед диваном или креслами журнальный столик, на который можно поставить какие-то угощения или еще что-то. И стало очень модным использовать стеклянные столы. Это тоже не очень хорошо, потому что мы знаем, что стеклянная поверхность может разбиться. Поэтому всякий раз, когда мы ставим что-либо на этот стеклянный стол и слышим стеклянный звук, то у нас возникает легкий спазм в теле. И, таким образом, мы не расслабляемся, а продолжаем оставаться в напряжении. А ведь гостиная — это то место, где бы мы хотели отдохнуть. Поэтому я советую либо не использовать такие столы, либо если такой стол уже есть, то можно просто покрыть его непрозрачной скатертью или чем-то еще. 
— Довольно часто в магазинах можно встретить небольшие деревца, на которых висят монетки, и считается, что это принесет финансовое благополучие в дом. Некоторые люди считают необходимым в своей гостиной разместить такое дерево. Как оно в действительности будет влиять на жизнь владельцев квартиры? 
— Само по себе дерево — это сувенир с монетами. Использование этих сувениров дома и в офисах — это китайское наследие. И, на самом деле, его предназначение в том, чтобы напоминать своему хозяину о его цели, чтобы он активно действовал в направлении достижения своих финансовых задач. 
Мы можем расположить такое деревце с монетами рядом с пышным растением. И хорошо будет, если мы поставим рядом, например, декоративный фонтанчик или водопадик, потому что именно эти предметы будут активно создавать энергию. Растения за счет своего роста продуцируют янскую энергию, а фонтанчик создает ее за счет циркуляции воды, что также создает избыток кислорода в этом месте. 
И если мы поставим это дерево с монетами, то мы, таким образом, поставим в нашей квартире маркер, что для меня благосостояние — это важно и я хочу, чтобы энергия направилась в этом русле. И тогда, всякий раз видя эту композицию, у нас будет запускаться процесс мышления: ""А что же нужно сделать для того, чтобы это благосостояние пришло в мою жизнь?"" И оно будет напоминать нам и толкать нас в этом направлении, чтобы мы были более активными в достижении того, что нам нужно в жизни. 
— То есть цветы в доме — это хорошо не только с точки зрения насыщения кислородом, но и с точки зрения фэншуй? 
— Да, конечно. Тем более, есть даже специальные сектора в комнатах, которые полезны для того, чтобы там были растения, чтобы более активная энергия усиливалась. А такие растения, у которых есть цветущие бутоны, или срезанные цветы в определенных местах усиливают романтическую удачу. И это ценно для тех, кто хочет обрести счастливое партнерство. 
— Наверное, все мы хотим, чтобы дома был порядок, но за неимением большого количества свободного времени довольно часто порядок превращается в беспорядок. В результате мы имеем завалы вещей и на стульях, и на открытых полках. Как это влияет на жизнь человека? Это просто некрасиво визуально или это еще способно вызывать какие-то негативные события? 
— В каком-то смысле да. Наше внешнее пространство отражает, во-первых, наше внутреннее состояние, и мы это также потом проецируем в мир. То есть если бардак чрезмерный, то он создает и некое хаотичное мышление, и проецируется на наши события в жизни. Живем мы так же хаотично, без какого-то планирования, бесконтрольно. И тут уже все зависит от талантов человека, от того, как он может управляться с этим хаосом в своей жизни. 
Еще важно, чтобы предметы, которыми мы пользуемся, были более-менее в движении. То есть какие-то хаотичные завалы, конечно, не хороши, но если еще человек этим не пользуется, и оно просто лежит как груда, то это как тромб. А это значит, что где-то внутри в жизни есть какой-то тромб, потому что внешнее и внутреннее неразделимо, все связано. Поэтому важно, чтобы мы пользовались тем, что у нас есть. Если мы не пользуемся, то, возможно, это просто не нужно, это нужно куда-то переместить, продать, выбросить. 
— Давайте перейдем к спальне. Это место, где мы отдыхаем, где мы проводим много часов подряд, когда спим. Очень много споров идет о том, в какую сторону лучше спать головой. Есть какие-то рекомендации? 
— Да, конечно, они существуют, но, к сожалению, я не могу дать одного общего совета. Я часто слышу, что головой нужно спать только на север или только на восток. Это абсолютная неправда. Люди индивидуальны, и каждому человеку соответствует несколько благоприятных направлений и несколько неблагоприятных. Это можно прочувствовать интуитивно. 
Какая здесь возникает чаще всего проблема? Человек ставит кровать каким-то классическим, традиционным способом, но чувствует себя некомфортно, неуютно, не высыпается, ворочается или ему снятся плохие сны. Это признак того, что данное место, или направление, или и место, и направление не подходят этому человеку. Тогда нужно попытаться найти какое-то нешаблонное решение. Может быть, переставить кровать в другое место, или даже иногда эту кровать стоит поставить под углом, защитив тыльную часть кровати, чтобы она не смотрела в пустой угол. То есть нужно проявить креативность, послушать свою интуицию, чтобы найти это хорошее место. И тело обязательно сообщит об этом, вы легко почувствуете, что так спать гораздо лучше, комфортнее, вы лучше засыпаете, легче просыпаетесь, нужно будет меньше времени, чтобы выспаться и т.д. 
Не рекомендуют располагать в спальне зеркала. Если есть все-таки острая необходимость, то желательно повесить зеркала таким образом, чтобы человек, лежа на кровати, не видел своего отражения. На самом деле, это может немного пугать во сне, когда ты просыпаешься, встаешь и видишь свое отражение. И вообще, какие-то блики, силуэты, тени, лучи на зеркалах могут просто тревожить. Потом, зеркала создают объем, дополнительное измерение, и тоже во время сна это может беспокоить. 
— Коснемся наиболее важных сфер нашей жизни — это здоровье, карьера, финансовое благополучие и личные взаимоотношения. Дайте, пожалуйста, короткие рекомендации, что сделать, чтобы во всех сферах жизнь стала немножечко лучше. 
— Что касается здоровья, должно быть больше энергии в квартире или в доме. Для этого квартира должна хорошо проветриваться, не быть захламленной. 
Если говорить о романтической удаче, о партнерстве, то важно следить за тем, что если у нас есть сложности в этом, чтобы в квартире не было каких-то одиноких символов: изображений одинокой тоскующей дамы или, опять же, картины ""Иван Грозный убивает своего сына"". Таких изображений не должно быть. Напротив, нужно привнести в интерьер как можно больше партнерских символов, которые символизируют счастливые взаимоотношения: две свечи, две птицы, две кошечки. 
А что касается бизнеса, успеха, процветания, то полезно правильным образом расположить рабочий стол, за которым вы работаете. Расположение стола должно быть таким: за спиной должна быть стена, с левой стороны - какая-то защита, а перед нами - открытое пространство. Тогда у нас достаточно много фантазии, есть тыл за спиной, и мы гораздо лучше функционируем.

2759,UK Officially Declare Russia ‘Threat To National Security’,"Posted on November 1, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , UK // 0 Comments 
The director general of the MI5 intelligence agency in the UK has declared Russia a “threat to national security” in a grave warning on Monday. 
Speaking with the Guardian , Andrew Parker warned that Russia is currently using all of its cutting-edge tools in order to undermine Britain. 
Presstv.com reports: 
“It is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways – involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks. Russia is at work across Europe and in the UK today. It is MI5’s job to get in the way of that,” he told the UK’s prominent paper. RELATED CONTENT Ukraine President Warns Of World War 3 With Russia 
He said that Russia has already some intelligence officers in the UK and has been threatening the UK covertly for decades, but “what’s different these days is that there are more and more methods available.” 
Moscow is using cyberwarfare to target military secrets, industrial projects, economic information as well as the British government and foreign policy, he added. 
He went on to say that Moscow “defines itself by opposition to the west and seems to act accordingly.” 
Relations between Russia and the west soured after people in Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula of Crimea voted for rejoining the Russian Federation in a referendum in March 2014. 
The West branded the move as Moscow’s annexation of the territory, with the US and its allies in Europe accusing the country of having a hand in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
Russia’s relationship with the US and the UK has also become unfriendly over the crisis in Syria, where Moscow has been conducting an air campaign at the request of the Syrian government to fight Daesh terrorists there since September 30, 2015. 
US-led coalition has also been conducting airstrikes in Syria to purportedly target terrorist groups like Daesh since 2014, but they openly fund and equip militant groups who are waging war against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 
On October 20, British Prime Minister Theresa May called on European leaders to unite against Russia and stop what she referred to as Russian “atrocities” in Syria. 
“It is vital that we work together to continue to put pressure on Russia to stop these appalling atrocities, these sickening atrocities, in Syria,” the premier said. 
Russia’s military campaign has helped the Syrian government defeat the Takfiri terrorists in many regions across the country.",0
2760,Fed Raises Interest Rates for Third Time Since Financial Crisis - The New York Times,"The Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the second time in three months, this time to a range between 0. 75 percent and 1 percent, is finally moving toward the end of its    economic stimulus campaign, which began in the depths of the financial crisis. But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the decision was announced that the Fed did not share the optimism of stock market investors and some business executives that economic growth is gaining speed. It still plans to move slowly because the economy continues to grow slowly. She suggested that the Fed would have plenty of time to adjust its plans should President Trump and Congress cut taxes or spend massively on infrastructure. Her announcement was full of confidence. But it certainly was not ebullient. “The data have not notably strengthened,” Ms. Yellen told reporters. “We haven’t changed the outlook. We think we’re moving on the same course we’ve been on. ” The Fed said that the United States economy continued to chug along, expanding at a “moderate pace. ” Employers are hiring, consumers are spending and businesses  —   the laggards in recent months  —   are starting to plow a little more money into their operations, too. The Fed’s sobriety did not appear to make much of an impression on investors. The stock market’s heady march that began after Mr. Trump’s election continued apace. The Standard  Poor’s   index rose 0. 84 percent to close at 2, 385. 26 Wednesday, moving up sharply after the announcement. Some said the Fed was still a long way from doing anything that might hurt. “The first four to eight rate hikes are the   fruit,” said Deron McCoy, the chief investment officer at SEIA, a Los Angeles firm. “The real test will be whether the economy can withstand positive real rates. And that still seems to be a 2019 topic. ” Some analysts said the Fed will want to see an impact from its actions. “Policy makers hike rates to tighten financial conditions,” said Ellen Zentner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “If this easing of financial conditions on the back of today’s hike are sustained, that would tell policy makers they need to do more. ” Ms. Zentner said she expected the Fed to raise rates again at its June meeting. The Fed’s   committee next meets on May 2 and 3. She noted that the Fed’s   outlook is less clear. Ms. Yellen’s term as Fed chairwoman ends in February, and Mr. Trump could then replace her. The Fed, charged with maximizing employment and moderating inflation, is close to achieving both goals. The unemployment rate fell to 4. 7 percent in February, consistent with the normal churn of people moving among jobs. And after several years of concern that prices were not rising fast enough, inflation is reviving. The Fed’s preferred measure rose 1. 9 percent over the 12 months ending in January, close to its 2 percent annual target. “The basis for today’s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy,” Ms. Yellen said at the postmeeting news conference. “And it’s been doing nicely. ” The Fed, which had made more inflation a central objective, said on Wednesday that it was now focused on stabilizing inflation. Ms. Yellen took the opportunity to note that inflation may now rise a bit above 2 percent, just as it has been below 2 percent the last few years. “It’s a reminder 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation,” she said. “It’s a target. ” The Fed’s increased confidence was reflected in a new round of policy forecasts it also published Wednesday. An increased number of Fed officials are expecting to raise rates at least twice more this year. Only three of the 17 officials who submitted forecasts expect the central bank to move more slowly. There was a similar coalescing around tighter policy for the following two years, marking the first time in recent years that the Fed’s quarterly economic forecasts have shifted toward a prediction of tighter monetary policy. This is the third time the Fed has raised rates since the financial crisis. The first hike came at the end of 2015 and the second almost exactly one year later. This time the Fed waited just three months. The benchmark rate remains below 1 percent, a very low level. People with credit card debt are likely to see an immediate increase of about a quarter percentage point in their interest rates. The effect on   loans is less direct, but the average rate on a   mortgage rose by half a percentage point over the last year. The nation’s largest borrower, the federal government, will also feel the pinch of higher rates. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal interest payments, measured as a share of the economy, to double over the next decade. Savers are unlikely to benefit immediately. Banks tend to raise interest rates on loans more quickly than they raise rates on deposits. Last week, the average rate on a   certificate of deposit was 0. 14 percent. Last year at this time: 0. 13 percent. The Fed’s move to raise rates puts it on course for a   collision with President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to increase economic growth through policies including cuts in taxation and regulation and more spending on infrastructure and defense. Fed officials have emphasized that the economy is already growing at roughly its maximum sustainable pace faster growth would therefore lead to faster increases in interest rates. Some economists and liberal activists argue that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed’s   committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak. That suggests, he said, that the economy has not yet returned to full employment. “We should be seeing faster wage growth with this level of employment growth if we were close to full employment,” Mr. Kocherlakota said on Twitter before the Fed’s decision. Mr. Kocherlakota’s successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, cast the sole vote against raising rates on Wednesday. The Fed’s assessment of economic conditions remained quite measured. The economy expanded by just 1. 6 percent in 2016, and there is little sign of an acceleration during the first quarter. Fed officials continue to forecast a Goldilocks economy, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4. 5 percent and inflation around 2 percent for the next three years. Ms. Yellen played down surveys showing a sharp rise in the optimism of consumers and business executives since the presidential election, noting there is little evidence that such surveys predict spending decisions. She said that Fed officials spoke regularly to business leaders, and that many were undoubtedly in “a much more optimistic frame of mind. ” But she added that many of those executives have adopted a    attitude  —   just like the Fed itself.",0
2761,"Report: Facebook Contributes $120,000 to Funding CPAC - Breitbart","Facebook has reportedly contributed $120, 000 to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this week, according to a report by the Daily Beast. [“Facebook’s contribution is worth more than $120, 000, according to our sources,” the Daily Beast reported on Tuesday. “Half of that is cash, and the other half is   support for CPAC’s operations. Facebook will have a space at the conference for attendees to film Facebook Live videos, and will also train people on best practices for using the social network and Instagram. ”  Chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp, who hosts CPAC, praised Facebook’s involvement with the conference. “We are glad Facebook agreed to be at CPAC and to acknowledge the importance of conservatives to their company, and we continue to work with them on issues important to conservatives,” he declared. Facebook, meanwhile, defended their contribution, citing their involvement in a wide range of events “across the political spectrum. ” “Facebook participates in events hosted by organizations across the political spectrum. Our presence allows us to facilitate an open dialogue where people can share their views and create content to engage their audiences, just as we did during other political events such as the Republican and Democratic Party conventions,” explained a Facebook spokesman. “Our involvement is not an endorsement of any particular position or platform. ” During CPAC, Facebook will hold numerous workshops, while an event on how attendees can “better reach and connect with voters on Facebook” will also be held at the conference on Wednesday.

2762,Cartel Assassination of Journalist Silences Mexican News Outlet,"One of the main news outlets in the Mexican border state of Chihuahua has shut down its operations after the murder of one of its journalists, multiple threats, and the complete lack of security conditions. [On Sunday, Oscar Cantu Murgia, the director for El Norte De Cd. Juarez announced that after 27 years in print, the publication is going silent. The print and online news outlet is one of the publications that the late Miroslava Breach worked for.   As Breitbart Texas reported, Breach was one of three Mexican journalists gunned down last month. The   journalist had helped uncover the close relations between Mexican politicians and a faction of the Juarez Cartel called “La Linea”. At the scene of Breach’s murder, the gunmen left a banner signed by the leader of La Linea, Carlos Arturo “El 80” Quintana. The kingpin is listed as a wanted fugitive by the U. S. Department of Justice on multiple drug trafficking and money laundering charges tied to the Juarez Cartel. “This day, my dear reader I am informing you that I have taken the decision to close this news outlet due to the fact that among other things, there are no security conditions or guarantees for the exercise of a press that is critical and provides counterpoints,” Cantu Murgia wrote in his Sunday editorial.  The farewell piece criticized the local, state, and federal government of Mexico for its corrupt practices. Cantu Murgia stated that he did not want any more of his staff members to pay the stiff price asked of them.  As Breitbart Texas reported, even after Breach’s murder, attacks on journalists continue to be commonplace in Mexico. Just days after Breach’s murder, gunmen in the states of Veracruz and in Baja California attacked two other journalists. Both survived the attack, however, authorities have not been able to capture anyone tied to any of the attacks. Ildefonso Ortiz is an   journalist with Breitbart Texas.

2763,Trump Has Made His Supreme Court Nomination. What Happens Next? - The New York Times,"President Trump on Tuesday night named Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court. But there’s a long way to go before the new nominee is confirmed. Judge Gorsuch will immediately face a public and private gantlet of scrutiny, and could end up at the center of fevered political maneuvering. Just 51 votes are needed to confirm him, but one big question looms: Will the Senate Democrats  filibuster the nomination? That would require 60 votes to overcome. Expect the task to drag on for months: Elena Kagan was confirmed 87 days after she was nominated, in 2010 Sonia Sotomayor’s confirmation in 2009 took 66 days, and Samuel Alito Jr. was confirmed 82 days after his nod, in 2006. Events would have to unfold very smoothly for the nominee to be confirmed by April 26, the date of the last scheduled arguments in the current court term, which typically ends in late June. The next term begins in October. Here’s what to expect in the nomination process. The nominee must fill out an elaborate questionnaire, which the Senate will examine. He will be asked to list every client he has ever represented, sources of income, speaking fees, travel destinations, media interviews, writings  —   everything short of where he went to summer camp. The questionnaire often runs hundreds of pages long. The F. B. I. will immediately begin a background check, and the staff members of senators on the Judiciary Committee will start their own investigations. As others pore over documents, the nominee will be calling and meeting with as many senators as possible. The   meetings typically take 15 minutes to an hour, said Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University. The senators are typically looking to learn about how the nominee thinks and what makes the    tick, while the nominee is trying to learn what concerns the senators might have, Mr. Wermiel said. There will most likely be political jostling over how the confirmation hearing is conducted. Democrats and Republicans will haggle over issues such as when it will occur, how many rounds of questioning will unfold, how long the rounds will last and how many outside witnesses will be allowed. Republicans will likely try to minimize the length of the hearings, Mr. Wermiel said. The nominee will probably undergo mock questioning from advisers in what is known politely as a “murder board. ” It’s similar to the practice sessions presidential candidates go through with their staff before squaring off in a televised debate advisers try to anticipate the questions that senators will ask. “Ideally, their goal would be that a nominee goes in there facing no question that he had not already heard in one of those sessions,” Mr. Wermiel said. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. once called the hearings a “Kabuki dance. ” Justice Kagan called them a “vapid and hollow charade. ” Nonetheless, the televised hearings will be conducted by the 20 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is made up of 11 Republicans, including Ted Cruz, Orrin Hatch and Lindsey Graham and nine Democrats, including Dianne Feinstein, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. Its chairman is Chuck Grassley, a Republican. There’s an art to the questioning, since nominees must be careful not to take positions on issues that might come before the court. For example, if a nominee directly expressed a preference to overturn Roe v. Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion across the nation, the judge may have to be recused from a future case. So committee members typically ask more roundabout questions, hoping to read the tea leaves about how the nominee’s judicial philosophies would apply to   issues. “It’s this sort of odd dance in which the Senators are trying to elicit some sense of how the nominee thinks about important constitutional questions, but they can’t really ask the things that they want to ask,” Mr. Wermiel said. Recently, the hearings have lasted for three or four days. Expect the senators to question the nominee for a few days, plus an additional day for outside witnesses. At least a week after the hearings, the committee will vote on sending the nomination to the full Senate. A simple majority is needed, but there’s a twist: By tradition, Supreme Court nominations are sent to the Senate even if the nominee is rejected by the committee. Then it’ll be in the hands of all 100 senators, where Republicans hold a   advantage over Democrats (two independents caucus with the Democrats). Both Democrats and Republicans will have difficult decisions to make with vast political consequences. If the Democrats filibuster the nomination, Republicans would need 60 votes to end the filibuster, requiring some Democrats to join the Republicans. That is, unless Republicans use the   nuclear option, a rare maneuver to end the filibuster. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has not ruled out the possibility, but is considered to be a strong believer in the traditions of the Senate, including the right of the minority party to filibuster. In 2013, Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat and the majority leader at the time, used the tactic to push through the Obama administration’s judicial and executive nominees. Furious Republicans vowed that Democrats would regret it once control of the Senate flipped. Mr. McConnell was among those who condemned the tactic at the time. But he said in November that any Republican retaliation by using the nuclear option themselves could backfire. “I don’t think we should act as if we’re going to be in the majority forever,” he said.",0
2764,Previously Deported Criminal Alien Charged in Teenager’s Death,"EAST BATON ROUGE, Louisiana  —   A previously deported criminal alien from Mexico faces   murder charges and federal charges after allegedly shooting and killing a teenager.  Louisiana State Police arrested Octavio Bringas, 49   for allegedly shooting    Darius Plummer in the head  —   killing him on the day of his birthday, according to WBRZ. East Baton Rouge Sheriff Officer deputies originally found Plummer in the apartment where he had been shot. Court documents allege Bringas was the only other individual in the apartment at the time of the shooting. Bringas’ family told police they heard the gunshot. When they entered the apartment, they saw only Plummer. An ambulance transported Plummer, a student at Zachary High School, to the hospital, where he later died from his injuries. Witnesses who live in the apartment building said Plummer visited the apartment but did not actually live in the building. After the shooting, Bringas called one of the witnesses who had been communicating with the police, telling them that he had accidently discharged the gun and said he was already on his way to Lafayette, Louisiana, which was once a ‘sanctuary city’ in the state. Bringas was subsequently arrested while heading to Lafayette, with police saying they believe he was attempting to flee the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials confirmed to Breitbart Texas that Bringas is an illegal immigrant. ICE officials put an immigration detainer on the suspect, which is a request for Bringas to be handed over to them should he be released. Bringas has a long history with the law. ICE spokesman Thomas Byrd told Breitbart Texas that immigration officials previously previously encountered Bringas on March 5, 2012, after he was released from the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison. Bringas was removed by ICE on March 22, 2012. In August and September of 2003, Border Patrol agents deported Bringas after apprehending him illegally crossing the border.

2766,"As U.S. Soccer Weighs Jurgen Klinsmann’s Future, He Says, ‘I’m Not Afraid’ - The New York Times","Jurgen Klinsmann, whose status as coach of the United States men’s national team is under intense scrutiny, said Sunday night that he was “very comfortable” with his position and that he believed those calling for him to be fired were “being disrespectful” and “ignoring the facts” about his tenure as the team’s leader. Speaking in a telephone interview, Klinsmann  —   who had recently returned from Berlin, where he attended a state dinner last week with President Obama and Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany  —   said that he had exchanged text messages with Sunil Gulati, the president of U. S. Soccer, and that he expected to talk with Gulati in the coming days. That discussion will take place in the shadow of mounting criticism of Klinsmann’s performance and after the team’s two recent losses in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, including a humiliating   defeat to Costa Rica on Tuesday that has many fans calling on Gulati to fire Klinsmann. “I’m not afraid,” Klinsmann said. “What you need to do is stick to the facts. Soccer is emotional, and a lot of people make conclusions without knowing anything about the inside of the team or the sport. I still believe we will get the points we need to qualify, and I am even confident we could win the group. ” He added: “The fact is, we lost two games. There is a lot of talk from people who don’t understand soccer or the team. ” Klinsmann, who is known for his upbeat disposition, could be overly optimistic. In countries that expect to reach the World Cup tournament, as the United States does every four years, starting the final round of qualifying with two losses generally means the coach’s job is in jeopardy  —   and Klinsmann acknowledged that he understands that. If Gulati decides to replace Klinsmann, it could be announced as soon as this week, according to several soccer executives familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss a personnel decision. This could be an ideal time to make a switch: The United States does not play its next World Cup qualifier until March, allowing a new coach several months to get acclimated. Bruce Arena, who coached the national team from 1998 to 2006, is the top candidate to replace Klinsmann if Gulati decides to make a change. Klinsmann conceded that he understood the criticism  —   “I am not saying I have nothing to be blamed for,” he said  —   and in many other countries, he probably would have been fired after a disappointing flameout in the 2015 Gold Cup, the regional championship tournament the United States hosted, or after his team’s loss to Mexico in the Confederations Cup playoff later that year. That Gulati, who pursued Klinsmann for five years before hiring him in 2011, has stuck with him this long is indicative of how much Gulati has staked on Klinsmann, a former striker for Germany. Yet now, with calls for change from both inside and outside U. S. Soccer growing, the potential for a switch is significant. Many believe that Klinsmann’s constant tinkering with lineups and formations has kept the United States team from growing tactically, and some believe that the Americans’ collapse in the second half against Costa Rica last week was indicative of Klinsmann’s no longer being able to motivate his players. Klinsmann directly disputed that charge Sunday, saying he did not believe any players quit against Costa Rica, even as they gave up three goals after intermission. “There was nobody giving up at that time,” Klinsmann said. “That was a normal emotional situation when things go wrong. When they get the second goal there, it was like a knock in your neck. I played those games many, many times. The whole stadium goes bananas. It’s totally human to put your head down for a second. And then they counter us for two more. Those games will always happen. We just couldn’t stop it, but the players did not stop trying. ” Judging the national team’s arc in 2016 solely on those games, Klinsmann added, would be unfair. He said that this year had been “very, very successful” for the national team, citing the Americans’ run to the semifinals of the Copa América as well as the development of younger players like Bobby Wood and John Brooks. That Brooks, a defender, had two rough performances against Mexico and Costa Rica  —   particularly Costa Rica  —   is, as Klinsmann said, “part of the development process,” and one of the reasons he argued that making a coaching change would be a mistake. “We are coaching a team through a transitional phase,” Klinsmann said. “We still have to break in younger players. We still have to look for leadership for the team. There are still a lot of technical and chemistry challenges ahead that are normal in this time period. And you put the final pieces together as you go towards Russia, which I am absolutely sure we will do. ” From the very beginning of his relationship with Gulati, Klinsmann said, he has stressed that patience was crucial  —   a point he will probably try to make to Gulati when they speak about the team’s current situation. “I always made it clear to Sunil, if you really want to move up to the top 15 in the world, you need to have consistency in what you’re doing,” Klinsmann said. “If you react emotionally, you will become a roller coaster. ” Many would argue that Gulati and others at U. S. Soccer have given Klinsmann more than enough time. And although Klinsmann is confident, a poor result in the next qualifying game  —   at home against Honduras, with a trip to Panama scheduled days later  —   would make things even more tenuous. By that time, a coaching change on the fly would be especially difficult. That is why it is expected that a resolution of the coaching situation will be reached soon. Klinsmann will either receive a vote of confidence or be fired. Either way, it has been an emotional few days for the coach, who traveled to Germany from Costa Rica and said he spent “an amazing” two and a half hours with President Obama and other world leaders. Klinsmann presented President Obama with a German national team jersey with the No. 44 on the back, and gave Merkel a United States jersey with the No. 1 on it. Of course, even President Obama asked Klinsmann a question about the national team situation. “He said, ‘It didn’t go well down there in Costa Rica, did it? ’” Klinsmann recalled. “And I said, ‘Nope, Mr. President  —   it didn’t go well at all. ’”",0
2767,Steady U.S. Job Growth Sets Stage for Fed to Raise Interest Rates - The New York Times,"A wave of hiring in February  —   President Trump’s first full month in office  —   pointed to a strong foundation for the nation’s economy, providing further evidence for the Federal Reserve that the moment to raise interest rates has come. The Labor Department reported a gain of 235, 000 jobs and healthy wage growth in a month when even the weather cooperated. It was the last major data release before Fed policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday, when they have signaled their intent to increase the benchmark interest rate. “The economy is riding a wave of bullish sentiment postelection,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, a career website. “We’re seeing strong labor demand across the board and no sign of slowing right now. ” Republicans and Democrats quickly jostled for credit. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had “  job creation, not only through his executive action but because of the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. ” Mr. Trump, who, as a candidate, repeatedly dismissed the official jobs reports as “phony,” reposted a comment on Twitter from the conservative website Drudge Report that said, “GREAT AGAIN: +235, 000. ” Mr. Spicer later quoted Mr. Trump on his faith in the report, “They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now. ” The Labor Department repeated that it had not changed the way it collected and analyzed jobs data since Mr. Trump took office. “It’s business as usual,” said Megan Kindelan, director of public affairs at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Republican   clearly irked Democrats. Tom Perez, labor secretary in the Obama administration and now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, countered that Mr. Trump had “absolutely nothing” to do with the job gains. “Trump inherited an economy from Barack Obama with the longest streak of private sector job growth in history,” he said. Although the economic anxiety that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House remains, the official jobless rate is near what the Fed considers full employment  —   a threshold where, in theory at least, everyone who wants a job at the going rate can find one. The official jobless rate fell to 4. 7 percent, from 4. 8 percent in January, even as the overall labor force grew. At the same time, jobless claims are near a   low, and the stock market is surging. Revisions to previous estimates raised the   average of monthly job gains to 209, 000 and annual wage growth to 2. 8 percent, further bolstering the case for those who argue the economy is strong enough to withstand a rate increase. The overall economic momentum received a push from February’s unusually warm weather, with almost a quarter of the jobs  —   about 58, 000  —   coming from construction. Manufacturing and mining rose too. Also significant was the increase in the labor participation rate to 63 percent, a result of rising employment even among people without a high school diploma. “There’s got to be some optimism that these people are feeling they finally have a chance,” said Diane Swonk, founder and chief executive of DS economics in Chicago. On the other end are employers who are seeing acute labor shortages. “They’re offering training programs now,” Ms. Swonk said. “They’re complaining about it. But that’s what tight labor markets do. It forces you to invest more to work with less. ” Bigger paychecks are something that most Americans are particularly eager to see, after years of stagnant wage growth. The Fed, too, has been waiting for an increase, but it is also wary of wages rising too fast. Its members want to head off incipient inflation without putting the brakes on hiring, especially because the benefits of the    recovery have been so unevenly distributed. Balancing those two goals is tricky. Lauren Griffin, senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA, said the scarcity of qualified workers had compelled employers to raise wages, strengthen benefits and improve amenities at the office. “We’ve got people in orientation classes,” Ms. Griffin said, “and they get up and leave because they’re contacted about another job that might be more money. ” At the same time, a broader measure of unemployment  —   which includes the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or who are working part time but would prefer   jobs  —   dropped to 9. 2 percent last month but is still high given how tight the labor market looks otherwise. Cautioning the Fed against moving too quickly with a rate increase, Elise Gould, an economist at the   Economic Policy Institute, noted that, “Workers throughout the economy, including young workers, workers of color, and   workers, need a chance to make up lost ground on wage growth. ” Many Americans who live outside urban centers also have been excluded from most of the rewards of the recovery. Large metropolitan counties have had more than twice the annual wage growth of nonmetropolitan areas, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “  jobs might be following educated, young workers, who are increasingly living in dense, urban neighborhoods as other demographic groups move to the suburbs,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, a   site. “Broader economic shifts also favor big cities: The occupations projected to grow tend to be more urban, while shrinking sectors like manufacturing and farming tend to be located outside large metros. ” That is disappointing for people with longstanding ties to smaller, more rural communities. “A lot of this has to do with mobility,” said Steven W. Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, an insurance company. “People are going to have to move where the jobs are and not expect the jobs to come where they are. ” Although the Trump administration has had little time to make any substantial policy changes, the expectation of a reduction in taxes and regulations and the possibility of vast infrastructure spending have created optimism among employers and   workers. Mr. Trump has promised to expand the economy by 4 percent a year, create 25 million jobs in the next decade, revive manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit. Achieving all that would be difficult in the best of circumstances, let alone with the potential headwinds facing the White House. Dissension among Republicans and the unpredictability of Mr. Trump’s course in several policy areas could dampen job growth. The future of the Affordable Care Act and a possible replacement is making hospitals and community health centers cautious about adding workers. A strong dollar and a potential backlash against the White House’s travel ban could slow tourism and hiring in the sector. And Mr. Trump’s    hiring freeze on federal government jobs, combined with declines at the state level, will probably reduce the total number of public sector employees. The uncertainty extends to prospects for tax cuts. Some Wall Street analysts, expecting delays, have pared their growth forecasts for 2017, after recently raising them. Certainly the snapshot of February’s labor market is good. The question is, if the economy does slow, whether Mr. Trump will accept the legitimacy of weak reports as enthusiastically as he does good ones. Mr. Spicer suggested the president would. “Numbers are going to go up and down,” he said. “We recognize that. ”",0
2768,Traveling With Adult Children - The New York Times,"There is nothing like traveling with your adult children to make you feel dazzled and impressed that they are truly all grown up, competent citizens of the world. And there is nothing like traveling with your adult children to remind you that they are still your children and sometimes you need to take care of them. My husband and I were pleased and flattered and maybe a little anxious that our three grown children all wanted to go on a vacation with us this winter. With the youngest now in college, and the oldest at the extreme end of that endless medical training, we were talking about five adults taking a trip together. This is not something that I remember even contemplating with my own parents, and sure enough, it turns out that there may be a trend here   and even   children may be statistically more likely to vacation with their parents nowadays. Maybe they wanted to come because we were heading to Taipei on the way to a teaching assignment. Foreign travel certainly has a special allure, and extra potential for mishaps, but you could also play out all the same family dynamics close to home. The long flight to Taiwan landed late at night, and I had worried we were too many to fit into a taxi, so my daughter had booked a van to pick us up she had pasted in the obscure street address of our Airbnb apartment, so the driver knew exactly where we were going, and I was the only one who found any of this surprising. My sons had spent time in Taipei the previous summer, and wanted to take us for the best beef noodle soup, or the best sea urchin bowl. So there were lots of moments when my husband and I found ourselves enjoying the unaccustomed pleasure of being led around by kids who had planned an itinerary, scoped out restaurants on Yelp, and plotted the walking and subway routes carefully on their phones. We two technologically befuddled parents followed along, playing our part by marveling at the confidence of our guides, exchanging genuinely surprised and almost giggly glances. We had put in years schlepping folding strollers and disposable diapers onto airplanes, planning trips to include special train rides, building in ice cream stops. Now we were delighted to do as we were told, proud to have raised         offspring. The food was phenomenal, including the almond milk and mango ices (someone was still building in the ice cream stops) the Taipei subway was a dream, and somebody always seemed to know where we were going. We found a supercheap flight to Bangkok and flew there for a few days. My husband and I, who had visited in 2014, got to lead the troop onto the ferry along the Chao Phraya River to take everyone to the Temple of Dawn and the Royal Palace. None of the children had been there before, unless you count the trip my older son made with us decades ago as a   toddler (in a folding stroller) we recreated some of those same photo ops with him, now as a bearded man. Back in Taiwan, there was the moment when we climbed out of the taxi after the long ride to the picturesque seaside town of Jiufen, which is supposed to be the setting of the anime film “Spirited Away. ” It was a holiday afternoon, and the road winding up into the mountains had been slow going. But here we were at last, ready to walk the picturesque old street and eat the famous glutinous rice cake, or the taro ice cream rolled in chopped peanuts. That was the moment at which my younger son realized he had left his cellphone in the cab, and all five of us ran wildly through the streets, peering into the window of one taxi after another, searching for the kindly driver who had brought us all that way. We tried calling the phone, but the ringer was turned off (only clueless parents actually use phones as phones). Finally my daughter decided that we were slowing down the search, and sent us to go explore the town and market with her older brother to keep an eye on us. So there we were, admiring the vista of mountains and sea, and exchanging parental glances what could be more familiar than a child who didn’t keep a close eye on his valuables? We shook our heads and felt like the parents again, as we tried to strategize the next steps toward canceling and replacing the phone, and promised each other that we wouldn’t draw any   morals when the kids got back. Meanwhile, they efficiently located the cabdriver and effected a handoff as he drove back down the twisting mountain roads (did I mention that the son in question speaks Mandarin? ). So sometimes adult children really can show themselves to be adults, and sometimes you even feel like they’re taking care of you. My daughter, who has more than her family share of organizational ability, arranged pickups and   in Bangkok as well. And then, on our last night there, she went down to the hotel lobby to print out all the boarding passes for our flight the next morning, and the hotel printer didn’t work, and the desk clerk advised her to go print at the much more luxurious hotel next door. And as she says herself, she lost it. We were too far from home and things weren’t going according to plan she had efficiently checked us all in and forwarded all the boarding passes and she was suddenly convinced that we would not be allowed on the flight or be forced to wait on long lines and then check our bags (against the family religion). Her father sent her up to her room, apologized to the desk clerk, who had borne the brunt of her distress, and, because he knew she would not otherwise be consoled, set off into the night to find a place to print the boarding passes. And thanks to the deity who occasionally watches over technologically inept parents, and makes them look as if they can keep the world on track, he followed the clerk’s suggestion and succeeded with the printer at the next hotel over.",0

2770,"Man Confesses to Killing 2 Nuns in Rural Mississippi, the Police Say - The New York Times","A man suspected of stabbing two nuns to death in their rural Mississippi home confessed to the killings on Saturday, according to the police. Rodney Earl Sanders, 46, was arrested on Friday and charged with two counts of capital murder in connection with the deaths of Sister Margaret M. Held and Sister Paula J. Merrill, 68, whose bodies were discovered on Thursday at their shared home in Durant, a town of 3, 000 people that had gone years without a murder. “Sanders was developed as a person of interest early on in the investigation,” Lt. Colonel Jimmy Jordan, the director of the state’s Bureau of Investigation, said in a statement. Mr. Sanders has a history with the police. In 1986 he served six years in prison for an armed robbery in Mississippi, and last year he was convicted of a felony D. U. I. He had been on probation since September, Grace Simmons Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said. An officer went the women’s home around 10 a. m. on Thursday for a wellness check after they did not report for work at the Lexington Medical Clinic, near Durant. The door to the   home was open, and the officer found the bodies inside. The authorities said they believed Mr. Sanders stole the victims’ car, a blue Toyota Corolla, before abandoning it about a mile away in Holmes County, which is about 65 miles north of Jackson, the state capital. Mr. Sanders, from Kosciusko, Miss. lived about 30 miles from where the killings occurred. Sister Paula was from the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, based in Kentucky. Sister Margaret was from the School Sisters of St. Francis, in Milwaukee, which said it thanked local and state law enforcement but had many unanswered questions. “There is still much we do not know about the suspect and the circumstances that led to this brutal and senseless crime,” the order said in a statement. Willie March, the Holmes County sheriff, said late Saturday night that Mr. Sanders had confessed after an extensive interrogation “We don’t have a motive yet,” Sheriff March said.",0
2771,"With Operation in Syria, Erdogan Shows His New Power Over Turkey’s Military - The New York Times","KARKAMIS, Turkey  —   In recent years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered plans drawn up for a Turkish military incursion into Syria. At every turn, though, military commanders, already fighting a war inside Turkey against Kurdish militants, pushed back. And then last month a rebel faction of the military tried to stage a coup, and that changed everything. In the aftermath of the coup, which failed but claimed more than 200 lives, Mr. Erdogan purged thousands of officers from the ranks, leaving the military seemingly depleted. It also provoked worry from Western allies, including the United States, that Turkey would either be unwilling or unable to be a reliable partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Instead, the opposite happened on Wednesday, as Mr. Erdogan ordered Turkish tanks and special forces soldiers into Syria, under cover of American and Turkish warplanes, to assist Syrian rebels in seizing the city of Jarabulus, one of the last border strongholds of the Islamic State. More Turkish tanks rumbled into northern Syria on Thursday to support rebels there, and the Turkish military seemed to be succeeding in clearing the border area of Islamic State militants, and preventing Kurdish militias from seizing more territory in the region  —   a primary goal of Turkey in the campaign. The operation, coming so soon after the failed coup, has highlighted how Mr. Erdogan, even after the purge, secured more operational control of the military. It allowed him to undertake Turkey’s most ambitious role yet in the long Syrian civil war and to bolster the flagging fortunes of rebel groups, of which Turkey has been one of the most consistent supporters. Other factors holding back Turkey’s ambitions in Syria were also recently resolved. A feud with Russia, which began last year after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane near the border, ended after Mr. Erdogan expressed regret for the episode. After Ankara’s relations with Moscow deteriorated, a Turkish incursion into Syria could have risked war with Russia, which has been bombing rebels in support of the Syrian government. And the United States, which had previously been opposed to Turkey’s intervention, agreed to support it. The operation also buoyed the hopes of armed opposition groups that are not affiliated with the Islamic State or Al Qaeda, whose fighters and supporters have been dejected for months over losses in northern Syria that their foreign backers did little to prevent, and a fear that the United States and Turkey were preparing to abandon them to pursue of a broader deal with the Russians. A senior Turkish official, who spoke anonymously as a matter of protocol, said that many commanders had resisted an operation in Syria in recent years. Many analysts who closely follow the Turkish military have said the same thing. One of the most prominent commanders opposed to a Syria operation, the official said, was the former head of the Turkish special forces, Brig. Gen. Semih Terzi, who was one of the most prominent plotters and was killed during the coup attempt. The incursion seemed to support the opinion of many experts that the Turkish military’s combat capabilities had not been substantially diminished. “This is the second largest military in NATO,” said Ross Wilson, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington and ambassador to Turkey from 2005 to 2008. “Yes, it’s been somewhat reduced in the last month, but it is still a very potent and   fighting force. They are very capable in their own region. ” On Thursday, an estimated 350 Turkish soldiers were in Syria taking part in the operation, called Euphrates Shield, including 150 members of the special forces, the local media reported. Two Syrian rebels interviewed in Karkamis, which lies just across the border from Jarabulus, said that Turkish soldiers were mainly helping to defuse and dismantle the numerous bombs and   that the Islamic State, which fled the city without much of a fight, had left behind. Witnesses reported loud explosions, followed by plumes of smoke, coming from Jarabulus on Thursday afternoon. The question now, with the Turkish troops inside Syria, is how long they will remain there. Turkish officials have not given a timetable, but have indicated that the army would stay as long as it takes to neutralize security threats to Turkey  —   defined as the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and Syrian Kurdish militias. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who arrived in Ankara, the capital, on Wednesday just as the operation began, seemed to suggest on Thursday that the Turkish military would stay in northern Syria indefinitely, and with the blessing of the United States. “I think the Turks are prepared to stay in an effort to take out ISIL as long as takes,” Mr. Biden said during a visit to Sweden, according to Reuters. He added that the Turks have gradually come to “the realization that ISIL is an existential threat to Turkey. ” Some analysts said that Turkish forces, wary of being perceived as occupiers, would likely clear a swath of territory west of the Euphrates River, perhaps several miles inside Syria, and then eventually turn    operations in that area over to Syrian rebels backed by Turkish special operations troops and trusted local Turkmen militia forces. “While Turkey could hold whatever area they clear, I don’t think that’s the plan rather the point is to deny the area to the Kurds, and allow the other rebel groups more to Turkey’s liking to hold it,” said Patrick M. Skinner, director of special projects for the Soufan Group, a political risk assessment firm in New York. Hassan Ahmed, a Syrian rebel who works with fighting groups, but mainly concerns himself with the political side of the Syrian opposition, predicted that Turkey would remain in Jarabulus for about two weeks. Metin Gurcan, an expert on the military and a columnist at   an online news outlet, said that, depending on whether Syrian Kurdish militias try to challenge the Turks, the Turkish Army would most likely end its operation within two or three weeks. Still, thwarting the Islamic State was not the only objective of the Turks, nor even its primary one. Turkish officials have made little secret that the main purpose of the operation was to ensure that Kurdish militias did not consolidate control over an area west of the Euphrates that they had seized during a United   campaign against the Islamic State in the city of Manbij, south of Jarabulus. That message was strongly seconded by Mr. Biden on Wednesday. He said the Kurds had to return to east of the Euphrates or risk losing American support. Militias affiliated with the Democratic Union Party, the main Syrian Kurdish party, have been crucial allies of the United States in the fight against ISIS in Syria. But Turkey considers the group’s expansion along its border a threat to its national security because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. Syrian Kurdish forces said in a statement on Thursday that their fighters had returned to their bases after capturing Manbij from the Islamic State, without specifying locations. A press officer for the United   coalition fighting Islamic State militants said the Kurds had retreated east of the Euphrates to prepare for the eventual liberation of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the Islamic State in Syria. But in the evening, the Turkish military shelled a group of Syrian Kurdish fighters near Manbij after they had made an advance west of the Euphrates, in a breach of the Kurds’ agreement with the United States. Suleiman Kankilic, a Turkish paramedic and ambulance driver, said that before the Islamic State took control of Jarabulus, merchants enjoyed a robust business selling things like wheat, milk, cooking gas and soft drinks to the city, which was then under the control of the moderate Free Syrian Army. “We really want this war to end,” he said in a small clinic about a   from the border on Wednesday. “Turkey getting involved is good for us because we feel safer with our soldiers on the other side. ”",0
2772,Drop in the bucket: Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:37 UTC © AFP The Pentagon loves to throw good money after bad ‒ to the tune of nearly $60 billion on failed big-ticket weapons systems over the last two decades, according to a new internal Department of Defense review. From the Army's Future Combat Systems (FCS) that focused on fighting the last war to its RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground, between 1997 and October 2016, the Pentagon invested $58 billion on weapons technology it never received. That doesn't include the boondoggle that is the F-35 jet , which was finally declared ""ready for combat"" at the beginning of August. The FCS ($20 billion) and the Comanche ($9.8 billion) are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished, and together the two Army projects made up more than 50 percent of the ""sunk costs"" outlined in the Pentagon's annual internal acquisitions performance review. The 224-page report by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall was published earlier this week. The report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program, how far along in the process they were before they were killed, and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs. For example, although the FCS was canceled, parts of it ‒ including many of the manned ground vehicles and the Intelligent Munitions System ‒ were swept up into a current program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program. Most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets, but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the Pentagon canceled them, the report found. The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, conducted an audit of Pentagon spending in 2011 and found $70 billion in waste, the New York Times reported at the time . Much of the overspending happened because the DOD started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested, the auditors said. With acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the Pentagon's budget, in March the Air Force enlisted IBM's Jeopardy! -winning cognitive computer , Watson. Two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable Watson to navigate the 1,897-page Federal Acquisition Regulation, helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts. The project is expected to become operational by 2018. Another way the Pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program, called 'Better Buying Power 3.0', which was announced in April 2015 . The program was designed to have ""a stronger emphasis on innovation, technical excellence, and the quality of our products,"" Kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program's implementation. It calls on the military-industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding, schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products. It will also reward contractors for successful expense management, and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy. Of course, holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that don't work is easier said than done. And it doesn't help when someone at the Pentagon thinks it's a good idea to spend money on bomb-sniffing elephants .",0

2774,Edward Enninful as British Vogue Editor: A Barrier-Breaking Choice - The New York Times,"He had been rumored to be a contender from the beginning, but most people didn’t believe it would ever happen. Not because Edward Enninful, the renowned   friend of Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, isn’t supremely talented, but because he is a black man, born in Ghana, raised in London and working in New York. To give Mr. Enninful the reins of one of the most storied woman’s fashion magazines would be to make a statement about diversity and gender that would resonate far beyond hemlines, upending decades of tradition and assumptions about men’s and women’s roles and reaffirming the importance of a global viewpoint for the fashion industry at a time when barriers are going up around the world. But on Monday, Jonathan Newhouse, the chief executive of Condé Nast International, did just that, naming Mr. Enninful the first male editor of British Vogue since its founding in 1916, and the first black editor of any edition of Vogue. Though Mr. Newhouse, contacted by email, was reluctant to engage in discussion of   other magazine insiders  —   and many on social media  —   were not. Twitter lit up with the news, and “British Vogue” became a trending topic. Anna Wintour, artistic director of Condé Nast and editor of American Vogue, where Mr. Enninful is a former contributor, said: “It is a brilliant choice, and I am thrilled for him. Edward will undoubtedly shake things up in a way that will be so exciting to watch. ” Stefano Tonchi, the editor of W (and one of the few men atop a women’s fashion magazine) who hired Mr. Enninful as creative and fashion director in 2011, said, “It’s a really historic moment. ” Of the 22 global editions of Vogue, three others are edited by men: Kullawit Laosuksri at Vogue Thailand, Kwang Ho Shin at Korean Vogue and Emanuele Farneti at Italian Vogue. The two editors of Italian and British Vogue, which along with American Vogue are arguably the most influential of the Vogues, were appointed this year. Mr. Enninful and Mr. Farneti were picked to replace two of the     female editors of any Vogue: Franca Sozzani at Italian Vogue and Alexandra Shulman at British Vogue. In email, Mr. Newhouse offered only the   “we try to appoint the best person for the job. ” Yet given that up to now conventional wisdom had it that the best person to run a women’s fashion magazine of the stature of British Vogue was, well, a woman  —   someone who could wear the clothes, model the clothes and understand what her readers want from their clothes, both in terms of everyday functionality and personal identity  —   it is not an insignificant line. As gender boundaries blur and the old distinctions between men’s wear and woman’s wear (not to mention men’s and women’s pronouns) disappear, perhaps, too, should the old assumptions about men’s and women’s magazines. Increasingly, fashion brands, including Burberry, Calvin Klein and Gucci, are beginning to combine their men’s and women’s shows in recognition of this new reality. Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, has explained it this way: Both collections are part of the same story and reflect the same point of view, so why should they be separate? Louis Vuitton used Jaden Smith to model its women’s collection last year, and Chanel has signed Pharrell Williams for its new handbag campaign. Men and women increasingly occupy the same space in real life fashion is simply representing that truth. And now, too, are fashion publications. “Fashion is always among the first industries to recognize a new reality,” Mr. Tonchi said. “Maybe it’s an old notion that there are magazines for women and magazines for men, and it is time to just have magazines for people interested in fashion and creativity, whatever their gender. “It is true: I don’t look at women’s collections and think, ‘Oh, I want to wear that,’ or ‘Will it fit me?’ But I do think about the concept behind the clothes and the culture of the clothes. ” As ceiling smashing as Mr. Enninful’s gender is, however, so is his race. Fashion is a notoriously undiverse industry for one that is supposed to cater to a diverse clientele, and though the industry goes through regular paroxysms of mea culpas, most often in terms of the absence of minority models on the runways, the power structure itself rarely seems to change. Nearly all of the design heads of major brands are white, as are the chief executives, so the fact that a black man will be in such a visible position is an important step  —   especially as Britain prepares to withdraw from the European Union and prejudice and cultural isolationism become more prevalent. Mr. Enninful’s background and experience of the world are bound to inform the sensibility of the magazine he will make. As Ms. Wintour said: “He’s fearless. At a time when values are being challenged, Edward always stands up for what he believes in. You can see that clearly in the recent ‘I Am an Immigrant’ and ‘I Am a Woman’ videos he made for W. Each was so perfectly timed and hit the mark. ” Mr. Enninful himself is aware of what his new role means, on many levels. “I believe we live in a world of possibility, and my appointment is a testament to this,” he wrote in an email. “The world is   as are traditional roles of male and female. The outpouring of support from people of all backgrounds has been humbling. ”",0

Leaving behind the airy social realm of Libra, we now plunge into the dark watery realms of the Unconscious. As we worked to balance our inner and outer lives in Libra, now we come to the point where we have to let go of what no longer serves us. This requires that we turn within and look at those emotions which keep us imprisoned in our pasts. As we face our inner darkness, the world outside is also growing dark. The Sun moves lower into the southern hemisphere, bringing them the warmth of Spring and coming Summer, while leaving us in the North with fading light, shorter days and colder weather. Nature is letting go of its life as the year dies. Samhain Ritual 2012 License DMCA Samhain Ritual/Sekhmet Just after this intense New Moon we'll be celebrating Samhain, the last Gate of the Wheel of the Year. At Samhain, the old year dies so the new year can be born. The veils between the world are very thin, and the spirits of the dead are very close to us. We celebrate Samhain, Halloween, All Hallow's Eve, the Day of the Dead, All Saints Day and All Souls Day to honor our ancestors at this transitional time. - Advertisement - The great goddess who embodies the energies of Samhain is Hecate, most ancient Goddess of the Triple Crossroads, Queen of the Witches and Guide and Protector on the road to the Underworld. She stands at the Crossroads with her two torches and her black dog at her side. She can see the past, the present and the future and while we each have to choose our path, she lends us one of her torches and sends her faithful companion to guide our steps into the mystery of our future selves. For more about Hecate: http://ladywisdomchronicles.blogspot.com/ Scorpio New Moon Scorpio is often considered the most powerful sign in the Zodiac, and those who incarnate as Scorpios, some of the most powerful souls. For Scorpio's initiation is pivotal to our soul's growth, which is to die to be reborn again. For anyone living under patriarchy, where we have been disconnected from our feminine, soulful consciousness, death is the ultimate test to our unconscious Ego. We have been taught to fear death as a punishment or an end, rather than as a transition, a change that will give us back eternal life. And so FEAR is the Gatekeeper we have to face as we sink into the dark, murky emotions from past lives which keep us stuck in old patterns of disconnection, betrayal, horror and hurt. It's interesting that the American elections are always held during the Sun's transit through Scorpio, signaling a transition of power, a transformation of our collective lives. Indeed, that's also what Scorpio is about. Power. The ruling planets of Scorpio are Mars and Pluto. Pluto, or Hades, is the Lord of the Underworld, ruling the unconscious depths within us. These depths can lie quiet when we live by ourselves, but they get stirred up when we relate to others. And that's why Scorpio also rules intimacy, the emotional sharing that's necessary for a deep, rich life. And Mars the Warrior is what is needed to give us the courage to face those emotions. Scorpio is concentrated emotional power which propels the energy of evolution, and so it is the repository of unconscious instinctual drives, old emotional patterns and attachments and the compulsive tendencies that we bring with us personally and collectively from other lifetimes as well as from our early childhood. These old emotional wounds keep us stuck in fear and suspicion. Jung called them the Shadow. They are the parts of us that we can't see about ourselves and which we tend to project onto others instead of taking responsibility for ourselves. The Shadow is alive and well in our culture at the moment. Perhaps the very obvious examples we see in the news will help us deal with our personal Shadows. - Advertisement - When we operate out of these unconscious patterns, we tend to use emotional manipulation, defensiveness and vindictiveness to get our way. This is the lowest form of Scorpionic energy, the unconscious energy of survival at all costs. The Snake often symbolizes this aspect of Scorpio, although its transformation is possible with the shedding of its skin--or our unconscious Ego drives. In many ways, snake is best seen as our instinctual wisdom so perhaps the better symbol is the Scorpion, which will sting itself in its frenzy to sting the other. We've seen this kind of lower Scorpio energy in some of Donald Trump's attacks on women and minorities instead of admitting his own mistakes. Eagle License DMCA Scorpio has three symbols because it concerns the process of transformation, and three is the number of process. The unconscious residue from other lifetimes which eats away at us is symbolized by the scorpion. Once we begin to recognize our Shadow and can name it, the symbol shifts to an Eagle. And Eagle is the highest flying bird, able to see far and wide. Like Great Spirit, it gives us an overview of our lives. Eagle Scorpios can look at and name their Shadows, but they can also repress those shadowy instincts and certainly not talk about them! They use their will power to keep those negative instincts in line. But that's just a step to the third part of the process: the death of old habits and complexes. The re-integration of those repressed emotions and instincts then give rise to a new birth, which is symbolized by the phoenix, who burns up old karma and arises out of the ashes with a new, spiritual vision. This is the initiation of Scorpio. To go through all the tests that life brings us and learn from our mistakes and find the meaning of what it is we are sent here to learn.",0
2776,Fascism Over Farmers? The Troubling Priorities of the American Government | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: USA in the World US Foods Holding Corporation and Sysco, the two top American food distribution giants, are laying off thousands of workers. Wal-Mart is closing stores and terminating employees. As the price of eggs, beef, cheese, and almost all agricultural products have dropped, farmers across the United States are facing financial ruin. The ongoing glut in agricultural products is not merely the natural cycle of the market at work. Policies of the US federal government are directly linked to the low food prices. While it is clear that the ongoing agricultural surplus is very bad for the US public, the government seems to have other priorities. Broken Promises From Politicians The agricultural prowess of the United States is known across the planet. The current president of China first visited the United States in 1985. He didn’t come to see the Statue of Liberty, or the Washington Monument. Rather, Xi Jinping visited Iowa in order to study the technology and farming techniques employed by some of the most advanced and efficient farmers in the world . Love for the small farmers is voiced by almost all sectors of US political establishment, and almost always has been. The writings of Thomas Jefferson spoke at length about the “yeoman” and his role in an ideal republic. The left-wing folk singer Pete Seeger sang about how “the farmer is man who feeds them all .” Right-wing Radio host Paul Harvey plucked the heart strings of the American public with his “So God Made a Farmer” speech in 1978 . Each election year, American politicians devote special attention to the Iowa caucuses, the first vote in determining who will be the major parties’ respective nominees. As they travel across the Midwestern agricultural state, the presidential hopefuls routinely make all kinds of speeches championing “the hard working farmers.” While politicians are known to make promises to the farmers, and seem to recognize that agriculture is essential to the US economy, the policies of recent years, most of them having bipartisan support, have been anything but beneficial to those who work the land. In the current presidential race, Iowa is hotly contested, with Trump and Clinton very close in the polls. The farm glut, spawned by federal policies, is undoubtedly a big factor . In the first 8 months of 2016, 43 million gallons of milk were poured out due to the glut. According to the Wall Street Journal: “Farmers across the US are pouring out tens of millions of gallons of milk amid massive over glut that has reduced prices and filled warehouses with cheese .” Meanwhile, another WSJ article reports: “Cattle and hog prices hover near the lowest levels in years as U.S. meatpackers produce the largest volume of meat in history .” Between July of 2016 and July of 2017, the price of milk has decreased by 11%. The price of eggs has decreased by 40% . The overproduction and under-consumption of agricultural products can be directly linked to federal policies. Throughout his administration, Barack Obama has repeatedly cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and reduced the amount of food that low income families are able to purchase. The cutting of this federal program directly takes food from the mouths of low-income Americans. Despite the fact that according to the US Department of Agriculture, 13% of American households are now food insecure, the cuts have continued, and hunger is rising among America’s poor . ( l ) In addition to the obvious impact on low-income Americans, the cuts in food stamps have also cut into food sales. Food producing corporations and small farmers have seen a decrease in their sales. Wal-Mart has laid off thousands of workers and closed thousands of stores. These losses and layoffs can be linked directly to the SNAP cuts . Congress has recently discussed a plan that would eventually take $150 billion out of the federal food assistance program, a move that would undoubtedly push a lot of food producers, retail employees, and meat packers over the edge, along with many others . The reductions in food assistance are not the only factor. The economic sanctions against Russia have played a dramatic role in creating the current food glut. The collapse and breaking up of the Soviet Union’s collective farm system during the Yeltsin era of the 1990s dramatically reduced Russia’s domestic food production. This opened up new markets for American farmers, who greatly increased their exports to the former USSR. However, the new sanctions imposed in 2014, which restrict US and EU agricultural sales to Russia, have dramatically changed the landscape of the global food market. American farmers have been deprived of 143.5 million potential customers due to the ban on selling to those living in the Russian Federation. Austerity & Fascism Leave Farmers Behind Why is food assistance to low income families being cut? The claim is that the US federal budget is too large, and that hard economic times mandate austerity. However, the United States still has the largest military budget on the planet. When it comes time to reduce spending, rather than cutting the amount of money spent on tanks, bombs, and drones, the politicians have opted to cut into the nutrition of low-income Americans, along with the livelihoods of farmers and agricultural workers. The thousands of military bases around the world, along with the billions given in foreign military aid to countries like Israel, all seem be far more important to US leaders. And why has the US drastically restricted the exporting agricultural products to Russia? The sanctions were enacted in 2014, in response to the Ukraine crisis. The elected President of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovich, was toppled in orgy of street violence. The new government, with a base of support only in the western regions of the country, has within its ranks many open admirers of Adolf Hitler, and is very hostile to Russia. Since 2014, the people of Eastern Ukraine have taken up arms to resist the new regime. The people in the region of Crimea voted to become apart of the Russian Federation, whose military they had been hosting since the collapse of the USSR. Sanctions were imposed on Russia and continue, based on allegations that Russia is supporting the resistance of people in the Eastern regions against the new, pro-Western regime. US leaders tell us the sanctions are intended to punish Russia for “meddling” in Ukraine. Since the passing of the sanctions, Russia has revived its own domestic agricultural programs. Small farmers across Russia are producing beef, wheat, and other products no longer sold to them by the US and the EU. Russian agriculture has experienced a boom since 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is even more popular than prior to the crisis . The decision of US leaders to wage economic warfare against Russia in support of Ukrainian fascists, while at the same time cutting assistance to low-income American families, is contrary to values often displayed throughout American history. Both Lincoln and Roosevelt saw prosperity for the agricultural heartland of the United States and the millions who lived in it as vitally important for the entire country. These two most beloved Presidents in US history both worked closely in alliance with small farmers, often in opposition to Wall Street bankers with different interests. The rallying cry of the Republican Party in its early years, was “Free Land, Free Labor, Free Men!” The “Free Soilers,” farmers who wanted to halt the expansion of slavery in new US territories were an essential part of it. While slavery found support in the financial districts of London and New York, the small farmers had a material interest in ending the barbaric practice, and anti-slavery militias appeared in Iowa and Kansas years before the Civil War broke out. It was a broad coalition of small farmers, religious abolitionists, and organized labor that eventually put Abraham Lincoln into the White House where he was forced to battle the slaveholders. The process that unfolded recreated the country, in what is widely called “The Second American Revolution.” “An American Government Cannot Allow Americans To Starve” The programs that preceded the currently existing Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) were the brainchild of Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace, who eventually became the Vice President. When the first “food stamps” were issued in 1939, the director of the program, Milo Perkins described it this way: “We got a picture of a gorge, with farm surpluses on one cliff and under-nourished city folks with outstretched hands on the other. We set out to find a practical way to build a bridge across that chasm .” While Roosevelt was universally hated by Wall Street bankers, he was very popular with organized labor, artists and musicians, as well as small farmers. As the unemployment councils and labor unions fought for a better life across the country, Roosevelt aligned himself with the mass movement in the streets. Essential in Roosevelt’s progressive coalition was the US Communist Party, an organization that sought to build a “Workers and Farmer’s Government.” When big business objected to Roosevelt’s dramatic economic reforms, he defended them by saying “An American government cannot allow Americans to Starve .” Roosevelt later aligned with the Russian people in order to defeat Adolf Hitler. FDR’s opposition to fascism and his policies of feeding of hungry Americans while subsidizing farmers were not isolated from each other. They corresponded with his overall view of the world, expressed in 1944: “We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth- is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill housed, and insecure….We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence….People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .” In 2016, things are very different. While banks were bailed out without hesitation during the 2008 financial crisis, financial assistance to low income Americans continues to be cut. Wall Street and London see the Eurasian Bloc of Russia and China as a rising competitor to their financial hegemony. The wealthy financial elite largely support sanctions and further isolation of both countries despite whatever disastrous impact on American farmers, agricultural workers, and food distributors. Children across the United States are hungry, as 13% of households are food insecure, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Farm workers and those who work for food distributors and supermarkets are losing their jobs. Gallons of milk are at this moment being dumped out in hopes of raising the prices, while food warehouses sit filled with rotting, unsold cheese. Meanwhile, US and NATO forces are increasing their presence in Eastern Europe, threatening Russia. As agricultural sanctions on Russia continue, weapons and training are being provided to a Ukrainian military that is known to contain a number fascist sympathizers, including the infamous Azov Battalion. As discontent rises in the United States, it is largely centered in the agricultural and de-industrialized mid-western heartland. It is clear that many Americans desperately want something to change. A government that prioritizes fascism in Ukraine over farmers in Iowa, Wisconsin, and Ohio, is clearly out of touch. Caleb Maupin is a political analyst and activist based in New York.

2777,Trump’s Possible Path Out of Ukraine Crisis – Consortiumnews,"Home News Ukraine Trump’s Possible Path Out of Ukraine Crisis – Consortiumnews Trump’s Possible Path Out of Ukraine Crisis – Consortiumnews 
Exclusive: The U.S.-backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 sparked a New Cold War with Russia, but a President Trump could roll back tensions with a creative strategy for resolving the Ukraine standoff, writes Jonathan Marshall. 
By Jonathan Marshall 
If Donald Trump wants to make a decisive and constructive mark on U.S. foreign policy early in his presidency, there’s no better place to start than by helping to end the brutal war in Ukraine that has claimed some 10,000 lives. President-elect Donald Trump 
The Obama administration helped ignite that war by attempting to yank Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit and into the Western security and economic sphere. Working alongside the European Union, Washington fanned mass street protests that led to a violent putsch against Kiev’s elected government in February 2014. Moscow responded by annexing (or, depending on your point of view, reunifying with) Russian-speaking Crimea, which is also headquarters of Moscow’s Black Sea Fleet, and backing pro-Russia separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. 
Since then, the two sides have fought to a bloody stalemate. Besides killing thousands of civilians, the war has sunk Ukraine’s economy and fostered rampant corruption. U.S. and E.U. sanctions have dragged down Russia’s economy and derailed cooperation between Washington and Moscow in other theaters. Rising tensions between NATO and Russia have greatly raised the odds of an accidental military confrontation between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. 
The best hope for Ukraine — and renewed East-West cooperation — is the Minsk Protocol, signed by Ukrainian, Russian, and European parties in the capital of Belarus on Sept. 5, 2014. The agreement provided for a ceasefire, an exchange of prisoners, and a framework for a political settlement based on giving the Donetsk and Luhansk regions a “special status.” 
That agreement broke down amid renewed fighting until the parties signed the Minsk-2 Agreement on Feb. 12, 2015. It provided for constitutional reforms, elections in the two republics, and restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over its borders. But Kiev has made no serious move to recognize the special status of its breakaway regions, and the two sides have engaged in sporadic hostilities ever since. 
Final Words 
Presidents Obama and Putin exchanged what may have been their final, desultory words on the subject at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru this month. Obama “urged President Putin to uphold Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements,” while a Russian spokesman said the two men “expressed regret that it was not possible to make progress in Ukraine.” President Barack Obama meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the sidelines of the G20 Summit at Regnum Carya Resort in Antalya, Turkey, Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015.

As current foreign policy messes go, however, the Ukrainian imbroglio may offer the greatest opportunities for a rewarding cleanup. Doing so will require both sides to acknowledge some fault and find creative ways to save face. 
Fortunately, President-elect Trump has created an opening for such a settlement by reaching out to Putin during the election campaign and explicitly declining to bash Russia for its annexation of Crimea (which followed a hastily arranged referendum in which the official results showed that 96 percent of the voters favored leaving Ukraine and rejoining Russia). 
There are also small signs of progress that give hope. A limited demilitarization accord signed in September led to a mutual retreat by the Ukrainian army and pro-Russia separatists from a small city in eastern Ukraine. The withdrawal was verified by observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), a party to the Minsk accords. Meanwhile, Ukraine, Germany, France and Russia are working on a new roadmap to strengthen the ceasefire. 
Conditions for Peace 
In a June 2015 interview with Charlie Rose, Putin laid out clear and reasonable conditions for making the Minsk accord stick: Ukraine’s anti-Russian President Petro Poroshenko speaking to the Atlantic Council in 2014. (Photo credit: Atlantic Council) 
“Today we primarily need to comply with all the agreements reached in Minsk … At the same time, I would like to draw . . . the attention of all our partners to the fact that we cannot do it unilaterally. We keep hearing the same thing, repeated like a mantra – that Russia should influence the southeast of Ukraine. We are. However, it is impossible to resolve the problem through our influence on the southeast alone. 
“There has to be influence on the current official authorities in Kiev, which is something we cannot do. This is a road our Western partners have to take – those in Europe and America. Let us work together. … We believe that to resolve the situation we need to implement the Minsk agreements, as I said. The elements of a political settlement are key here. There are several. . . . 
“The first one is constitutional reform, and the Minsk agreements say clearly: to provide autonomy or, as they say, decentralization of power. . . 
“The second thing that has to be done – the law passed earlier on the special status of . . . Luhansk and Donetsk, the unrecognized republics, should be enacted. It was passed, but still not acted upon. This requires a resolution of the Supreme Rada – the Ukrainian Parliament – which is also covered in the Minsk agreements. . . . 
“The third thing is a law on amnesty. It is impossible to have a political dialogue with people who are threatened with criminal persecution. And finally, they need to pass a law on municipal elections on these territories and to have the elections themselves. All this is spelled out in the Minsk agreements. . . . 
“I repeat, it is important now to have a direct dialogue between Luhansk, Donetsk and Kiev – this is missing.” 
Future of Crimea 
Any lasting settlement will also require some compromise over Crimea, which Putin has vowed never to relinquish. A map showing Crimea (in beige) and its proximity to both the Ukrainian mainland and Russia. 
As Ray McGovern, the CIA’s former chief Russia analyst, has noted, the annexation of Crimea did violate a pledge that Russia made in 1994 — along with Great Britain and the United States — “to respect the independence and sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine,” as a precondition to Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons. Of course, the United States and the E.U. had already violated the same pledge by supporting a coup d’état against the country’s elected government. 
McGovern cited other “extenuating circumstances, including alarm among Crimeans over what the unconstitutional ouster of Ukraine’s president might mean for them, as well as Moscow’s not unfounded nightmare of NATO taking over Russia’s major, and only warm-water, naval base at Sevastopol in Crimea.” 
In support of annexation, Russian and Crimean authorities also pointed to the hasty referendum that was held in Crimea in March 2014, which resulted in 96 percent support for reunification with Russia, a relationship dating back to the Eighteenth Century. Subsequent polls of Crimean opinion, conducted by Western firms, have largely confirmed support for the 2014 referendum on rejoining Russia. But the referendum did not have international observers and was not accepted by the United States and other Western nations. 
Condemning the annexation in a soaring speech about the “rule of law” and America’s dedication to universal principles, President Obama contrasted Crimea with Kosovo, which NATO forcibly broke away from Serbia in 1999. 
Obama said, “Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized not outside the boundaries of international law, but in careful cooperation with the United Nations and with Kosovo’s neighbors. None of that even came close to happening in Crimea.” 
Actually, none of that came close to happening in Kosovo, either. Obama’s story was a myth, but it confirmed the powerful legitimacy offered by popular referenda, like those in Great Britain over Scottish independence or Brexit. 
Yet, as part of a permanent settlement of the larger Ukraine crisis, the Minsk signatories could agree to hold another, binding referendum in Crimea under international supervision to decide whether it stays under Russian rule or returns to Ukraine. 
To get Russia’s buy-in, the United States and its European allies should agree to lift sanctions if Moscow abides by the referendum and other terms of the Minsk accord. They should also agree to rule out the incorporation of Ukraine into NATO, the original sin that sowed the seeds of crisis between Russia and the West. Russia, in turn, could agree to demilitarize its border with Ukraine. 
Obstacles to Settlement 
President Putin has signaled his willingness to compromise in several ways, including firing his hardline chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, and welcoming the presence of armed observers from OSCE to monitor the Minsk agreement. The neo-Nazi Wolfsangel symbol on a banner in Ukraine. 
But major obstacles still impede progress. One is President Petro Poroshenko’s stalling in the face of opposition to the Minsk accord by Ukrainian nationalists. Kiev needs to be given a firm choice: go it alone, or compromise if it wants continued economic support from the United States and Western Europe. The Obama administration has quietly urged the Poroshenko government to honor the Minsk agreement, but has never put teeth behind its entreaties. 
The other major obstacle is hostility from militarist hardliners in the West who propose arming Ukraine to ratchet up conflict with Russia. Prime examples include the State Department’s chief policy maker on Ukraine, Victoria Nuland; former NATO Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove, who became infamous for issuing inflated warnings about Russian military operations; Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain; and Stephen Hadley, Raytheon board member and former national security adviser to President George W. Bush, who chairs the Orwellian-named United States Institute for Peace. 
But Trump will have great leeway as commander-in-chief to reject their advice and set a new direction for NATO’s policy on Ukraine and Russia more generally. He has everything to gain by breaking the cycle of political conflict with Moscow. 
An ally in the Kremlin will immeasurably improve his chances of making deals in the Middle East, finding a way out of Afghanistan, and managing China. 
The next few months should tell us whether Trump has the independence, imagination, and gumption to do the right thing.

2778,4.1 Miles - The New York Times,"Note: This documentary short film was nominated for a 2017 Academy Award. When I returned home to Greece last fall to make a film about the refugee crisis, I discovered a situation I had never imagined possible. The turquoise sea that surrounds the beautiful Greek island of Lesbos, just 4. 1 miles from the Turkish coast, is these days a deadly gantlet, choked with terrified adults and small children on flimsy, dangerous boats. I had never seen people escaping war before, and neither had the island’s residents. I couldn’t believe there was no support for these families to safely escape whatever conflict had caused them to flee. The scene was haunting. Regardless of the hardship Greeks have endured from the financial crisis, for a long time my home country has by and large been a peaceful, safe and easy place to live. But now Greece is facing a new crisis, one that threatens to undo years of stability, as we struggle to absorb the thousands of desperate migrants who pour across our borders every day. A peak of nearly 5, 000 entered Greece each day last year, mainly fleeing conflicts in the Middle East. The Greek Coast Guard, especially when I was there, has been completely unprepared to deal with the constant flow of rescues necessary to save refugees from drowning as they attempt to cross to Europe from Turkey. When I was there filming, Lesbos had about 40 local coast guard officers, who before the refugee crisis generally spent their time conducting routine border patrols. Most didn’t have CPR training. Their vessels didn’t have thermal cameras or any equipment necessary for tremendous emergencies. Suddenly, the crew was charged with keeping the small bit of water they patrolled from becoming a mass grave. Each day, thousands of refugees crossed the water on tiny, dangerous inflatable rafts. Most of the passengers, sometimes including whoever was operating the boat, had never seen the sea. Often a motor would stall and passengers would be stranded for hours, floating tenuously on a cold, volatile sea. Or the bottom of a dinghy would simply tear away and all the passengers would be cast into the water. The coast guard felt completely abandoned, they told me, as if the world had left them to handle a huge humanitarian crisis  —   or allow thousands to drown offshore. I followed a coast guard captain for three weeks as he pulled family after family, child after child, from the ocean and saved their lives. All the ones in this film were shot on a single day, October 28, 2015. Two additional rescues happened that same day but were not included. The problem is far from over. Many of the refugees come from Syria, where Russia is intensifying bombings that are killing thousands of civilians and devastating Syrian cities. The United States is planning to respond. According to the Greek Coast Guard, thousands of families with children are lining up along Turkish shores to make the unsafe crossing to Greece. In making this film, I was struck by the fine lines that separate us, the moments when our paths cross fleetingly, and we look at one another for the first time and sometimes for the last. This film shows that crucial moment between life and death, where regardless of political beliefs, fears or preparation, some people will go beyond themselves to save a stranger. And it raises questions about our collective responsibility  —   the choices we all make for ourselves, and for others. We don’t all confront the refugee crisis with the same immediacy as the coast guard captain portrayed here. But as our world becomes more interconnected, and more violent, we do all face a choice  —   would we act as he does, to save the life of stranger? Or would we turn away?",0
2779,Internet Erupts In Mockery After Sarah Palin Posts Something Monumentally Stupid Again (TWEETS),"on October 30, 2016 4:07 pm · 
For like the eleventy-billionth time, Sarah Palin posted a broken link to a Facebook post on Twitter Sunday. Now, at first glance her months of posting dead links and not figuring out how to fix the problem might seem moderately stupid — until you see the content of the actual post on the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska’s Facebook timeline. 
Referencing Clinton’s recent, mundane campaign stop at a bar, Palin — who regularly appears to be heavily intoxicated whenever she has a camera in front of her and was involved in a drunken hillbilly brawl in 2014 — quipped, “she’s gonna drive us all to drink.” 
Thinking she is clever, she then adds that Clinton should have been “thinking Sam Adams” rather than “drinking Sam Adams.” 
Naturally, as Palin brought up drinking, the internet decided it couldn’t let this one go: @SarahPalinUSA I see you've already started

2781,"Comment on ""The Working Class Won the Election"" by Paul Craig Roberts","Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
The US presidential election is historic, because the American people were able to defeat the oligarchs. Hillary Clinton, an agent for the Oligarchy, was defeated despite the vicious media campaign against Donald Trump. This shows that the media and the political establishments of the political parties no longer have credibility with the American people. 
It remains to be seen whether Trump can select and appoint a government that will serve him and his goals to restore American jobs and to establish friendly and respectful relations with Russia, China, Syria, and Iran. 
It also remains to be seen how the Oligarchy will respond to Trump’s victory. Wall Street and the Federal Reserve can cause an economic crisis in order to put Trump on the defensive, and they can use the crisis to force Trump to appoint one of their own as Secretary of the Treasury. Rogue agents in the CIA and Pentagon can cause a false flag attack that would disrupt friendly relations with Russia. Trump could make a mistake and retain neoconservatives in his government. 
With Trump there is at least hope. Unless Trump is obstructed by bad judgment in his appointments and by obstacles put in his way, we should expect an end to Washington’s orchestrated conflict with Russia, the removal of the US missiles on Russia’s border with Poland and Romania, the end of the conflict in Ukraine, and the end of Washington’s effort to overthrow the Syrian government. However, achievements such as these imply the defeat of the US Oligarchy. Although Trump defeated Hillary, the Oligarchy still exists and is still powerful. 
Trump said that he no longer sees the point of NATO 25 years after the Soviet collapse. If he sticks to his view, it means a big political change in Washington’s EU vassals. The hostility toward Russia of the current EU and NATO officials would have to cease. German Chancellor Merkel would have to change her spots or be replaced. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg would have to be dismissed. 
We do not know who Trump will select to serve in his government. It is likely that Trump is unfamiliar with the various possibilities and their positions on issues. It really depends on who is advising Trump and what advice they give him. Once we see his government, we will know whether we can be hopeful for the changes that now have a chance. 
If the oligarchy is unable to control Trump and he is actually successful in curbing the power and budget of the military/security complex and in holding the financial sector politically accountable, Trump could be assassinated. 
Trump said that he will put Hillary in prison. He should first put her on trial for treason and war crimes along with all of the neoconservatives. That would clear the decks for peace with the other two major nuclear powers over whom the neoconservatives seek hegemony. Although the neoconservatives would still have contacts in the hidden deep state, it would make it difficult for the vermin to organize false flag operations or an assassination. Rogue elements in the military/security complex could still bring off an assassination, but without neocons in the government a coverup would be more difficult. 
Trump has more understanding and insight than his opponents realize. For a man such as Trump to risk acquiring so many powerful enemies and to risk his wealth and reputation, he had to have known that the people’s dissatisfaction with the ruling establishment meant he could be elected president. 
We won’t know what to expect until we see who are the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries. If it is the usual crowd, we will know Trump has been captured. 
A happy lasting result of the election is the complete discrediting of the US media. The media predicted an easy Hillary victory and even Democratic Party control of the US Senate. Even more important to the media’s loss of influence and credibility, despite the vicious media attack on Trump throughout the presidential primaries and presidential campaign, the media had no effect outside the Northeast and West coasts, the stomping grounds of the One Percent. The rest of the country ignored the media. 
I did not think the Oligarchy would allow Trump to win. However, it seems that the oligarchs were deceived by their own media propaganda. Assured that Hillary was the sure winner, they were unprepared to put into effect plans to steal the election. 
Hillary is down, but not the Oligarchs. If Trump is advised to be conciliatory, to hold out his hand, and to take the establishment into his government, the American people will again be disappointed. In a country whose institutions have been so completely corrupted by the Oligarchy, it is difficult to achieve real change without bloodshed.

2783,"Greed, Corruption and Danger: A Tarnished Afghan Gem Trade - The New York Times","KABUL, Afghanistan  —   The local people called the militia’s takeover of the giant lapis mine in northeastern Badakhshan Province a white coup  —   easy and bloodless. Perhaps, but the seizure has become a lesson in how the lack of accountability and rule of law in Afghanistan can turn bounty into ruin. Riding waves of excitement after a 2010 report  by the United States military that Afghanistan’s mineral wealth could be worth as much as $1 trillion, the Lajwardeen Mining Company won a   contract in 2013 to extract lapis lazuli in Badakhshan. For thousands of years, Afghanistan has been one of the chief sources of lapis lazuli, a prized blue gemstone associated with love and purity and admired by poets as well as jewelers. Valued at about $125 million a year in 2014, the lapis trade had the potential to be worth at least double that, and Lajwardeen, owned by an Afghan family in the   business for three generations, saw a great opportunity. Yet within 21 days of officially beginning its work, the company lost the mine to a local militia supported by the Afghan political elite. In the two years since, according to interviews with company employees, Afghan officials and militia commanders, the government has done little to restore the mine to the company. Lapis is still being mined, with the rent split between the militia and the Taliban, who have established a strong foothold in a province long resistant to them. With the plunge in global commodity prices deflating some of the enthusiasm for Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, the initial excitement has faded into broader  —   and, among Afghans,     —   concerns over mismanagement, impunity and corruption. The country has failed to make even the most basic legal and regulatory changes, and even President Ashraf Ghani recently expressed fear that “we are faced with the curse of natural resources. ” Javed Noorani, an Afghan analyst who has written extensively about extractive industries, said: “We have to define a vision for our mines and how we go about extracting each. In the current reality, where do we have security control and can provide the most basic governance and oversight?” But Mr. Ghani’s government, which promised a more judicious approach to the mines, seems to be perpetuating the old way of doing business. The Afghan National Security Council, over which Mr. Ghani presides, ordered the termination of the Lajwardeen contract and moved to reopen the bidding. The council also proposed bringing the militia into the government framework. Such a change would set a strange precedent: failing to protect a contractor from a seizure of assets and then legalizing the takeover. The decision to cancel the contract was made in November 2014, the National Security Council said in a statement, because the contractor’s progress had not met the terms of the agreement and the mine was being used by “irresponsible armed men. ” While other parts of the National Security Council’s decision, such as dispatching forces to protect the mine, have not been carried out, the government said it still considered the contract annulled because Lajwardeen had not followed up on its appeal in the courts. The company, though, says it is still pursuing the case. Expansion of the mineral industry is essential to cultivating Afghanistan’s economic growth and weaning the country from foreign aid, said Stephen Carter, the leader of the Afghanistan campaign at Global Witness, an organization that investigates corruption and environmental degradation in the exploitation of natural resources. “What the lapis mines of Badakhshan show better than almost any other example is that the realistic expectation is that they are going to do precisely the opposite  —   that they are going to be a source of conflict and corruption and actually possibly fuel a   chronic   conflict,” Mr. Carter said. “So what should be a treasure is actually a poison for Afghanistan. ” A new Global Witness report explains how interests of the Taliban and the political elite align to keep the government weak and the resources in the hands of an unlawful few. The report also shows how Lajwardeen was essentially caught in a larger rivalry between two local strongmen. For much of this century, the mine was controlled by local strongmen including Zalmai Mujadidi, a member of Parliament who made his brother the leader of the security force protecting the mine. When Lajwardeen (the word is a Persian description of lapis) won the contract in 2013, the government struggled to hand over the mine as rival factions vied for control. Company executives agreed to a compromise: They gave illegal miners a few months to take as much of the stone as they could. The executives also offered them a chance to buy shares in the company once it began operations. But the company’s perceived closeness to Mr. Mujadidi set off a vicious backlash. While saying Mr. Mujadidi had not been awarded shares, company officials acknowledged that they had enlisted the support of powerful people like him, especially since his brother’s guards essentially controlled the mine such was the reality of doing business in Badakhshan. In January 2014, Abdul Malik, a militia commander and a longtime rival to Mr. Mujadidi, spread rumors that the Taliban were about to take the mine. Instead, fighters loyal to him seized it. “There was no Taliban in the district at the time they took over the mine,” said Noor Agha Nadery, who was then the district governor of Kuran wa Munjan, where the mine is situated. “The truth of the matter is that the mine was taken over with the help of senior officials in Kabul and Badakhshan, who are still trying to keep the mine in the hands of Malik. ” Imamuddin, one of Mr. Malik’s commanders, who helped take the mine but has since had a   with him, said, “There were no Taliban in the district. ” That rumor, said Imamuddin, who like many Afghans uses only one name, “was spread by Malik himself. ” Mr. Malik, who believes in restoring local ownership of the mine, has said he led a popular uprising against outsiders exploiting it. Mr. Malik’s militia made about $18 million in 2014 and $12 million in 2015 from renting the mine to local extractors and collecting tolls on the roads, the Global Witness report said. As the Taliban have encroached on the area, he has been forced to pay them. He split the income   in the first four months of 2016, the Global Witness report said, meaning the Taliban would get an estimated $6 million for the full year. Global Witness lists Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, who was Afghanistan’s defense minister at the time of the takeover, as one of Mr. Malik’s supporters. A longtime guerrilla commander with the   Northern Alliance, a movement that for decades tapped into the lapis trade to pay for its campaigns, Mr. Mohammadi knew the value of the mine. If the allegation is true, it shows just how complex and counterintuitive war at the local level can be. It would mean that a former   political figure tasked with defending against the insurgency became involved in a scheme that brought the Taliban huge profits, making them a force in a province that had long resisted them. Mr. Mohammadi was traveling and could not be reached for comment, said Shafiq Salangi, an aide. “Minister Bismillah Khan was not supporting Malik he did not support him in getting the lapis mines in Badakhshan,” Mr. Salangi said. “This claim does not have logical grounds. We reject this claim. ” But local commanders said Mr. Mohammadi had been one of the first people Mr. Malik contacted after seizing the mine. “Commander Malik called Bismillah Mohammadi to assure him that the mine was taken over, and that no one had been killed and that he would follow orders from him,” Imamuddin said. Lajwardeen hopes to reclaim the mine one day. In the meantime, it is buying lapis  —   from Mr. Malik’s militia.",0
2784,Queen claims 70 years of Prince Philip is perfect preparation for Donald Trump,"Monday 21 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Queen claims 70 years of Prince Philip is perfect preparation for Donald Trump 
With tradition dictating that the British monarch should be amongst the first to meet a newly elected president, the Queen has assured everyone she knows exactly how to deal with men like that. 
An unnamed source close to the royal family told reporters “She’s basically been living with a Trump-like character for decades, so she knows the level of bloke she’s dealing with. 
“By all accounts both the Duke of Edinburgh and Donald Trump have the same insatiable sexual appetite – you can only imagine how Philip suggested they celebrate their 69th anniversary. Hopeless. 
“And then there’s the racism. She will probably attempt to discuss important matters such as the economy and international relations with Trump, but she just knows he’ll lower the tone of the conversation with racial stereotypes and outdated misogynistic views. 
“You know, like the ones she hears day in, day out from her husband.” 
It is believed that the Queen will brace herself with a few gin and tonics before meeting Trump, in the hope that the effect of the alcohol will be to take her mind off the depressing thought that the strangely coiffed reality TV star could be the last president she knows. 
Her source also added, “Some people have expressed concern about the Queen having a private meeting with a self-confessed sexual predator, but they need not have any worries. 
“She can handle herself – Philip has been trying to grab her by the pussy without success since the 1970s.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",0
2785,How the Poll Was Conducted - The New York Times,"The latest New York   News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted July 8 to 12 with 1, 600 adults throughout the United States. Of those, 1, 358 said they were registered to vote. SSRS of Media, Pa. conducted sampling, interviewing and tabulation for the survey. Interviews were in English or Spanish. The sample of landline telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 82, 000 active residential exchanges across the country, maintained by MSG of Horsham, Pa. The exchanges were chosen so as to ensure that each region of the country was represented in its proper proportion. Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers alike. Within each landline household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey. Cellphone numbers were generated by a similar random process. The two samples were then combined and adjusted to assure the proper ratio of     and   users. Interviewers made multiple attempts to reach every phone number in the survey, calling back unanswered numbers on different days at different times of both day and night. The combined results have been weighted to adjust for variation in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, age, education and (for landline households) the number of adults and number of phone lines. In addition, the sample was adjusted to reflect the percentage of the population residing in mostly Democratic counties, mostly Republican counties, and counties more closely balanced politically. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, overall results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all American adults. This margin includes the effects of weighting procedures, which enlarge sampling error slightly. For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 9 points for the 171 black respondents, 6 points for the 393 Republican registered voters and 5 points for the 441 Democratic registered voters. Shifts in results between polls over time also have a larger sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variation in the wording, order and translation of questions, for instance, may lead to somewhat different results. Michael R. Kagay of Princeton, N. J. assisted The Times in its polling analysis.

2786,Texas House Passes Crackdown Policy on Teacher-Student Sex,"Members of the Texas House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill Tuesday to crack down on the state’s epidemic of   sexual misconduct. [In a vote of    the House approved Senate Bill 7, authored by Senator Paul Bettencourt ( ). In March, the bill sailed through the Senate,   . It imposes harsh consequences on wayward educators and on the school administrators who ignore the problem.  “Educator misconduct is a statewide plague that has unfortunately been on the rise,” said Bettencourt in a prepared statement following the bill’s passage in the House, adding: “Inappropriate relationships between students and teachers must be stamped out, period. ” Lawmakers hope to end the “plague” ravaging the state’s classrooms through a number of fixes. As Breitbart Texas reported, S. B. 7 mandates the automatic revocation of a teaching license when an educator receives deferred adjudication or must register as a sex offender for this abhorrent behavior. It also holds principals and superintendents to account with fines and jail time when they look the other way and purposely fail to report teacher wanton misdeeds to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Even an administrator’s unintentional failure to report sexual misconduct results in a $500 fine. Additionally, S. B. 7 criminalizes when an educator becomes romantically involved with a student under 18 years old, regardless of what school district the teacher works or where a student attends classes. Currently, this is not an offense. While the bill does not name a particular curriculum, it requires that teachers attend continuing education classes to ensure “appropriate relationships, boundaries, and communications between educators and students. ” On Monday, the House tacked on several new amendments to S. B. 7, including one from Representative Matt Rinaldi ( ). “Crimes against children are an unbearable evil,” said Rinaldi. His amendment calls for revoking a teacher’s pension if convicted of having an improper relationship with a student. In an amendment to this amendment, Representative Gary VanDeaver (  Boston) left it up to a judge’s discretion if the convicted educator’s pension could be released to a spouse. Representative Tony Dale (  Park) who filed the companion H. B. 218 to close loopholes and stiffen prosecution measures for educators who engage improperly with students, authored two amendments. One mandates teacher applicants sign a   affidavit disclosing whether or not they have ever been charged or convicted of having an inappropriate relationship with a minor. Failure to disclose such information is grounds for termination. The other requires schools to notify parents of any alleged educator misconduct with their child. From April 2015 to April 2017, TEA data revealed a 65 percent increase in these inappropriate relationships between teachers and students, noted Bettencourt’s office. Recently, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told Breitbart Texas the agency opened 159 cases between September 1, 2016, and March 31, 2017. The   school year marked an    with 222 reported instances of educators romantically   sexually involved with the children entrusted to them in classrooms around the state. By comparison, the TEA opened 123 cases during the entire   school year. Each subsequent year, the number of cases rose:   141 cases   152   156   163 and   179. In   the TEA accounted for 188 cases which led to Lt. Governor Dan Patrick’s interim charge for Senate Education Committee members to meet and seek policy solutions, Breitbart Texas reported. In his 2017 State of the State, Governor Greg Abbott called for legislation that imposed strong consequences on educators who violate the public trust by crossing the line sexually with students and for those school administrators who turn a blind eye to these inappropriate relationships, Breitbart Texas reported. S. B. 7 now returns to the Senate for concurrence or conference before making its way to Abbott’s desk for signature.

2787,"NATO builds up offensive capability on borders of Russia & Belarus, Moscow to respond","
The US and NATO are building up their offensive capabilities on the Western borders of Russia and its ally Belarus, prompting Moscow to take reciprocal measures, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu told the two countries’ top military brass.
“Those actions undermine strategic stability and are forcing Russia to take reciprocal defensive measures, including some in the Western theatre,” the defense minister said.
NATO “has not abandoned attempts to dictate its will to other countries through economic and political means, as well as by military force,” he said, noting that “an information war is in full swing.”
Confronted with a complex security environment, Russia and Belarus will join forces to strengthen their mutual security, Shoigu added.
“Advanced bilateral cooperation and a common stance on major global and regional security challenges allow us to successfully tackle strengthening our defense capabilities,” he stressed, adding that this approach appears to be necessary at this point, “as international crisis response mechanisms have stalled, while hotspots are already near our borders.”
In order to address the security challenges, Russia is now supplying state-of-the-art armaments and weapons systems to the army units guarding the Western borders, as well as ramping up combat training for the troops, the Defense Minister said.
Russian and Belarusian militaries are constantly working on improving their interoperability and the capacity to act in large troops formations, he added.
The remarks come amid NATO’s biggest military buildup in Eastern Europe since the Cold War. The deployment will see up to 4,000 troops deployed in the Baltic countries and Poland, in addition to the more than 1,000 soldiers already stationed there on a “rotational basis.”
A German-led battalion will deploy in Lithuania, the US will send troops to Poland, Canada is expected to station troops in Latvia, and the UK will deploy an 800-strong battle group in Estonia.
British Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon claimed in a bellicose op-ed appearing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday that Europe “is our continent” and, as such, it will be defended by a “fully combat-capable” force.
Earlier this year, NATO staged several multinational war games, the largest of which was Anaconda 2016. Those exercises saw more than 31,000 personnel from 24 NATO and ‘partner’ countries taking part, reportedly in order to develop their capacity to “deploy, mass and sustain combat power” against a near-peer adversary.
In June, Ukraine, a non-NATO state, hosted the Rapid Trident 2016 exercise, which featured over 1,800 soldiers from 14 countries, along with dozens of combat vehicles, aircraft, and heavy weaponry. That drill was said to be the largest multinational war games ever to be held in Ukraine.
Most recently, 680 troops from 32 NATO and non-NATO states, including Georgia, Albania, Israel and Ukraine, took part in war games called Crna Gora 2016 in the Balkan country of Montenegro, where they trained for “disaster relief operations” in a series of joint exercises.
Moscow has consistently warned that the buildup does nothing to improve European security and is nothing but a “projection of force.”
NATO members “are fulfilling their confrontational schemes of military planning and military preparations in the territories along our borders,” Russia’s envoy to NATO, Aleksandr Grushko, said on Monday.
“So, a question arises: What’s next? A new wave of NATO speculation about a ‘Russian threat’ and a new arms race?” the diplomat added. “We believe this is a road to nowhere.”

2788,Insurers use California’s assisted-suicide law to deny treatment for terminal patients,"Legal Insurrection – by Leslie Eastman 
About one-year ago, Gov. Jerry Brown signed the state’s assisted-suicide bill into law. It fully went into effect this June, with the opening of the first clinic . While there is no data on the number of California assisted-suicides, Oregon recorded over 130 last year as part of their legalized physician-assisted death program. 
Now, one young mother says her insurance company denied her coverage for chemotherapy treatment after originally agreeing to provide the fiscal support for it, but indicated it would be willing to pay for assisted suicide instead. 
Stephanie Packer, a wife and mother of four who was diagnosed with a terminal form of scleroderma, said her insurance company initially indicated it would pay for her to switch to a different chemotherapy drug at the recommendation of her doctors. 
…But shortly after California’s End of Life Option Act, which authorizes physicians to diagnose a life-ending dose of medication to patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live, went into effect, Ms. Packer’s insurance company had a change of heart. 
“And when the law was passed, it was a week later I received a letter in the mail saying they were going to deny coverage for the chemotherapy that we were asking for,” Ms. Packer said. 
She said she called her insurance company to find out why her coverage had been denied. On the call, she also asked whether suicide pills were covered under her plan. 
“And she says, ‘Yes, we do provide that to our patients, and you would only have to pay $1.20 for the medication,’” Ms. Packer said. 
Packer attends meetings with others suffering from terminal illnesses. She indicates that the tone of those meetings have changed since the California assisted-suicide law was enacted. 
“As soon as this law was passed – and you see it everywhere, when these laws are passed – patients fighting for a longer life end up getting denied treatment, because this will always be the cheapest option.” 
Packer attends a support group for terminally ill patients. She said legally sanctioned suicide has changed the tone of the meetings, which used to be “positive and encouraging.” With patients under new societal pressure to kill themselves, she said meetings “became negative, and it started consuming people. And then they said, ‘You know what? I wish I could just end it.’” 
Concerned about the enormous potential for abuse, a the national organization, Patients Rights Action Fund, has created a website for patients like Packer. The online resource offers a place for patients, family members, concerned friends to report possible coercion, failure to identify depression or other patient mental health concerns, and complications that arise from the overdose prescription or other aspects of the assisted-suicide process. Were you or someone you know pressured to use assisted suicide, misleadingly known as ‘death with dignity’ or ‘aid in dying’? Did you or a loved one have a chronic, life-threatening illness and personal circumstances where you/they felt like suicide or assisted suicide was your only option? Did a doctor advise you or someone you know of a prognosis of 6 months or less that was wrong by months, years, or even decades? Were you or a loved one denied coverage for a life-sustaining treatment or medication by your HMO or insurance company? 
During his Gettysburg Address describing the first 100 days in office if he is elected President, Donald Trump indicated he would work to replace Obamcare with health savings accounts, remove barriers to purchasing health insurance across state lines, allow states to manage Medicaid funds and speed up drug approval inside the Food and Drug Administration. 
However, his election would be too late help many terminally-ill Californians who are now experiencing the unintended, but quite predictable, consequence of yet another feel good progressive policy.",0
2789,"World’s Largest Aircraft Crashes, Gently, in 2nd Test Flight - The New York Times","It was a slow and gentle plunge: The world’s largest aircraft, the Airlander 10, crashed in southern England on Wednesday during its second test flight. In a video posted on YouTube, spectators could be heard saying, “Oh my God, he just crashed it,” as the nose of the aircraft made contact with the ground after an agonizingly slow descent at Cardington Airfield, about 40 miles north of London, before coming to rest. Hybrid Air Vehicles  —   the British developer of the       aircraft, which has a top cruising speed of about 90 miles an hour  —   said on Twitter that the crew members were “safe and well. ” “Airlander sustained damage on landing during today’s flight,” the company added, though “no damage was sustained midair. ” The first test flight of the Airlander 10 was postponed on Aug. 14 after Stephen McGlennan, the chief executive of Hybrid Air Vehicles, said the airship had “a slight technical issue. ” It completed its initial test flight three days later. On Wednesday morning, however, spectators watched as the ship slowly   and made an unplanned landing on its cockpit. The company did not provide an explanation as to why the aircraft had come down. “It was going so well,” said Angela Hatwell, who posted several photographs of the aircraft on Facebook and described the airship’s flight as an “absolutely amazing sight. ” “It was awful to watch,” she wrote of the crash. One of Ms. Hartwell’s photographs showed the pilots in what appeared to be a damaged cockpit. “It just appeared to crumple up,” she wrote. “Luckily they appeared to walk away uninjured. ” The Airlander 10 was initially a project developed for the United States military, and Hybrid Air Vehicles has said the airship could stay airborne for up to five days at a time with someone on board and for two weeks when flown remotely.",0
2790,GOVERNMENT HIDING UNPRECEDENTED TB INFECTION RATES AMONG RELOCATED REFUGEES,"Home › HEALTH › GOVERNMENT HIDING UNPRECEDENTED TB INFECTION RATES AMONG RELOCATED REFUGEES GOVERNMENT HIDING UNPRECEDENTED TB INFECTION RATES AMONG RELOCATED REFUGEES 0 SHARES 
[10/26/16] J.D. HEYES- More Americans might be accepting of President Barack Obama’s zealous push to flood the country with refugees from war-torn parts of the world, if only he, along with federal and state officials, were more transparent about the entire process. 
Like for instance being up front with Americans about the health threat posed by many of these refugees. 
Breitbart News is reporting that officials at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, county health departments throughout the state and local offices of refugee resettlement agencies – all of whom are working closely with the Obama administration – have taken to hiding the latent tuberculosis infection rates among refugees from the general public. 
The website noted further that the “culture of concealment” in Michigan contrasts with how several other states deal with latent TB infection rates among refugees. 
As Breitbart News has reported in the past , the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services doesn’t collect latent TB infection rate information from county health departments or local resettlement agencies it hires to perform initial medical screenings of newly-arrived refugees. Also, the state agency obviously does not honor its legal obligation to do so under provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980. Michigan officials not keeping TB data required by law 
When the news service asked MDHHS officials for data about latent TB infection rates based on the full population of refugees screened, a spokesman for the agency, Bob Wheaton, said, “We do not have that data.” 
Breitbart noted that the agency has hired a number of county health departments, and in some counties private refugee health screening services, all working in cooperation with local resettlement officials for the purpose of conducting initial medical screenings of all new refugee arrivals. 
Under guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and MDHHS, all refugees who complete initial health screenings are tested for latent TB infection. However, MDHHS officials said that neither the counties nor private agencies are sharing screening data. What’s more, the counties and private refugee health screeners who do have the TB data will not make that information available to the public. 
As Breitbart News noted further: 
“In the case of at least one private refugee health screening service, the Arab American and Chaldean Council, which MDHHS has hired to conduct refugee health screenings in Wayne County, Macomb County, and Oakland County, that data is also not being shared with health departments in those counties.” 
Again, the provision of the data is a requirement of federal statutes regarding the health screening status of refugees. One-third of the rest of the world has latent TB 
Many states have made this information public in annual reports. They include Minnesota, where the latent TB infection rate among newly-arrived refugees in 2014 was 22 percent; Indiana (26 percent); Arizona (18 percent); Utah (18 percent), Texas (15 percent); California (12 percent) and Florida (12 percent). 
In addition, Breitbart News noted, other states made information available to the news service after repeated requests. They include Tennessee (27 percent); Vermont (35 percent); and Idaho (21 percent). 
It is vital to identify refugees coming into the United States with latent TB infections, because treatment must begin immediately in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, studies – including one from the University of California, San Diego in 2013 – have shown that higher rates of latent TB infection among resettled refugees pose a greater health risk to the general public in regions where they have been sent. 
Latent TB turns into a public health risk when it activates into infectious TB, a process that is generally associated with lower levels of immunity among those with latent TB. In the U.S., 4 percent of the general population has latent TB; 10 percent of those develop active TB at some point during their lives. 
By contrast, fully one-third – 33 percent – of the rest of the world has latent TB, Breitbart News reported. Post navigation",0
2791,Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space - The New York Times,"COLORADO SPRINGS  —   Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a   mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company. Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the   of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2. 5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a “golden age of space exploration. ” “If we can make access to space   then entrepreneurs will be unleashed,” he said. “You will see creativity, you will see dynamism, you will see the same thing in space that I’ve witnessed on the internet in the last 20 years. ” Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the   customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the   rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin’s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips. “It’s a mistake to race to a deadline when you’re talking about a flying vehicle, especially one that you’re going to put people on,” he said. “I still think we can do commercial paying passengers in 2018. ” Asked how much passengers would pay, Mr. Bezos said he did not know yet, but he predicted ticket prices would decline as spaceflight became more common. (Hundreds of people have already put down deposits to reserve places on similar commercial trips on Virgin Galactic that could cost $250, 000 a ticket, although that company’s spaceplane has yet to take anyone up.) New Shepard is a modest start for Mr. Bezos’s ambitions to tap into the nascent space tourism market. It is a   booster with a capsule on top that is designed to carry six passengers at a time on trips of about 10 to 11 minutes. There will not be a Blue Origin crew on the spacecraft. Passengers wearing sleek jumpsuits will be able to peer out what the company says will be the largest windows in space, taking up about   of the surface area of the dome. About 12 feet in diameter, the passenger capsule holds six black seats that resemble recliners, with panels offering details about altitude and other features of a trip. The engine that powers the booster produces up to about 110, 000 pounds of thrust. On ascent, passengers will experience forces of about 3 Gs, about three times the normal force of gravity that humans experience on earth. When the booster reaches a certain altitude, the capsule will detach and coast above the Karman line, which is 62 miles above sea level, officially entering into space. There, the passengers will experience about four to five minutes of weightlessness. They can unbuckle their harnesses and do somersaults, if desired, in the   interior. On descent, they will encounter forces of 5 Gs. The capsule will parachute back to the plains of West Texas, slowing to a coasting speed of about 20 miles per hour, while the booster drops and fires its engine to slow down and make a vertical landing. The capsule slows to 3 m. p. h. before touching down. Both pieces are reusable to make the trips more economical. “Reusability is the key to getting millions of people living and working in space,” Mr. Bezos said. While the concept is similar to the procedures SpaceX has used to recover the boosters for its Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX’s endeavors have been far more challenging, because the boosters must accelerate to speeds of thousands of miles per hour in order to put payloads on a trajectory to reach orbit. Just last week, SpaceX successfully launched a satellite into space with a reused booster, a first for commercial spaceflight. New Shepard has a simpler flight path: just up and down, almost like a big roller coaster that slows to a stop at the top of its arc. However, Mr. Bezos and his Blue Origin team believe that New Shepard, which is expected to fly many times, will give the company ample practice and experience that can be applied to New Glenn, which will be manufactured and launched in Florida. The New Shepard booster on display at the Colorado symposium made five successful    flights beginning in November 2015. Its last flight, in October, included a test of an   system that is designed to blast the capsule  —   and, eventually, passengers  —   to safety in case something goes wrong with the booster. The abort system worked. To the pleasant surprise of the engineers, the booster survived the force of separation, righted itself and descended to a landing. (It would have still been considered a successful test if the booster had crashed.) A Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 crashed, killing one pilot and severely injuring the other. Both Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk have much more ambitious goals beyond their current rockets. Mr. Musk wants to send settlers to Mars. Mr. Bezos has said his   vision involves having millions of people living and working in space.",0
2792,Presidential Election Live: Donald Trump’s Victory - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s victory in the presidential race on Tuesday night capped a remarkable election in which several Democratic Senate candidates fell short and Republicans retained their majority in the House of Representatives. Here are some key takeaways from a stunning result that upended conventional expectations and set the stage for a drastic reordering of politics in Washington: • Mr. Trump took the stage at the Hilton just before 3 a. m. and told his supporters that Hillary Clinton called him to concede the election. Striking a gracious note, he wished her well and said, “We owe her a major debt of gratitude for her debt to our country. ” • Reading from teleprompters and flanked by Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and his son, Barron, Mr. Trump said he wanted to “reclaim our country’s destiny” and be bold and daring. He also called for unity and said that he hoped Democrats and Republicans would work together. • Democratic hopes that Hillary Clinton would easily defeat Mr. Trump crumbled as the evening wore on, as the Republican candidate’s bombastic style appeared to win significant support among white,   and rural voters across the country. • Mrs. Clinton’s loss seemed to result, in part, from a    showing among   and young voters  —   two important parts of the coalition that lifted President Obama to victories in 2008 and 2012. • Black voters made up 12 percent of the national electorate this year, nearly the same as in 2012. Mrs. Clinton won a broad majority of black voters  —   88 percent, compared with 8 percent for Mr. Trump. But Mr. Obama received 93 percent of the   vote four years ago. • Mrs. Clinton also did slightly worse than Mr. Obama among young voters. People under 30 made up 19 percent of this year’s electorate, the same as in 2012. Mrs. Clinton got 54 percent of their support, compared with Mr. Obama’s 60 percent. Mr. Trump had the backing of 37 percent of voters under 30, the same percentage that Mitt Romney won in 2012. • Mr. Trump won in part on his strength with voters who were not strongly identified with either party. Independents made up 31 percent of 2016 voters, compared with 29 percent in 2012. Mrs. Clinton won 42 percent of independents, compared with Mr. Trump’s 47 percent, while 6 percent voted for Gary Johnson and 3 percent supported Jill Stein. • In the key battleground of Florida, Mr. Trump built his support largely on voters who expressed deep dismay with Washington. Nearly nine in 10 of his voters in Florida said they were dissatisfied or angry with the state of the federal government. Just as many disapproved of Mr. Obama’s job performance, and   thought the president’s health care law went too far. • Nearly four in 10 Florida voters said they were most interested in electing a president who would bring serious change, and Mr. Trump won that group by a broad margin. Mrs. Clinton won voters looking for a compassionate, experienced or more judicious leader  —   but it was not enough to cancel out Mr. Trump’s support among those hungry for change. • Hispanic voters made up 11 percent of voters nationwide in 2016, just 1 point higher than in 2012. While Mrs. Clinton got 65 percent support among Hispanics, compared with 29 percent for Mr. Trump, her support from this group was 6 points lower than Mr. Obama’s in 2012. • While Mrs. Clinton did better than Mr. Trump among nonwhite voters in Florida, it was not enough to offset his success with white voters, who skew older in the state. He won those by nearly 2 to 1, including those with a college degree.   of Florida’s electorate was white and over 60. Mr. Trump pulled most of his support from the Gulf Coast and the central part of the state, a hub for wealthy retirees, offsetting Mrs. Clinton’s gaping lead in the Miami and Orlando areas. •Mr. Trump also did well in Ohio, where voters ages 18 to 29 were 11 points less likely to support the Democratic candidate this year than in 2012, with Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein capturing 7 percent of their votes. Black voters in Ohio were 6 points less likely to support Mrs. Clinton than they were to support Mr. Obama four years ago. • In North Carolina, 30 percent of voters were nonwhite, and Mrs. Clinton won this group by a   margin (79 percent to 17 percent). Mr. Trump, countering with a strong showing among whites, won the state. • The suburban share of the North Carolina vote increased to 38 percent, from 28 percent in 2012, while the share of the rural vote decreased by 10 points, to 24 percent. Mr. Trump won majorities in both groups.",0

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has a few problems when it comes to Black voters. To look at the polls, you’d wonder if there is a single Black person in the entire country who is willing to give him the time of the day. They do show up, of course. Sure, sometimes they turn out to be ex-cult members turned jazz singing GOP fanatics . Sure, sometimes they are faded celebrities who accidentally use the ‘N’ word on stage. But you know, sometimes it’s a Marine or Navy serviceman who has somehow managed to look past the debase insults , juvenile tantrums , and transparent lies of the GOP’s great orange hope. 
It’s such a damn shame that Trump can’t tell one group from another. They All Look The Same To Trump 
His recent attempts at rebooting his campaign’s standing with Black people was something of a fiasco . It failed in part because it’s way too late for Trump to distance himself from close ties to White supremacy and antisemitism . 
But it also failed because his image of the lives of Black people is that it is one of nasty, brutish, Dickensian squalor. Indeed, it’s so out of touch-offensive that even his plans to help struggling Black communities come across as being unforgivably racist. 
It’s little wonder, then, that when Trump saw a black face at his rally in Kinston, North Carolina, his razor-sharp mind kicked in. He jumped to the kind of conclusion you’d expect from a man with less racial sensitivity than a 19th century British naval officer. 
He assumed the man was a protester. Different Strokes Of The Pen 
Sixty-three-year-old ex-Marine C.J. Cary was on a mission. Though a die-hard Republican, he had been deeply shocked by some of the things Trump has said. In an effort to reason with him, he penned a letter that, according to the Charlette Observer : “… [Urged] Trump to be less offensive and more inclusive to four demographic groups: black people, women, people with disabilities and college students.” 
He never got to deliver the note. 
He made his way toward the front rows shouting “Donald” and waving his document, trying to attract the nominees attention. It worked. Sort of. “We have a protester!” Trump told the crowd, adding : “By the way,were you paid $1,500 to be a thug?” Trump calls black supporter a ""thug,"" has him kicked out of a rally in North Carolina. https://t.co/b4gkI6qx9v pic.twitter.com/eJKuu0CLRi

As the long time Republican voter was escorted from the venue he made one final attempt to get his note to the man who would be king : “I said, ‘I was trying to get to this doc to Mr. Donald … will you get this to Donald?’” 
The official promised he would pass along the note. Having been treated to some common courtesy at last, Cary set off back home to watch the election coverage with that same horrified expression that we’ve all become so accustomed to. 
By the way, this wasn’t the first time a Trump supporter has been mistaken for a protester simply because he wasn’t the right color:

Professor Henry Brubaker said: “Speaker people want everyone to hear their conversation because they reckon the world is a soap opera in which they are the main characters. “Often the person holding the phone is just repeatedly saying ‘Oh my God’ and laughing maniacally while the person on the other end says ‘Oh my God’ back. “Or it’s some corporate rubbish like ‘Karl, KMG just caved in at the Didbury meeting, we’ve nailed it’.” Speaker phone fan Mary Fisher said: “Speaker mode is handy for when you’re driving or if you’re on busy public transport and you want to let the entire bus know you’ve just seen a massive cat. “I just like holding the phone directly in front of me, it looks futuristic plus I can see my lovely chin reflected in the screen.”

2797,"Russia, Suspected in Hacking, Has Uneasy History With Hillary Clinton - The New York Times","PHILADELPHIA  —   Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Donald J. Trump’s apparent endorsement on Wednesday of Russian cyberspying against Hillary Clinton has pulled President Vladimir V. Putin fully into the American political fray. But Mr. Putin’s relationship with Mrs. Clinton has been tense at least since 2011, when, as secretary of state, she accused him of rigging an election and he accused her of meddling in Russian politics. Mr. Putin  —   who was then the prime minister, plotting his return to the presidency  —   said her words were a “signal” to protesters, encouraging them to take to the streets, which they did in large numbers. Her remarks also annoyed the White House, which at that time still clung to the hope that President Obama’s policy of “resetting” relations with Russia could be salvaged. That episode, late in Mrs. Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, is important to understanding why Mr. Putin’s government could have a motive for hacking into the Democratic National Committee’s computers and leaking emails to damage her electoral prospects against Mr. Trump. But it also speaks to the   stance toward Russia and Mr. Putin that Mrs. Clinton staked out in the Obama administration. At the same time that she was condemning Russia over its elections, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was planning to travel to Moscow to meet Mr. Putin her harsh words complicated his diplomacy. Above all, the bitter exchange attests to a combustible relationship between two ambitious,   leaders, both unafraid to exercise power  —   one a former K. G. B. officer who emerged from the shadows the other a famous female politician who spent decades on the public stage. “In our administration, Secretary Clinton always had a tougher line toward Putin and the Russians than other senior administration officials,” said Michael A. McFaul, an adviser on Russia who served as United States ambassador to Moscow. “It was Putin’s strong belief that we, with Clinton in the lead, were trying to meddle with his regime. ” It was one of several instances where Mrs. Clinton was more hawkish than her boss  —   differences the White House and the Clinton campaign have so far played down but which may loom larger in the general election. Certainly, Mrs. Clinton has been open in saying she would push back harder than Mr. Obama has against Mr. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria. Mrs. Clinton’s first meeting with Mr. Putin as secretary of state set the stage for a stormy relationship. When she went to see him in his dacha outside Moscow on March 19, 2010, he kept her waiting in front of a ceramic mantelpiece, facing a forest of cameras and boom microphones. Mr. Putin finally turned up for what was billed as a brief photo opportunity, only to lecture her in front of the reporters about how the United States needed to lift sanctions against American companies doing business in Iran. And when Mrs. Clinton started to defend the Obama administration’s policy, he promptly ordered the news media out of the room. Mrs. Clinton laughed off the episode, telling reporters what has become an   story about their relationship. “Prime Minister Putin,” she recalled asking him amid his harangue about trade policy, “tell me about what you’re doing to save the tigers in Siberia. ” Eyes brightening, Mr. Putin motioned her to his private office downstairs, where he showed her a map of Russia. Pointing to various regions, he delivered a fervent lecture about endangered tigers and polar bears. He asked her whether Bill Clinton would go on a   expedition with him in Siberia. If Bill was not available, he said, maybe Hillary would go? Diplomats traveling with her were impressed. “It’s like he sizes somebody up and sees them as a worthy adversary or counterpart,” said William J. Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow who served as Mrs. Clinton’s deputy at the State Department. “I’ve seen him with other people who he didn’t see that way, and he’d be much more dismissive and snarky. ” In retrospect, though, the meeting planted the seeds for future tensions. Eight months later, Mrs. Clinton canceled her attendance at a meeting he organized in St. Petersburg to save the tigers. Her excuse was that she had to stay in Washington to lobby the Senate to ratify a new arms reduction treaty. A year later, Mrs. Clinton was traveling in Lithuania when reports of ballot tampering and other fraud emerged after parliamentary elections in Russia. “The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,” she said in a statement, drafted by her spokeswoman, Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat and Soviet expert known for her   views about Russia. “Putin was livid that she had spoken out,” Mr. McFaul said.   Russian officials even called the White House to ask whether she was speaking for the United States. That created a tempest in the West Wing, since Mr. McFaul had signed off on Mrs. Clinton’s statement. Although the president was also skeptical of Mr. Putin’s intentions, he, too, had hoped to keep the reset policy alive a little longer. There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had any regrets. Shortly before she left the State Department, she asked her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, to draft a      exit memo from her to Mr. Obama, warning him that the reset policy was dead, that relations with Russia would deteriorate under Mr. Putin and that the United States needed to push back hard. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said they were confident she would pursue such a strategy as president. Mr. Trump’s latest comments  —   in which he said he hoped Russia would find and expose thousands of emails that Mrs. Clinton did not hand over to the State Department  —   only highlighted the chasm between their positions, according to these aides. “What Trump said today is reckless and demonstrates he is unfit for the Oval Office,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official and   adviser to Mrs. Clinton. He said that he was confident that Mrs. Clinton would strongly defend the interests of the United States and its allies against any aggression by Mr. Putin. By 2014, after Russia had annexed Crimea and sent its tanks and troops to menace Ukraine, Mrs. Clinton’s exit memo to the president looked prescient. Speaking at a Democratic   in California in March 2014, she likened Mr. Putin’s behavior to Hitler’s conquest of the Sudetenland in 1938. When Mr. Putin was asked about that comparison by a French television station three months later, he replied: “It’s better not to argue with women. Ms. Clinton had never been too graceful in her statements. ”",0

The professor in question, Olga Perez   declined the award for an unspecified reason, according to Doug Bennet, executive director of college advancement at OCC. Even though Cox turned down the award, some people at the school think the faculty’s decision to nominate her was wrong in the first place, given what she said last semester. “The fact that the faculty chose professor Cox for the faculty member of the year award speaks volumes to how blind they are about what she did last semester,” said Joshua     of OCC’s College Republicans group. On Saturday, campus police discovered graffiti targeting the OCC College Republicans and  . “Doxx Joshua Martinez OCC Young Republicans = Fascists,” one graffiti message read, according to the Los Angeles Times.   says that Cox probably did not accept the nomination because of these recent events. “She understood the impact that accepting the nomination could have on the campus climate, and that is why she refused,”   said.  ’s group is the same group responsible for posting the video of Cox’s comments on Facebook. In her comments, Cox blamed the Electoral College for Trump’s win and and said that the “act of terrorism” was committed by someone “among us. ” “It’s an act of terrorism.

Moore, whose fortitude saved most of his outnumbered battalion in 1965 in the first major battle between American and North Vietnamese troops  —   exploits immortalized in a book and a movie starring Mel Gibson  —   died on Friday at his home in Auburn, Ala. He was 94. His death was confirmed by his son Col. David Moore who, like his brother Lt. Col. Stephen Moore and their father, was a West Point graduate. General Moore recounted his battlefield heroics in 1992 in a   book, “We Were Soldiers Once   …     and Young,” written with Joseph L. Galloway. Mr. Galloway, as a    war correspondent for United Press International, had witnessed the battle, one of the war’s bloodiest, in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965. Mr. Gibson played General Moore in “We Were Soldiers,” the 2002 film adaptation of the book. “He was a phenomenal man of great strength and character, courageous and like a father to his troops who got most of his boys out of there after he landed in a hornet’s nest,” Mr. Gibson, who visited the general a few months ago, said on Monday in a phone interview. General Moore later fended off an antiwar protest by Jane Fonda at a California base and oversaw the sweeping transition to an   Army after the war. But no moment in his   military career was as transformational as the brief American victory at Ia Drang, in shaping both his heroic reputation (he was George Armstrong Custer’s heir as commander of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment) and his view that America’s combat role in Vietnam was futile. “It wasn’t our place to question,” General Moore wrote with Mr. Galloway in a   book, “We Are Soldiers Still: A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam” (2008). “We were soldiers and we followed their orders. In times and places like this, where the reasons for war are lacking, soldiers fight and die for each other. ” The North Vietnamese retreated after the battle, but they went on, with the Vietcong, to wage a successful guerrilla war that ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital. Years after General Moore retired from active duty in 1977, he visited Ia Drang with his North Vietnamese battlefield counterpart for an ABC documentary, publicly supported a global ban on the production and use of   land mines, and likened the American invasion of Iraq to the protracted war in Vietnam, which, he wrote, ended after 10 years “with a hasty withdrawal just ahead of defeat. ” “His mantra,” his son David said, was “Hate war, love the American soldier. ” General Moore did both. Nicholas Proffitt, a former war correspondent, wrote of “We Were Soldiers Once” in The New York Times Book Review, “General Moore’s respect and affection for his troops is evident on every page, and one can understand why he became one of the legendary commanders in Vietnam. ” And why he hated war. “As a glimpse into the abyss, into the bilious reality of war, it is a revelation,” Mr. Proffitt wrote. “As a reading experience, it’s a car crash of a book you are horrified by what you’re seeing, but you can’t take your eyes off it. ” On Nov. 14, 1965, Hal Moore, at the time a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, and about 450 troops from his First Battalion were ferried by helicopters to Landing Zone   a field near the Drang River in South Vietnam, six miles from the Cambodian border. They stumbled on more than they had bargained for: three North Vietnamese regular army regiments that at times outmanned them 12 to 1. “By midafternoon in   heat we were strongly outnumbered, taking heavy casualties in a cliffhanger fight to the finish,” the general wrote in a West Point yearbook. Bloody    combat ensued on a battlefield punctuated by termite mounds the size of pickup trucks and bodies strewn amid the elephant grass. Never leaving the combat zone and remaining in the thick of the fight, General Moore delivered on a vow that endeared him to his troops: “I’ll always be the first person on the battlefield, my boots will be the first boots on it, and I’ll be the last person off. I’ll never leave a body. ” Finally, reinforcements and the firepower of helicopter gunships,   and American 105 mm howitzers positioned several miles away turned the tide. “Unlike Custer,” General Moore said later, referring to Custer’s Last Stand in 1876 at the Little Bighorn, “we had major fire support. ” The American death toll at   was 79. As the reinforcements marched to a second landing zone named Albany, they suffered heavy casualties in an ambush that was largely covered up at the time. When the combat in both places ended, as many as 3, 000 North Vietnamese and 234 Americans were dead. By the end of November, the American toll in the Ia Drang Valley had risen to 305, branding it as the Valley of Death. “Every one of us thought at least once we were going to die there,” Mr. Galloway said in an interview on Monday. “There was only one man who thought for certain we were going to prevail, and that was Hal Moore. ” Harold Gregory Moore Jr. was born on Feb. 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Ky. then a city of about 2, 000, where his father was an insurance agent. His mother was the former Mary Crume. He was 15 when his father first suggested he consider West Point, provided he got a required recommendation from a United States senator. As a high school senior, though, all Hal was able to extract from Senator A. B. (Happy) Chandler was a patronage job in the Senate warehouse in Washington. By the time he graduated from George Washington University in 1942, though, World War II had begun, and more appointments to military academies were available. This time he was successful, making it to West Point and graduating in 1945. His wife, the former Julie Compton, died in 2004. In addition to his sons David and Stephen, he is survived by another son, Harold Gregory Moore III, known as Greg two daughters, Julie Moore Orlowski and Cecile Moore Rainey a sister, Betty Karp a brother, Ballard 12 grandchildren and four  . After West Point, General Moore served in the Korean War and in Europe. He was deployed to Vietnam in 1965 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for valor at Ia Drang. Returning to the United States, he was assigned to plan for the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam commanded Fort Ord in California, where he dealt with antiwar demonstrators, including Ms. Fonda and was named the Army’s deputy chief of staff for personnel in Washington. General Moore likened Ia Drang to the Spanish Civil War before World War II: a dress rehearsal for the tactics that both sides would employ for the rest of the war and a harbinger of a prolonged stalemate in seesaw battles over territory. “He never claimed that was an American victory, but he prevailed,” Mr. Galloway said. “At the end of the day they left and we still occupied the ground, although after we left they came back. ”",0
2800,Congressman Calls for Federal Probe into John Podesta’s Board Membership on Firms Linked to Russian Investors,"Citing investigative reporting by the Government Accountability Institute (GAI) and advance reporting by The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group, Rep. Louie Gohmert is calling for a congressional investigation into the connection between Hillary Clinton’s former campaign chairman, John Podesta, and Russia. [Podesta sat on the board of the   energy company alongside Russian officials who received $35 million from a   Russian government fund, Breitbart News reported last August, as revealed in a   GAI report titled “From Russia with Money: Hillary Clinton, the Russian Reset, and Cronyism. ”  Now Gohmert, the Texas Republican firebrand who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, says Podesta’s role in the   firm “certainly needs to be reviewed to see if there really is something nefarious going on with these activities. ” Podesta also sat on the executive board of an energy company, Joule Unlimited, which also received millions from a   Russian government fund. The longtime Democratic operative owned “75, 000 common shares” in Joule, which Podesta had transferred to a holding company called Leonidio LLC. According to the GAI report, “Two months after Podesta joined the board, Vladimir Putin’s Rusnano announced that it would invest up to one billion rubles into Joule Unlimited, which amounts to $35 million. That represents   of the entire amount of investment dollars Joule collected from 2007 to 2013. ” Furthermore, Joule board members also included senior Russian officials. Podesta had failed to fully disclose his position on Joule Unlimited’s board of directors and include it in his federal financial disclosures, as required by law, before he became President Obama’s senior adviser in January 2014. A federal lawsuit, The Daily Caller reports, cites Podesta’s role in funneling billions in devalued Russian currency into U. S.  tech companies: An ongoing federal lawsuit, Neas Ltd, v. Rusnano, which is now before the U. S. District Court for Northern California, suggests Podesta and others at Joule may have unwittingly assisted Rusnano in a scheme hatched to move billions of weak rubles into valuable U. S. dollars by parking them as “investments” in   companies in Boston and in Silicon Valley. Gohmert’s call for a federal probe into Podesta’s Russian ties comes amid a partisan push to link President Donald Trump and his aides to Russian   and collusion during the presidential campaign. However, evidence of collusion to advance Putin’s Russia started years before Trump announced his presidential bid. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton spearheaded U. S. involvement in a Russian government technology initiative called Skolkovo. The Russian government’s stated goal for Skolkovo, touted as “innovation city,” was to be the Russian equivalent of America’s Silicon Valley. Skolkovo housed more than 30, 000 workers in     facilities under Kremlin control. Despite the FBI and the U. S. Army’s warning that Putin could use Skolkovo to accelerate its military technological capabilities, Hillary Clinton’s State Department and her campaign manager developed alarming relationships with   entities.

2801,In the Chamber of Secrets: J.K. Rowling’s Net Worth - The New York Times,"In 2012, Forbes dropped J. K. Rowling after eight years on its authoritative billionaires list, saying high British taxes and large charitable contributions had eroded her fortune. Forbes may want to rethink that. Last weekend, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”  —   the first of a new, multifilm franchise, with a script by Ms. Rowling  —   opened in the United States to a strong $75 million weekend. (The international box office was close to another $150 million.) Hugely popular Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions have opened at Universal Studio theme parks in Orlando, Fla. Hollywood and Osaka, Japan, as well as a Potter attraction at Warner Bros. Studio Tour London. The   drama “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is a smash hit in London and is scheduled to open on Broadway in 2018. A book based on the play was an instant No. 1 best seller. Warner Bros. recently licensed the television rights to the Harry Potter films to NBCUniversal for as much as $250 million. Any estimate of Ms. Rowling’s fortune is at best informed speculation, and most previous attempts I’ve seen don’t seem very informed. Ms. Rowling is famously private, especially about her financial and business affairs. She denied being a billionaire after Forbes first anointed her, telling the television interviewer Katie Couric in 2005 that “I’ve got plenty of money, more money than I ever dreamed I would have. But I am not a billionaire. ” She has remained publicly silent on the subject since. So I set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune, not to invade her privacy but because she’s that    commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy  —   a role model. Not only has she made her fortune largely through her own wits and imagination, but she also pays taxes and gives generously to charity. At a time of bitter disputes over rising income inequality, no one seems to resent Ms. Rowling’s runaway success. “It’s an impressive story,” said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and an author of “It’s the Market: the   Rise in the Return to Top Talent,” a study of wealth generation in the digital age. “She struggled as a single mother,” he said. “Then, she created this amazing franchise. She had tremendous talent, and she’s reaping the rewards. People don’t mind that. What they resent is when chief executives get paid for failure. ” Ms. Rowling has also been backed by some   negotiating and marketing muscle  —   Scholastic, which published the Potter books Warner Bros. the studio behind the Potter films and now the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise and NBCUniversal, which opened the Wizarding World attractions at its theme parks. Neil Blair, a former Warner Bros. executive, has represented her and fiercely protected her interests since he founded the Blair Partnership, a literary agency, in 2011, with Ms. Rowling as his most prominent client. Mr. Blair did not respond to requests for comment. Along with other famous authors, entertainers and sports stars, Ms. Rowling has also benefited from globalization and technology advances, the same forces that have squeezed the working class. “Thirty and 40 years ago, entertainers and sports figures didn’t have that kind of money,” Professor Kaplan said. (He noted that Bob Hope was the only entertainer on the original Forbes 400, and he made most of his money in real estate.) “Thanks to globalization, the internet and social media, they can reach a much bigger market today,” he said. A close look at Ms. Rowling’s sources of income suggests that she’s worth more than $1 billion, even allowing for a large margin of error. I came up with the estimates by interviewing a range of publishing and entertainment executives and agents. Some of them have negotiated with Ms. Rowling’s representatives and knew what terms they were seeking. No one was willing to be identified because pretty much everyone hopes to do business with Ms. Rowling. “She’s a sacred cow,” one executive said. To start with the obvious, there’s the source of her wealth: The seven Harry Potter books have sold an estimated 450 million copies, with estimated total revenue of $7. 7 billion. At a standard 15 percent author’s royalty, she would have earned $1. 15 billion. These books continue to sell strongly years after they were first published. Ms. Rowling has presumably been able to negotiate better deals for her subsequent books, which include adult mysteries under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, published by a Little Brown imprint, as well as numerous Potter spinoffs. These works probably contributed at least another $50 million. Ms. Rowling’s deal with Warner Bros. is a closely guarded secret, but it has been reported that she sold the film rights to the first four Potter films for just $2 million. Nearly all such deals, though, also include a percentage of the net profits, which were substantial. The first four films grossed close to $3. 5 billion and generated an estimated $2. 5 billion in profit. If she managed to achieve a 10 percent net profit participation, that’s $250 million. The next four Potter films were far more lucrative, generating well over $4 billion in revenue. By then, she was one of the rare talents who probably had negotiated a deal providing her a percentage of a film’s gross revenue. At 10 percent, that’s another $400 million. She almost certainly, according to the people I spoke with, managed a similar deal for the “Fantastic Beasts” series. Even if the first film generates just $500 million in revenue, less than half the   Potter films, that adds another $50 million to her fortune, bringing the film total to $700 million. Warner negotiated Ms. Rowling’s theme park deals on her behalf. That deal with NBCUniversal is also secret, but she is one of the unusual examples of someone who is also a “consultant” and gets a percentage of the gate. (Steven Spielberg, the only other known example, gets 2 percent of ticket sales at Universal Studios.) She also received a   licensing fee estimated at $60 million to $80 million and annual development fees. Like Mr. Spielberg, Ms. Rowling also gets a percentage of gross sales of merchandise, food and beverages. NBCUniversal does not break out revenue from the Wizarding World attractions, but attendance has more than doubled since the first Harry Potter attraction opened in 2010. Last year, NBCUniversal’s parent, Comcast, said overall theme park revenue jumped more than 60 percent to $1. 4 billion. If half of that comes from Wizarding World, and Ms. Rowling gets 2 percent, then her take last year would have been $14 million. Since 2010, when the first attraction opened, I’d estimate she has earned at least $30 million on ticket sales, which would bring her total theme park earnings to roughly $100 million. NBCUniversal also bought exclusive television rights to the eight Harry Potter films this summer in a deal valued at as much as $250 million. Ms. Rowling presumably received a large piece of that, at least $125 million. That replaced a deal with Disney estimated to have been worth $50 million or more to her. That brings her total estimated earnings from books, movies, theme parks and television to more than $2. 2 billion. Assuming that she paid Britain’s top individual tax rate of 45 percent, she would have been left with $1. 2 billion. Ms. Rowling also has other income. She did not write the play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” but no doubt earned a licensing fee and is a profit participant.   hit shows can generate enormous income  —   the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has an estimated net worth of $1. 2 billion. She earns licensing fees on all   merchandise. She owns the   rights to her books, sold on her proprietary website, Pottermore. Pottermore loses money, but it said this week that it expected to earn a profit in 2017. And, of course, Ms. Rowling has substantial investment income and unrealized capital gains given the long stock market rally. An average 8 percent return on invested assets of $1 billion would generate $80 million a year, and it compounds. Ms. Rowling has given generously to charity  —   Forbes estimated a total of $160 million by the time it dropped her from its list in 2012  —   but there’s no indication that the contributions have even offset her investment income, let alone seriously dented her net worth. Whatever the precise size of her fortune, Ms. Rowling is enormously wealthy. In this postelection holiday season, maybe her   success is something everyone can feel warm about. “It’s not going to happen to everyone, but it’s an inspiration that if you work hard and have talent, really good things can happen,” Professor Kaplan said. “It’s kind of like her books: Good triumphs over evil. ”",0
2802,Federal Court Blocks Trump Admin’s Immigration Executive Order - Breitbart,"A second federal judge —  this one in Wisconsin —  on Friday blocked President Donald Trump’s new executive order (EO) on immigration travel, while the federal judge who blocked the first EO is reserving judgment on the revised EO. [Trump signed EO 13780 on Mar. 6, replacing his original order (EO 13769) temporarily restricting immigration from several   nations. Judge James Robart of the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the first EO. The San   U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit kept the TRO in place.  Lawsuits have also been filed against the new EO 13780. The plaintiff states in the original TRO lawsuit —  a growing list that currently includes Washington, Minnesota, and Oregon —  asked Robart to rule that the TRO blocking EO 13769 likewise applies to the new EO. Robart released an order Friday stating that none of the parties have properly filed new motions in that litigation  —   and that he will reserve judgment until there is a relevant motion and the legal issues have been fully briefed before his court. However, on that same day, Judge William Conley of the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin did issue a new TRO against the new EO, holding that the plaintiff in that new lawsuit had a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, and would suffer irreparable harm unless the court provided immediate relief. This new lawsuit in Wisconsin concerns a man with a family member in Syria who has applied for asylum and claims that EO 13780 is thwarting that asylum request. A TRO is a temporary emergency measure that typically lasts less than two weeks, only long enough to give a district court judge enough time to fully consider an urgent matter in a lawsuit. A TRO is only issued in extraordinary situations. Conley has ordered legal briefs filed on an expedited basis for the next stage of litigation and will hold a court hearing on Mar. 21 on whether to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction, a   remedy that could stay in place for however long it takes to reach a final decision on the legality of EO 13780. Although a TRO cannot be appealed, a preliminary injunction can, which could take either case quickly to the next level of the federal judiciary. The Washington case would go back to the Ninth Circuit, while the Wisconsin case would go to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago. The first case is Washington v. Trump, No. 2:   in the Western District of Washington. The second case is Doe v. Trump, No. 3:   in the Western District of Wisconsin. Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

2803,Collective Gridwork Fluctuations – Lisa Transcendence Brown,"Collective Gridwork Fluctuations 10/23/2016 
We are going through many fluctuations in the gridwork this month and these are challenging many as they are “moved” from one gridwork to the next… connected, disconnected, connected, disconnected… there are huge periods of template wipes where we go offline, disconnect and then come back up online… This is the strongest I’ve experienced this since June 2015. Huge disconnects, which need to occur so we can shift to a whole new collective timeline. 
If you are feeling this, then it’s continual re-calibrations in the gridwork, which you hold/link up to with your Crystalline LightBody Structure. 
A lot of people’s feelings are all over the place, whether subtly or loudly…. The more we exist as a soul, the more subtle this is. The more human, the more external/loud this is. There have been such huge energetic releases lately by collectives…. 
This month has been about re-calibrating our systems, massive physical upgrades for many as how we function is completely re-worked even more than before. 
To cleanse collective wounds for more love to emerge from within all, many must experience what they don’t want before they understand what’s important and the kundalini fire must be ignited to awaken the spirit/soul inside. This mass root chakra awakening that was triggered collectively in January 2016 has lit the fire, fueling the souls need to emerge from within. As collectives exit the old 3D matrix simulation and awaken from the slumber, all the suppression and victimhood must be cleared as each takes their power back from within. As chaos ensues for many to release, the more released, the more the gridwork is affected by the masses coming online, going back offline, coming back online… These fluctuations are affecting all of us, in our own ways. 
To understand, one must be totally connected inside and in-tune with their own energetic gridwork to be aware of what is what. While the more crystalline light we are, the less we are subjected to unconscious collectives, we are affected when our NEW Earth Gridwork is being re-calibrated with such intensity now. 
So, for those who feel disconnected, this is a part of the process as we clear old timelines and move/jump into new ones. We have to disconnect from anything that’s no longer in alignment/supporting our new existence here. The programs for this were held in the physical body/cellular structures and these continue immense re-sequencing and re-coding, because of these mega-frequency upgrades that we are experiencing every day now. 
As multi-dimension light beings, you can experience multiple emotions simultaneously, while not being bound by any of them. You can observe what your re-calibrations are and honor this, while not being affected by the transitional phases as much as before. Your mind is no longer dictated by the emotion you feel. You can be a peace and always feel the magic while something else cleanses/clears. You don’t shift out of alignment while your body/mind/emotions do their thing. It’s a process that you honor and understand through your presence and connection inside. You can feel disconnected yet not be totally disconnected…. for you know the adjustments are important to move you into your next phase of a more awesome reality…… 
The reason I write this is because if there is any human’ness left, the human aspect will go to judgement and this creates suffering inside. Let go of the judgment and be okay, accept whatever you are feeling or not feeling inside and choose how you desire to experience the phase you are going through as these huge shifts occur. Kindness and compassion towards yourself, will allow you to feel these for others too. Remember, you are evolving beyond human comprehension and you don’t always need to understand everything first…. it takes awhile….be patient and listen to your body, honor you and how you need to feel as you shift. Pull away if you need to, connect with others if you need to…. 
These are unprecedented vibrations we are in now. These are new territory for all. We don’t know until we experience, and those predicting can only predict according the the vibrations that they have access to thus far. No one can tell you what timeline you are going to be in, for every moment is a different vibration now. Vibrations create realities, so the moment you shift vibrationally, then your timeline changes. As you master what you are doing/creating/transmitting vibrationally, then you get to participate in which timelines you desire to activate to experience here. Some timelines are always a surprise, because there are always a gazillion that were a higher vibration than you had access to before. The faster we integrate, the faster we experience the highest one’s possible thus far. 
Now, we have connected back up and the Unified Field is stronger and at a much higher frequency than before. Collectively the gridwork is back online. We have super high frequencies continually now. Much is going on for everyone moving further into being responsible for the realities that they create. The backlash of unconsciousness is going to continue to be more visible as the physical reality becomes louder for those hearts and minds not open yet. The beauty and magnificence for intentionally transmitted conscious realities become more profoundly magical by the moment. The polarity continues out there, but it does not have to inside. The more in-tune and aligned one is, the softer and easier physical realities are. These higher vibrational realities are very soft, the exchanges are beyond beautiful when all is aligned. You will know when it is not, as you won’t be happy, inspired and in-joy the experience. Just the recognition gives you the ability to choose where you are going to focus your energy and attention for what you experience here. 
Get ready loves….. powerful energies is an understatement. For many of us, we are going through physical realignments more than normal, as our crystal bodies are embedded with deep sacred soul codes now. It’s not an emotional or mental experience anymore. It’s just physical re-calibrations and our physical bodies process energies much differently than before. We’ve moved beyond the heart and the head. Now the spine is the primary processing center, which is why so many are experiencing the nervous system overhauls. I’ll share more on this as we go. Bizarre is an understatement for our “new bodies”…. They require great care now. 
See you guys tomorrow. Sleep well and happy traveling! p.s. We entered Galactic Frequencies a bit ago as well. Not that these all aren’t, but we’ve achieved the overall frequency field-wise to be fully galactic right now. In-JOY these exquisite HOME frequencies loves! ♥",0
2804,"Your Thursday Evening Briefing: Golden State Warriors, Hillary Clinton, Prince - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Hillary Clinton launched a blistering attack on Donald Trump. She called his foreign policy ideas “dangerously incoherent” and said he could lead the country into war “just because somebody got under his very thin skin. ” But the Republican establishment continued closing ranks. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, finally endorsed Mr. Trump, and Karl Rove, who has called Mr. Trump “a complete idiot” has met with him. _____ 2. Federal regulators are trying to rein in the payday loan industry, which has trapped many   Americans in a cycle of debt. New rules that could go into effect next year include a limit on the number of times that borrowers can roll over their   loans into newer, pricier ones. Lenders could fight the constraints in court. _____ 3. The official cause of Prince’s death was an accidental overdose of a painkiller many times more powerful than heroin. The coroner’s report, delayed for weeks until a toxicology report could be completed, specified fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller given much of the blame for the high mortality rate of the opioid epidemic. _____ 4. The N. B. A. finals feature the same teams as they did last year, but this year’s series isn’t your basic rematch. The defending champion, the Golden State Warriors, and the Cleveland Cavaliers have both evolved, with the Cavaliers better equipped to match the Warriors’ shooting. But the Cavs didn’t show evidence of that in Game 1, when they lost,   despite limiting Stephen Curry, the Warriors’ guard, to just 11 points. _____ 5. Big news for opera fans: The Metropolitan Opera named a successor to James Levine, its first leadership transition in decades. The new guy is Yannick   41, widely regarded as a brilliant conductor. But the Met faces a long wait for his attention. He does not officially begin until the   season  —   and plans to remain as artistic director at the Philadelphia Orchestra. _____ 6. President François Hollande declared a natural disaster for the region around Paris, as days of torrential rain sent the Seine 18 feet above its typical level. The Louvre and Musée d’Orsay prepared to evacuate some of their masterpieces. The storm system, which caused flooding in much of central and northeastern France, also inundated southwestern Germany, killing at least nine. _____ 7. The former graduate student who fatally shot this professor at U. C. L. A. and then killed himself on Wednesday is suspected in another homicide. Police officers who searched his residence in Minnesota found a list of people he apparently intended to kill. Officers then found one of them, a woman, shot to death at her nearby home. _____ 8. Germany passed a symbolic resolution calling the killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in the early 20th century genocide. The move strains relations at a time when Europe needs Turkey’s help in managing the migrant crisis. The Turkish government denounced the vote as “null and void. ” _____ 9. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the   company Theranos and the rare   female billionaire, was ignominiously jettisoned from the heights of Forbes’s “richest” lists. The magazine sharply lowered its valuation of Theranos, noting questions about the accuracy of its tests and a welter of investigations, and put Ms. Holmes’s net value at zero  —   down from $4. 5 billion. _____ 10. A special neighborhood has been growing in the upper reaches of New York City’s skyscrapers. This week, our Magazine ascends into the rarefied living spaces, offices and construction sites above 800 feet. Its denizens are proud, sometimes rivalrous, occasionally poetic and, at least in one case, humble. “You realize how small you are and how big the world is,” said a man who sees the city from the 85th floor of 1 World Trade. _____ 11. And finally, there’s a show worth watching even higher than that. Thanks to a celestial alignment, Saturn will be visible all night. The best time to see it will be after midnight local time, when the ringed planet will hang highest. Look for a golden orb just to the left of Mars, a crimson dot. And Saturn will remain visible, if not as perfectly, through the summer. _____ Dolores Morrison contributed.  Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

2805,"Donald Trump, Interrupted. He Calls Flint Pastor Who Cut In ‘a Nervous Mess.’ - The New York Times","Donald J. Trump said on Thursday that the pastor who interrupted his remarks at an   church in Flint, Mich. was “a nervous mess” when she introduced him and that he thought “something was up” with her. During his visit to Bethel United Methodist Church on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, started to assail his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, for being a failure. As he spoke, the Rev. Faith Green Timmons came over to him and said, “Mr. Trump, I invited you here to thank us,” and added, “not make a political speech. ” Mr. Trump addressed the awkward exchange in an interview on Fox News on Thursday, suggesting that Pastor Timmons had a political agenda. “Everyone plays their games, it doesn’t bother me,” Mr. Trump said, claiming Pastor Timmons was shaking when she came up to him. He added: “She was so nervous, she was like a nervous mess. I figured something was up. ” Some conservatives defended Mr. Trump on Thursday, pointing to a Facebook post in which she wrote that the visit was an opportunity to educate Republican candidate as evidence that she was planning to embarrass him. While that post does not appear on her Facebook page, Pastor Timmons did address the controversy there on Wednesday night. “Had he stuck to what his camp claimed he came to do, we would not have had a problem!” she wrote. Mr. Trump has shown more discipline on the campaign trail in recent weeks, but his criticism of the pastor demonstrated that he is still willing to push back against perceived slights. Mr. Trump also allowed himself to belittle Mrs. Clinton’s recent illness at a rally on Wednesday night, suggesting that she could not stand for such an event and that she was probably “lying in bed. ” After the interruption at the church, Mr. Trump went on to discuss the economic situation in Flint. He said on Thursday that most of the people who attended the event at the church welcomed him warmly. “The audience was saying ‘let him speak, let him speak,’ ” Mr. Trump said. “The audience was so great. ” But a pool reporter who was traveling Mr. Trump disputed his account, describing a scene where several members of the audience actually heckled Mr. Trump and questioned him about reports that he had discriminated against black people as a landlord. According to the pool report, Pastor Timmons defended Mr. Trump and told the crowd that he was “a guest of my church and you will defend him. ” Mrs. Clinton, in North Carolina on Thursday, lamented Mr. Trump’s attack on Pastor Timmons, saying it was unwarranted. “He called her a nervous mess,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference. “That’s not only insulting, it’s dead wrong. ” She added: “She’s a rock for her community in trying times. She deserves better, and Flint deserves better  —   in fact, so does America. ”",0
2806,"U.S. Presses for Truce in Syria, With Its Larger Policy on Pause - The New York Times","HANGZHOU, China  —   The image of a    Syrian boy, dazed and bloodied after being rescued from an airstrike on   Aleppo, reverberated around the world last month, a harrowing reminder that five years after civil war broke out there, Syria remains a charnel house. But the reaction was more muted in Washington, where Syria has become a distant disaster rather than an urgent crisis. President Obama’s policy toward Syria has barely budged in the last year and shows no sign of change for the remainder of his term. The White House has faced little pressure over the issue, in part because Syria is getting scant attention on the campaign trail from either Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton. That frustrates many analysts because they believe that a shift in policy will come only when Mr. Obama has left office. “Given the tone of this campaign, I doubt the electorate will be presented with realistic and intelligible options, with respect to Syria,” said Frederic C. Hof, a former adviser on Syria in the administration. The lack of substantive political debate about Syria is all the more striking given that the Obama administration is engaged in an increasingly desperate effort to broker a deal with Russia for a   that would halt the rain of bombs on Aleppo. Those negotiations moved on Sunday to China, where Secretary of State John Kerry met for two hours with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, at a Group of 20 meeting. At one point, the State Department was confident enough to schedule a news conference, at which the two were supposed to announce a deal. But Mr. Kerry turned up alone, acknowledging that “a couple of tough issues” were still dividing them. “We’re not going to rush,” he said, “and we’re not going to do something that we think has less than a legitimate opportunity to get the job done. ” Mr. Kerry said he would stay in China another day to keep trying. But his boss, Mr. Obama, voiced skepticism. “If we do not get some   from the Russians on reducing the violence and easing the humanitarian crisis, then it’s difficult to see how we get to the next phase,” the president said after a meeting with the British prime minister, Theresa May, in Hangzhou. Whatever progress Mr. Kerry has made, officials said, could easily be unraveled by external events, whether a new offensive by Turkey or the Nusra Front  —   which until recently had publicly aligned itself with Al Qaeda  —   or intensified bombing raids by the government of President Bashar  . And it is clearer than ever that if Mr. Kerry’s latest attempt at diplomacy falls short, there is no Plan B. Mr. Obama, officials said, has become increasingly skeptical about one of the major fallback options advanced by officials in the administration: expanding military aid to rebels vetted by the United States to put more pressure on Mr. Assad to compromise. With Nusra fighters playing a more dominant role in the rebellion, they said, the president has deepened his resistance to providing the rebels with more powerful weapons. In October, Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, proposed enforcing a partial   zone over Syria to create safe zones for civilians in places like Aleppo. She has said little about the plan in recent months, and people familiar with her thinking say she now acknowledges that the complexity of the battlefield  —   with Russian planes flying raids  —   would make it far more difficult. Mrs. Clinton, these people said, would be open to other measures to ground Mr. Assad’s Air Force. They did not offer details, but officials in the Obama administration, including 51 State Department employees who signed a “dissent channel” memo on Syria, have pressed privately for the United States to carry out airstrikes to hit Mr. Assad’s planes on the ground and their runways. In another election season, these are the kinds of questions that would be hotly debated. But the foreign policy debate has instead revolved mainly around the fitness of the Republican nominee, Mr. Trump, to be commander in chief. Mrs. Clinton, analysts said, has other reasons for not being drawn out on Syria. “A clear imperative for the Clinton campaign is to stay as close as possible to President Obama,” Mr. Hof said. “That means neither looking for, nor emphasizing, areas of disagreement, such as Syria. ” And yet, Mrs. Clinton’s aides say, Syria remains a priority for her. At a private   in the Hamptons last week, Mrs. Clinton delivered, unprompted, a lengthy policy prescription for what to do in Syria, including a gentle critique of the Obama administration for not pursuing her original proposal of a   zone, according to a person who attended and described her remarks on the condition of anonymity. The views of Mrs. Clinton  —   and Mr. Trump, for that matter  —   are critical. As Andrew J. Tabler, an expert on Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted, “Everyone in the region is just waiting for the next U. S. administration. ” In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is persevering with his diplomacy, while the situation in Syria is growing ever murkier. A particular point of contention is the central role that the Nusra Front has played during the pitched battles against the Syrian military. The Nusra fighters are commingled with rebels supplied by the C. I. A. and other Arab nations. The Russians have used the presence of Nusra fighters to justify airstrikes around Aleppo, saying the city is an important front in its campaign against terrorism. The fact that the Nusra Front was not a party to past   agreements, allowing the group to continue its attacks on Syrian government troops during the fragile pauses in violence, has given added fuel to the Russian argument. The “marbling” of the various rebel groups with more extremist groups has been a sticking point in the negotiations. American officials insist that they give no support to Nusra fighters despite the group’s name change and split with Al Qaeda. “Nusra is Al Qaeda,” Mr. Kerry said. No name change, he said, “hides what it really is. ” The Russians have been pressing their advantage in recent months, bolstering Mr. Assad’s military as it claims more territory from the C. I. A.  rebels and the Nusra Front and gaining leverage as the diplomacy proceeds at a glacial pace. Still, both the United States and Russia have shown an inclination to dial back the temperature of a proxy war that, for the first time since Afghanistan in the 1980s, has seen fighters backed by the C. I. A. in a direct confrontation with the Russian military. “The   fight in eastern Syria is heating up, and our forces are right in the middle, in this instance some actually on the ground,” said Robert S. Ford, a former American ambassador to Syria. Military analysts say Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, would recognize the folly in waging an   war in Syria, and in having to prop up Mr. Assad indefinitely. Russia’s military successes in Syria since the campaign began last year, they said, could be solidified by a political settlement, and Moscow could gradually extricate itself from direct military involvement. Some outside analysts see Mr. Kerry’s determination to broker a   as driven by their assessment that the Russian offensive has reversed the fortunes of Mr. Assad’s military, sending the   rebels into retreat and owning a shrinking patch of territory in northern Syria. The back and forth of the conflict continues, with insurgents making major gains against the government in central Hama Province over the weekend. Any “cleareyed” interpretation of Mr. Kerry’s actions, said Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, would read this as a public admission that the United States is bowing out of continuing the proxy war against the Syrian Army, seeing a negotiated agreement as “the best means of saving what little is left of the moderate opposition. ” If he fails, though, Mr. Obama will be left with little more than the news release his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, issued last week, in which the White House took credit for achieving its goal of taking in 10, 000 refugees from Syria, more than a month ahead of schedule  —   but only a small fraction of the five million Syrians who have fled their country.",0
2807,How Siberia Became Part of Russia - Oleg Skripnik,"Citizen journalism with a punch How Siberia Became Part of Russia 
The conquest of Siberia by Russia took place in a relatively short period of time. How did it happen? Originally appeared at RBTH 
Siberia became a part of Russia with incredible speed. In 1585, the first Russian expedition attempting to cross the Eurasian continent perished beyond the Urals; only 54 years later, however, Russians reached the Pacific Ocean. 
The history of Russians in Siberia 
Russia's contact with Siberia's indigenous populations began long before the ill-fated military expedition to the Urals. The 14th-century Laurentian Codex, which is the oldest record of the history of Northern Russia, mentions Gurat Rogovich from Novgorod who went on an expedition to the ""Ugra lands” in the 11th century. According to Russian historian Sergei Solovyov, the ""great mountains and copper gaits"" mentioned in the Codex are the Urals. In a subsequent period, the Ushkuiniks — pirate warriors from Novgorod who traveled along the rivers in flat-bottomed boats — would often raid those territories. 
In 1483, Muscovite warriors went on a military campaign to the Urals, and in 1555, the Khanate of Sibir, an ethnically diverse Muslim state made up of indigenous Siberian tribes, became a vassal of the Russian tsar. However, in 1563, a new leader, Kuchum, became khan and reasserted the independence of the Khanate. ostrog.jpg The first full-fledged Russian colonization expedition to Siberia was Cossack Yermak's campaign against Kuchum in 1581.

The first full-fledged Russian colonization expedition to Siberia was Cossack Yermak's campaign against Kuchum in 1581. By that time, the khan had begun raiding bordering Russian lands. Yermak, who began his expedition with 540 Cossacks, gathered more troops as he moved further into Siberia, fighting local tribes and the khan’s forces along the way. In 1585, Kuchum’s men led a raid on Yermak’s camp and killed the Cossack leader and most of his soldiers. But it was too late to stop the colonization of Siberia. 
New Russian expeditions built forts in Siberia, which later evolved into large cities. In 1586, the city of Tyumen (current population 720,000) was founded; in 1604 — Tomsk (population: 570,000) and in 1628 — Krasnoyarsk, home to more than one million people today. 
Not a colony 
Unlike the British territories in North America, Siberia was not a colony. Russia did not divide its territories along such lines. The region just became a part of the expanding Russian Empire. The local elites were integrated into the Russian administrative systems. For example, Kuchum's son eventually signed a peace agreement, and his grandson became head of the Qasim Khanate, a Tatar vassal state of Russia. 
Experts believe that before the arrival of the Russians, 240,000-300,000 indigenous people lived in Siberia on a territory of 5 million square miles. The Siberian tribes fought fiercely against one another, and many of them accepted Russian rule as a way to avoid further bloodshed. However, the further east the Cossack explorers went, the more resistance they faced from those groups who wanted to preserve their independence. 
The Russian government used forts and garrisons to spread its power, but indigenous tribes attacked and burn the forts, which led to retaliatory strikes by the Cossacks. Folklorist Georgy Ergis says that in the legends of the Yakut people, Russians are described as ""people of battles and massacres."" 
The last holdouts 
The Chukchi were one of the most defiant indigenous people of Siberia. They fiercely fought the Cossacks and often even defeated them on occasion. The scale of the battles between the Chukchi and the Cossacks were not great — in one serious defeat on the Orlova River, the Russian forces lost 51 men — but eventually the imperial government had enough. In 1742, the tsar issued a decree: ""Attack the restless Chukchi with an armed hand; eradicate them completely."" surikov_1300.jpg Yermak's conquest of Siberia. Vasily Surikov. / Source: Wikipedia.org 
Like native groups in other parts of the world, the indigenous people of Siberia were vulnerable to diseases brought by Russian explorers. ""The new illnesses weakened and demoralized the indigenous population,"" historian John Richards wrote. ""They destroyed 80 percent of the Tungusic people and 44 percent of the Yukaghir people."" 
Nevertheless, the aim of Russia's expansion was not genocide or the enslavement of the Siberian peoples but to impose a tribute on them and include the new lands in the Russian Empire. Usually, Russians would resort to weapons only if their diplomatic efforts failed. Today approximately 10 percent of the population of Siberia is made up of native peoples. In the Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, for example, there are more ethnic Yakuts than Russians.",0
2808,"Automakers Knew of Takata Airbag Hazard for Years, Suit Says - The New York Times","At least four automakers knew for years that Takata’s airbags were dangerous and could rupture violently but continued to use those airbags in their vehicles to save on costs, lawyers representing victims of the defect asserted in a court document filed on Monday. The Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Takata’s   airbags has so far painted automakers as unwitting victims duped by a rogue supplier that manipulated safety data to hide a deadly defect, linked to at least 11 deaths and over 100 injuries in the United States. But the fresh allegations against Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota, made as part of a   lawsuit in Florida and based on company documents, point to a far deeper involvement by automakers that used Takata’s defective airbags for years. Honda vehemently denied the new allegations on Monday. The three other automakers either declined to comment or said a response would come through legal channels. Last summer, The New York Times reported indications that automakers, rather than being the victims of Takata’s missteps, had pressed their suppliers to put cost before all else. That report focused on General Motors, which is not named in the Florida case, though plaintiff lawyers said they were preparing to take action against the company. The defect has prompted the nation’s largest automotive recall ever, affecting nearly 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles. The plaintiffs’ filing came hours before Takata pleaded guilty, under a deal announced last month, to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data, a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing. Federal prosecutors also said last month that they had charged three Takata executives with fabricating test data and fined the Tokyo company $1 billion. “I deeply regret the circumstances that resulted in the agreement today,” Yoichiro Nomura, Takata’s chief executive, said at the federal court hearing in Detroit. The company’s actions were “completely unacceptable,” he said. “Takata is fully committed to ensuring such conduct never happens again,” he added. The allegations in the Florida case came in response to a court document filed by the automakers last week that pointed to Takata’s plea deal to argue that the supplier alone was culpable. But the plaintiffs, who could gain from suing the   automakers alongside Takata, argue that the automakers were more deeply involved in the handling of the defect. The fines and costs associated with the scandal have also taken a heavy financial toll on Takata, and it has been searching for a financial lifeline  —   possibly in the form of a white knight that would effectively take it over. One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, Kevin R. Dean, filed an objection to Takata’s plea deal on Monday in Detroit, arguing that the automakers were accomplices in the  . He urged the judge to reject the agreement and for the Justice Department to further investigate the automakers’ role. The plaintiffs have taken particular issue with the amount set aside for victims in Takata’s plea  —   a total of $125 million. In contrast, the automakers will have recourse to draw on an $850 million fund to offset continuing recall costs. Judge George Caram Steeh dismissed Mr. Dean’s objections, saying that Takata’s plea deal was in the best interest of the victims. He said any further action against the automakers should be pursued in civil court, and approved the plea deal as is. Randi Johnston, 26, of Farmington, Utah  —   who was injured in September 2015 when the airbag in her 2003 Honda Civic ruptured and metal shards struck her throat  —   attended the hearing and said afterward that she was shocked by the judge’s decision. The shards severed most of her vocal cords, leaving her able to speak only in a whisper. “I really don’t have any words right now,” said Ms. Johnston, a plaintiff in the Florida   case. The filing by the plaintiffs says emails and internal documents turned over by Honda show that in 1999 and 2000, the automaker was intimately involved in developing a problematic propellant, or explosive, used in Takata’s airbags. The propellant is housed in a steel container called the inflater, which in the Takata case can rupture, shooting metal fragments toward the car’s driver or passengers. That propellant, based on a volatile compound, raised concerns internally at Takata at the time, and long plagued the company’s engineers. During testing of Takata’s inflaters in 1999 and 2000 at Honda’s own facilities, at least two inflaters ruptured, according to the filing. Still, Honda pushed a particularly problematic configuration of the propellant over Takata’s objections, the filing said. Honda chose Takata’s airbags because of their relative “inexpensiveness,” the filing quoted Honda documents as saying. The first recalls of Takata’s airbags did not take place until almost a decade later, when Honda recalled 4, 000 vehicles in 2008. The Times has reported that Honda and Takata became aware in 2004 of an airbag explosion in a Honda Accord in Alabama that shot out metal fragments and injured the car’s driver. But the two companies deemed it “an anomaly” and did not issue a recall or seek the involvement of federal safety regulators. On Monday, Honda strongly y denied the allegations in the plaintiffs’ filing. When it installed Takata’s airbags, it said in a statement, “Honda reasonably believed, based on extensive test results provided by Takata, that they were safe. ” Honda said it believed it reacted “promptly and appropriately” in handling known airbag defects. It also said Takata’s airbags had not necessarily been cheaper than those of its competitors. “Sometimes they were more expensive, sometimes less,” the carmaker said. The filing also cites internal documents from Ford, Nissan and Toyota indicating that cost considerations influenced the automakers’ decision to adopt Takata’s airbags in the early 2000s, despite safety concerns. Toyota used Takata’s airbags “primarily” for cost reasons, even though the automaker had “large quality concerns” about Takata and considered the supplier’s quality performance “unacceptable,” the filing said. In 2003, a Takata inflater ruptured at a Toyota facility during testing, the court filing said. In 2005, Nissan began investigating the use of adding a drying agent to Takata’s airbag inflaters out of concern that exposure to moisture made the propellant particularly unstable, the filing says. Takata engineers had long known that its explosive was sensitive to moisture and adopted it despite internal concerns over its safety. Although patents show that its engineers have long struggled to tame the propellant, the company still maintains that the explosive can be stabilized to withstand moist conditions. Ford chose Takata’s inflaters over the objections of the automaker’s own inflater expert, who opposed the use of Takata’s propellant because of its instability and sensitivity to moisture, the filing said. Ford overrode those objections because it thought Takata was the only supplier that could provide the large number of inflaters Ford needed, the filing says. The filing says that Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota were also aware of instances of ruptures years before any recalls. It also mentions the German carmaker BMW and points to circumstantial evidence that BMW was similarly involved in what federal prosecutors, in their criminal complaint and in announcing the Takata   agreement, have called a  . But BMW has so far refused to submit documents in the case, the filing says. Representatives of Nissan and BMW said the companies could not comment on active cases. A Toyota representative also declined to comment. A Ford spokeswoman said the automaker would respond through appropriate legal channels.",0
2809,A Congressman Just Revealed Who Is Behind Comey’s Email Smear,"Comments 
Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) was the ranking minority member on the House Benghazi committee, so he knows firsthand how Republican witch-hunts work from up close personal experience. 
On CNN’s New Day this morning, he revealed the real motivation behind the FBI Director’s stunningly improper memo to Congress last week. 
“I don’t think the American people have a clue how hard the Republicans – particularly on my committee – have been on the FBI. This is a man – Director Comey – who they loved. They said he was the greatest thing in the world, very honorable.” 
“When he came out with the decision in July to not prosecute Mrs. Clinton, they suddenly turned against him. He knows that if he makes any misstep, the Republicans are going to be all over him and they’re going to try and bring harm to him. The thing that he did say in our hearing, and it stuck with me, is that ‘there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of Mrs. Clinton.'” 
That’s right, it is heavily implied that the FBI Director was so intimidated by Congressional Republicans and their innuendo machines that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the Trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support. 
Even Comey himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted , which is probably why CNN’s host began her interview with Congressman Cummings by saying, “Trump is lying about the email probe.” 
It hasn’t taken long for the roof to cave in on Comey’s career anyway, as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the FBI Director, his former boss to condemn his actions and for the Senate minority leader Harry Reid to demand answers from the FBI about the Republican candidate’s love affair with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. Reid’s point was not lost on the Congressman from Maryland who told CNN: 
“There has been a lot of information out there about Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and the Russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election. Members of Congress have asked for months, for the FBI to provide us with information if Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort and any elements of the Russian government have any coordination or connection with each other.” 
“They have not given us one syllable. So the question here is: Do we have a double standard here?” 
Of course there’s a double standard! 
The FBI has a responsibility to keep certain things secret, and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral democracy’s basic functioning. Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald pointed out cogently that Republican George W. Bush was investigated by the FBI in 1996, prior to running for President. Yet, the Clinton White House didn’t grab his FBI file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election. Otherwise, the FBI could decide to influence every election in America, and over time the FBI would pick the elected officials to their liking. 
Nothing can un-ring the bell that FBI Director Comey struck by letting loose his vague memo, but everyone can understand there is a sexist, partisan and blatant double standard at play by Republicans celebrating a vague memo, which only happened because an official sworn to be non-partisan decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system

2812,"A Turn In The Tide, Plus A Remarkable Look At Kennedy And Lincoln Assassinations","82 Views November 22, 2016 GOLD , KWN , KWN II King World News 
With continued uncertainty in global markets, are we seeing a turn in the tide? Plus a remarkable look at the Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations. 
A portion of today’s note from Art Cashin: On this day in 1963, the President of the United States, John Kennedy, was fatally shot while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas. His assassin (as you may have heard), was Lee Harvey Oswald, who fired from the Texas Schoolbook Depository. But…of course…you know all that! The event has been the subject of several movies, at least three national investigations, countless TV specials, a few hundred books, a million magazine articles and several theories. 
Having been exposed to all this, you are no doubt aware of all the trivia and oddities. There’s the Kennedy/Lincoln oddity. Jack Kennedy’s personal secretary was named Lincoln…just as Abe Lincoln’s secretary was named Kennedy. Both secretaries had pleaded with their bosses not to go to the place where they were shot. Both Presidents were succeeded by guys named Johnson. Both Johnson’s were Southerners and former Senators. Both Johnson’s were born 100 years apart. Kennedy and Lincoln were elected 100 years apart. John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald were born 100 years apart. Both Kennedy and Lincoln were assassinated on a Friday while sitting next to their wives. Booth shot Lincoln in a theater and tried to hide in a warehouse. Oswald was in a warehouse when he shot Kennedy, he then tried to hide in a theater. But…you recall all that. 
And, if you recall all that, you probably recall that it had been raining in Dallas earlier that morning. That, fearing a bad hair day, Jackie Kennedy suggested putting the bubble top on the limo. Then, when the sun came out, the Secret Service decided to skip the bubble top. 
So, then you also recall the reports that Oswald was considering dropping his plans the night before, but a buzz-off from the wife sent him back to his plot. Which means you certainly recall that the initial reports indicated that both the President and Vice President had been killed. And when they brought that report to Speaker John McCormack (still lunching in the House Dining Room), he froze at the thought that, at age 71, he was suddenly the President of the U.S. He froze so literally that he was unable even to stand up and only recovered when he was told LBJ was still alive. 
On the floor of the NYSE selling had begun before any headlines hit the tape. Months later I learned that was thanks to a savvy branch manager in Dallas. 
Since Presidents didn’t travel widely in 1963, he thought he would give much of the staff a treat by letting them go out and watch the Presidential parade. He kept a skeleton crew and sent the others out to watch the parade, which was due to pass about a block away. 
Rather shortly the gang wandered back in looking somewhat glum and disappointed. “What happened”?, asked the manager. “Parade got canceled” mumbled one of the returnees. 
After questioning, he learned that they had heard the sirens accelerate, the police lights flare and the “parade” suddenly turned right. They were many blocks away and obviously heard no shots. 
The savvy manager quickly asked – “Give me a bullish reason to pull a President out of a parade?”“It’s not to sign a tax bill – that could wait.” No one could think of a bullish reason to divert a parade. Then they mulled bearish reasons. No one thought assassination. But they did think natural disaster, nuclear accident, missile threat and scores of others. That’s when they decided something “bad” must have happened and began to sell. 
As their sell orders poured onto the floor and prices began to melt, they were asked by brokers – “Why the selling?” The response was the incomplete – “something about the President.” 
Sometime later, the first headline hit – “Shots reported fired at President’s motorcade!” The selling broadened an accelerated. Rather quickly the next headline – “President reported hit.” 
Exchange leaders hastily gathered and discussed closing the Exchange. Then the headline “Motorcade diverted to Parkland Hospital.” They rang the bell at 2:07 (EST). 
The Dow fell the equivalent of what would be 460 points today. When we reopened Tuesday, there was such a sigh of relief that power had been transferred and the Constitution still functioned, that a massive rally erupted, soaring the equivalent of 710 points. An unforgettable period. 
Overnight And Overseas – In Asia, most markets were better. Tokyo shrugged off the earthquake and closed moderately higher as did Shanghai and India. Hong Kong was sharply higher led by the Macau gang. Manila was odd man out, falling sharply, led by real estate. 
In Europe, the FTSE is red hot, led by mining stocks. On the continent, almost all markets are higher, but in somewhat lighter volume. 
The metals are percolating, with several trading “up limit”. The U.S. dollar is softer against the euro, the pound and even the Australian dollar. Crude soared overnight but is now backing off the highs. 
Consensus – Let’s watch crude, which reached a technical count target and has begun to ease back. A turn in the tide? Too early to tell. 
They are somewhat overbought but 19,000 may be too tempting a target. Stick with the drill – stay wary, alert and very, very nimble. May you and all your hold dear have your most wonderful Thanksgiving ever!

Wikileaks Email Reveals Clinton Campaign Eyeing Paul Ryan’s Relative for Supreme Court,"New Wikileaks email dumps have revealed massive corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta .

Ketanji Brown is the subject of the article. She is related to Paul Ryan by marriage and is a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. 
The email reads, “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair).” 
“Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show * The Wire *) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” 
Earlier this month, he even said he would not campaign for nor support his party’s nominee, Donald Trump . In fact, some supporters of Trump have theorized that Ryan was somehow behind or involved in the leak of the tape in which Trump made sexually crude comments about women. 
If you claim this is merely circumstantial, then I think there is no hope for you understanding just how corrupt DC has gotten, and this is the very Paul Ryan I warned you about in 2012, which everyone said was “so conservative.” Sadly, many didn’t listen and voted for liberal Mitt Romney and him. Perhaps Paul Ryan’s records and emails should be leaked and maybe we just might see that he’s willing to engage Hillary in a pay-to-play scheme .

2815,CBS News Awed by ’Relatively Reliable’ Smart Gun - Breitbart,"On January 12 CBS News was awed by a smart gun that is unlocked by a   fingerprint reader and is “relatively reliable. ”[The gun is a . 40 caliber Glock that MIT freshman Kai Kloepfer altered by making it inoperable unless activated by the swipe of an authorized user’s finger across the reader. On October 8 Breitbart News reported on this very gun as it was being developed by Kloepfer and he admitted that the smart gun’s reader will not work if the authorized user is wearing gloves or if his fingers are dirty. Smartphone users have the same problem. And Kloepfer’s fingerprint reader also failed to work if the authorized user’s fingers were wet —  just like a smartphone.  But CBS News is euphoric because the gun is “relatively reliable. ” And even though Kloepfer admitted the gun would not stop mass shootings, he believes his smart gun could save some lives. After all, Kloepfer says “it functions almost every single time. ” Lost on Kloepfer and CBS are all the additional lives that could be lost when the gun does not function —  those represent lives that could have been saved had the victim reached for a traditional handgun that goes bang every time. Moreover, think of all the additional sexual assaults that could occur in a scenario where a firearm is only “relatively reliable. ” Each fail could represent a horrific assault that could have ended if the victim had grabbed a classic,    revolver. It is interesting to note Kloepfer’s admission that his gun would not stop mass shootings, because this may actually be the strongest argument against smart guns that needs to be made. In the “theory” surrounding such guns, the authorized user of the weapon would be the person who passes a background check to acquire it. That would mean, the Orlando Pulse gunman —  who passed a background check for both his weapons —  would simply shoot up the place and slaughter innocents with his smart gun instead of a traditional firearm. It also would mean the San Bernardino attackers (December 2, 2016) the UCLA   gunman (June 1, 2016) the Umpqua Community College gunman (October 1, 2015) Allison Parker’s murderer (August 26, 2015) the Lafayette movie theater attacker (July 23, 2015) the Chattanooga attacker (July 16, 2015) the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attacker (Jun 17, 2015) the Muhammad Cartoon Contest attackers (May 3, 2014) the Las Vegas cop killers (June 9, 2015) the Santa Barbara attacker (May 23, 2014) the Fort Hood attacker (April 2, 2014) the Arapahoe High School attacker (December 13, 2013) the D. C. Navy Yard attacker (September 16, 2013) the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) Gabby Giffords’ attacker (January 8, 2011) the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) would have still been able to carry out their heinous acts because they all passed background checks for their weapons. The only difference would have been that they would have carried them out with a smart gun instead of a traditional firearm. Is CBS News listening? The point is clear —  even if smart guns worked they would not prevent evil people from carrying out evil deeds. The only thing that stops such people is an equal or greater amount of force coming at them when they try to carry out such foolishness. And that equal or greater amount of force is brought to bear by a good guy with a gun that goes bang every time, not a good guy with a gun that is “relatively reliable. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

2816,DB Feedbacker Claims He Was on B29s That Fire-Bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"DB Feedbacker Claims He Was on B29s That Fire-Bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki By Daily Bell Staff - November 18, 2016 
Well now!! i was a pilot of a B 29, on the raids of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. i am 96 years old. Yes we firebombed these cities as well as Tokyo. But there were A bombs dropped on the two cities in question. –ALPHAMEG feedback to DB article 
We’ve written numerous articles referring to the Pentagon’s lies about its nuclear program – both today and over the past 65 years or so. Now someone (see excerpt above) steps forward in a feedback to claim that indeed the Pentagon, along with millions of pages of military history, has not been telling the truth about Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
The feedback comes in response to our article, “If Trump Wants to Fix the ‘Disaster’ of the Pentagon, He Should Clean Up Its Nuclear Lies,” here. 
ALPHAMEG seems to be a longtime poster but we have no idea if he is 96 years old, or if he participated in a firebombing raid on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We have no idea if his feedback is a hoax, a joke or even a “mis-remembering.” 
However, in response to his lengthy feedback, we wrote the following: 
Do you realize the magnitude of the cover-up you are suggesting? Hiroshima and Nagasaki were fire-bombed? This negates 65 years of recorded history and changes the entire post-war narrative. Incredible! We have doubts about the severity of the radiation by the way. 
Regardless of any nuclear detonations, the idea Hiroshima and Nagasaki were firebombed radically changes the military narrative of the war’s end. But we and others have regularly offered this alternative retelling. 
Even a cursory investigation of America’s pre- and post-war nuclear program reveals a good many inconsistencies and outright lies. The Pentagon has manipulated its nuclear narrative from the very beginning, and so presumably have other countries who joined in later. You can see some of the articles we’ve written on elements of the Pentagon’s apparent nuclear fiction here, here and here . 
We would invite ALPHAMEG to send us a feedback elaborating on his fire-bombing raids over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Additionally, we would invite anyone else who has knowledge of these raids, or apparently participated in them or was involved with the Pentagon’s nuclear program in the early days, to write to us as well. 
The early days of the Pentagon’s nuclear program, especially, have surely not been properly related. Instead, we have been subject to reams of propaganda and obfuscation. This is especially sad when we consider how many millions of school-children in the 20th century spent time practicing ducking beneath their desks so they would know how to take shelter in case of a nearby atomic explosion. 
Of course the ramifications are far larger. The threat of nuclear warfare has profoundly shaped the psychology of billions of people and reshaped world history. If things are not as they seem, if the Pentagon and US government have substituted – at least in some cases – PR hype for truth-telling, we should do our best to find out more. It’s a most important effort. 
Conclusion: Only once we know, can we can make informed decisions about our place in the world – and understand more clearly how our society generally operates, and what can be done to change it for the better.",0
2817,‘Botched’ Repair to China’s Great Wall Provokes Outrage - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   The Great Wall of China. A stirring symbol of national pride whose overlapping sections span thousands of miles. A crumbling, melancholy monument to China’s imperial grandeur, so imposing that it inspired the stubborn myth that it is visible from the moon. One part of the Great Wall is even more visible now, but for very wrong reasons. Chinese preservationists, internet users and media commentators have been incensed this week after pictures showed that officials repaired part of the Great Wall in northeast China by slapping a white substance on top of the crumbling, weathered stones. A once unkempt, haunting    stretch of the wall now looks like a cement skateboarding lane dumped in the wilderness. The aesthetic impact was “not ideal,” the head of the provincial cultural relics bureau, Ding Hui, conceded, according to The Beijing News. “The repairs really don’t look good,” he said. Online, in newspapers and in interviews, many people, including experts on preserving the Great Wall, went much further in condemning the repairs to the section, in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province. “This was vandalism done in the name of preservation,” Liu Fusheng, a park officer from the county who first raised an outcry about the work, said in a telephone interview. “Even the little kids here know that this repair of the Great Wall was botched. ” Newspapers also lamented. The Beijing News, widely read in the capital, put the ruination of the ruins on its front page. “Where is there still any feel of that most beautiful wild Great Wall?” asked a commentary on a news website in central China. “It’s just a road winding through the hills. ” The repairs to the 1.  section of the wall were undertaken two years ago but came to wide attention only on Wednesday, after a local newspaper, The Huashang Morning News, described what had been done in the name of preservation. Mr. Liu, who helped draw notice to the work, said officials commissioned the repairs because they were worried the wall would collapse entirely from erosion and tourists walking on top. But in their haste, they wiped out the gnarled features that people had come to treasure, including the crenelations and towers, Mr. Liu said. “It’s like a head that’s lost its nose and ears,” said Mr. Liu, who has spent 15 years studying that section of the wall. Once the towers there had stone carvings, but they had fallen to the ground before the repairs, he said. “They didn’t restore the carvings back to where they belonged and just tossed them aside,” Mr. Liu said. “They used new bricks to fill in the original spots, and that saved a lot of expense. ” Construction of that section of the wall started in 1381, part of the sprawling web of fortifications and protections that Ming dynasty emperors built to ward off and police marauding nomads from the steppes. But now city dwellers who come to marvel at the isolated section of the wall in Suizhong County leave wondering why they bothered to travel so far to see a strip of cement, one villager living nearby told The Huashang Morning News. Officials have sworn that they did not use cement but rather a mix of lime and sand. Mr. Liu said they used both. In an interview, Dong Yaohui, a vice chairman of the China Great Wall Society and an expert on preserving the wall, called the attempt an “extremely rudimentary mistake. ” “Our principle in repairing the Great Wall is to minimize interference,” Mr. Dong said. “It’s not important whether you used lime or cement. Repairing it like this has wiped out all the culture and history. ” He said the society, a   organization, had been investigating damage along the entire Great Wall in the hope of spurring more action and stronger rules to preserve it. “There’s serious damage on many parts of the Great Wall,” he said. Cultural preservation officials responsible for that part of the wall defended their efforts. They said that the section was in danger of falling down, that the higher authorities approved their plans and that, like emergency dental work, beauty was not their priority. But since the uproar, the officials have conceded that the results were less than satisfactory. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage declared that it was time  —   two years after the repairs were done  —   to get to the bottom of what had gone wrong. “There will be no indulgence or conniving,” the administration said on its website. “Preserving the Great Wall is a sacred and unshirkable duty of all cultural relics workers. ” One villager who worked on the repairs two years ago saw a silver lining to the topping. “Now the top of the Great Wall has become a smooth pavement,” the villager, Zhang Yuwu, told The Huashang Morning News. “Except when it rains or snows, it’s a lot easier to walk on than before. ”",0
2818,"New England Patriots, Lady Gaga: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Donald Trump got into Twitter spats with the Iranian government, the University of California, Berkeley and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The issues ranged from missile tests to free speech to TV ratings. Speaking to a gathering of religious leaders in Washington, Mr. Trump brushed aside criticism and pledged to “destroy” a law restricting political speech by   churches, a potentially huge victory for the religious right. Late Thursday, he unexpectedly shifted his stance on Israel, warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on settlement construction. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited South Korea, his first stop on an Asia trip meant to reassure U. S. allies. But his visit was overshadowed by news of Mr. Trump’s testy phone call with the leader of Australia over the weekend. He clashed with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over an agreement to take in 1, 250 refugees. European leaders are gathering in Malta to discuss a crisis that has unexpectedly overtaken the agenda: the newly unpredictable United States. _____ 3. The administration amended its immigration order to allow U. S. entry to the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the U. S. government and military forces. But tumult over the order continued. The C. E. O. of Uber is stepping down from the president’s economic advisory council, saying he did not want his participation to be mistaken for support. Somali refugees in Kenya suddenly robbed of hope say they fear reprisals from   militants. And tens of thousands of people from the seven countries named in the executive order are effectively stuck in the U. S. because the State Department revoked their visas  —   without notifying them. _____ 4. It isn’t clear exactly what happened during the   standoff at a prison in Smyrna, Del. But when authorities used a backhoe to storm it at dawn, they found a hostage corrections officer unresponsive. He was quickly pronounced dead. Sgt. Steven Floyd had worked for the Department of Correction for 16 years. Details of his death were not released, and officials said they were treating all 120 inmates as suspects. A woman who worked as a counselor was not only unharmed, she had been protected by the inmates. The inmates’ grievances included allegations of mistreatment and a lack of educational and rehabilitation programs. _____ 5. Several community groups in Michigan and Minnesota are rejecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal aid to fight violent extremism. The money comes from Homeland Security grants to counter recruitment by terrorist and white supremacist groups. But the community groups are reacting to reports that the Trump administration is considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. _____  6. The Super Bowl, scheduled for Sunday night in Houston, is infused with national politics like never before. During Fox’s pregame telecast, Bill O’Reilly will interview Mr. Trump, who is a friend of the Patriots’ owner, coach and star player. There may be protests outside the stadium, or at the halftime show. Lady Gaga remained coy about the plans for her halftime performance. Fox and the N. F. L. are trying to keep game commercials apolitical. A lumber company’s ad depicting a mother and daughter who encounter a wall during an arduous journey north was nixed. _____ 7. Snapchat’s parent company filed paperwork for its public stock offering. While the filing does not indicate a price for an initial public offering, Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors. The move puts the company’s    chief executive, Evan Spiegel, in the spotlight. The chairman of Google is calling him the next Gates or Zuckerberg. _____ 8. “ . ” That’s our critic, describing “I Am Not Your Negro,” a new documentary about James Baldwin. “Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called ‘race relations’  —   white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English  —   this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. ” _____ 9.

2819,"ISIS Chainsaw Massacre: Nine Christian Youths Literally Sawed In Half, Accused Of Being Part Of Resistance Faction","Ads ISIS Chainsaw Massacre: Nine Christian Youths Literally Sawed In Half, Accused Of Being Part Of Resistance Faction Oct 27, 2016 Previous post 
Just when you thought ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) could not possibly develop more heinous ways of executing captives and prisoners, news out of the besieged city of Mosul, Iraq, reveals that a group of youths have been put to death in what amounts to nothing short of a chainsaw massacre. According to a source, nine Mosul youths were killed, all accused of belonging to an anti-ISIS resistance faction. 
Iraqi News reported August 31 that nine youths were convicted in an Islamic State sharia court of being members of a resistance faction in the city. They were summarily sentenced to a public execution. The nine were then tied to a pole Wednesday and cut in two with a chainsaw by ISIS militants. 
A source, who wished to remain anonymous, told Iraqi News , “The death sentence pronounced by ISIS sharia court stated that the men should be tied to an iron pole in the center of Tal Afar Square in Mosul and then sliced into two with an electric chainsaw.” 
The news outlet went on to note that ISIS has executed thousands of the city’s citizens since taking over Mosul in June 2014. Although allegations and charges have varied, most of those killed by the extremists were convicted of collaborating with enemy forces. 
The ISIS chainsaw killings come just a week after Islamic State extremists, after convicting six individuals of collaborating with the enemy in sharia court, killed the group by lowering the then still living men into boiling vats of tar . According to Inquisitr , the killings were also a public execution in Mosul, the carrying out of the sentence said to have been done to instill fear in the citizenry. 
It is doubtful that, given ISIS’ barbaric and often horrendous killing methods (not to mention the regularity with which killings are carried out), there was a need to instill fear in the local population. At best, the most that could have been accomplished was to reinforce the Islamic State’s willingness to kill any and all who oppose its authority.

2820,Would a Trump Presidency Mean Economic Disaster? Let’s Take a Look - The New York Times,"If Donald Trump were elected president and put in his stated policies, the United States would experience a lengthy recession, enormous job losses, much higher interest rates and diminished   growth prospects. At least, that is the conclusion of economists from Moody’s Analytics, a recent analysis highlighted by Hillary Clinton in a speech Tuesday. The Trump campaign has noted, accurately, that the lead author of the study, Mark Zandi, has informally advised the Obama administration and donated to Democratic campaigns. So what should a properly skeptical person think of the new report? Is it an accurate projection of what will happen to the economy if Mr. Trump’s preferred policies become law, or partisan  ? Given that a presidential campaign is a contest of competing forecasts, here’s how to think about the many predictions you’ll hear between now and November. A careful reading of the Moody’s report shows this: Its underlying assumptions about what Mr. Trump would do as president and how the effects of those policies would ripple through the economy are plausible, and squarely within the mainstream consensus view among economic forecasters about how the economy works. But the report also offers a big helping of false precision, giving exact numerical forecasts on effects that have vast amounts of uncertainty. It’s worth being skeptical about Moody’s projection that Trump’s policies would cause a 1. 5 percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2019. After all, forecasters aren’t even sure what G. D. P. growth will turn out to be in the second quarter of 2016, which ends in nine days. To forecast growth three years from now under an unknowable set of policies is more an intellectual exercise than anything exact. It’s not as useful to look at numerical projections that are almost certain to be wrong. Instead, let’s examine the analytical judgments underlying those numbers  —   and what they say about the direction of the economy in a Trump presidency: Tax cuts and larger deficits would stimulate at first, then cause a contraction. Mr. Trump has advocated major tax cuts, including reducing the highest income tax rate to 25 percent from 39. 6 percent and increasing the standard deduction for all filers. On spending, he has said he would maintain the military, Social Security and Medicare, and raise spending on veterans health care. These actions would stimulate the economy at first  —   the Moody’s projection has stronger growth in 2017 in a Trump administration than in a baseline case. But over time they would translate to higher deficits that would push interest rates much higher and crowd out other activity in the economy, given that they forecast the economy will be near its full potential when the next president takes office in January 2017. Moody’s predicts that Trump policies would push   Treasury bond yields to 8. 6 percent in 2018, compared with 1. 6 percent today and 3 percent in their base case  —   leading to a contraction in business investment, housing and consumer spending. The money the government would need to borrow to fund a much larger deficit would squeeze out business investment, housing and consumer spending. Mass deportations would be a negative supply shock. The simple version of this is that if there are fewer workers in the United States because the Trump administration deports millions of undocumented immigrants or makes life unpleasant enough for them that they leave voluntarily, the nations’s economic output would fall. As immigrants leave, the Moody’s researchers write, employers will struggle to fill the vacated jobs. “Many of these positions will go unfilled, because, by the time the Trump administration is underway, the U. S. is expected to be at full employment, meaning there will be no slack labor out of which to hire workers. ” Some businesses that are heavily reliant on immigrant labor would close. To the degree the labor shortage drives up wages, it would be counteracted by Federal Reserve interest rate increases to try to slow the economy and combat inflation. Trade wars would raise prices and reduce exports. The researchers assume a Trump administration would slap a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports and a 35 percent one on Mexican imports, which in the Moody’s model raises overall consumer prices by 3 percent. Meanwhile, they figure that a retaliatory response from China and Mexico would result in new tariffs and lower American exports to those countries, reducing economic activity. And higher interest rates in the United States and a sense of global uncertainty around a potential trade war would drive up the dollar, making all United States exporters less competitive. These underlying assumptions, while built on a large body of economic research, involve some guesswork and are at least debatable. Conservatives have long argued that lower taxes on the wealthy will generate more investment and economic activity, which would offset some of the increased deficits evident in the Moody’s model. Immigration skeptics might argue that an exit of undocumented immigrants would drive up wages and would pull more   workers into the labor force who are currently out of it. Perhaps Mr. Trump’s plans for tough negotiation with China and Mexico really would yield new, more favorable arrangements that don’t create import inflation or a trade war that reduces exports. But while the predictions of a recession and slower   growth got all the attention in the new report, understanding why these particular economic forecasters see these effects is more useful. And there’s a lesson there in making sense of any forecast or analysis of a candidate’s policies: Focus less on the conclusion, and more on how the researcher got there.",0

2822,Monsanto Weed Killer Roundup Faces New Doubts on Safety in Unsealed Documents - The New York Times,"The reputation of Roundup, whose active ingredient is the world’s most widely used weed killer, took a hit on Tuesday when a federal court unsealed documents raising questions about its safety and the research practices of its manufacturer, the chemical giant Monsanto. Roundup and similar products are used around the world on everything from row crops to home gardens. It is Monsanto’s flagship product, and   research has long found it to be relatively safe. A case in federal court in San Francisco has challenged that conclusion, building on the findings of an international panel that claimed Roundup’s main ingredient might cause cancer. The court documents included Monsanto’s internal emails and email traffic between the company and federal regulators. The records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The documents also revealed that there was some disagreement within the E. P. A. over its own safety assessment. The files were unsealed by Judge Vince Chhabria, who is presiding over litigation brought by people who claim to have developed  ’s lymphoma as a result of exposure to glyphosate. The litigation was touched off by a determination made nearly two years ago by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a branch of the World Health Organization, that glyphosate was a probable carcinogen, citing research linking it to  ’s lymphoma. Court records show that Monsanto was tipped off to the determination by a deputy division director at the E. P. A. Jess Rowland, months beforehand. That led the company to prepare a public relations assault on the finding well in advance of its publication. Monsanto executives, in their internal email traffic, also said Mr. Rowland had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review. Dan Jenkins, a Monsanto executive, said in an email in 2015 that Mr. Rowland, referring to the other agency’s potential review, had told him, “If I can kill this, I should get a medal. ” The review never took place. In another email, Mr. Jenkins noted to a colleague that Mr. Rowland was planning to retire and said he “could be useful as we move forward with ongoing glyphosate defense. ” The safety of glyphosate is not settled science. A number of agencies, including the European Food Safety Agency and the E. P. A. have disagreed with the international cancer agency, playing down concerns of a cancer risk, and Monsanto has vigorously defended glyphosate. But the court records also reveal a level of debate within the E. P. A. The agency’s Office of Research and Development raised some concern about the robustness of an assessment carried out by the agency’s Office of Pesticide Programs, where Mr. Rowland was a senior official at the time, and recommended in December 2015 that it take steps to “strengthen” its “human health assessment. ” In a statement, Monsanto said, “Glyphosate is not a carcinogen. ” It added: “The allegation that glyphosate can cause cancer in humans is inconsistent with decades of comprehensive safety reviews by the leading regulatory authorities around the world. The plaintiffs have submitted isolated documents that are taken out of context. ” The E. P. A. had no immediate comment, and Mr. Rowland could not be reached immediately. Monsanto also rebutted suggestions that the disclosures highlighted concerns that the academic research it underwrites is compromised. Monsanto frequently cites such research to back up its safety claims on Roundup and pesticides. In one email unsealed Tuesday, William F. Heydens, a Monsanto executive, told other company officials that they could ghostwrite research on glyphosate by hiring academics to put their names on papers that were actually written by Monsanto. “We would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit  sign their names so to speak,” Mr. Heydens wrote, citing a previous instance in which he said the company had done this. Asked about the exchange, Monsanto said in a second statement that its “scientists did not ghostwrite the paper” that was referred to or previous work, adding that a paper that eventually appeared “underwent the journal’s rigorous peer review process before it was published. ” David Kirkland, one of the scientists mentioned in the email, said in an interview, “I would not publish a document that had been written by someone else. ” He added, “We had no interaction with Monsanto at all during the process of reviewing the data and writing the papers. ” The disclosures are the latest to raise concerns about the integrity of academic research financed by agrochemical companies. Last year, a review by The New York Times showed how the industry can manipulate academic research or misstate findings. Declarations of interest included in a   paper on glyphosate that appeared in the journal Critical Reviews in Toxicology said panel members were recruited by a consulting firm. Email traffic made public shows that Monsanto officials discussed and debated scientists who should be considered, and shaped the project. “I think it’s important that people hold Monsanto accountable when they say one thing and it’s completely contradicted by very frank internal documents,” said Timothy Litzenburg of the Miller Firm, one of the law firms handling the litigation. The issue of glyphosate’s safety is not a trivial one for Americans. Over the last two decades, Monsanto has genetically   corn, soybeans and cotton so it is much easier to spray them with the weed killer, and some 220 million pounds of glyphosate were used in 2015 in the United States. “People should know that there are superb scientists in the world who would disagree with Monsanto and some of the regulatory agencies’ evaluations, and even E. P. A. has disagreement within the agency,” said Robin Greenwald, a lawyer at Weitz  Luxenberg, which is also involved in the litigation. “Even in the E. U. there’s been a lot of disagreement among the countries. It’s not so simple as Monsanto makes it out to be. ”",0

2825,"Report: Russian, U.S. Jets Have Close Encounter Over Syria","By wmw_admin on October 29, 2016 Morgan Chalfant — Washington Free Beacon Oct 28, 2016 
U.S. and Russian military jets reportedly had a close encounter in Syrian airspace several days ago. 
AFP, citing U.S. officials, reported Friday morning that a Russian fighter jet flew dangerously close to a U.S. jet in airspace over eastern Syria on Oct. 17, nearly two weeks prior. 
A Russian jet escorting a larger spy aircraft flew into the vicinity of the U.S. warplane, moving to “inside half a mile” from the American plane, according to Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigian. #BREAKING Russian, US jets had near miss over Syria: US officials 
— AFP news agency (@AFP) October 28, 2016 
“I would attribute it to not having the necessary situational awareness given all those platforms operating together,” Harrigian further stated, according to AFP. 
An unnamed defense official said that the Russian aircraft “was close enough you could feel the jet wash of the plane passing by.” 
The U.S. and Russia have set up a line of communication to avoid clashes in airspace over Syria. In this incident, the American pilot reportedly attempted to communicate with the Russian warplane but was unsuccessful. 
Harrigian also reported an increase in close encounters between American and Russian military jets in the region in the past six weeks. He said that Russian jets have intentionally flown close to U.S. warplanes about once every 10 days. 
Tensions between the United States and Russia have been exacerbated over the situation in Syria in recent weeks, following a failed ceasefire deal and suspension of communications between the two countries. 
Russian and Syrian jets have bombed civilians and U.S.-backed rebels in Aleppo, drawing ire from America. Moscow has threatened to shoot down coalition jets that target Bashar al-Assad’s forces with air strikes in Syria, after reports indicated that the Obama administration would consider targeting Syrian government forces with strikes.",0
2826,Amazon Looks to ’Take Away the Need to Ever Use a Cable Box Again’ with Integrated Fire TV Sets - Breitbart,"Amazon will start to ship television sets with Fire TV built in as early as next month, according to a report. [The TV sets, which support “4K video, and pack a   processor, 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage for apps,” will replace Amazon Fire sticks and boxes and are currently available to preorder in various sizes.  “Amazon and Element as well as Westinghouse first announced Fire   TV sets at CES in Las Vegas earlier this year,” reported Variety on Tuesday. “Now, the companies shared a number of additional details, including pricing. Element’s   Fire TV Edition will retail for $449. A   model and a   model will cost $549 and $649, respectively, and a $  model will retail for $899. ” The sets also “directly integrate    broadcast TV,” allowing users to switch between live shows and   streaming services. “Right now, all of this only works with    television, but Gupta said that the ultimate goal was to integrate with streaming TV providers like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue as well,” continued Variety, adding that it will eventually “take away the need to ever use a cable box again. ” “It will have a longer life cycle than a regular smart TV,” said Amazon’s Smart TV Vice President, Sandeep Gupta. “We see Fire TV Edition as a true cord cutter solution. ” Google are also expanding into the television industry with their upcoming YouTube TV package. The package will act as a “skinny bundle” to compete with current cable television providers and will cost just $35 per month. The monthly fee will get users “6 accounts, 3 of which can be used to stream live TV concurrently, and access to 40 different networks, including ‘ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, regional sports networks, and dozens of popular cable networks,’” while it will also use an A. I. searching system similar to Netflix. Customers will, however, be forced to watch commercials on many programs that are not live and are recorded. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

2827,Hans Von Spakovsky: Democrats Oppose Jeff Sessions Because He’ll Enforce Our Immigration Laws,"Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation, formerly an attorney with the Department of Justice, said he expected “fireworks” at the confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily. [“What’s going on here is that, look, professionally, Jeff Sessions has the perfect background to be the U. S. Attorney General  —   from being a line prosecutor working for the Justice Department, to being a U. S. attorney, to being the state Attorney General in Alabama. Professionally, he’s got the perfect background for this,” von Spakovsky said.  “But Democrats really don’t like him because of his views on issues,” he continued. “For example, they really don’t want someone who’s actually going to enforce our immigration laws. They’ve been giving him a hard time in the civil rights area too, even though many of their criticisms really have been false. So they’re going to give him a very hard time, even if they eventually, perhaps, on the Democratic side will vote for him, because they have to make their liberal advocacy groups that support them happy that they gave him a hard time. ” SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam suggested that Democrats would be “uncouth” to Sessions to gin up donations and political support from their base. “Yes, because I think that’s going to anger the same people all around the country that voted for Donald Trump,” von Spakovsky agreed. “And you can tell how this is going because after Sessions testifies, they’re actually pulling up a panel of other witnesses. And who have the Democrats called? They have called the director of the ACLU, the president of the NAACP, and a woman from an LGBT group. All of them are simply going to be critical of him on issues, not his professional background  —   and that’s not a reason to not vote for him for confirmation. ” Kassam asked von Spakovsky to discuss his recent article about how Democrats have tried to portray strong action against voter fraud by Sessions as a nefarious attempt to suppress the minority vote. “When he was a U. S. attorney in Alabama, he prosecuted three local civil rights activists who were accused of voter fraud,” von Spakovsky recalled. “They were stealing absentee ballots from voters  —   black voters  —   and changing the votes. Unfortunately, the jury found them innocent, and so ever since then, he’s been accused of having pushed this for racist reasons he was trying to suppress the black vote. ”  “What all those stories leave out is that the reason this case was prosecuted was because local black voters and local black candidates called the FBI and called Sessions, saying, ‘Look, we think our vote is being stolen by these other black candidates,’” he noted. There was a power struggle going on inside the Democratic party. This was an   county, in these races. The federal grand jury was presented with overwhelming evidence that these three defendants were stealing ballots. ”  “Yeah, a jury found them innocent, but I actually found and interviewed the   career Justice Department lawyer who worked on this case, and he said it was clearly a case of jury nullification,” von Spakovsky said. “These folks were local activists, and the jury wasn’t going to find them guilty no matter what they did. One quick example: a family of six people,   testified in court that one of the defendants had changed their votes without their permission, and yet the jury didn’t believe them. They, instead, believed the defendant when he said, ‘Well, yeah, I did change their votes, but I had their permission to do it. ’” As Kassam put it, Sessions was “opposing the exploitation of minority groups, and this is now being used as a cudgel against him. ” “The NAACP came down to this case, and instead of wanting to get these   convicted, they actually provided lawyers to defend these folks in the lawsuit,” von Spakovsky marveled. He said the Democrats’ position was a combination of instinctively viewing “old white guy” Sessions as a racist in a story of conflict with black activists and crass political opportunism by senior Democrats who know perfectly well what really happened in the vote fraud case. “Their attitude towards any voter fraud prosecutions has always been: if the defendants are black, well, you must be doing it for racist reasons,” he noted. “Remember, we saw that in the New Black Panther story out of Philly in 2008, when Eric Holder came in and immediately dismissed the voter intimidation case against them, despite the overwhelming evidence that the Black Panthers had been intimidating voters and poll watchers. It was dismissed by the Obama Justice Department because they didn’t believe that black defendants should be prosecuted. They don’t believe in the   enforcement of the voting and election law. ” As to Sessions’ prospects of making it through the confirmation process, von Spakovsky pointed out that “there’s not a single Republican that has said he’s going to vote against Sessions. ” “I really think the worst that can happen is the Democrats put up a histrionic, almost hysterical, raising of all these issues, make all these false claims against Sessions  —   but in the end, like I said, the Republicans have the majority, and I think they’re going to be able to vote him in,” he predicted.

2828,Julian Assange Ends The Suspense: “The Source Of Hacked Emails Is Not Russia”,"
With countless hours of media, and Clinton campaign, speculation and accusations that the source of hacked Wikileaks Democratic emails including the Podesta files, is none other than Russian president Vladimir Putin, either directly or indirectly, Julian Assange has decided to close the book on that particular loose end, and as RT reports , in a John Pilger Special, to be broadcast by RT on Saturday courtesy of Dartmouth Films, Assange categorically denied that the troves of US Democratic Party and Clinton work and staff emails released this year have come from the Russian government. 
“The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That’s false – we can say that the Russian government is not the source,” Assange told the veteran Australian broadcaster as part of a 25-minute interview.
Assange spoke with Pilger at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has been for four years, and accused the US presidential candidate of being a pawn of behind-the-scenes interests, and voiced doubts about her physical fitness to take charge of the White House.
“Hillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick – for example faint – as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.”
Over the past nine months, WikiLeaks uploaded over 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton’s private email server, while she was Secretary of State. This was followed by nearly 20,000 emails sent to and by members of the US Democratic National Committee, exposing the party leadership’s dismissive attitude to Bernie Sanders, and his outsider primaries campaign.
Finally, last month, WikiLeaks posted over 50,000 emails connected to John Podesta, Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, and a close associate of the current presidential frontrunner.
A preview of the upcoming interview is below. The Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence posted a joint statement in October, claiming they were “confident” that the Russian government “directed” this year’s leaks. Moscow has rejected the accusation, with presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov calling the claims “nonsense,” while Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the “public bickering with Russia” before the US election is probably a “smokescreen” to draw the voters’ attention away from serious domestic issues.

2829,Leaked Images Show Illegals Casually Strolling Across Open Border,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:31 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments A series of leaked images reveal how groups of illegal immigrants continue to flow over the Texas border in unprecedented numbers. The lack of physical barrier and real border security allows human smugglers and their cargo to simply wade across the shallow waters of the Rio Grande. 

Breitbart Texas exclusively obtained leaked law enforcement images of a crossing attempt by human smugglers in an area between Del Rio and Laredo, Texas. According to various sources on both sides of the border, the area where the crossing took place is under the control of the Los Zetas cartel . 

The black and white images were taken using night vision equipment in order to record the smuggling operations. The images reveal that human smugglers appear to operate with little concern due to the lack of presence by U.S. law enforcement. 
The human smugglers can be seen driving in SUVs to the Mexican side of the river before disembarking. The illegal immigrants then hoist their belongings over their heads and proceed to wade through the water onto the U.S. side of the border where more human smugglers await. 
Border Patrol Agent Shawn Moran, speaking to Breitbart Texas in his role as National Border Patrol Council Vice President, cautioned that many would assume the fact that technology identified these unknown aliens crossing does not mean they were apprehended. 

Agent Moran stated, “We have a manpower shortage and have seen instances where were could only respond to 40 percent of the crossings we knew were occurring. The technology is great at letting us know a crossing is occurring, but what good is it if we don’t have the agents to respond.” 
A recent report from Breitbart Texas showed illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico and entering the U.S. inside the city limits of Laredo, Texas. In that case, the foreigners were able to overcome U.S. border security with nothing more than a breaststroke and a cheap inner tube . 
As Breitbart Texas recently reported, the numbers of illegal immigrant families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border from Mexico are up dramatically in the federal Fiscal Year 2016. The apprehension of families has increased by 95 percent over FY 2015 numbers to 77,674 according to a report from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) crossing the border hit a near record total of 59,692. According to a previous Breitbart Texas report, the numbers of illegal immigrants have been dramatically increasing in the three months leading up to the election.

2830,"Fifth Avenue in Front of Trump Tower Will Stay Open, de Blasio Says - The New York Times","The stretch of Fifth Avenue in front of   Donald J. Trump’s home in Trump Tower will remain open to vehicle traffic for the foreseeable future, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Friday. Since the election, the   tower, on Fifth Avenue between East 56th and 57th Streets, has drawn thousands of protesters and gawkers, swelling congestion in that area of Midtown Manhattan. Officials from the New York Police Department and the Secret Service have been discussing how to balance the security of Mr. Trump with the need to keep pedestrian and vehicle traffic flowing, particularly as the holiday season brings crowds to nearby Rockefeller Center and Radio City Musical Hall. The mayor said that security planners were focused on the period between now and the inauguration on Jan. 20, but that they also were preparing for the prospect that Mr. Trump would be a regular presence in the city during his term. “We have never had a situation where the president of the United States would be here on such a regular basis,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. “But the N. Y. P. D. is up to the challenge, and the City of New York is up to the challenge. ” How much time Mr. Trump will spend in his Manhattan residence during his presidency is unclear. As a candidate, he often flew back to New York at night, just to be at home. And he has indicated that as president he would like to be in the city when possible. So far, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has made the tower his headquarters as he prepares for the presidency and assembles his administration. Advisers, emissaries,   and prospective cabinet members can be seen crossing the marble lobby throughout the day. At the news conference, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said his administration intended to seek reimbursement from the federal government for the substantial overtime costs the city is incurring. “We think it’s a valid situation to turn to the federal government for the maximum reimbursement of the costs,” he said. Among the Secret Service agents and police officials handling presidential security at Trump Tower, there is a range of opinions regarding where Mr. Trump should spend his time. There is almost universal agreement that the  ’s penthouse suite in Trump Tower poses more formidable security challenges than most presidential homes. Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who has protected both President George W. Bush and President Obama, said that compared with the residences of past presidents “the penthouse is going to be tough,” particularly if, while president, Mr. Trump decided to spend significant time there. Mr. Trump’s residence, at the top of the   building, is generally reached by elevator, which poses problems in terms of getting in and out quickly. Some surrounding buildings have clear views to Trump Tower, which will need to be monitored by the Secret Service. And there is the challenge of the dense Midtown airspace, and the need to quickly try to intercept any aircraft that might veer too close. Still, Mr. Bongino said that during presidential trips abroad, the Secret Service confronts environments far more threatening than Midtown. Arnette F. Heintze, who served on the permanent details of two presidents and was later a spokesman for the Secret Service, said   environments were not unfamiliar. “Him living in a   in Midtown Manhattan, the Service does protective operations in and out of that environment all the time,” he said. “Once the president makes a decision they’re doing something it’s the Service’s job to make that secure, regardless of the situation, whether a   a war zone or the middle of Fifth Avenue. ” “We accept a president for who they are and their particular lifestyle and nuances,” added Mr. Heintze, who is currently the chief executive of Hillard Heintze, a security firm. While Fifth Avenue remains open to vehicle traffic for now, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York office, David Beach, did note that security arrangements could change at any moment. “As a matter of practice, security plans will evolve to address emerging threats,” he said at the news conference, speaking after the mayor. So far, Fifth Avenue has been closed to vehicle traffic on only three occasions in the past two weeks, to allow for the installation of concrete barriers and because of demonstrations opposing the  . The Police Department said that last week there were seven arrests in the vicinity of Trump Tower. Elsewhere in the city, there were 70 arrests related to Mr. Trump’s victory and the demonstrations it prompted, according to statistics provided by the department. Trump Tower has long been open to the public, and the status of both the building and the sidewalk in front of it is unclear. While shoppers and employees heading to the luxury stores are generally permitted to pass the police checkpoints at the street corner and make their way toward the Gucci Store or Tiffany on the block, others are turned away and told to walk on the opposite side of the street. At the news conference, Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill said that sidewalk and the building itself would remain open to pedestrians “who need or want access. ” “People will be allowed access into that building, but there will be a screening point,” Mr. O’Neill said.",0
2831,GOP has a day of reckoning coming,"License DMCA The face of the Republican Party. 
There is a light at the end of this tunnel called a presidential election campaign and, if the gods are not playing a cruel trick on us, that light is not on an engine with TRUMP emblazoned on its sides. In any event, the end is near and I am as weary of writing about this ugly affair probably as you are of reading about it. 
The problem is, that's all most of the mainstream and social media care to talk about these days. In case you missed the other news: 1) The Cubs and Indians are in the World Series. 2) Heavily armed police in North Dakota attacked hundreds of protesters who joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe trying to block construction of a pipeline they say threatens water supplies and sacred sites. 3) Soupy Sales, master of the pie-in-the-face, died. And 4) Tim Tebow is apparently just as good at baseball as he was at playing quarterback in the NFL. 
But really, the only thing the media want to talk about are Donald Trump's repeated claims that the election is rigged and that the press -- meaning all the news outlets who report accurately on his words and actions -- lie. 
These are claims that losers and demagogues resort to when everything else -- lies, threats, lies, threats, lies, threats -- fails. Honestly, it is disheartening to feel a need to point out to, apparently, millions of Americans, that Trump's claims are nonsense. It is even more disheartening to realize that many of the people who still support his candidacy don't seem to care. There is a major issue to address some day soon in that. 
Meanwhile, as to his two claims: Voter fraud is virtually non-existent in America. You can check this with any legitimate news provider. The real threat is voter intimidation -- keeping some people from voting through excessive (illegal) regulations and perceived threats. Suggesting rigged elections is a serious threat to the very foundation of a free, democratic society -- an orderly transfer of power. This is something about which Trump knows little and seemingly cares less. As far as he's concerned, if he doesn't win, the powers that be must be against him. The press. Ah, the press. ""They can say anything they want,"" he complained the other day. No kidding, Sherlock. You just noticed? He says if he's president he's going to change that and strip the major media companies of their power. He can try, of course. It won't be easy though. You see, Donald, those same forefathers who were so wise as to guarantee Americans the right to bear arms in that Second Amendment you and your followers are so fond of spouting and shouting about thought the idea of a free and unfettered press was so important to a functioning democracy that they wrote it into the First Amendment of the Constitution. That's one ahead of the guns amendment, which some might say suggests it is more important. Since a civics lesson is apparently in order for Trumpers, it should be noted that the First Amendment also guarantees everyone freedom of religion. Which is also to say, freedom from your religion. 
But these are mere facts and Trump and the folks at Fox News have demonstrated the power of repeating false news over and over again until listeners -- like the inhabitants of Orwell's ""1984"" -- simply take it for fact. We have always been at war with Eurasia. We have never been at war with Eurasia. Love is hate. War is peace. I know Putin well. I never met the man. - Advertisement - 
We are told that many Trump supporters -- virtually all of them white and the majority male -- are angry and frustrated with their lives. Somehow, goes the argument, all those black, brown, Muslim, Mexican, gay, Jewish, Arab, Asian people who don't belong here -- and some pushy American women as well -- have prevented these Trump fans from realizing the American Dream. They took all the jobs and live on welfare. Love is hate. Up is down. Bigotry has nothing to do with it. We just want to make America great again, like before all those other people said they wanted to enjoy the American Dream, too. 
Enough already. At some point in a person's life, if he or she is lucky, the opportunity presents itself to take responsibility for one's actions. To take stock of how things are going. Not materially, but really. It can be frightening. It can also be rewarding. Among other things, this look in the mirror allows one to say -- if one can be honest -- ""I've made some mistakes. I sincerely regret them. I hope to do better from now on."" A lot of people never do this. 
With that runaway train called Trump menacing the trust and tolerance that are the pillars of our, yes, already great nation, I'm thinking that a lot of people -- a lot of white, Republican people -- have a date with a mirror. It's far too late to undo the damage Trump has done or to deny any part in it, but it's not too late to admit the mistake of supporting him in spite of all the hateful, false things he said. It's not too late to admit to acting as if he didn't say them because, well, maybe because you were angry or confused or frightened or thought it would be disloyal. Maybe you feel you were lied to. Or maybe you just wanted to believe the lies. 
Republican politicians who have stuck with Trump have no such out. The McCains and Ryans and Cruzes and Rubios knew Trump was bad news from day one. But he was their bad news and his lies became their lies even when they disagreed with him, because they never had the courage -- the humility, the simple decency -- to look in the mirror and say: ""Enough. This man is obscene. He is an insult to our party and our nation. We made a grave mistake in pandering to the worst instincts of some of our party members in order to get their votes. Our pride kept us from admitting this. Fear drove our decisions. We allowed him to make fools of us. Indeed, we made fools of ourselves."" 
Speaking, if I may, for the rest of an angry, resentful nation, that day of reckoning can't come soon enough. - Advertisement -",0
2832,The Supermoon and Other Moons That Are Super in Their Own Ways - The New York Times,"Shrug off the supermoon. Yes, it’s true that on Sunday and Monday nights the full moon will be at its closest to Earth in nearly 70 years. But to the casual observer, it probably won’t look much different from a regular full moon. Yet headlines heralding the event as some sort of don’  spectacle are everywhere. The supermoon isn’t unique in being sensationalized. Several times every year some sort of   lunar activity grabs attention, whether warranted or not. That’s how we’ve ended up with   events like the blood moon, the black moon, the blue moon, the strawberry moon and the harvest moon, among others. Though some of these names have historical and cultural origins, many are rooted in folklore and are often overhyped. Below you’ll find an explanation of the science and origins behind some of these events that will let you decide whether they are worth late nights or early mornings of moongazing. And if you do want to watch the supermoon, the exact time that the moon will be closest will be Monday around 6:22 a. m. Eastern time, but it may shine brighter when the sky is darkest on Sunday and Monday nights. “The supermoon is a   term,” said James Lattis, an astronomer at the University of  . “It’s not an astronomical term, there’s no technical definition of it. ” Supermoon was actually coined by an astrologer in the 1970s, not by a scientist. The term has come to loosely mean a full moon that is at perigee, or when the moon is at its closest position to Earth along its orbit. Now, this definition can vary, which means supermoons can occur multiple times a year, or about once every 14 months, depending on the definition you use. The next   supermoon will be on Dec. 14. The supermoon on Sunday and Monday nights is supposed to be special because it is the closest the full moon will be to Earth since 1948. That means it will be the biggest and brightest full moon in about 68 years. Compared to an average full moon, this supermoon will be approximately 7 percent larger and 15 percent brighter. But most people won’t be able to tell the difference between it and a regular moon. “There’s no fireworks show, no blinking sign that says, ‘Hey, this is the supermoon! ’” said Noah Petro, a deputy project scientist for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter mission. Instead, the supermoon really shines when it is compared with the full moon at apogee, or its farthest position from Earth. If you place images of the two side by side, you can see the difference more easily, Dr. Petro said. The supermoon is 14 percent larger than the apogee full moon and 30 percent brighter. On average, the moon is about 238, 900 miles away from Earth. But Sunday and Monday’s supermoon will be approximately 221, 524 miles away. Astronomers measure the distance of the moon from Earth by shooting lasers to the surface of the moon, which then bounce off mirrors called retroreflectors, which were left behind by the Apollo missions and two Soviet landers. Even though most people will not notice anything special about this supermoon, Dr. Petro said it will still be a good excuse to start gazing at the night sky more regularly. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon moves completely behind Earth’s shadow. Recently, this event has given rise to the sinisterly named blood moon, because the moon becomes a dark   as it’s consumed by Earth’s shadow. “A term like that has a number of problems,” Dr. Lattis said. “In the case of a total lunar eclipse, they aren’t always red. The term blood moon not only suggests, it exaggerates. ” Dr. Lattis also said that the reddish color of the moon during a total lunar eclipse did not have anything to do with the moon itself. Instead, it get’s its red appearance because of the way the Earth’s atmosphere scatters light. Rather than make a fuss about its sanguine color, people should admire the total lunar eclipse. Early astronomers like Aristotle used it to figure out that Earth was round by observing the shape of the shadow that the planet casts on the moon. You can expect the next total lunar eclipse in January 2018. We’ve all heard the saying “once in a blue moon,” but what does that really mean? And how often do they occur? There are two definitions that float around for the elusive blue moon. One refers to the second full moon in a calendar month. Full moons typically occur once every 29. 5 days. The other definition, which is older, says that a blue moon is the third full moon in a season that had four full moons. Typically, a   season has three full moons. So to answer the question, blue moons occur about once every two and a half to three years  —   most recently on May 21, 2016. But depending on the definition you use, they could occur more frequently. The next one will be on Jan. 31, 2018. And no, they are not blue in color. The ominously named twin to the blue moon, a black moon is in some ways the opposite of its brother. It’s the name given to the second new moon in a month. New moons are the first phases of the moon, during which time they are not visible. The other definition is that a black moon is the third new moon in a season of four new moons. Similar to blue moons, these typically occur about every two and a half to three years  —   most recently on Oct. 31, 2016, which made for the   Halloween black moon. Every month’s full moon has a unique name if you look at The Old Farmer’s Almanac. It bestows names like full wolf moon, full worm moon, full flower moon, full buck moon, full sturgeon moon and full beaver moon. Folklore has it that those names came from Algonquin Indian tribes and their terms for the full moon during different times of the year. But that might be debated. “No one knows whether someone made those up in the ’30s or if they go back to real Indian use because there aren’t real records prior to that,” said Gordon Johnston, an   program executive at NASA who studies moon names as a hobby. June’s moon is known as the full strawberry moon or the full rose moon. The idea behind the names is that they have to do with the season when the Algonquin collected strawberries. Rose moon might have been named by Europeans. Sometimes the moon is tinged red, but that occurs in the summer because the moon appears lower on the horizon. The most recent strawberry moon happened on June 20 and coincided with the summer solstice. The harvest moon, unlike some of the other moons, has an astronomical meaning. It is the closest full moon to the autumnal equinox. Folklore says that farmers would use the light of the harvest moon to collect their crops in the fall. The harvest moon appears in September and shines brightly for a few nights in a row. Following the harvest moon is the hunter’s moon, which is thought to have provided people with extra moonlight to seek out food. Both names are relics of a more agrarian era. Now, they provide us with an opportunity to reflect on the moon’s importance to people of the past. “All of these names of the moons are due to the fact that the moon for centuries has captivated humans,” Dr. Petro said. “I wish nowadays we’d do the Super Bowl moon or modernize these names for our culture so people pay attention to the moon. ”",0
2833,DNC To Sue Trump For Telling Truth About ‘Election Fraud’,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Sean Adl-Tabatabai in News , US // 0 Comments 
The DNC is suing the Republican National Committee due to Donald Trump’s claims that Hillary Clinton is committing election fraud. 
The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in New Jersey and aims to silence Trump’s claim that the election is rigged, which the DNC are particularly sensitive about. 
Townhall.com reports: 
The DNC alleges that the RNC has not done enough to reprimand Trump for claiming that the election is rigged, and seeks to have the court hold the committee in civil contempt as well as levy sanctions. 
The DNC claims that because the RNC has done “ballot security” work, they are agreeing with Trump that the election is rigged. 
Marc Elias, Hillary Clinton’s campaign counsel, claims that there is also a racial element to Trump’s claims of voter fraud. “Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be ‘rigged’ based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in ‘certain areas’ or ‘certain sections’ of key states,” the Democratic attorneys, including Hillary Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias, wrote. “Unsurprisingly, those ‘certain areas’ are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside.”

2834,"Along the Mekong River, a Timeless Place Where Time Marches On - The New York Times","Deep in the folds of the hill, up steep stone stairs flanked with frangipani trees, stood the inner sanctum of the ancient Khmer temple of Vat Phou. We faced the mountain ridge, our backs to the waters of the Mekong River, looking for the chamber. From this angle, it was hidden. But other parts of the temple had begun revealing themselves to us. Down here, along the rutted stone path leading to the stairs, we watched as a construction crane lifted a block onto the wall of one of the outer chambers. To our right, a few carvers chipped away at other blocks with small tools. Through their hands flowed the tales of Hindu mythology, the   narratives of gods in love and war that had originated on the Indian subcontinent and traveled to distant Java and to Khmer temples across Cambodia and Laos. Now that transmission of stories and beliefs and ideas was continuing here, like the flow of the Mekong, in the shadow of one of the most beautiful of those temples. Built more than 1, 000 years ago at the high point of an axis stretching from a range of mountains down to the Mekong, Vat Phou is one of the most sacred temples of the vanished Khmer kingdoms. The Khmer ruled a wide swath of Southeast Asia from the ninth to the 15th centuries, and their dedication to art and architecture is best embodied in the famous temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Lesser known and distinct from Angkor in its intimacy is Vat Phou, sometimes written in English as Wat Phu, which has been designated a World Heritage site by a United Nations agency. To see the temple and this stretch of the Mekong, my wife,    daughter and I based ourselves for three nights at a new riverside hotel outside the town of Champasak. This was the middle leg of a   whirlwind trip through Southeast Asia that we regarded as our farewell to the region. I had been reporting in China for The New York Times for eight years, and we had plans to leave in the coming year. We had a special attachment to Southeast Asia  —   my wife, Tini, is Vietnamese American and worked for seven years for The Associated Press in Vietnam before moving to China. And while in China, as a couple and then a family, we had spent much of our vacation time exploring the region. For many foreigners and Chinese ground down by living in China’s polluted, crowded and clogged megacities, the beaches, rivers and hills of tropical Southeast Asia provided a   escape hatch. Neither Tini nor I had been to southern Laos before, so it made sense to choose it as the centerpiece of our final Southeast Asia vacation on this tour. Even if Laos was an authoritarian state, it was still the land of the Mekong, with palm trees lining the riverbanks, freshwater dolphins swimming between islets and fishermen casting nets over the side of skiffs. The pace of life was slower, much slower, than that of Beijing. But it would have been wrong to think of the region as timeless. The restoration of Vat Phou that we witnessed belied notions of ancient ruins lost in eternal mists. And it was there, near the entrance to the temple complex, that we discovered we were not the only escapees from the rush of development in China. As we set foot that morning on the eastern end of the pathway leading up to the inner sanctum, we met a Chinese couple from Shanghai who were in the middle of a monthlong trip through Laos with their    daughter. Our daughter, Aria, instantly began following the older girl around. We told the family we were fleeing the notorious Beijing pollution. “The situation is very bad in Shanghai, too,” the father said. It was rare to see a Chinese family traveling alone in this corner of Southeast Asia, and I wondered whether they were a harbinger for a new wave of tourists. French travelers were ubiquitous here and had been so for more than a century, given France’s colonial history in   Indochina, but Chinese travelers were rare, even though China bordered Laos. We had begun our   trip with a flight from Beijing to Chiang Mai in Thailand to visit friends there, then entered southern Laos with a plan to spend one week before meeting other friends on a beach in Vietnam. We crossed the   border near the Laotian town of Pakse. There, on a sleepy street (towns in Laos only have sleepy streets) we had lunch at Dok Mai, a restaurant run by an Italian, Corrado. He told us he had tried living and working in India, but that had been tough. “Pakse chose me,” he said. A young man sent from the River Resort then drove us the   from Pakse to the hotel, built along the Mekong. We found ourselves in the middle of nowhere, but that was the point. The River Resort consisted of   luxury buildings along the west bank of the Mekong, with a large room on each floor. There were two riverside swimming pools on the grounds. We had a balcony room overlooking the river. The entire wall and door facing the river was made of glass. We could wake up in bed gazing across the waters to the sunrise. At sunset, a golden light bathed the river and trees and stones. It was one of the most stunning hotels in which we had stayed in Southeast Asia. We would have enjoyed spending an entire day just on the riverbank, but Khmer civilization beckoned us. In the mountains looming to our west, hidden by jungle, lay Vat Phou. The next morning, we hired a taxi to drive us the 15 minutes to the temple. Along the range of hills, we could make out one peak that stood above the others. The builders of Vat Phou had noticed this and proclaimed it a natural lingam of Shiva. A hotel employee, Taiy, told me of the importance of rituals at the temple. “I’ve been to Vat Phou four times,” he said. “My family goes once a year. Because I have to work, I usually don’t go. I don’t have much time, so I would only be able to go at night. ” “There’s a big festival once a year,” he said. “I remember there were many people. This year, there will be a big one, and maybe I’ll have to go. ” After we met the family from Shanghai, we walked between rows of trees and up the stone steps to the inner sanctum. Along the main walkway, we passed a   naga statue draped with yellow garlands. A bell rang somewhere. Inside the inner temple, a Thai family made offerings to a statue of the Buddha. They had bought incense sticks from a woman outside the temple. They prayed with the lit sticks. Sweet smoke drifted through the temple. On our walk, Aria had picked up a white frangipani flower, and now she placed it on a wooden table, atop dried candle wax. It was her offering. Around the sanctum were lintels carved with ornate scenes from Hindu mythology. One showed the god Indra atop a   elephant. Another depicted deities taking part in the churning of the Ocean of Milk, an image that I had also seen a decade earlier at Angkor. Then there was the scene of Krishna tearing his uncle Kamsa in half. Outside, more worshipers were arriving. We walked along the slope of the mountain behind the temple. On the site were the ruins of a small library, a sacred spring and a cave shrine. At a cistern, Laotians anointed themselves with water that flowed from mountain springs. The Shanghainese girl told us to follow her, and she showed us a   rock that our guidebook said might have been used for human sacrifices before the age of Angkor. It was the wider natural surroundings that cast a spell on us. Atop the hill, staring down the axis and toward the Mekong to the east, I could see the many frangipani flowers below, bursts of white on the brown landscape. The temple commanded the scene, as its cousins at Angkor did in the Cambodian jungles. After we walked down the stairs, four women holding umbrellas approached us. They went straight up to Aria and said “sabaidee,” or hello. She said it back, pronouncing the syllables carefully even if she did not know what the word meant. The next morning, we arranged with our hotel to take a boat over to the island of Don Daeng, in the middle of the Mekong. We had brought bicycles with us, and I strapped Aria to my back with a baby sling. A herd of water buffalo wandered languidly down the sandy beach to drink at the river. We biked along dirt paths to villages. There were five main ones on the island, with a total population of 3, 000. Locals walked from one to another or sat on the rear of trundling tractors. Outside their homes, women fried up rice cakes in pans. At lunchtime, we stopped at La Folie, a     lodge. While our hotel was all modernist glass and concrete, La Folie had polished wooden panels on the floors and walls. It overlooked the river and faced the spine of mountains to the west. We could see Vat Phou in the hills. Top, a smiling    man from Pakse, was working in the dining room. He had just started there one month earlier. When he found out I was from the United States, he asked about the Ultra Music Festival in Miami  —   Had I heard of it? Had I been there? I shook my head. “I really want to go,” he said. “My favorite D. J. s from around the world go there. ” He said that was his goal, to be a D. J. and that there were two bars in Pakse where D. J. s played. Timeless Asia, indeed. That evening, we took a sunset boat ride on the Mekong with a Dutch couple. Over canapés and bottles of Beerlao, we spoke with Kanh, a    hotel worker accompanying us. He had begun working at River Resort three months earlier. He was from Pakse, he said, the son of a Vietnamese mother and a father who was Laotian and Chinese. While his mother had been born here, her parents were from Hue, the old imperial capital in central Vietnam. They had fled the fall of South Vietnam to Communist forces in 1975, only to eventually settle in another Communist country. “He’s the original mixed Southeast Asian,” Tini said with a laugh. Her ancestors, too, were from Hue, and she and her family had also fled Vietnam in 1975. They ended up deep in the American South. So went the vagaries of history. The next morning, we took a ferry across the river, followed by a bus to a river port to the south, where we hopped on a wooden boat crammed with backpackers for a ride to what is known as the Four Thousand Islands area, or Si Phan Don, on the border with Cambodia. This stretch of the Mekong was filled with small islets and rocks. Waterfalls abounded. It was here that French colonists were unable to navigate ships up the Mekong to southwest China without building a small railroad across Don Khon and Don Det. We stayed for a couple of nights on the northern side of Don Khon. We got a riverside room at Sengahloune Villa, a more rustic place than the River Resort. The narrow waterways, wooden skiffs and palm trees swaying among the islands reminded me of the backwaters of Kerala in southern India and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, where the Mekong emptied into the South China Sea. We spent our days biking around the island and watching the sunset from the old French railroad bridge next to our hotel. One afternoon, we hired a small boat off the southern tip of Don Khon, near the old railway tracks, to see the area’s famous freshwater dolphins. As we strained from our boat to catch a glimpse of the dolphins, we saw a group of monks in saffron robes sitting in a skiff. They had come over from Cambodia. Their boat flew the Cambodian flag, with an image of the main temple at Angkor Wat. They sat there with umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun and pointed whenever the head or back of a dolphin poked above the water for a few seconds. The river flowed onward, passing around their boat and continuing for hundreds of miles to the ocean far away.",0
2835,"At Real Madrid, Zinedine Zidane’s Gift Is Wrapped in Charisma - The New York Times","MADRID  —   A few days before Real Madrid and Barcelona were to meet in the first Clásico of last season, Madrid’s manager at the time, Rafael Benítez, sat down with the club’s president, Florentino Pérez. It was only November, and Benítez had been at his post for only a few months, but even at that early stage of the season, his position was shrouded in doubt. There was a lack of what the captain Sergio Ramos would later call “affinity” between Benítez, the cool, methodical manager, and the cadre of glittering stars that made up his squad. Performances had been stuttering, results imperfect: At Santiago Bernabéu, the   stadium where Real Madrid plays its matches, one loss and three draws in 11 league games does not cut it. When Benítez sat down across from Pérez, Real Madrid sat 3 points behind Barcelona in La Liga the word was that defeat would spell the end for the coach. Pérez, soothingly, offered reassurance. Benítez would not be fired, he told the manager, regardless of the result. A caveat, though, was concealed in the velvet glove. Pérez made it clear that Benítez was safe as long as he picked what the president felt was his strongest team: an adventurous lineup that included the Colombian midfielder James Rodríguez. Such a selection ran against Benítez’s cautious instincts. He would have preferred the more defensively minded Brazilian Casemiro as a bulwark against Barcelona’s formidable attack, but eventually Benítez relented. Rodríguez started Casemiro did not. Barcelona won,   humiliating Madrid on its home field. Benítez would cling to his job for only six more weeks. As Real Madrid and Barcelona prepare to come face to face again on Saturday at Camp Nou, Pérez will not be having any such frank conversations with Benítez’s successor. Casemiro, fitness permitting, is expected to start. Rodríguez almost certainly will not. In that one lineup decision lies not only proof of the power of Madrid’s new coach, Zinedine Zidane, but evidence of the source of it. Almost a year into his   managerial career, it is hard to find fault with Zidane’s record. He lifted the Champions League trophy after only six months, his third Champions League title with Real Madrid  —   one as a player, one as an assistant, one as coach  —   and the club’s 11th over all. His team sits atop La Liga, 6 points ahead of Barcelona. He has a win percentage of 81. 8. Statistically, he is the best manager in the history of Spain’s top division. Yet few rank Zidane, a taciturn, enigmatic Frenchman, as the equal of those   in place at many of Europe’s top clubs. The common perception is that he is not as inventive as Pep Guardiola, as inspirational as Jürgen Klopp, as astute as José Mourinho, as suave as Carlo Ancelotti. That view has its adherents, even at Real Madrid. Among the club’s hierarchy, there were always concerns that Zidane possessed the desire but not the ability to be a   manager. In 18 months with Castilla, Real’s B team, he was given every assistance: While the reserves had previously traveled to away games by bus, under Zidane’s aegis, they went by chartered jet. Still, he was hardly a resounding success. His training methods, particularly fitness work inspired by coaches like Gérard Houllier and Marcello Lippi, were seen as out of date   sessions designed to improve stamina had been phased out by many of his peers. There was no suggestion of a revolutionary tactical mind at work. The team’s results were unspectacular. Pérez, as late as the summer of 2015, was said to have been privately expressing his hope that Olympique Marseille would offer Zidane the chance to start his managerial career there, allowing him to learn his craft and make his mistakes away from Bernabéu. Pérez had always hoped that Zidane would prove to be Real’s equivalent to Guardiola, a genius schooled in the ways of the club. Pérez seemed resigned, though, that Zidane was more in line with Roberto Di Matteo, Chelsea’s     Champions   coach in 2012, and Luis Enrique, a custodian of  —   rather than an upgrade to  —   Guardiola’s legacy at Barcelona. In some ways, Zidane’s time with Real’s first team has borne that out. There are still rumblings of discontent among the players that his training sessions are   his closest confidant on his staff is Luis Llopis, the goalkeeping coach. Jorge Jesus, the manager of Sporting Lisbon, insisted before his club faced Real Madrid in the Champions League last month that Zidane’s team “does some very interesting things tactically,” but Jesus declined to mention what any of them were. A   whitewash of city rival Atlético in November aside, there have been few   performances. Real Madrid tends to be reliant on brilliance from its individuals rather than the smooth operation of the team. The praise from Zidane’s players also has been telling: The Spanish midfielder Isco has suggested that Zidane lifted morale, while Cristiano Ronaldo pinpointed that the squad “feels his affection. ” Such tributes make Zidane sound more like a mascot than a manager. And yet results brook no debate. Zidane may not be a tactician or a visionary his presence is so brooding that it is impossible to imagine him as a   rhetorician. Instead, his strength may be something else entirely: charisma. In Ancelotti’s Italian autobiography, “Preferisco la Coppa” (I Prefer the Cup) he detailed the impression he had gleaned of Zidane while coaching him at Juventus. “He was the best player I have ever managed,” Ancelotti wrote, but what really stood out was the effect Zidane had on those around him. Ancelotti described how the Juventus owner Gianni Agnelli had been “hopelessly lost, in love” with Zidane. “I saw it dozens of times,” Ancelotti said. “Sometimes, his grandsons, John and Lapo Elkann, would be with him. They would say hello to the squad and go straight to Zidane. Then Luciano Moggi: to Zidane. Antonio Giraudo: to Zidane. Because Zidane was shy, and did not speak much, it was more than anything a conversation with yourself, but still, it was with Zidane. ” These were some of the most powerful people in Italian soccer, men used to obeisance from others, bending the knee. The players did likewise: In the same book, Ancelotti recounted a story from his first season in Turin, 1999, in which Zidane had been late arriving for a team bus. Ancelotti gave him 10 minutes to show up, and when he did not, Ancelotti ordered the bus to leave. Paolo Montero, a brutish Uruguayan central defender, then told Ancelotti in no uncertain terms that “without Zidane, nobody is going anywhere. ” The bus waited. That charisma has not receded. The best players rarely make the best managers  —   witness Diego Maradona  —   but in the case of Zidane, and Real Madrid, the fit is perfect. This is a squad that resented taking instruction from Benítez and Mourinho, who had never played at a high level, but which defers instinctively to Zidane. For all his flaws as a coach, a chronically political dressing room sits in his thrall. More significant still, Pérez does the same. The squad had long grown tired of the president’s interventions. One comment to Ronaldo, last season, suggesting after a game in which he had scored three goals that he should have had four, went down especially poorly. The players have mockingly known Pérez as abuelo, or grandfather, for some time that he is sufficiently awed by Zidane not to dictate team selections, to afford him independence, naturally places the players at the coach’s back, rather than in their more familiar position at their manager’s throat. Zidane’s power, his infallibility, is rooted in his charisma, his status. In that sense, Pérez has got what he wanted: his own Guardiola, a coach entirely in tune with his surroundings. Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson always said he felt the manager ought to be the   employee at any team, to put him in a position of strength. Zidane is not that, but he remains more of a Galactico, to borrow Pérez’s famous label, than any of his charges. Zidane may not produce a   collective, like Mourinho or Klopp or Guardiola, but Real Madrid has always been built around the cult of the individual. Zidane understands that. For him, and for his club, it works. Zidane may not be the perfect manager, but he could well be perfect for Real.",0
2836,Oil Has Been Leaking Into The Pacific Since Last Month And It's Being Totally Ignored,"Share on Facebook When is environmental damage too much? When is it acceptable? In what is being called “ a relatively tiny ” marine oil spill, for the Heiltsuk First Nations of the Central Coast of BC, the question is being asked in quite real terms, forcing government to answer the questions that it might have preferred to have evaded. Since running aground in mid-October , a small boat has been leaking oil into the Pacific Ocean, and along BC's Central Coast. Despite the fact that this spill comes in the aftermath of the Royal Visit to the region — a visit that sought to place the health of the coastline and all the life that dwells there within the global lens — there appears to be very little international interest. Making matters worse, there appears to be little interest from Canadian lawmakers on how best to reduce the potential for disasters like this. Along the Central Coast of British Columbia, the Great Bear Rainforest is seen as “one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth.” Stretching approximately 400 kilometers along this sparsely populated area, the Great Bear Rainforest has long represented the very idea of conservation and intrinsic preservation to Canadians and environmentalists around the world. Along with the Kermode Bear , the area made National Geographic's “ Places of a Lifetime ” list and has been called the planet's last large expanse of coastal temperate rain forest by people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Natural beauty, conservation projects , and provincial parks are not, however, all the region is known for. Of all things, the Central Coast offers access to the Pacific Ocean. It also provides a more-or-less direct line for fossil fuel exportation from various LNG (liquefied natural gas) sites around the province, as well as tar sands oil from the neighbouring province of Alberta. North of Bella Bella, the town of Kitimat serves as the proposed terminal destination of Enbridge's Northern Gateway Pipeline , a project that has seen a great deal of protest that, in many ways, echoes the issues coming to a head in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. One of the most attractive aspects of the region, insofar as fossil fuel extraction is concerned, is the access it offers to Asian markets , pitting the desires of big oil corporations against those of First Nations and environmentalists , alike. Even with the legislative death of Northern Gateway, the region continues to be the focal point for resource extraction. October's oil spill — which is ongoing — provides a visceral reminder of what is at stake in such discussions, pushing many local residents to demand a full tanker ban along the Central Coast . Yet, while the Coastal Rainforest is inundated with thousands of litres of oil, the federal government seems content to remain reactive . Rather than agreeing to the suggested ban, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instead proposed a $1.5 billion (CDN) fund to help deal with oil spills after they occur. Reactive policies like this leave the fragile ecosystems found in the Central Coast region to suffer contamination before they are dealt with, and offer no change for the way issues of sovereignty are evaluated between First Nations and the colonial Canadian government. Since his election in 2015, PM Trudeau has taken several quick steps back from his promises to respect First Nations' sovereignty and deal with environmental issues . Although this “ relatively tiny marine oil spill” can be seen as just that, a minor environmental issue that will be cleaned up with more federal money, there is a deeper implication that can be seen — one that pits ongoing environmental degradation and cultural assimilation and genocide against neoliberal economic policy .

2837,EXCLUSIVE: Undercover Audio Reveals Protesters’ Plans to Shut Down Trump’s Inaugural Parade,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   Breitbart News was able to infiltrate a key planning meeting for the effort of radical groups to not only protest the inauguration of President Trump, but also to “shut it down” and disrupt the historic event. Exclusive, undercover audio reveals the radical coalition will throw everything they have at “shutting down” the Trump Inaugural Parade that spans from the U. S. Capitol to the White House. They will attempt to do so by targeting police checkpoints and preventing other Americans from exercising their   right to assemble and express their views.[  Breitbart’s infiltration of the radical   effort also netted a map that reveals the specific locations of checkpoints that will be targeted and possibly shut down and which specific groups are responsible for each location. The map also reveals the entire infrastructure for the radical groups and which “choke points” they deem critical to the inauguration. Radical Occupy organizer and troublemaker Lisa Fithian was revealed in the audio as a trainer, apparently playing a role in the effort’s stated and recorded goal of “shutting that shit down” in reference to the Inaugural Parade.  The radical left protest movement that is currently manifesting as   as well as Lisa Fithian, have long histories and methods of operation that can be examined to better understand how they will act in their effort to shut down the Inaugural Parade. Fithian was a key trainer at the 2008 Republican Nation Convention (RNC) in St. Paul, Minnesota. In that instance, the radical groups used a red, yellow and green team strategy in an attempt to shut down the RNC. Red teams consisted of black bloc anarchists intent on attacking police and Republicans. Yellow teams consisted of “arrestables,” or   activists willing to get arrested for civil disobedience, and the green teams consisting of average liberal protesters who could be manipulated en masse without ever knowing they were pawns in the red and yellow teams’ radical efforts to prevent other Americans from assembling and celebrating their views. In the instance of the 2008 RNC, the radicals used the mainstream liberal marches as cover for their illegal behaviors. They waited until the liberals (green team) were in the street. The radicals would have key persons manipulate the green team to stop in the street and the yellow team would use the green team for cover as the arrestables handcuffed and locked themselves in human chains across critical streets that buses of Republican delegates needed to get to the RNC. The green team would clear the street at the order of police. If the yellow team had not yet secured their roadblocking human chain efforts and needed more time, the red team would put on masks and attack police so that the yellow team had more time. Once the yellow team was ready, the red team would enter the crowd of the unknowing green team and remove their masks to blend. This history indicates that the radical   protesters will use the permitted marches of liberals as cover for their efforts to shut down the Inaugural Parade and possibly other events. It indicates that human chains will be used to block the police checkpoints thereby preventing Republicans from entering the parade areas and possibly providing cover for radicals who wish to throw liquids and other items over and across the barricades that   will depend on for their safety. History suggests the groups will use handcuffs to lock on to physical structures and to each other in their effort to shut down Trump’s Inaugural Parade.

2838,A Republican Representative Just Called For Hillary To Be Killed By Firing Squad,"Comments 
Admitted racist Republican State Rep. John Bennett from Sallisaw, Oklahoma, is the next Republican to publicly call for the assassination of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. 
“ 2 words … firing squad” read Bennet’s Facebok post, with a link to a right-wing blog blaming Clinton for the deaths of American soldiers in during the 2102 Benghazi terrorist attacks. 
Half-heartedly back-peddling on the threat, Bennett, wrote in a text message to The Oklahoman that the comments were intended to be sarcastic, but that reiterated that Clinton was guilty of treason, punishable by death. 
Rep. Bennet is an outspoken Islamophobe, who has openly bragged about his hatred of Muslims, claiming the Prophet Mohammed “only teaches violence” and paints Christianity as being dialectical opposition to Islam. Just last week, he presided over the waste of taxpayer dollars for an “interim study” on “radical Islam” in Oklahoma , a witch-hunt which ended with him declaring a local imam and the leader of the local Council of American-Islamic relations as “terrorists.” 
Bennet’s hatred cannot be tolerated and his threats should be directly addressed; a public official who threatens the future president is not a sarcastic matter. The frequency with which right-wing politicians are actively repeating the conspiracies of radio-show wingnuts and calling for the murder of the Democratic nominee is absolutely appalling, and a sign of just how far our political system has fallen.",0
2839,Hate Hoax: Teen Allegedly Posts ’KKK’ Twitter Threat,"A    student allegedly hoaxed a Twitter threat from a social media account that she claimed was the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). [The teenager has been charged by the Anne Arundel County Police Department with a juvenile citation after she allegedly tweeted out “We’re planning to attack tomorrow” from a Twitter account police say she created, named “@KoolkidsKlanKkk,” according to CBS Baltimore.  Anne Arundel police said they worked with Twitter to find the identity of the individual who sent out the threatening message, ultimately leading them to the      student. Police officials have interviewed the teenager, saying she admitted to creating the Twitter account and sending the threatening message. After being charged by police with a juvenile citation for allegedly disrupting school activities, the teenager was released to her parents. “I kind of felt unsafe at the school and a little hurt,” Arundel High School Freshman Taylor Nash told CBS Baltimore. Anne Arundel County Public Schools Superintendent George Arlotto said he was thankful police were able to identify the teenager who allegedly made the threat and Twitter account. “I want to thank Police Chief Tim Altomare, State’s Attorney Wes Adams, County Executive Steve Schuh, and their staffs for their thorough and expeditious work to identify a suspect in the online post that threatened violence at Arundel High School this week,” Arlotto said in the statement. “The anonymity of the internet provides a murky and complex disguise for many who want to threaten the safety and security of our communities. ” “Our partners in the Police Department and county government peeled back that disguise quickly in this case, in the process reassuring parents, students, and staff that our schools are safe places in which to educate our children,” Arlotto continued.

2841,"Close to Half of American Adults Infected With HPV, Survey Finds - The New York Times","More than 42 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 59 are infected with genital human papillomavirus, according to the first survey to look at the prevalence of the virus in the adult population. The report, published on Thursday by the National Center for Health Statistics, also found that certain   strains of the virus infected 25. 1 percent of men and 20. 4 percent of women. These strains account for approximately 31, 000 cases of cancer each year, other studies have shown. Two vaccines are effective in preventing sexually transmitted HPV infection, and researchers said the new data lend urgency to the drive to have adolescents vaccinated. “If we can get   and    to get the vaccine, we’ll make some progress,” said Geraldine McQuillan, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and lead author of the new report. “You need to give it before kids become sexually active, before they get infected,” Dr. McQuillan said. “By the time they’re in their   people are infected and it’s too late. This is a vaccine against cancer  —   that’s the message. ” (Do you have questions about HPV? Read some answers here.) She and her colleagues also found that 7. 3 percent of Americans ages 18 to 69 were infected orally with HPV, and 4 percent were infected with the   strains that can cause cancers of the mouth and pharynx. HPV is a ubiquitous virus, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. About 40 strains of the virus are sexually transmitted, and virtually all sexually active individuals are exposed to it by their early 20s. The virus usually is spread through direct contact with infected genital skin or mucuous membranes during intercourse or oral sex. Over 90 percent of HPV infections are cleared by the body within two years. The figures released today were a snapshot of the prevalence of active oral HPV infection from 2011 through 2014, and active genital infection in 2013 and 2014. Sometimes, the virus persists in the body. Chronic infections with certain strains can lead to genital warts and cancers of the cervix, vagina, penis, anus and throat. Two viral strains,   and   cause almost all cervical cancers. “One of the most striking things that we really want people to know is that   HPV is common  —   common in the general population,” Dr. McQuillan said. While the C. D. C. recommends routine screening for cervical cancer for all women ages 21 to 65, adults are not routinely screened for HPV infection itself. Indeed, there is no HPV test for men. (A test for women is sometimes used in conjunction with a Pap screen for cervical cancer.) There were significant differences in rates of   genital HPV infection by race and ethnicity, Dr. McQuillan and her colleagues found. The highest rate, 33. 7 percent, was found among   blacks the lowest, 11. 9 percent, among Asians. The prevalence of genital HPV infection was 21. 6 percent among whites and 21. 7 percent among Hispanics. Men generally have somewhat higher rates than women, but among Asian and Hispanic men, the infections are not significantly more common. The reasons for these variations are not known.",0
2842,Donald Trump and the Equilibrium to Come | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: USA in the World The news these last few days has been all about the radical left being up in arms over Donald Trump’s ascendency to the US Presidency. The massive upset victory of this charismatic non-politician is crystallizing into a very divisive situation in the United States and in Europe, as EU leaders and NATO nations paint a geo-political picture of gloom and doom for us. However negative the picture may seem though, the shiny side of this leadership coin shows a glowing promise. Here’s my take on what is about to happen when Donald Trump is inaugurated. Donald Trump did not win this election on any of the bases which Clinton’s supporters profess. This is crucial to accept if we are to understand what is about to happen. Trump is not a bigot, a racist, nor is he some misogynistic woman hater. Trump is a product of both American progress and to an extend hyper-capitalism. His “locker room” talk resonates no more resoundingly than his anti-establishment diatribe against the Washington elites. For those who have watched him over the years, it is so clear the man just says what he thinks at the moment. He said he would “drain the swamp” of politically corrupt in Washington, and I think he is about to. He also said , if he was elected, he would install a special prosecutor to investigate and indict Hillary Clinton for her part in illegal activities. Those out there demonstrating do not fully understand “who” it is there are demonstrating on behalf of, nor do they understand the breadth of criminality and malfeasance Mr. Trump has suggested. WikiLeaks opened the investigation to the court of public opinion, and this is why Donald Trump is the President-elect now. I could enumerate the multiple statutes Mrs. Clinton breached while she was Secretary of State, but her alleged crimes and misdemeanors against the United States are not the reason the Democrats lost. I could list the multitude of lies the Podesta emails proved, and how Hillary Clinton told Congress, the media, the FBI, and the atmosphere of crooked dealings she and the Democrats created, but the American people did not shun her for lying to them either. Politicians lie like water flows with gravity. The American people voted for Donald Trump because the system in place the last 25 years failed them. There’s no need for a history lesson in order for me to prove my contention here. When George Herbert Walker Bush met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the people of the world drew in a deep breath of possibility and potential. The promise was further illuminated in 1991, but the fall of the Soviet Union that was supposed to set free all the peoples of all the nations, it was never the plan. Almost simultaneously with his handshake with Gorbachev, Bush and his backers were steeled for the first invasion of Iraq. Bush’s part in lighting the fuse on today’s destabilization bomb was not his greatest betrayal of the American people though. Not many political analysts these days talk about George H.W. Bush’s role in NAFTA, but step toward globalism ruined a hundred million lives and the dreams attached to them within a few short years. NAFTA, later set in place by Bill Clinton, destroyed the United States as a manufacturing power. Not only did millions lose their jobs, the globalization strategies keyed to NAFTA would later cause the global economic and military conflicts we see right now. An easy way of seeing this is by watching the march of NATO across Eastern Europe toward the doorstep of Russia. I can show you how Bill Clinton’s administration got Yugoslavia out of the US hegemony’s way. Clinton left office as one of only two US Presidents to have been through impeachment proceedings, and after having paved the way to the coming Iraq invasion. Showing the collusion in between Clinton’s successor George W. Bush, Britain’s Tony Blair, and Europe’s leadership in what became known as the “Bush Doctrine”, which amounted to “Democratic regime change”. The Afghanistan War, the war and occupation of Iraq, the later Georgian War, Barack Obama’s part in Ukraine, then Arab Spring, Gaddafi, Assad and Syria, the spread of this quasi-democratic movement is well documented by the trail of blood and misery left in its path. Whether the reader wishes to see the march of these successive administrations as complicit or circumstantial participants in this is irrelevant. In the long view the United States’ domestic and global policies have failed billions of people. Furthermore, on some individual level, each and every one of us has felt these failures. This is true of the protesters from Austin to Washington today. These Hillary supporters are by and large, just the pawns of the globalists who pay for play via the US Treasury, and who now fund the very upheaval against President-elect Trump. The Hillary Clinton “upset” is a far bigger paradigm than anyone is telling us. At this point some readers are already asking; “So where is that glowing promise?” Donald Trump is in the process of emptying not only the “Washington swamp”, but the European one as well. Before you object, please consider what it means for a powerful outsider to enter this game of crisis-détente. Look at how EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is expressing the panic of European leadership in this comment this week: “We will need to teach the president-elect what Europe is and how it works.” News that NATO is losing it over the Trump presidency is brought into context if we look at how NATO is trying to establish Moscow as the bitter foe again. I recall something Mr. Putin said to the Valdai Conference in Sochi in 2014, when announced; “Playtime is over”. The Russian president was talking about backroom deals and underhanded dealings geo-policy makers had been engaging in for decades, and how he was not engaging in them any longer. This is vital for understanding Mr. Trump’s position with regard to positivity toward Russia and China. The globalists who have run this show for decades are now faced with powerful opponents to their plans. All of this is irrefutable, and only the minute details remain to be seen. The worst nightmare of the billionaires who have benefited from world chaos is now elected. Imagine now what will come out in a Hillary Clinton investigation without the Obama Department of Justice to block! Donald Trump has at his fingertips every underhanded shift, every bit of NSA intelligence, every USAID or CIA penny shoveled to ISIL, or to some unscrupulous EU official. Hillary and Bill Clinton, the Bushs, Barack Obama, Angela Merkel, Tony Blair, Cameron, billionaires like George Soros and his NGOs, the whole grimy and messy swamp of leadership corruption is now in the hands of a guy who builds skyscrapers and golf courses. Somebody outside the “club” is in the White House and nobody knows what he is going to do. No Rockefeller millions put him there. No Soros funding promoted him, and no corporate media voiced a kind word about him. The opposition to Donald Trump did every dirty, stinking, rotten deed they could to ensure he lost, but fed up America said “no”. The world’s geo-political reptiles are losing their collective minds today. Soros and MoveOn.org, the neo-socialists marching in Berlin are organizing a popular uprising, but the Trump power base is more firm. The same frustrated American that lost his manufacturing job and pension to NAFTA, he is the neighbor of that redneck veteran Obama sent to lose in Afghanistan. The shining hope I speak of is in the pragmatic realism of Trump, Putin, and any leader compelled to actually serve a people. Here is how I see it playing out. As I looked at Vladimir Putin’s Instagram account today, I could not help but notice he and former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi walking side-by-side in the woods. The reason I mention this is because the media in the west has already jumped on a fear, and a meme, in comparing Berlusconi to Trump. One of Mr. Putin’s friends, Berlusconi is a fascinating and powerful ally in Italy, a nation increasingly reticent on Germany’s and America’s control of Europe. The neo-fascist liberals who were so “all in” to get Clinton elected, now they are in chaotic disarray now over politicians like Matteo Renzi, whom Berlusconi backs. To cut short here, the Trump-Putin cohesion the far-left tried to use against the billionaire property mogul, is the same bright potential that can rescue the planet. Europe is only an extension of Washington, London, Berlin, and Paris these days, and the EU that never was has scores of nations restless for change. Trump is the catalyst for this change whether he choose to try Hillary Clinton or not. You see Trump is a businessman first, and philosopher poet last. The bottom line here is, peace with Russia and carry on business, or stand trial for betraying a billion people. These protests, the NATO and EU “warnings” to Trump, these indications tell me just how corrupt this system was.

2843,New York Times Co.’s Decline in Print Advertising Tempered by Digital Gains - The New York Times,"Precipitous declines in print advertising rocked the newspaper industry last year. And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable. The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue. For the quarter, print advertising revenue declined 20 percent. The story on the digital side was positive, underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company. Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year, to $209 million. The Times Company added 514, 000 net   subscriptions for its news products during the year, bringing its total to 1. 6 million. Buoyed by readers’ intense interest in the presidential election, the company added 276, 000 net   subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. Including print and crossword product subscriptions, The New York Times now has more than three million total paid subscribers, a milestone that aligns with the company’s commitment to a   revenue model that is less reliant on the advertising revenue derived from page views and clicks. As for many other legacy print companies trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world, these have been challenging times for The New York Times. Last month, The Times released an internal report that called for swift changes in the newsroom, including more staff training, a commitment to hiring journalists with   skills and an elimination of duplicative layers of editing. That has left employees bracing for staff reductions that newsroom leaders said could be announced in the next several weeks. Despite positive developments on the digital side, the overall financial results announced on Thursday are unlikely to assuage the tangible anxiety among journalists at The Times. Total revenue fell about 2 percent for the year, to $1. 6 billion, and 1 percent in the quarter, to $440 million. Adjusted operating profit, the company’s preferred method for assessing performance, fell to $241 million last year, from $289 million in 2015. Operating profit dropped to $102 million, from $137 million. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit was $96 million, compared with $118 million in the fourth quarter in 2015. Operating profit fell to $56 million, from $88 million. On a more positive note, circulation revenue rose 3 percent in 2016, to $881 million. Revenue from the company’s   subscriptions jumped 17 percent in 2016, to $233 million. For the quarter, circulation revenue increased 5 percent, to $226 million, and   subscription revenue rose 22 percent, to $64 million. Digital advertising revenue rose 11 percent. In an earnings call on Thursday, Mark Thompson, chief executive of the Times Company, called digital growth “unprecedented” and expressed optimism in the company’s   growth strategy. He also used the call to needle President Trump over his claims that the publication’s audience and subscriber numbers were “dwindling. ” “Not so much, Mr. President,” Mr. Thompson said. “We had spectacular audiences in the quarter. ” Times executives said the company expected circulation revenues to increase about 6 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter last year. The company also expected to see about 200, 000 net additional subscriptions to its digital news products in the first quarter. Total advertising revenue is forecast to fall in the high single digits, though digital advertising revenue is expected to increase 10 to 15 percent. On Wednesday, The Times announced the promotion of Clifford J. Levy, a top digital editor, to the position of deputy managing editor. On Thursday, the company announced a partnership with Snapchat to create a new daily edition for the app’s Discover section, with the aim of gaining exposure to a younger audience.",0
2844,Queen Elizabeth’s Party Planner Is Proud to Wear $35 Shoes - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Lady Elizabeth Anson, Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin and her party planner for more than 50 years, was raised in a Downton   home where servants ironed the newspapers, and was married at Westminster Abbey. But on a recent Friday, Lady Elizabeth  —   the orchestrator of some of Britain’s most aristocratic parties  —   was in her    sitting room. She was wearing a gray Tomasz Starzewski jacket bought on sale more than 40 years ago, drinking tea from a   tankard (an eBay find) and discussing her recovery from her weekly lottery   addiction. “I still do a lucky dip if it’s a huge amount of money,” said Lady Elizabeth, who has also organized events for Tom Cruise and other celebrities seeking discretion. On her feet were what looked like Roger Vivier court shoes, but when a reporter suggested she might like to remove whatever was stuck to the bottom of them before having her photograph taken, Lady Elizabeth, 75, handed the footwear to her liveried butler. “Certainly, my lady,” he said, before getting rid of the price tags that revealed that the shoes cost £25 (about $35). “Marks  Spencer’s best,” Lady Elizabeth said, looking delighted at this evidence of her frugality. And really, why shouldn’t she be? Among her “grander family,” as she calls them, frugality is a trait to be celebrated. The queen has been known to take public trains. Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge (whom Lady Elizabeth refers to as “Catherine”) is applauded for wearing dresses more than once. Let somebody else be the embarrassingly profligate relative that makes the monarchy look bad. Lady Elizabeth  —   daughter of Princess Anne of Denmark, goddaughter of King George VI  —   is just another   entrepreneur, albeit possibly the only one with the word “lady” in her email address. “I do not know how to be a lady who lunches,” she said. “I love my work, and my work pays for my home. ” She asked the butler to bring her her nicotine sweets. She gave up smoking in the ’60s, picked it up after 17 years, then quit with difficulty again 11 years ago. If she were to start again, the sitting room would rebuke her. Every surface is crammed with decorative eggs  —   536 of them, by her grandchildren’s last count  —   that she began collecting after her stepfather presented her with an alabaster one as a worry bead for her right hand when she first put down the cigarettes. Hers is a   business. One of her projects is the queen’s 90th birthday this month. The milestone is being marked with street parties, pageants and ceremonies, but Lady Elizabeth handled the private family celebration, which, like all of her events, she was “not prepared to discuss. ” Still, she is as unguarded as one can possibly be when bound by confidentiality agreements, referring to one of Ivana Trump’s   husbands as “looking like a frog. ” (Mrs. Trump is a former client. Things did not end well.) Of the overweight king of Tonga, whom she was looking after, along with all the other foreign heads of state, at the 2011 royal wedding, she said, “He thought he’d break the furniture in Buckingham Palace. ” The chairs there are “very low,” she said, “very wonderful Louis Quatorze. It looks as if you sat on it, it would break. But it doesn’t. ” During a discussion about the lost art of conversation because of cellphones, she took her incessantly ringing land line off the hook, letting the receiver dangle at her stockinged feet, and leaned in, saying: “I think I can tell this. It’s a bit about the royal family. ” She described how the queen had had her grandchildren over for dinner. “And she said to me that she found it really difficult,” Lady Elizabeth said, “because they didn’t really know how to talk each other. And she said, ‘I suppose it’s because they’re always getting up and down and helping somebody and putting something in a dishwasher or whatever they’re doing, because they don’t have enough staff. ’” On the subject of Her Majesty: For the record, the queen is a “most meticulous hostess,” though she does not insist only on Malvern water or yellow freesias, as has been reported. “People love creating myths,” Lady Elizabeth said. “It makes them feel very  . ” In fact, it was a gardener at Windsor Castle who decreed the yellow flowers. For the wedding of William and Kate, for which Lady Elizabeth was an adviser (and planned the wedding eve family dinner) the couple had very strong ideas that the queen “was marvelous and listened to,” she said. Traditional royal weddings have no reception afterward  —   guests just depart after the service  —   but William and Kate wanted one after seeing that was what their friends had had. “And so the palace had to learn quite a lot about different canapés, because they weren’t used to doing them,” Lady Elizabeth said. Her code name around the office for the queen is (or was until it’s been published) Shirley Temple, though Lady Elizabeth said she can’t remember why. Referring to her staff of five, she said: “We literally had the funniest names possible for everybody. And the people who were the most aware of their celeb importance that I’ve ever had got names that were truly extraordinary. ” While looking at wedding sites with the actress Isla Fisher, who was marrying Sacha Baron Cohen, Lady Elizabeth was amused that Ms. Fisher (code name: Sally Dangletrot) kept three different wigs in the car to disguise herself. “I wouldn’t have known her if she was passing down the street,” she said. “I shouldn’t say that because it’s quite rude. ” Lady Elizabeth started her business at age 18, in 1960. Her inspiration was the stress of planning her own 1959 debutante party, which prevented her from enjoying the evening. Chasing down R. S. V. P. s was a particular headache, and she claims credit for inventing “this ghastly thing called the reply card” to solve the problem. The first time she created one, she forgot to leave a space for people to write their names, and so she ended up with a bunch of yeses and nos but no clue who they were from. Her first event for the queen was a disco at Windsor Castle for Prince Charles, then 15, and Princess Anne, then 13. “My business started before the discothèque was invented,” she said. “So when this man told me he was going to charge me £25 to put on records for the evening, I thought, ‘Is this man absolutely crazy?’ Anybody can put on a gramophone record. ” She soon learned it was “an art form. ” A party for the Rolling Stones ended with the police showing up as guests were drunkenly throwing unopened bottles of Dom Pérignon into the Thames, but generally Lady Elizabeth’s events are known for their calm elegance and thoughtful touches. At a   dinner for 40 people last month hosted by royalty at the cavernous, drafty Victoria  Albert Museum, Lady Elizabeth marched over to “my little Indian caftan man on the Portobello Road” and bought a load of white pashminas to drape on each chair. She hid   bottles underneath cushions. (She also suggested to guests that they wear “heat tech from Uniqlo. ”) “It’s that ghastly boring phrase ‘the devil’s in the details. ’” she said. “The devil is in the detail, and the detail doesn’t need to cost very much. ” She can do strict protocol  —   working out what year various marquesses or earls were created to determine seniority (and thus seating arrangements)  —   but she is not afraid to break it, along with convention. Glynn Woodin, who has worked with her for 30 years as the managing director of Mustard Catering, a society favorite, recalled that recently she decided the damask tablecloth (Mr. Woodin described its color as “eau de vie with a bit of olive”) would look better flipped upside down, using the rougher textured side. “We were doing a party absolutely littered with royals,” he said. “You and I would be horrified to use a cloth on the wrong side, but it was exactly right. ” She has never advertised. Instead, she attributes her success in part to being “terribly, terribly shy”  —   she still bemoans a party she never quite made it to years ago where, dressed in a red velvet trouser suit and with her hair freshly done, she stood by the elevator watching people go in, unable to summon the nerve to do the same. And so she arranges party spaces with the timid in mind. “The downfall of any party in the countryside is to walk into a hall and be confronted by a dance floor,” she said. “And some young man has driven you down, so he’s got a girl on both arms, and what do you do with yourself?” Her solution: a   bar, which she calls a “picking up and dumping ground. ” With multiple events a week, she said she has little time for hobbies, though she was an avid “Downton Abbey” watcher (dismayed as she was by the dining room tablecloth  —   “a   table was a butler’s pride and joy”).

What is it? The leaks. Yes, leaks. There is a leaker in the White House. There is a traitor inside the people’s house  —   a traitor who must be taken out. That person is an enemy of the United States. That person [is] doing enormous damage not just for the president, who is certainly capable of taking care of himself, but instead to our nation. ” “This leaker needs to be found immediately, no holds barred,” she added.

2846,Doctors in Aleppo Tend to Scores of Victims in Gas Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   As rebel negotiators unveiled a new plan on Wednesday for a political transition in Syria, doctors in the city of Aleppo were still treating people in intensive care after an attack believed to involve the use of chlorine gas sickened more than 120 people, including 10 women and 37 children. At least two people died in the attack, which witnesses said was carried out by government forces in the   section of Aleppo. Rescuers and citizen journalists who went to the scene said by text message that there had been a strong smell of bleach. One of the victims, a    girl named Hajer Kyali, died Wednesday afternoon. She had been in intensive care since the attack, which doctors said they believed had struck her family’s house directly, delivering a deadly dose of the gas. Medical staff members described seeing people with symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, sneezing, irritation of the eyes, nausea and in some cases respiratory failure. Such symptoms are consistent with attacks involving chlorine, which can kill in high concentrations. Rescue workers also said that four members of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group had been killed responding to attacks in the past day in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib, both in “ ” strikes that hit the area a second time to target rescuers. The rescue workers said the Sukari district, the same neighborhood hit by the suspected chlorine attack on Tuesday, was struck on Wednesday by two barrel bombs, killing an estimated 20 people, according to witnesses and rescuers. Doctors were still working to confirm the final death toll. In London, the Syrian oppositions’ negotiating body, the High Negotiations Committee, presented a new vision of a political transition to end the civil war, now in its sixth year. The group said that it would preserve the human rights of all Syrians and the institutions of the state, including the military, and seek to avoid the mistakes made by the United States occupation in Iraq. That means having a military council made up of both   and opposition figures, and no wholesale purges, with punishment only for those directly responsible for crimes. The committee’s leader, Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister who defected after a crackdown on protests that began in 2011, laid out the plan in London at a meeting of countries supporting the opposition. He said that the group could talk with members of President Bashar  ’s government but that, at the end of the negotiation process, Mr. Assad should leave office  —   a proposal that fails to resolve an impasse with Russia and the Assad government, which insist that he can stay in office during a political transition. The gas attack came three years after the Syrian government agreed to give up its chemical weapons program under a deal brokered by the United States and Russia. It also accompanied several days of intense aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo by government and allied Russian forces that have continued as Russian and American diplomats seek to negotiate a   deal. There was no independent confirmation of who carried out the attack or that chlorine was used the Assad government and its armed opponents have accused each other of using chlorine as a weapon of war. A recent United Nations report determined that both the government and Islamic State militants have used chemical weapons on several occasions. In Aleppo, the forces fighting the government range from groups with American backing to factions that until recently were officially affiliated with Al Qaeda. The Islamic State is not a player in the city. The first death reported from the gas attack in Sukari was that of Abdulkareem Afefa, 29. Numerous videos and photographs that doctors, rescuers and witnesses shared online showed men, women and children being treated with oxygen. Abdelkafi   an activist and citizen journalist who filmed the aftermath of the attack, said that when he arrived at the scene, the fumes were still so strong that he could not catch his breath. “I couldn’t speak to the camera without a mask,” he said. Mr. Hamdo said that some people at the scene had reached such a level of despair  —   having concluded that publicizing such attacks brings no help from the outside world and may even bring more danger  —   that they tried to stop him from filming. “Some people think that if they told the world that they are being killed, Assad will drop many weapons on them,” he said. He added that people had told him they believed the government was targeting civilians to encourage them to flee, and that showing many civilian victims makes the area a good target for the next attack. “The message from Assad and Russia is this: ‘You have to accept my conditions or die,’” he said. The sputtering negotiations over a   include a Russian proposal for civilians to leave the area residents fear they will never be allowed back. Russia and the government say that civilians have been taken hostage by the fighters in   areas. “Nothing, just chemical once again, don’t worry, don’t be sad, it is normal,” Aref   an   activist with the Aleppo Media Center, said in a sarcastic text message as he shared his photographs of victims. In 2013, after sarin gas attacks killed more than 1, 000 people in   suburbs of Damascus, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing militarily enforceable sanctions for any party using chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia has blocked the use of those sanctions against the Syrian government, which denies it was responsible. Under threat of United States retaliation for the sarin attacks, the government agreed to eliminate its previously secret chemical weapons program. Chlorine gas is not listed as a banned chemical weapon in the international Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria agreed to join under the agreement, but its use as a military weapon is banned under international law.",0
2847,Donald Trump: Steve Bannon ‘a Very Decent Guy’ Getting ‘a Bad Rap’,"President Donald Trump defended his team of rivals in the White House, specifically his senior advisors Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner. [“Bannon   …     he’s actually a very good guy,” Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News. The president joked that sometimes he called Bannon “ ” and suggested that he was “more of a libertarian” despite his widely recognized populist nationalist politics.  “You know, they give him a bad rap,” Trump added. “Bannon is a very decent guy who feels very strongly about the country. ” Trump defended his    Jared Kushner as “a very brilliant young guy” who was getting along with Bannon, after their widely reported feud in the White House. “They’re getting along fine   …     they’re getting along well,” Trump said, although he admitted that “for a while it was a little testy” between the two of them. He acknowledged that his team was “very competitive” and tried to dispel the notion that Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer were rivals. He specifically praised Sean Spicer for getting great television ratings. “He’s become the biggest star on television now, you know?” Trump said. “He’s getting more than the ‘Bold and the Beautiful’ guys, those handsome guys that they pay a fortune, right?” Trump said he expected to keep his team intact, but hinted that “probably people are going to get job offers. ” “You know, things happen,” he said. “But, but I’m very happy with our group. We’re doing very well. ”",0
2848,Donald Trump Dismisses ’Golden Showers’: ‘I’m Very Much a Germaphobe’ - Breitbart,"  Donald Trump denounced some of the unsubstantiated rumors published by left wing blogs about Trump receiving “golden showers” from prostitutes while he was in Russia. [“Does anyone really believe that story?” Trump asked incredulously during his press conference at Trump Tower, after he was asked about his behavior in Russia.  “I’m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way, believe me,” he added. Trump asserted that as a high profile person, he was “extremely careful” about his activity in hotel rooms and was extremely suspicious about hidden cameras. “I’m surrounded by people and I always tell them anywhere, but I always tell them, if I’m leaving this country, be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you’re going to probably have cameras,” he said.",0
2849,Cancer Patient Awaits Day She Can Return to the Kitchen - The New York Times,"Stuffed inside cookie tins and between the pages of books in Diane Fields’s kitchen are multitudes of recipes. Ms. Fields has clipped them from newspapers and kept them for years, intent on preparing and sampling them all. But for the past year, a cancer diagnosis has cast those aspirations in doubt. “I won’t have the chance to cook my recipes,” said Ms. Fields, 69, who received the diagnosis in late 2015. “These are the things that come to mind when you go through something like this. ” The first sign that something was wrong came in November last year with painful stomach cramps. Doctors told Ms. Fields that she had pancreatic cancer, the same cancer that claimed the lives of one of her grandmothers in 2004 and a brother in 2010. Ms. Fields was already saddled with health problems, including heart disease, osteoporosis and a torn meniscus that forced her to retire in 2009 as a senior case manager at a maternity shelter. “I didn’t cry,” Ms. Fields recalled. “My first inclination was what are we going to do about it? What kind of options do I have?” Last December, she began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan to try to shrink her tumors. Ms. Fields is still undergoing chemotherapy. “With chemo, if I’m not sick, I’m still tired,” she said. Even simple tasks, like a walk to the corner store, have left Ms. Fields suddenly and drastically immobilized. She feels discouraged about leaving her home. Her only child, Kimberly Fields, 46, is constantly by her mother’s side. She had moved into her mother’s apartment in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn a couple of years earlier when she was between jobs in retail. When her mother learned she had cancer, Kimberly Fields postponed her job search. “Since I was here anyway, I said, ‘Let me take care of my mother,’” she said. “I don’t mind certain things. I’m not saying it’s not stressful, but it’s good stress. It’s my mother. ” In addition to the crippling fatigue, the cancer has taken a psychological toll. Ms. Fields has found herself snapping at strangers for minor offenses and grousing about her daughter’s overprotective nature. Her daughter hesitates to allow her to venture out on her own, leaving Ms. Fields frustrated by her confinement. “Thank God she’s here. She helps me,” Diane Fields said. “But you want to be able to do stuff on your own. ” In May, Ms. Fields was dealt another setback. She was moved to a different insurance plan and forced to reapply for Medicaid. She then learned that the $1, 027 in Social Security benefits she receives each month disqualified her from regular Medicaid, and that she was responsible for paying $184 a month to offset the surplus income. This new financial demand, in addition to her medication costs, led to dwindling savings and put her rent into arrears. At that time, Ms. Fields sought the help of Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. It used $500 in Neediest funds to cover the missing portion of her rent. In November, Ms. Fields was granted a fair hearing from the state to object to her Medicaid changes. She succeeded, was reimbursed for past surplus payments and no longer has to pay the additional $184 every month. With that resolved, battling her cancer remains at the forefront. The mother and daughter try to stay strong, often to lift each other’s spirits. Ms. Fields said her first good cry had happened in private, and many months after the diagnosis. “I don’t know what it was that made me start crying,” she said. “I was just sitting here thinking, and I just started crying, to let it out. ” The Fieldses greet each day with faith, optimism and gratitude. Diane Fields praises her doctors and fellow patients at Sloan Kettering for their boundless optimism. “I’m not going to say you’re not frightened,” Ms. Fields said. “But you can’t just lie down and say this is it. ” When she regains her strength, the recipes she has clipped will be waiting for her. So will a slow cooker, still in its packaging and sitting on a kitchen shelf. And she is eager to pull out her bread maker for a pizza dough recipe she has wanted to prepare. “I haven’t been able to do all that yet, but once the cancer’s gone, I will,” Ms. Fields said.",0
2850,"Report: 90,000 Christians Killed for Their Faith in 2016","During the year 2016, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith around the world, according to a new study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). [The director of CESNUR and leader of the study, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world, and the numbers of those affected are staggering.  Christians are targeted primarily for two reasons, Introvigne said, “first because their proclamation of peace disturbs more belligerent groups and second, because their social teachings on life, family and poverty are opposed by powerful forces. ” While in the past century, atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians, Introvigne added, the geopolitical landscape has changed considerably since then and the actors have changed as well. While “Communism’s last salvoes” are still responsible for some   of Christians, Introvigne told Breitbart, “Islamic  ” has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. Introvigne’s findings coincide with those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 “World Watch List,” for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer “extreme persecution” had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. The 2016 report found that “Islamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine” of Christians in the world today and that “40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. ” Introvigne told Breitbart that in Nigeria, “over the last 12 years, the most reliable estimates assess at more than 10, 000 the Christians killed by the Islamic   organization Nigeria’s Boko Haram. ” Yet while some groups, like Boko Haram, are private organizations, in a number of countries, “persecution of Christians is actually promoted by the governments,” Introvigne said. “Several Muslim countries still have laws punishing apostasy —  converting from Islam to another religion,” he noted. “Others have laws against blasphemy, and some tend to consider any criticism of Islam as blasphemy. ” While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. CESNUR’s annual study, which is slated for release next month, indicates that between 500 and 600 million Christians were in some way persecuted and prevented from freely practicing their faith.

2851,Russian Executive Sues BuzzFeed Over Unverified Trump Dossier - The New York Times,"A Russian technology executive who was named in a dossier containing unverified allegations about connections between President Trump and the Russian government has sued BuzzFeed News, which published the information. The defamation suit was filed in court on Friday in Broward County, Fla. according to lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, the chief of XBT, a technology company based in Luxembourg. The suit focuses on allegations, made near the end of the dossier, that Mr. Gubarev and his company were involved in hacking operations against the leadership of the Democratic Party. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers say that BuzzFeed acted recklessly that none of the statements have any basis in fact and that Mr. Gubarev’s association with the dossier has left his reputation “in tatters,” compromised his family’s security and damaged his company’s business prospects. It called BuzzFeed’s decision “perhaps one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern ‘journalism. ’” The publishing of the dossier was one of the most startling moments of the weeks before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Compiled by a former British intelligence operative who was hired by Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals and later by supporters of Hillary Clinton, the document had circulated for months among   government officials and journalists. The veracity of its claims had been investigated but never proved. But after CNN reported last month that intelligence officials had presented a summary of the allegations to Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama, BuzzFeed decided to publish the document in full, saying that “Americans can make up their own minds about allegations about the   that have circulated at the highest levels of the U. S. government. ” When it published the dossier, BuzzFeed noted that it contained errors and that its claims had not been verified. The publication’s editor in chief, Ben Smith, later wrote that its reporters in the United States and Europe spent weeks investigating the report. BuzzFeed ignited a debate over both the claims in the report as well as the outlet’s decision to break from typical journalistic practices in publishing it. Mr. Trump denounced the unproven claims as a   smear, and called BuzzFeed a “failing pile of garbage” during a heated news conference on Jan. 11. Mr. Gubarev’s lawsuit claims that while more than 30 publications tried to contact him after the dossier’s publication, he was not contacted by BuzzFeed for his response to the allegations. Mr. Gubarev, 36, lives in Cyprus with his wife and three children. He founded the site Webzilla  —   which is also identified in the report, the complaint notes  —   and built it into an international business, XBT, with more than 300 employees around the world. The lawsuit was filed in Florida, where Webzilla is registered. A federal lawsuit over the publishing of a sex tape featuring the wrestler Hulk Hogan that led the website Gawker to file for bankruptcy and eventually shut down was also filed in the state. That case, over invasion of privacy, remains a cautionary tale in the media world. After learning of the lawsuit on Friday, BuzzFeed removed the names of Mr. Gubarev and his company from the dossier. “We have redacted Mr. Gubarev’s name from the published dossier, and apologize for including it,” the company said in an emailed statement to The New York Times. A spokesman for BuzzFeed said it had redacted other names in the document and should have redacted Mr. Gubarev’s, but the spokesman defended the company’s decision to publish the dossier. Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers have also filed a lawsuit in Britain against the former intelligence agent who compiled the report and his consulting company. The lawsuit against BuzzFeed comes at a tense moment for the news media. Mr. Trump’s administration has castigated journalists for challenging unverified or false claims presented by the White House as fact, and the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has labeled the news media “the opposition party. ” Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment scholar and lawyer, said the lawsuit was a “difficult situation for BuzzFeed to be confronted with. ” “It seems inevitable that BuzzFeed will say in some fashion that subjecting it to crippling damages for publishing the dossier would, in the end, imperil the public’s right to know just what misconduct an American president” is suspected of, he said. He added that he could foresee lawyers arguing to move the case to federal court or to a court outside Florida. In the complaint, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers argue that he is not a public figure. But if the court disagrees, Mr. Gubarev’s lawyers would have to prove that BuzzFeed acted not only negligently, but also maliciously. One potential argument for defense lawyers is a principle called neutral reportage, which defends the publishing of some defamatory material if it is a matter of public interest and “does it in a fair and disinterested manner, without endorsing a defamatory charge,” Mr. Abrams said. The principle has been rejected by some courts, however, and has not been tested widely, he added. “I would think that wherever this case is heard, an absolutely central issue will be whether a court would adopt the neutral reportage principle and say basically precisely what the editor of BuzzFeed has been saying  —   that this is an enormous matter of public interest, we reported it fairly, we did not endorse it, we made very clear that these were simply charges that were well known to everyone but the American public,” he said.",0
2852,Dannenfelser: Trump’s SCOTUS Finalists Would Defend Life - Breitbart,"I’m proud to have made the   case for Donald Trump during the presidential campaign. Now that he’s been sworn in, I’m eager to help him build a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v. Wade and wipe out the “abortion distortion” that has plagued judicial rulings for decades. So when it comes to filling Justice Scalia’s vacancy, it’s essential to assess how the various candidates on President Trump’s Supreme Court list measure up on that score. [That’s why I must respectfully disagree with Andy Schlafly, son of the late and great Phyllis Schlafly, whose vocal opposition to almost all of the candidates on President Trump’s list has caused confusion and consternation among   activists. Schlafly claims there is only one candidate among the 21 on the President’s list worthy of his endorsement.  Even candidates like 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, who has decried Roe v. Wade as the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law” and as having “led to the slaughter of millions of innocent unborn children,” do not satisfy Schlafly’s qualifications. Pryor has won my approval, and has strong backing from Federalist Society, Alliance Defending Freedom and others whose opinion I highly value. Phyllis Schlafly herself helped put several candidates on President Trump’s list. She praised them as “ . ” Former Scalia clerk Ed Whelan (who has long argued for Roe to be overruled) has thoroughly argued against Schlafly’s criticisms. Last week Whelan wrote a response to Schlafly’s condemnation of 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch pointing out that Gorsuch, in a powerful opinion, argued for allowing the state of Utah to defund Planned Parenthood, America’s largest abortion business. Gorsuch has written a doctoral dissertation and a book arguing against assisted suicide and euthanasia and has also declared that “human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. ” Further, Gorsuch strongly supported the   rights of Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor against the HHS mandate on abortifacient drugs and devices. Schlafly claims that Gorsuch “thinks courts should not correct their own mistaken precedents. ” But the sentence written by Gorsuch quoted by Schlafly, from the panel ruling in a case United States v.   goes on to call for his court to overturn its wrong precedent. Schlafly also criticizes the Federalist Society for not being, and never being,  . The Federalist Society doesn’t take institutional positions on any issues. But Justice Scalia helped to found the Federalist Society and remained a good friend of it until his death, precisely because of the sound legal principles that the Federalist Society helps to promote. I have every confidence that the Federalist Society is helping President Trump fulfill his pledge to appoint   justices. Truth is the   movement’s strongest ally in our fight to change hearts and minds in the culture while also building protections for the unborn into our nation’s law.  The names being surfaced as finalists for President Trump’s Supreme Court pick provide an historic opportunity to fill the Supreme Court with strong Constitutionalists who would defend the right to life of Americans born and unborn. Marjorie Dannenfelser is the president of the Susan B. Anthony List. ",0
2853,"Countering Trump, Bipartisan Voices Strongly Affirm Findings on Russian Hacking - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   A united front of top intelligence officials and senators from both parties on Thursday forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election, directly rebuffing   Donald J. Trump’s repeated questioning of Russia’s role. They suggested that the doubts Mr. Trump has expressed on Twitter about the agencies’ competence and impartiality were undermining their morale. “There’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement,” James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the Russian hacks. He added that “our assessment now is even more resolute” that the Russians carried out the attack on the election. The Senate hearing was the prelude to an extraordinary meeting scheduled for Friday, when Mr. Clapper and other intelligence chiefs will repeat for Mr. Trump the same detailed, highly classified briefing on the Russian attack that President Obama received on Thursday. In effect, they will be telling the   that the spy agencies believe he won with an assist from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Then Mr. Trump will have to say whether he accepts the agencies’ basic findings on Russia’s role or holds to his previous contention that inept, politicized American spies have gotten the perpetrator of the hacking wrong. That would throw the intelligence agencies into a crisis of credibility and status with few, if any, precedents. In a pair of Twitter posts early Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the scorn he had previously expressed for the intelligence agencies’ work, as well as from his embrace of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, which released most of the hacked emails of Democratic officials. “The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange  —   wrong,” he wrote. “I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!” But on Thursday night, the   returned to Twitter and appeared to underscore his doubts about the F. B. I. ’s investigation of the hacking. “The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia,” he wrote, a day after a report by BuzzFeed on the issue. “So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?” Early next week, the public will get its fullest information to date on the evidence the agencies have to support their contention that Mr. Putin’s government used the hacked emails to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign and help Mr. Trump’s. Mr. Clapper said he would “push the envelope” to include as much detail as possible in the unclassified version of the intelligence agencies’ report on the Russian operation. The hacking, he added, was only one part of that operation, which also included the dissemination of “classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news. ” Mr. Clapper will step down as intelligence director later this month after a career in intelligence and military service that began when he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961. His replacement is expected to be Dan Coats, a retired senator from Indiana, a Trump transition official said Thursday. A   conservative who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Coats would oversee the nation’s 16 intelligence agencies in a job that was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to improve the sharing of information, but that is sometimes criticized as adding a layer of bureaucracy. The Coats news came on the same day that R. James Woolsey, a former C. I. A. director, stepped down as a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, citing his diminishing role in the transition. The Senate hearing on Thursday, devoted to foreign cyberthreats, was unusual as much for its context as its content  —   a public, bipartisan display of support for the intelligence community that seemed aimed, at times, at an audience of one. Though Mr. Clapper and most Republican senators were careful to avoid antagonizing the   directly, the hearing spoke to the rift Mr. Trump has threatened to create between the incoming administration and the intelligence officials assigned to inform it. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the committee, said the purpose of the gathering was “not to question the outcome of the presidential election” but to move forward with a full understanding of what had happened. Repeatedly, though, Mr. McCain and his colleagues seemed to undercut Mr. Trump’s past messages of support for Russia, and for Mr. Assange of WikiLeaks. “Do you think there’s any credibility we should attach to this individual?” Mr. McCain asked. “Not in my view,” Mr. Clapper said. Another witness at the hearing, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, said he agreed. The intelligence director said he welcomed skeptical questioning from Mr. Trump, allowing that the intelligence community was “not perfect. ” “We are an organization of human beings, and we’re prone, sometimes, to make errors,” Mr. Clapper said. But he said the agencies had learned from their failures, notably their declaration that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Democrats on the committee repeatedly coaxed intelligence leaders to rebut Mr. Trump’s multiple assertions that a random individual hacker might have hacked Democratic targets. Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana, told Mr. Clapper that in the conflict between the intelligence agencies and Mr. Assange over Russian responsibility for the attack, “We’re on your side every time. ” He asked Mr. Clapper to convey his level of confidence in attributing the election attack to Russia, rather than “someone in his basement. ” “It’s, uh, very high,” the laconic intelligence director replied. At one point, Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, wondered aloud “who benefits from a   trashing the intelligence community. ” Ms. McCaskill said there would be “howls from the Republican side of the aisle” if a Democrat had spoken about intelligence officials as Mr. Trump had. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and Mrs. Clinton’s running mate, used the occasion for an aside about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, who has a history of sharing discredited news stories and conspiracy theories. Mr. Kaine said that he was unsure whether Mr. Flynn was acting out of “gullibility” or “malice,” but that it was a cause for “great concern” that Mr. Flynn shared stories that “most fourth graders would find incredible. ” No Republican lawmakers embraced Mr. Trump’s remarks casting doubt on the intelligence conclusions, though some were more conspicuous than others in their efforts to distance themselves. Perhaps the closest to a defense of Mr. Trump came from Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. Denouncing “imprecise language” stating that Russia “hacked the election,” Mr. Cotton asked Mr. Clapper to confirm that the actual balloting was not affected. Mr. Cotton also suggested that the conventional wisdom that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton might be wrong. Mr. Trump promised a stronger military and more American oil and gas production  —   policies Mr. Cotton suggested would not be to Russia’s advantage. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the Obama administration for its response to the Russian attack. He said the White House had lobbed mere “pebbles” in retaliation for the interference. “When it comes to interfering with our election, we better be ready to throw rocks,” he said. Then Mr. Graham issued a warning for fellow Republicans who might be inclined to brush off any attack on an opposing party. “Could it be Republicans next election?” he asked. “It’s not like we’re so much better at cybersecurity than Democrats. ”",0
2855,Rep. Marsha Blackburn: FCC Rule-Change Vote Eliminates Obama Admin Internet Tax and Regulatory Power Grab,"Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( ) discussed the possible elimination of the FCC’s 2016 broadband privacy rules on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow. [“The Senate, under the leadership of Sen. Flake, took this up last week,” Blackburn said. “What we are doing is recalling a privacy rule that the FCC issued right at the end of the Obama administration, and the reason we are doing this is because it is additional and duplicative regulation. ”  “The FCC already has the ability to oversee privacy with broadband providers,” she explained. “That is done primarily through Section 222 of the Communications Act, and additional authority is granted through Sections 201 and 202. Now, what they did was to go outside of their bounds and expand that. They did a swipe at the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC. They have traditionally been our nation’s primary privacy regulator, and they have done a very good job of it. ”  “What the FCC did was clearly overreach. It gives you two sets of regulators that you’re trying to comply with, not one. So we are recalling the FCC’s rule, and that authority will go back to the FTC,” she said. Blackburn said Congress wants to ensure “privacy is being overseen, protected, and that when there is a necessity for enforcement, that it’s being exercised  —   if there is a necessity for penalties, that they are being placed. ” “In the physical space, that has rested with the FTC,” she noted. “So if someone were to abridge your online privacy and sell your information without your knowledge, without your consent, that would be something that the regulators would go after. Let’s say if someone starts to wholesale sell your data, and you said, ‘Do not share my data. Do not share my information,’ that’s the kind of effect that it has. ” She said Congress was aware of the need for more privacy and   legislation, as opposed to regulations promulgated by agencies. “The other thing with the broadband providers, let’s say your ISP which is holding data, and they were to scoop up that data and then begin to sell that history without your knowledge. They are prohibited from doing that, and the FCC currently has the authority to go after them. The FTC has the ability to protect consumers, and that is what they do. They are the primary regulator. But let’s say an ISP begins to sell that data, then there would be complaints filed, and the FCC would go after that broadband provider under the regulations that are on the books,” Blackburn said. Marlow raised criticism that Internet users will be exploited by aggressive advertisers if the 2016 FCC rule is recalled. “What the Obama administration did  —   and I will say they did this against this, against the wishes of a lot of Democrats  —   they reclassified your Internet service as Title II, which is a common carrier classification. It is the rule that governs telephone usage,” Blackburn responded. “Those rules were put on the books in the thirties. So what the Democrats did, and this was pushed by the White House in the last administration, they reclassified Internet, which is an information service, as a telephone service, and then put those   rules on top of your Internet service. ”  “They did that so they could tax it, so they could begin to regulate it. Then one of the additional regulations  —   which is going to cost money for compliance and paperwork and additional bureaucrats  —   one of those regulations is privacy. But as we say, the authority that they need to oversee broadband is already articulated in Section 222 of the Communications Act,” she said.  “You don’t need another layer of regulation. It’s like flashing alerts: We don’t need net neutrality. We don’t need Title II. We don’t need additional regulations heaped on the Internet under Title II. The Internet is not broken. It has done just fine without the government controlling it. That’s the way it should stay,” she contended. Blackburn said Democrats “think government is the solution for all things. It should be either the bureaucracy or the courts that are solving the problems. ” “To them, another added layer of regulation, where you are having a federal agency require compliance of businesses, so now they’re having to file compliance papers with two regulators, not one  —   they don’t see a problem with that,” she charged. “What we’re saying is, it is unnecessary it’s an added cost to doing business. Who pays those costs of doing business? It’s the consumer. It’s the end user. ” Blackburn said Ajit Pai is “doing a great job as chairman of the FCC. ” “He was my pick to lead the FCC, and I’m thrilled that he is there,” she said. “He understands the utilization of the Internet, all the   components. He understands the backbone of the Internet and what and how it works. He understands why we need to be careful with spectrum so that we increase broadband deployment and utilize that spectrum in the Internet of Everything. Ajit knows that these components are critical for economic growth and jobs growth in this country. ”  “We are very fortunate to have someone with skill set and understanding as we turn the corner and put the focus on broadband expansion in the country. I’m looking forward to working with him. I talk with him regularly,” she said.  “We are going to go through reauthorization of the FCC, which has not been done since the early nineties. We are going to go through reauthorization of the NPIA. We’re going to put some emphasis on spectrum management and spectrum utilization from a government and also a private sector standpoint and do what we can to get broadband into these unserved areas across the country. We’re full steam ahead on that,” she promised. Marlow suggested unsolicited robocalls are an annoyance the American public would like to see controlled more tightly. “That is something that’s called the TCPA. Looking at how individuals interface with their customers is what we will do in that,” Blackburn replied, referring to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. “We’ll pull that up after we do reauthorizations and then do a revisit on some of the components of the TCPA. ” “People who want to work with their customers need the ability to do   with them, but we also want to make certain that people are not harassed, if you will, by unwanted marketing calls,” she said.

2856,Covering Fashion Shows With a Functional iPhone Keyboard - The New York Times,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? The Times’s fashion director and critic discusses the tech she uses. As a fashion critic, what’s your favorite tech product that helps you spot and keep track of fashion trends? My iPhone 5, embarrassing as that is to say, and my laptop. I am stuck with my iPhone 5 because I have a keyboard attachment for it that turns it into a BlackBerry, and which I love because during fashion shows I file reviews on my phone and they can be 1, 000 words long. I can’t do that on a touch screen. I hate lugging anything bigger than the phone around since I carry so much else. I also use the gadgets mostly to surf around Instagram and Facebook and various news sites to see what regular people are wearing during their everyday lives in places I am not. For runway trends, I just use my eyes. You’ve written a lot about wearable technology. Are smartwatches ever going to be fashionable enough to replace normal watches? I am sure they will be at some point, but who knows when that will be. The problem is they just look too much like gadgets  —   or like wannabe traditional watches. Someone has to come up with a third paradigm. Then whoever does that will be in clover. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? My Kindle. It’s really the only other tech product I use. I have gone through iPad and tablet phases, and smartwatch moments, but they all end up in the back of a drawer somewhere or my kids take them. I am really interested in tech that is efficient and functional and solves problems that are real problems, not theoretical ones. After that, I find it hard to get worked up. What do you and your family do with it? Read! Plus a Kindle is very good to take to shows, because I am lugging a heavy bag full of stuff all day, and it is light and takes up almost no room. And it gives me something to occupy my mind during the endless minutes I spend waiting for shows to start. What could be better about it? The light. Shows have very complicated lighting plans and sometimes that makes it hard to read. What is your children’s favorite piece of technology and why? The favorite app for my    and    daughters are Snapchat and SoundCloud. That’s because they can use Snapchat to connect with their friends and stay in touch with those that are far away, and SoundCloud because it is easy and a good way to find new music and fun remixes. For my    son: Spotify, because he loves listening to music. Favorite piece of technology (from all of them): their iPhones. It is like another limb for them.",0
2857,Obama Just EXPOSED Trying to Sabotage Clinton Email Investigation ⋆ USA 24,"November 1, 2016 
You know Hillary Clinton is getting desperate when she begins resorting to cheap tricks like this one… 
As you already know, yesterday the FBI announced that they will be reopening the Clinton email investigation following the discovery of new emails on Anthony Weiner ’s laptop that Hillary thought she had deleted. 
Well, as a last ditch effort to try and save her career, President Obama stepped in last minute and Ordered Attorney General Loretta Lynch to tell Comey to back off and not release the information to the public!! 
You see, technically Loretta Lynch is in charge of the FBI by being attorney general. She approached Comey directly when she learned about the information and ordered him to stand down, saying he was violating Department of Justice policy. 
According to her, it would “interfere with the election.” 
James Comey, however, was apparently sick and tired of being bossed around. He stared back at her and declared that he had a duty to Congress and the American people to let them know what is REALLY going on. 
Comey said, 
“I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE MISLEADING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE WE NOT TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD.” 
So thank you, FBI Director Comey, for finally growing a pair and standing up to the Hillary Clinton and Obama machine. Now the American people know the TRUTH about Hillary Clinton, and that will end her reign of terror. 
If you want to show Comey your support, then share this out so everyone can see that the man is a hero just in case Obama uses some dirty trick to try and sabotage him too… ",0
2858,"Roger Ailes, Arguing Gretchen Carlson Breached Contract, Presses for Arbitration - The New York Times","Lawyers for the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes filed a motion on Friday arguing that the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, should be moved from a New Jersey Superior Court into federal court and submitted for arbitration. Mr. Ailes’s lawyers said Ms. Carlson’s suit, which they called a “   campaign,” was a breach of her contract. The contract, they said, included a confidentiality agreement stipulating that any disputes should first go into arbitration. The motion was filed on Friday in a federal court in Newark. The motion also contends that the case should not be heard in a New Jersey Superior Court since Mr. Ailes maintains that his primary residence is in Garrison, N. Y. not in New Jersey, as the lawsuit said. Ms. Carlson lives in Connecticut. “Gretchen Carlson had an arbitration clause in her contract, stating that any employment dispute regarding her employment at Fox News must be done via confidential arbitration,” Barry Asen, Mr. Ailes’s lawyer, said in a statement. “Because Ms. Carlson’s lawsuit violated the arbitration clause, a motion was filed in federal court to have the case arbitrated. The federal court is the proper court to decide the motion because Ms. Carlson’s primary residence is in Connecticut and Mr. Ailes’s primary residence is in New York. ” Ms. Carlson’s lawyers said Mr. Ailes was trying to force the case into a secret proceeding, and away from the public spotlight of a trial. “Gretchen never agreed to arbitrate anything with Mr. Ailes, and the contract on which he relies does not mention him and is not signed by him,” her lawyers, Nancy Erika Smith and Martin Hyman, said in a statement. “Gretchen intends to fight for her right to a public jury trial, a right protected by the discrimination laws and our Constitution. ’’ Ms. Carlson did not name Fox News in the lawsuit. Mr. Ailes is the only defendant. In her lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday, Ms. Carlson argued that she was fired from her weekday afternoon show on Fox News when she rebuffed sexual advances from Mr. Ailes, and that she was a victim of sexual harassment both from him and the “Fox and Friends” host Steve Doocy. The suit sent shock waves throughout the media industry since Ms. Carlson, 50, was a prominent Fox News personality and an   veteran of the network, and Mr. Ailes, 76, is one of the most powerful men in television news. Mr. Ailes emphatically denied the charges in the suit and said Ms. Carlson’s contract was not renewed because of poor ratings. Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, said on Wednesday that it is conducting an internal review of the matter.",0
2859,"Donald Trump, Fort Lauderdale: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The declassified version of the intelligence report on Russian hacking ordered by President Obama found that Russia’s leader, Vladimir V. Putin, “ordered an influence campaign” to sway the 2016 election. He turned from seeking to “denigrate” Hillary Clinton to developing “a clear preference” for Donald J. Trump, the report states. Mr. Trump was briefed on the report’s contents by the nation’s top intelligence and law enforcement officials. Afterward, the   acknowledged the possibility that Russia had hacked a variety of targets, but asserted that the hacking had not affected the outcome of the election. _____ 2. At least five people were killed and eight wounded in a shooting at Fort   International Airport in Florida. The gunman targeted people in the baggage claim area of a terminal used by Delta and Air Canada, and was quickly taken into custody. Senator Bill Nelson identified him as Esteban Santiago and said he was carrying a military identification. _____ 3.   Trump acknowledged that Mexico will not be paying for a wall at the border, at least now. Mr. Trump said the wall could be built faster with U. S. taxpayer money  —   but he still insisted that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States, probably through a renegotiated trade agreement. _____ 4. The last jobs report of the Obama administration showed tepid job growth but also a    rise in wages. Our economics reporter says that for all of Mr. Trump’s attacks on President Obama’s economic policies, he will inherit an economy that is fundamentally solid, with consumer sentiment, corporate profits and the stock markets up. _____ 5. Much of the southeastern U. S. is bracing for harsh winter storms. Many schools and government offices in Arkansas and Oklahoma were closed on Friday. A state of emergency was declared in Alabama, North Carolina and northern Georgia, including Atlanta, above. _____ 6. Russia ordered its aircraft carrier to return home from the Syrian coast, part of a general drawdown of its forces involved in the conflict. The    carrier was sent on its first combat mission last fall to mount airstrikes in support of forces loyal to President Bashar  . _____ 7. A second prison riot in a week in Brazil left at least 33 inmates dead. Local news agencies reported a gruesome scene, including decapitations, days after 56 people were killed in another riot. Officials say the violence is linked to an intensifying war among drug gangs for control of Brazil’s cocaine trade. _____ 8. Here in the U. S. opioids  —   both heroin and prescription painkillers  —   have killed more than 33, 000 people since 2015. Public health officials say it is the worst drug crisis in American history. We sent a team of reporters around the country to examine how communities are searching for solutions. We also asked readers how opioid abuse has affected them. One man wrote in from Tucson, Ariz. about his son, who became addicted to OxyContin and then heroin. “Every time he lied to me about getting clean, I would believe him and try to help him out,” he wrote. “Now I just hope his bottom is not his death. ” _____ 9. Would Hillary Clinton run for mayor of New York? While the answer is almost certainly no, that’s not stopping political buffs  —   on the right and the left  —   from discussing the question. The Clintons live in the suburbs north of the city, but Mrs. Clinton would need only to move inside the city limits by Election Day to qualify for the job (which, again, there are no signs she wants). _____ 10. Finally, the holidays are behind us. “I think we’re alone now,” writes our food editor, Sam Sifton. “Let’s cook for ourselves. ” Here are his suggestions for what to cook this weekend, including pasta with caramelized cabbage, anchovies and bread crumbs.

2861,Delingpole: EPA’s Scott Pruitt Gets Eaten Alive by Fox - Breitbart,"I just watched Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, get eaten alive by Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace. [Not only was it an ugly and painful sight but it was also a very dispiriting one.  Here is the guy who was carefully selected to be in the vanguard of President Trump’s war on the Green Blob which, for decades, has been doing untold damage to liberty, the scientific method, and the economy. And he can’t even answer a few basic and obvious questions about why the job he is doing is necessary, important, and right. Wallace asked him about the UN’s view that it was 95 percent likely that more than half the temperature increase since the   century is due to human activity. Pruitt sweated, stuttered, and floundered. Wallace asked him about NOAA’s claim that 2015 and 2016 are the hottest years on record. Pruitt had no convincing comeback. Wallace asked him the   question beloved by climate alarmists: “What if you’re wrong? What if CO2 is causing dramatic climate change and we as humans are responsible?” Pruitt just didn’t know how to respond. There should have been nothing complicated or unexpected about these questions. They are the kind of thing any   decent interviewer might have asked, be he a hostile one or a   Fox News one playing devil’s advocate. And if Scott Pruitt had had even the most cursory briefing and media training in his new role, he should have been prepared for them. Not only should he have known the most effective answers to give but he should have been so confident in the rightness and truth of his cause that he should have been able to seize the moment and make the points that really need to be made about President Trump’s environmental policy: that it is being enacted for the good of science, for the good of the economy and the core mission of Making America Great Again. How could Scott Pruitt not do this? Any one of us on the skeptical side of the argument could have pointed him to dozens of leading scientists  —   and hundreds if not thousands of papers and articles  —   that could easily have enabled Pruitt to say what needed to be said. He could have noted the incompetence, corruption, and mendacity of the heavily politicized IPCC the dishonest manipulation by organizations like NOAA  —   indeed especially NOAA  —   of the raw temperature data the utter meaninglessness of the “hottest year evah” claims so often made in the liberal media. And he could easily have batted off the “What if you’re wrong?” question by making perhaps the most important point of all that needs to be made about the “war” on “carbon”: that what it all comes down to is cost benefit analysis. To whit: the trillions of dollars being spent every year on the possibility that there might be a problem, a) could be spent much more usefully elsewhere and b) are doing more harm than good. Pruitt was incapable of doing this though because, trained lawyer though he is, he is simply not on top of his brief. This is disgraceful. It’s an embarrassment and a shambles. Worst of all, it’s an entirely needless concession to the enemy. See how it’s being reported by the   propaganda site Think Progress.",0
2862,"SOLID: 211,000 Jobs Created in April, Unemployment Falls to 4.4% - Breitbart","The American job creation machine was   in April after a disappointing March. Payrolls grew by 211, 000 jobs in the months and unemployment fell to 4. 4 percent, the lowest since May 2007. [The consensus forecast of economists was for job growth of 185, 000 and for a slight increase in unemployment.  A broader measure of unemployment known as   which includes people not actively looking for jobs as well as workers who can only find   jobs,  fell to 8. 6 percent from 8. 9 percent in March, the lowest level since November 2007.  Somewhat strangely, the decline in unemployment and rise in job creation was accompanied by a tick downward in the labor force participation rate to 62. 9 percent. Wages grew seven cents an hour to an annualized pace of 2. 5 percent, a decline from March’s 2. 7 percent rate. Economists had expected wage growth to remain unchanged. The decline in the pace of wage growth may partly be explained by types of jobs that were created in March. These were concentrated in less productive, lower paying fields, with leisure and hospitality leading the way with 55, 000 positions. March now seems to have been even more dismal than originally thought. The initial read of 98, 000 jobs was revised down to 79, 000, a remarkably low number.  February, however, was revised upward to 232, 000 from 219, 000. Overall, the report suggests that the economy is growing at a healthy pace despite the poor jobs number in March and sluggish first quarter GDP showing.",0
2863,"Republicans Facing Violence, Death Threats From Left-Wing Activists","Republicans going home to talk to their constituents are facing violence and death threats, with some lawmakers upping security at town hall events  —   a consequence of a culture of violence being fostered by   activists and their allies in the liberal media. [In the lead up to the passage of ObamaCare in 2010, conservatives were vocal at town halls and other forums in their opposition to the law. Yet, despite a great deal of speculation and fearmongering by the media, town hall events were almost entirely free of violence or threats of harm.  As the Democrats seek to mirror that opposition against President Trump and the Republican health care bill, the same commitment to   is not there. Using similar tactics to “Antifa” activists opposing conservative speakers on college campuses, some   activists are disrupting events and even resorting to threats and acts of violence.  A man was arrested last week for threatening Rep. Martha McSally ( ) in voicemail messages, telling her that her days “were numbered” because of her support for the president. The Arizona Republic reported that her district is one of the most evenly divided in the nation, but the threats are especially disturbing as she represents the district represented by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011. McSally faced one of the more extreme crowds at a town hall in February where she was heckled as activists carried signs saying, “Stop Trump’s crusade of hate” and “No! This fascist regime must be stopped before it starts. ” Some threats, allegedly from Steven Martan who was arrested by the FBI, say: “Martha our sights are set on you, right between your (expletive) eyes” and “Can’t wait to (expletive) pull the trigger (expletive),” according to the Republic. This month, a woman was arrested after she allegedly attempted to drive Rep. David Kustoff ( ) off the road over his support of the Republican health care bill after an event. When the car stopped, she is alleged to have attacked the car, hitting the windows and reaching inside the car. She was arrested after she bragged about it on Facebook. While tempting to dismiss as   incidents, the threats and attacks come amid a backdrop of a culture of violence among the left. Riots, once a rare occurrence in America, now seem commonplace from leftist thugs in the era of Trump. Hundreds of people were arrested for rioting on Trump’s Inauguration Day alone, and college campuses have seen threats and violence should they dare to invite a conservative speaker onto campus.  This has even been promoted to an extent by some liberal media outlets. In addition to the general hysteria and misinformation being pushed by some outlets (such as the false claim spread by a number of outlets that the health care reform bill would “make sexual assault a   condition”) there have been outright calls for harassment.  Two days before the attack on Kustoff, a May 10 opinion piece by Michelangelo Signorile for HuffPost told readers, “It’s time to move beyond polite protests within specified boundaries. It’s time to escalate the expression of our outrage and our anger in a massive way. ” Starting today and from here on, no elected official ― certainly those in the GOP defending and supporting Trump on a variety of issues, for example ― should be able to sit down for a nice, quiet lunch or dinner in a Washington, DC eatery or even in their own homes. They should be hounded by protestors everywhere, especially in public ― in restaurants, in shopping centers, in their districts, and yes, on the public property outside their homes and apartments, in Washington and back in their home states. A day later, a man at a town hall meeting put his hands on Rep. Kevin Cramer ( ) and tried to stuff money into his blazer to protest his support of the health care bill. The protester, Mike Quinn, was then written about sympathetically by The Washington Post, which made much of his subsequent apology to Cramer  —   but included this frightening quote from Quinn: “I was out of my mind with anger for a few moments there. ” Understandably, it now seems Republican lawmakers are taking precautions. The Hill reports that, after a catalog of violence and threats, many GOP lawmakers are fearing for their safety at town halls, and some are upping security in response.  Rep. Tom Garrett ( ) increased security at a town hall event after he received a number of death threats online  —   threats deemed “credible and real” by authorities. “Dissent is American. Praise God. We need that. That’s what made us who we are. But when it’s ‘I’m going to kill you this way. Then I’m going to kill your wife. This is what I’m going to do to your daughters,’   …     I’m not going to not share it,” Garrett told The Roanoke Times. In its report documenting the threats, The Hill noted that often it isn’t the lawmakers themselves that get the threats, but members of their families. It was the young daughter, for instance, of Rep. Jeff Fortenberry ( ) who found a sign on the family lawn: “Traitors put party above country Do the right thing for once, shithead. ” Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

2864,Days of Chaos in Baghdad: Protest or Meltdown? - The New York Times,"Hundreds of protesters stormed Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone on Saturday and entered the Parliament building, demanding an end to corruption. A day later, they began to leave. What brought on this chaos, and why did it end so quickly? Images of Iraqis storming Parliament over the weekend made it seem as though a popular revolution was at hand. In reality, it was something else: partly a legitimate expression of popular anger, but partly political theater. The episode had to be somewhat condoned by the authorities, given the ease with which the protesters were able to pass through the fortresslike security. There were reports that Prime Minister Haider   had tacitly supported the breach, although his office denied that. And a militia aligned with the protesters took over security around Parliament, suggesting a deal with the security forces. There were reports of lawmakers’ being attacked and slapped, but no one was seriously hurt. Protesters did attack the fancy vehicles of lawmakers  —   the detested black sport utility vehicles that barrel through Baghdad traffic, sirens ringing  —   and damaged furniture, desks and wall hangings in the hall of Parliament. But all in all, it was largely nonviolent. _____ They are mostly loyalists of the Shiite cleric Moktada   who rose to prominence after the American invasion of 2003. He commanded a militia that fought the Americans, then took part in the grisly sectarian war of 2005 and 2006. After national elections in 2010, he emerged as a power broker. Mr. Sadr resurfaced in February to lead protests supporting measures by Mr. Abadi to reduce government waste, tackle corruption and end sectarian quotas. The quotas have become the foundation of Iraq’s political system, apportioning government positions based on sect over merit and arguably bringing on much of the country’s dysfunction. Mr. Sadr is nominally an ally of Mr. Abadi’s, and the protests were seen as an effort to push Mr. Abadi’s opponents to approve a cabinet filled with technocrats rather than officials loyal to a party or sect. But Mr. Sadr is unpredictable and cannot be seen as a reliable ally. He has said that if further attempts to pass a new cabinet fail, he will push for Mr. Abadi’s ouster. _____ It was a tactical withdrawal. After they jubilantly occupied Parliament on Saturday afternoon, the demonstrators moved by evening to another area of the Green Zone, a former parade ground where Saddam Hussein held military pageants. By Sunday evening, Mr. Sadr had directed an orderly end to the demonstration, saying he would allow the political class another chance to meet and approve a new cabinet. He also gave notice that he would not hesitate to use his influence among downtrodden Shiites to create havoc in the streets if his grievances were not met with government reforms. _____ The deadliest fault line in Iraqi society is the divide between the majority Shiite Arabs and the minority Sunni Arabs. This is at the heart of the war between the Iraqi state  —   supported by the   coalition and Iran  —   and the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State. But the political crisis in Baghdad is largely a struggle among Shiites. The American invasion upended the old order of Sunni dominance  —   under Mr. Hussein, under the monarchy and under the Ottomans before the founding of modern Iraq at the end of World War I  —   and for the first time gave the Shiites power. Yet they have never figured out how to overcome their differences and unify Iraq. As Mr. Abadi has pushed to root out corruption, trim government and end sectarian quotas, he has been opposed by other Shiite factions. The protests  —   both those being led by Mr. Sadr and others that began last summer and at first were largely led by secular Iraqis  —   also reflect a growing anger over corruption and a failure to provide basic services. _____ The Green Zone is the name that the American military gave to the fortified heart of Baghdad that served as the seat of the occupation and the new Iraqi government. Outside the blast walls and razor wire of the Green Zone is a teeming city of traffic jams, car bombs and daily hardships like a lack of reliable electricity and clean water. But within the zone, cars move easily between checkpoints, tanks are positioned at major intersections, electricity flows and Iraqi officials live in palaces. It is home to the American Embassy, a fortress inside a fortress. For ordinary Iraqis, the Green Zone is a symbol of occupation and corruption that has long been off limits. Its breach was unprecedented, and for many of the protesters it was their first time inside, reflected in pictures of Iraqis enjoying themselves. (For an understanding of the relationship between Iraqis and the Green Zone, read this piece by Anthony Shadid, a New York Times reporter who died in 2012.) _____ Far worse, by nearly every measure. Things were not good in 2011. Al Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor of the Islamic State, was regrouping. The prime minister at the time, Nuri Kamal   was showing himself to be an authoritarian and Shiite supremacist rather than the unifier the Americans had hoped for. And the Sunni Awakening, the   program that paid former Sunni insurgents to work with Baghdad, was unraveling. Still, there was some measure of hope that Iraq could lurch forward. Now, it resembles a failed state on three basic levels: security, politics and, given the collapse in oil prices, economics. _____ For now, the withdrawal of Mr. Sadr’s followers from the Green Zone allows yet another chance for Iraq’s leaders to address the crisis and approve a new cabinet put forward by Mr. Abadi. But Iraq has not held together as a country. The northern Kurdish region is a de facto state, with its own foreign policy, army and visa rules. Roughly a third of Iraq is in the hands of the Islamic State, including Mosul, Iraq’s   city. The reach of the central government is limited, and Shiite militias with ties to Iran are in some cases more powerful than state security forces. A decade ago, as a senator, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called for the partition of Iraq, an idea that is likely to resurface if Iraq continues on the path it is taking.",0
2865,"Tim Kaine Presses Donald Trump on Health, Mocking a Doctor’s Letter - The New York Times","ERIE, Pa.  —   Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Hillary Clinton’s running mate, challenged Donald J. Trump on Tuesday to be more forthcoming about his health, taking aim at Mr. Trump over an issue he has tried to use to undermine Mrs. Clinton. As part of a lengthy critique of Mr. Trump, Mr. Kaine mocked a   letter signed last year by a doctor for Mr. Trump, which proclaimed the candidate’s strength and stamina to be “extraordinary” and declared that he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency. ” The doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, told NBC News last week that he had written the letter in five minutes while a black car waited outside his office to collect it. As for his choice of words about Mr. Trump, Dr. Bornstein said he “picked up his kind of language and then just interpreted it to my own. ” Mr. Trump “won’t even release credible information about his health,” Mr. Kaine said at a waterfront rally, where the picturesque backdrop included a   boat with the initials V. P. (for Victorian Princess, not vice president). Mr. Kaine, 58, accused Mr. Trump, 70, of withholding critical information from the public on a variety of fronts, including his tax returns and details about his business ties. “Hillary Clinton has met every test of disclosure we expect of presidential candidates  —   in many cases, has gone even further,” Mr. Kaine said. “Donald Trump has failed all of these tests miserably. ” Mrs. Clinton’s health has been the subject of conspiracy theories. Mr. Trump himself has raised questions about her fitness to serve as president, saying that Mrs. Clinton, 68, “lacks the mental and physical stamina” needed for the job. On that subject, Mr. Kaine offered a firsthand defense of Mrs. Clinton. Though he mostly campaigns separately from Mrs. Clinton, he testified to her energy on the campaign trail and told the crowd that she had been “running on full speed” for nearly a year and a half. “Can I give you an     on this?” he asked. “I have been on the trail with Hillary for five weeks, and I can barely keep up with her. ” Mr. Kaine, a lawyer by training, then offered his own medical appraisal. “I can tell you, Hillary Clinton is one tough and one healthy person,” he said. “Very, very tough and very, very healthy. ” And Mr. Kaine could not resist addressing Dr. Bornstein’s contention that Mr. Trump would be the healthiest president, especially given the White House’s    current occupant. “I’d like to see him go one on one with President Obama,” he said. “That’s for another day. ”",0
2866,Real-Time Election Day Projections May Upend News Tradition - The New York Times,"PALO ALTO, Calif.  —   For decades, news organizations have refrained from releasing early results in presidential battleground states on Election Day, adhering to a strict,   embargo until a majority of polls there have closed. Now, a group of data scientists, journalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs is seeking to upend that reporting tradition, providing detailed projections of who is winning at any given time on Election Day in key swing states, and updating the information in real time from dawn to dusk. The plan is likely to cause a stir among those involved in reporting election results and in political circles, who worry about both accuracy and an adverse effect on how people vote. Previous early calls in presidential races have prompted congressional inquiries. The company spearheading the effort, VoteCastr, plans   projections of presidential and Senate races in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It plans to publish a map and tables of its projected results on Slate, the online newsmagazine. The company will make its projections by looking at who is actually turning out to vote, and then processing that data through a method known as predictive turnout modeling. The process is similar to how presidential campaign war rooms operate on Election Day, when they track turnout by likely supporters so they can adjust     efforts accordingly. “It’s what campaigns do,” said Ken Smukler, the founder of VoteCastr. “We’re flipping up the kimono and letting people see what campaigns do on Election Day. ” Providing   updates will be a drastic departure from standard election reporting that television networks, national newspapers and The Associated Press have rigidly adhered to for decades. Many news organizations refrain from publishing exit poll data about the likely winners in a state until a majority of polls there have closed. (Exit polls are based on surveys of voters as they leave polling stations, and they are considered a polling gold standard because only people who voted are questioned.) Though not legally bound to do so, news organizations have kept this information under wraps for fear of suppressing turnout and affecting   races if the presidential election were called before voting in most states had ended. “Politicians from Western states have been very critical of any attempt to project election outcomes and report election outcomes before voters in their states have had a chance to cast their votes,” said Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Research, which conducts exit polling for leading news organizations on election nights. There is no conclusive evidence that early reporting suppresses turnout. But news organizations have stuck to their decision to refrain from reporting any results early on Election Day. “The media approach to covering Election Day broadly is to have a total media blackout on what voters are doing in real time,” said Julia Turner, the editor in chief of Slate, who called the withholding of such information “ill conceived and  . ” The group expects to make some bold predictions to kick off Election Day. At 6 a. m. Eastern time, before the first rays of sunlight kiss the Rockies or a single Election Day vote is cast, it expects to project who is winning the swing state of Colorado based on absentee ballots and an early vote count kept by the Colorado secretary of state. Mr. Smukler of VoteCastr experimented with this style of reporting during the Philadelphia mayor’s race in 2003, a rematch between Mayor John F. Street and Sam Katz, projecting results live throughout the day on the radio. The projections held true all day. VoteCastr is basing its turnout models on key counties in the swing states, sampling from areas that favor Hillary Clinton, swing areas and areas that support Donald J. Trump. Those models can then be used to project results statewide. On Election Day, hundreds of employees and volunteers will be dispatched to designated precincts in their key counties to report turnout. If turnout exceeds their modeled expectations in an area solidly for Mrs. Clinton, for example, they can deduce that she is overperforming in the percentage of total statewide votes coming from similar areas and is therefore likely to outperform in total vote expectations statewide. They then tabulate all of these   results to eventually report who is most likely winning the state. VoteCastr argues that this method is far more effective than using exit polls, which it considers useful for explaining results after the election, but flawed for projecting turnout on Election Day. “Exit polls are crude, inefficient and a bad way of predicting these outcomes,” said Sasha Issenberg, a journalist and an author of the book “The Victory Lab,” who is a member of the VoteCastr team. “They have always been designed to tell us why certain types of people voted the way they did, not to predict the outcome. ” He knocked the traditional Election Day reporting that is bereft of early results, leaving journalists to fill airtime by saying things like, “Oh, it’s raining in Cleveland. ” The media has been skittish about reporting early results partly because of its own history. In 1980, there were reports of voters leaving lines in California after television networks called the presidential race for Ronald Reagan before the polls there had closed. The networks made the call after President Jimmy Carter conceded, and voter data did not show a large   in turnout in the West. Nonetheless, the presidents of ABC, NBC and CBS were brought before Congress for numerous hearings. After the 2000 election, when some networks incorrectly called the Florida results before voting had ended in the Panhandle, which is in an earlier time zone, the network presidents were again summoned to Capitol Hill. Television networks have taken their pledge not to post results too early so seriously that they even quarantine their election night forecasters and polling professors who work for them. “The networks actually do this quarantine room because they do not want this info to leak out,” said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco and a member of ABC’s decision desk. “That’s to their credit. ” Both Slate and VoteCastr feel they are on solid legal ground reporting projections early. “The legal constraints generally have been those on exit polling, and those were restraints about physical distance and approaching voters,” said Karl J. Sandstrom, a lawyer for VoteCastr. The group does not feel comfortable making outright calls of winners, but rather intends to show “ where things stand” throughout the day. “The appeal is not to   CNN or declare the election over at 10 a. m. on Election Day,” Ms. Turner said. Either way, some say the group could be getting ahead of the results and threatening how elections should be covered. “I’m profoundly uncomfortable with characterizing election results during Election Day,” Mr. Goldstein of ABC said. But the group, seeing its role as part informer, part disrupter and part pioneer in the world of election reporting, believes it will change the Election Day experience forever, even adopting the provocative terminology used by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas during his presidential bid to describe the news industry. Speaking about the networks’ reluctance to share their information throughout the day, Mr. Smukler has a simple moniker for the election consortium: “the media cartel. ”",0
2867,"Two Defending Champions, but Two Outlooks, at Wimbledon - The New York Times","WIMBLEDON, England  —   The    Kingdom clearly has bigger concerns than a mere tennis tournament, with the focus on the country’s leaving the European Union and on England’s remaining in soccer’s European Championships. It’s rather strange how that timing has worked out. But no matter what is transpiring in the wider, less orderly world, there is still plenty to play for in the bubble of Wimbledon, where the grass  —   at least on Henman Hill  —   looks even greener than usual this year. On the eve of the tournament on Sunday, the defending champions Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams spoke    in the interview room at the All England Club. Neither has played an official event since the French Open. Both sat with their hands folded in front of them. Both spoke more softly and slowly than usual, but only Williams seemed subdued, keeping her answers terse, even to questions that lent themselves to rambling on, and not so subtly checking her watch as the allotted 15 minutes neared an end. She has had a fine season by nearly anyone else’s standards, reaching the finals at the Australian Open and the French Open and remaining No. 1 in the rankings. But it has definitely been a downbeat year for her, with upset losses to Angelique Kerber in Melbourne and to Garbiñe Muguruza in Paris. Williams’s mood on Sunday could be taken two different ways: One, she is still reeling, or two (and much more likely) she is simmering and much more interested in crushing serves and returns and restoring the tennis universe to its natural order than in the    game. “I’m definitely ready to start playing at this point,” she said. “I’m kind of over practicing every day for two hours, then going to the gym. ” When she won here last year, Williams held all four of the Grand Slam singles titles. Now she holds only Wimbledon’s. Djokovic, her dancing partner at last year’s champions dinner, is the one on the   roll now. He’s the first man to hold all four major titles since Rod Laver in 1969 and the player with a chance to do what Williams could not quite manage last year by completing the Grand Slam and winning all four majors in the same calendar year. I asked Williams what she might tell Djokovic after her unsuccessful chase last year, which ended two rounds short of the Grand Slam when she was stunned in the United States Open semifinals by Roberta Vinci. “You know, he has every opportunity to do it,” she said. “I think he’ll get it easy, so he should be fine. ” Easy sounds unlikely, given the pressure and fatigue that will surely build up in a year that also features the Olympics. Less than an hour after Djokovic won the French Open this month for his first Roland Garros title, the former star Henri Leconte walked past the Djokovic camp in the players’ lounge and said theatrically: “Two to go! Two to go! Oh, my God! Two to go!” Marian Vajda, one of Djokovic’s coaches, laughed. This was Leconte, one of tennis’s class clowns, after all. Vajda, in typical fashion, then acknowledged the reality. “Real Grand Slam, now we can think about it,” Vajda said. “This was a real mental breakthrough for Novak, to win in Paris. And now he needs to focus on going to Wimbledon fresh and going for the U. S. Open, and there’s obviously the Olympic Games in the middle, so it’s too many goals in a row. It makes it more complicated. ” More compelling, too, and all the more so because Djokovic surely never gave the Grand Slam too much serious thought earlier in his career. He was too preoccupied with leveling the playing field with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to think about outclassing the field to this degree. Even Djokovic’s biggest supporters  —   his family  —   were not thinking about it. Vajda said he ran into Djokovic’s father, Srdjan, at a restaurant in Paris during the French Open. Srdjan was with a group of friends and asked Vajda to tell the group what Srdjan had told him when they first met. “You told me he will be No. 1,” Vajda replied, “and I started laughing because I thought you were joking with me. And Novak’s father said: ‘No, I was not joking. I knew he was going to be No. 1, knew it, but I forgot one thing. I didn’t know he would be dominating so much in the tennis world one day.’ ” But here Djokovic is, undoubtedly the world’s top player on all surfaces, with a   record against the top 10 during the past two seasons. He has done it, in part, by learning how to conserve his physical and emotional energy  —   unplugging from the game when necessary, which he did again before Wimbledon. “Winning Roland Garros was obviously one of the most memorable and beautiful moments of my career,” said Djokovic, who will face James Ward of Britain in the opening match on Centre Court on Monday. “Also, it took a lot out of me. I thought that it’s more important for me to just rejuvenate and rest a little bit from tennis and then come back preparing for Wimbledon. ” He does not plan to overplay. Defend his title at Wimbledon, and it is entirely possible that he will play only the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the United States Open in the two months that follow. But there are other temptations, including a Davis Cup quarterfinal versus Britain (and Andy Murray) in July and the Rogers Cup in Toronto, which could serve as a hardcourt   for Rio. The Grand Slam is such a rare prize that it bears sacrificing other worthy goals, as Williams is better placed than anyone to grasp. She has not been the same irresistible force since that loss to Vinci in September, and Wimbledon is full of ghosts as well as big victories for her. Not that she remembers them all. On Sunday, she could not recall any of the details of her first appearance in 1998 (she retired in the third round versus Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain). But she surely remembers losing to Sabine Lisicki in the fourth round in 2013 and to Alizé Cornet in the third round in 2014, just as she surely remembers beating Muguruza in straight sets last year to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title. “This year, I don’t feel as much tension as I usually do,” she said. “Well, there’s some years that I haven’t felt any tension, either. I’m feeling pretty good. I don’t feel any pressure or stress. ” In truth, it was a challenge to sense what Williams was feeling on Sunday, and she will now let her racket do the talking, beginning with her   match on Tuesday versus Amra Sadikovic of Switzerland, 27, who retired in May 2014 but is now back for more and making her Grand Slam debut. Williams, at 34, knows too well that life is full of such surprises, and surprise has been the rule of late in the women’s game, with the   Flavia Pennetta, Kerber and Muguruza winning the past three major titles. “Think about how many women now know that they have an opening,” said Pam Shriver, an ESPN analyst. “During most of the Serena era, the players have felt there was no opening for them,” she continued, “so the question is, who is big enough to walk through it, especially at Wimbledon, where there’s more media and where you better have control of your breathing and know how to manage your nerves more than anywhere else? Because there’s a quietness and an aura about the place, and if you’re not firmly planted with two feet with your confidence, it will knock you off balance. ”",0
2869,An Angry John Podesta Issues A Statement On “Reopening” Of FBI Probe,"While Hillary has yet to address today’s stunning letter by FBI director Comey, who reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigations has “opened” a probe into Hillary Clinton’s email as a result of “findings” on what the NYT reported was an electronic device belonging to Anthony Wiener, a clearly angry John Podesta, Clinton’s recently hacked campaign chair, issued the following statement in Response to FBI Letter to GOP Congressional Chairmen.
In response to the letter sent by FBI Director James Convey to eight Republican committee chairman in Congress, Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement Friday: 
Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comet’ declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call. In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.
FBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee chairmen . Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is ‘reopening’ an investigation but Comey’s words do not match that characterization. Director Comey’s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.
It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. 
The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.”

Video shows that Trump was in the middle of his speech when the incident occurred. He was looking into the crowd, his hand over his eyes to block the glare from the stage lights, when Secret Service agents grabbed him and escorted him off the stage. Trump ducked his head as he left the stage. The crowd panicked with frightened looks on their faces, as the Secret Service and police tactical units rushed in to quickly arrest the man. Video on twitter shows the moment that the Secret Service and law enforcement took down the man.

Early unconfirmed reports suggest a man was armed in the crowd according to some witnesses. One witness said that they were in the crowd when an unknown guy creeped toward the stage staring at Trump. The witness then proceeded to get the attention of four bigger guys surrounding them and confronted the man. The man then freaked out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun.” According to the witness the man was mumbling about “the delegates.” “ I was in the crowd, me and my dad saw a guy creeping toward the stage staring at trump. i got the attention of 4 big guys around me and we confronted him and when we did he spurged out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun. when we tackled him to the ground and between punches he kept saying something about “the delegates”? he must have the delegates. sorry i’m pretty shaken up right now. “ With one person in the crowd shouting “he’s got a gun.” The man was then detained by police officers, Secret Service agents and SWAT armed with assault rifles and taken to a side room for questioning. The suspect is seen below. Trump returned to the stage minutes later and proceeded to continue his speech before thanking the Secret Service and police. “Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped. We will never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic.”

2871,Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker Resigns Over Leak of Confidential Information - Breitbart,"Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker suddenly and unexpectedly quit Tuesday after he admitted in a statement that he discussed confidential information with an analyst in 2012. [Lacker’s role in the 2012 leak of sensitive information to an analyst at Medley Global Advisors came to light as part of a federal investigation. His resignation comes as part of a deal worked out with investigators, a person familiar with the matter said.  “Once our Bank’s Board of Directors learned of the outcome of the government investigations, they took appropriate actions,” the Richmond Fed said. “I deeply regret the role I may have played in confirming this confidential information and its dissemination to Medley’s subscribers,” Lacker said. Lacker, who has been the head of the Richmond Fed for 13 years, stopped short of admitting that he was the source of the information and said that it was not his intention to reveal confidential information in his conversation with the analyst.  CNBC’s Steve Liesman reported Tuesday afternoon that an attorney for Lacker said that federal authorities have said no charges will be filed against his client. Medley disclosed to its clients previously unknown details about the Fed’s plans for the third round of asset purchases, known as QE3, according to sources familiar with the matter.  The leak has been under investigation internally by the Fed, by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The federal prosecutors and CFTC have been investigating possible   in connection with the leaks. Lacker said that the analyst brought up an “important   detail” about the Fed’s plans. Instead of ending the call, Lacker continued the conversation. The following day, Medley published its report containing the sensitive information. It remains unclear how the Medley analyst originally obtained the information that Lacker says he confirmed. But the report was so detailed that it left little doubt it was based on   information. The report came after the Fed announced in September 2012 its plans to attempt to boost economic growth by buying $40 billion worth of   securities each month. Medley’s October 3rd report said Fed officials had discussed adding monthly purchases $45 billion of Treasury bonds, a policy which the Fed didn’t announce until the following December. It also said that Fed officials had discussed assuring market actors that the central bank wouldn’t consider raising interest rates until unemployment fell below 6. 5% or the   outlook for inflation rose above 2. 5%. Those numerical triggers weren’t formally adopted by the Fed until later that year. Other intriguing details from the Medley report include a report that staff members were working past midnight to prepare for the central bank’s meeting and that the minutes from the meeting would include a reference to a staff meeting. Those minutes were published by the Fed the day after Medley’s report. In addition to admitting that he confirmed some of the Medley analysts   information, Lacker also said that he did not initially tell the Fed’s investigators that the analyst was in possession of that information during the call. Instead, he only disclosed this fact in 2015 when he was interviewed as part of the investigation by federal prosecutors, the CFTC and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. “I regret that in this instance I crossed the line to confirming information that should have remained confidential,” Lacker said. Lacker had previously announced his intention to retire this fall. Under the Fed’s rotating schedule, the Richmond Fed president will not become a voting member of the   interest rate setting board until 2018. Lacker has been an advocate for the Fed to adopt a faster pace of rate hikes. He has dissented over a dozen times to the Fed’s interest rate decisions during his term, consistently arguing for a less accommodative monetary policy stance. He opposed the use of the Fed’s balance sheet to buy mortgage bonds during the financial crisis.    ",0
2872,Russia Plans to Upgrade Syrian Air Defenses After U.S. Missile Strike - Breitbart,"Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said on Friday that Moscow would “strengthen and raise the effectiveness of the Syrian armed forces’ systems of   defense systems” following the American missile strike on Syria’s Sharyat airbase. [Konashankov promised a “complex of measures” would be taken to “protect the most sensitive Syrian infrastructure facilities. ”  The Defense Ministry also claimed the American strike was largely ineffective, stating that only 23 of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by the U. S. Navy struck their targets. (The Pentagon provided a very different estimate, stating that 58 of the 59 missiles hit their targets.) “The combat effectiveness of the US massive missile attack on the Syrian air base is extremely low,” Russia’s Defense Ministry insisted. According to the Russian assessment, six   fighter jets and some structures at the airbase were destroyed, but the runways were not damaged. The Russians also complained that America “obviously” prepared for an attack on the Sharyat airbase long before Tuesday’s chemical weapons attack. “The preparation of such a strike is necessary to conduct a large range of activities for exploration, planning, preparation of flight missions and bringing the missiles into full readiness for launch. For any specialist, it is clear that a decision on the missile strike on Syria was taken in Washington long before the events in the village Khan Sheikhoun,” said the Defense Ministry. The Defense Ministry accused the Trump administration of carrying out the attack “solely for domestic political reasons. ”",0
2873,"Enough With the Tweets, China’s State Media Tells Trump - The New York Times","BEIJING  —   China’s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark, jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that   Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his    Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the South China Sea and, most recently, North Korea. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money  wealth from the U. S. in totally   trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump’s sarcasm  —   “Nice!”  —   could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the   way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. “An obsession with ‘Twitter foreign policy’ is undesirable,” read the headline of  a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump’s posts. “Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn’t child’s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,” said the article, published after Mr. Trump’s latest barbed comments on China. “Twitter shouldn’t become an instrument of foreign policy,” the article said. Earlier that day, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump’s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump’s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse, punchy format after he settles in the White House. “Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,” Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that “issuing   comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries. ” Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009, though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans, they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long, tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare. Sad!",0

2875,Police threaten eviction 'at any time' as Dakota Access protesters refuse to leave private land,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 03:59 UTC © Robyn Beck / AFP Despite officers threatening to clear private land, Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protesters are refusing to leave. As tensions have built up, police handling of the protest has reportedly cost nearly $6 million in just one month. ""We have the resources. We could go down there at any time and we are trying everything we can to not have to do that,""Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney told reporters on Wednesday. Protesters have been occupying private land known as Cannonball Ranch, which belongs to the Dakota Access Pipeline's developer, the Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. Since the weekend, both the company and law enforcement have been asking dozens of protesters to leave the area and move to public land. The occupation began Sunday, when demonstrators set up a new camp of at least 15 tents and 100 teepees. They have also blocked State Highway 1806, putting themselves directly in the path of the planned 1,172-mile pipeline, which will span four states. ""Just come off the private property, go back to the big camp and let's talk and try figure out the solution for this. Their message was absolutely not, we are standing here,"" Laney said, adding that ""at some point rule of law has to be enforced."" Energy Transfer Partners also said in a statement that ""all trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and removed from the land."" More than 125 people were arrested over the weekend, but the message had no effect on the protest. Demonstrators have refused to vacate the land or leave State Highway 1806, keeping traffic and local residents from using the road. Dozens of protesters formed a human blockade, enforced with horses and hay bales. ""No surrender, no retreat!"" protest organizer Mekasi Camp-Horinek, of Oklahoma, reportedly yelled to the people as he left negotiations. ""We've got to make our bodies a living sacrifice,"" John Perko, a protester from South Dakota told The Bismarck Tribune. ""This is the most honorable thing I could be doing right now."" Last week, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been leading the protest since August, agreed to provide its land to relocate the unauthorized camp from the US Army Corps of Engineers property for the winter. As police try to abstain from using force, even the peaceful handling of the protests appears to be draining the budget at high speeds. According to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services, authorities have spent $5.8 million since early September. This is nearly all of the $6 million the state borrowed from the Bank of North Dakota in emergency funds to deal with the protest against the $3.78 billion pipeline. Meanwhile, an investigation into a September 3 confrontation between protesters and private security guards has revealed license violations. It says that officers who deployed dogs on protesters were not properly licensed and could face criminal charges.",0
2876,There Is An Alignment Between Ancient Sites That Will Blow Your Mind,"Did you know that ancient sites like Easter Island, Nazca, Ollantaytambo, Paratoari, Tassili n’Ajjer and the Pyramids of Giza are all aligned on a single great circle? There is a mind-boggling connection among ancient structures that is indicative of a far greater meaning than we were aware of. 


There have been numerous theories that ancient structures around the globe were specifically positioned by its ancient builder’s thousands of years ago. Perhaps one of the best examples –according to many— is the Great Pyramid of Giza and its curious position on Earth. For those of you who didn’t know, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the most accurately aligned structure in existence and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error. Furthermore, the weight of the pyramid is estimated at 5,955,000 tons. Multiplied by 10^8 gives a reasonable estimate of the earth’s mass. As you can see, ancient structures were built with a mind-boggling precision.

But the Pyramids at the Giza plateau do not stand solitary on Earth. In fact, there are countless other sites that seem to be connected somehow. If you take a look at other ancient sites like the Nazca Lines, Machu Picchu, Easter Island, Mohenjo Daro, and Tassili n’Ajjer among others and draw down their position on a map, you will notice a connection that points perhaps towards an ancient ‘code’ embedded within these structures.

As is noted by world-mysteries.com , ancient sites like Giza, Siwa, Tassili n’Ajjer, Paratoari, Ollantaytambo, Machupicchu, Nazca, Easter Island, Aneityum Island, Preah Vihear, Sukhothai, Pyay, Khajuraho, Mohenjo Daro, Persepolis, Ur, Petra are shown clockwise from Giza on the equal azimuthal projection. The projection is centered on the axis point in southeastern Alaska. Distances to any location from the center of an equal azimuthal projection are equally scaled. Since all of the sites on the great circle alignment are equally distant from the axis point at one-quarter of the circumference of the earth, the alignment forms a perfect circle halfway between the center and the outer edge of the projection.

Check out the image below to understand the complexity of this mysterious alignment. 


Jim Alison goes on to explain even further in a very intriguing chart: 
The chart below lists the distance of each site from the great circle and the distance of each site from the northern axis point. There are slight variations in the distance from the axis point to the great circle depending on whether the route from the axis point to different locations along the great circle crosses over the equator or Polar Regions. The mean distance from the axis point to the great circle is 6,218 miles. 

Furthermore, the alignment of these sites is easily observable on a globe of the Earth with a horizon ring. If you line up any two of these sites on the horizon ring, all of the sites will be right on the horizon ring:

Start on the Equator, at the mouth of the Amazon River, at 49° 17′ West Longitude; go to 30° 18′ North Latitude, 40° 43′ East Longitude, in the Middle East, which is the maximum latitude the line touches; then go to the Equator at 130° 43′ East Longitude, near the Northwest tip of New Guinea; then to 30° 18′ South Latitude, 139° 17′ West Longitude, in the South Pacific; and then back to 49° 17′ West Longitude, at the Equator.

As you can see, there seems to be a connection among all of the above structures that form –to the surprise of many— a massive circle encompassing all major archaeological site son planet Earth. How this is possible remains a profound enigma.

What are your thoughts? Were te ancient’s trying to tell future generations something? Or, is it possible that this fascinating connection is nothing more than another bizarre coincidence?

2879,Hillary Immediately Runs From Media After What Camera Caught Outside Plane,"Hillary Immediately Runs From Media After What Camera Caught Outside Plane Posted on October 28, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Aboard Hillary Clinton’s plane (left), “Hill Force One” (right) 
While Hillary Clinton was en route to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for what ended up being a very uncomfortable campaign stop, she got some bad news. The FBI is taking another look at her emails — which could likely end her. Media rushed to the runway after her arrival, where cameras caught what she tried to hide outside her private airplane. 
The FBI announced that they are looking into Hillary’s previously undisclosed emails as she was mid-air and blissfully unaware and unable to prepare. Knowing what’s in those documents, she’s more aware of the ramifications than the rest of us, but because it was sprung on her, she wasn’t fully prepared for questions about it since she requires practiced answers that she receives ahead of time before talking to the public. 
However, forced to face the music upon landing, Hillary couldn’t escape the press pool waiting for her as she made a beeline for her getaway car from the airplane. That’s when she did something very telling of her guilt. JUST IN: Hillary Clinton arrives in Iowa amid news the FBI is taking another look at her email server https://t.co/uH00LebKTe pic.twitter.com/rxFkJZXEvo 
— CNN (@CNN) October 28, 2016 
Knowing that there was no way around the reporters, Hillary hid in Hill Force One with her advisors for about 30 minutes, who we can only imagine were calming the raging candidate down before she faced the public. Our guess is, she had a moment of meltdown with the news, screamed, yelled, and then was given a shot of her favorite liquor before exiting the aircraft, where she was met with a barrage of questions about the investigation. Rather than responding, which an innocent person would do, she flashed a fake smile and wave and didn’t say a single word. 
It would take too much explanation to lie, and she’d only further incriminate herself, so she gave the press the silent treatment instead, which actually spoke volumes. No matter how much Hillary ignores this, it’s not going away, as the truth will prevail against her and, hopefully, land her in the jailhouse — not the White House.",0
2880,Intuitive Astrology: October 30 New Moon 2016,"by Tanaaz 
The October 30th New Moon falls in the dreamy and introspective sign of Scorpio. Even though Scorpio energy can be deep and dark, there is a way to channel this energy into something productive and even, magical. 
The energy of the October New Moon is going to guide us away from the material and external world and into a deeper, more intuitive realm. Here we will be able to receive new ideas, new inspirations and new creative visions. 
In fact, the energy of this New Moon has a high creative and supernatural charge to it and we will all be guided to go deep within, so we can remind ourselves about who we really are. 
There has been a lot of cleansing and releasing energy in the Universe this year, and while October’s New Moon will be asking us to go deep, it will be asking us to venture deeper than our problems and deeper than our fears, all the way into the heart of our soul. 
This New Moon is about reconnecting with who you are, celebrating yourself and learning how to love and accept yourself exactly as you are. 
There is also a transformative energy to this New Moon, which will be allowing us to emerge reborn. 
This transformative energy is gentle, supportive and calming. It will be reminding us to nurture and care for ourselves. It will also be reminding us that sometimes the greatest healing we can offer ourselves is our own true love. 
Scorpio energy supports us to dive deep into our imagination and intuition. Use the force of this New Moon to travel within and get lost in the fairytales of your mind. Use the energy to inspire your creative visions and to expand your intuition. 
The New Moon also falls just one day before All Hallows Eve , making the Scorpio New Moon even more magical. 
Halloween is a time when the veil between dimensions is thinnest and this New Moon will definitely be amplifying this energy. 
Spirit energy will be high around this New Moon, so it is important to protect yourself energetically and stay open to any Divine messages or inspiration you may receive. 
In fact, if there is something that you have been looking to receive guidance on, this New Moon will allow you to take the journey within so you can hear the answer radiating from your own soul. 
The Scorpio New Moon will also allow us to take a journey into the underworld. 
The underworld is our subconscious and the deeper, darker, more intuitive side of who we are. It is when we are in this place that we can truly understand the power and magnificence of our own light. 
By losing our attachment to the external and going deep into the energy of the night, we will be able to realize and feel our potential shining through. 
For those who already experienced a New Moon on October 1st, this second New Moon will be a Black Moon. 
While the energy of the Black Moon is the same, there is a heightened energy when two New Moon’s fall in the same month. Those experiencing the Black Moon are going to feel the effects even stronger and will be encouraged to dig that little bit deeper. 
This digging process is not about assessing, reviewing or analyzing, instead this digging process is about feeling. It is about feeling the soil and the earth around you, it is about feeling who you really are and allowing yourself to get lost in You. 
We are not our bodies and we are not our thoughts. We are soul energy and when we can travel within to feel this soul energy, we intuitively gain an understanding about who we are and where we are heading. 
If you allow the energy of the Scorpio New Moon in, you are going to be able to feel your soul; you are going to be able to feel your energy on a powerful level and you are going to be able to transform yourself with the power of your own love. 
The October New Moon is beautiful, magical and supportive, so allow its energy to guide you. Allow yourself to be taken by the energy and see where you travel to. Share:",0

2882,’Supernatural’ Actor Mark Pellegrino In Israel: Kerry On Wrong Side Of History Once Again,"TEL AVIV  —   Supernatural actor Mark Pellegrino slammed the United Nations and the U. S. for the “unethical” Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements. [Pellegrino was visiting Israel for the first time last week with a group of fellow actors and other professionals from the entertainment industry. The trip, organized by Israel’s Ministry for Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy and America’s Voices in Israel, coincided with Secretary of State John Kerry’s controversial address on the   conflict.  The actor, who is best known for playing Lucifer in the Warner Bros. series, lambasted Kerry for condemning Israel in his speech. “[Kerry] was on the wrong side of every historical event and this was no different,” he said in an interview. He further slammed the United States for abstaining from the vote on Resolution 2334, which calls Israeli settlements a “flagrant violation of international law. ” “Leave it to the UN to do the absolute wrong thing and save it for posterity’s sake in the form of the resolution,” Pellegrino said. Pellegrino, who was joined by TV stars Meagan Good from Deception and The Walking Dead‘s Sonequa   among others, made the decision to come on the trip out of a sense of “obligation to support democracies. ” “I’ve always been a huge supporter of the only democracy in the Middle East,” he said. “The way things are turning out all around the world, we have an obligation to support democracies. ” While Israel continues to be “under attack from the rest of world,” for Pellegrino as a secular person, the Jewish state is an island of hope in the region for allowing “full freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and for promoting human prosperity. ” Pellegrino said that one of the highlights of his trip was visiting the Western Wall  —   Judaism’s holiest site  —   defined in the resolution as “occupied Palestinian territory. ” Despite identifying himself as an atheist, Pellegrino conceded that being at the Western Wall made him “open to the suggestion because of its unique power that prayer goes straight to God. ” Pellegrino was also drawn to the rich archaeology of the area, which “prove[s] Israeli existence there for many thousands of years. ” But the most profound moment, unexpectedly, was visiting a hospital. The Rambam Healthcare Campus, which has Arab doctors and Jewish doctors working side by side treating Arab and Jewish patients alike  —   and even Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza  —   opened Pellegrino’s eyes to the “wide diversity in Israel. ” “It’s symptomatic of a free country, of a culture that respects everybody’s mind and values. Far more so than Arab countries,” he said. “The hospital was an entire community devoted to medical sciences, to using science to increase prosperity. It is literally changing the world,” he added. According to Pellegrino, Hollywood has a myopic,   view of the   conflict. “In my opinion, Hollywood doesn’t know the context. Hollywood sees a David and Goliath story with Israel being cast in the role of Goliath, as the evil aggressor,” he said. “The Palestinians are simply innocent reactors to whatever Israelis are throwing at them. And everything  —   like their economic situation  —   excuses the savagery. ” “Those people in the Hollywood community would be served by coming here,” he added.",0
2884,Military Success in Syria Gives Putin Upper Hand in U.S. Proxy War - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Syrian military was foundering last year, with thousands of rebel fighters pushing into areas of the country long considered to be government strongholds. The rebel offensive was aided by powerful   missiles supplied by the Central Intelligence Agency and Saudi Arabia. Intelligence assessments circulated in Washington that the Syrian president, Bashar   was losing his grip on power. But then the Russians arrived, bludgeoning C. I. A.  rebel forces with an air campaign that has sent them into retreat. And now rebel commanders, clinging to besieged neighborhoods in the divided city of Aleppo, say their shipments of C. I. A.  antitank missiles are drying up. For the first time since Afghanistan in the 1980s, the Russian military for the past year has been in direct combat with rebel forces trained and supplied by the C. I. A. The   Afghan fighters prevailed during that Cold War conflict. But this time the outcome  —   thus far  —   has been different. “Russia has won the proxy war, at least for now,” said Michael Kofman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. Russia’s battlefield successes in Syria have given Moscow, isolated by the West after its annexation of Crimea and other incursions into Ukraine, new leverage in decisions about the future of the Middle East. The Obama administration is now talking with President Vladimir V. Putin’s government about a plan to share intelligence and coordinate airstrikes against the Islamic State and other militant groups in Syria, and Mr. Putin has thus far met his goals in Syria without becoming caught in a quagmire that some  —   including President Obama  —   had predicted he would. But even Mr. Obama has expressed wariness about an enduring deal with Moscow. “I’m not confident that we can trust the Russians or Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference on Thursday. “Whenever you are trying to broker any kind of deal with an individual like that or a country like that, you have got to go in there with some skepticism. ” At the same time, some military experts point out that Mr. Putin has saddled Russia with the burden of propping up a Syrian military that has had difficulty vanquishing the rebels on its own. The Russian campaign began in September, after a monthslong offensive by C. I. A.  rebel groups won new territory in Idlib, Hama and Latakia Provinces in northern Syria. One problem for Washington: Those groups sometimes fought alongside soldiers of the Nusra Front, which until recently was officially affiliated with Al Qaeda. The offensive took Syrian troops by surprise, prompting concerns in Moscow and Damascus that Mr. Assad’s government, long supported by the Russians, might be in trouble. Some of the rebel groups boasted at the time that powerful TOW antitank missiles provided by American and Saudi intelligence operatives were a key to their success. For several years, the C. I. A. has joined with the spy services of several Arab nations to arm and train the rebels at bases in Jordan and Qatar, with the Saudis bankrolling much of the operation. A C. I. A. spokesman declined to comment about any American assistance to Syrian rebels. But Lt. Col. Fares   a former aviation engineer who heads the rebel group Fursan   said during an interview in May 2015 that his group would receive new shipments of the antitank weapons as soon as the missiles were used. “We ask for ammunition and missiles, and we get more than we ask for,” he said. Yet the advance also created problems for the fractious assortment of rebel groups, as it allowed the Nusra Front to gain control over more areas of northern Syria. The Obama administration has officially forbidden any Nusra fighters to receive weapons or training. But the group has at times shown greater prowess against the Syrian government forces than the C. I. A. ’s proxies. Moreover, they have shown that they can and will destroy or sideline C. I. A.  rebels who do not agree to battlefield alliances. Moscow cited the battlefield successes of the Nusra Front to justify its military incursion into Syria as a campaign to fight terrorism  —   even if its primary goal was to shore up Mr. Assad’s military against all insurgent groups, including the C. I. A.  rebels. The Russians began a rapid military buildup in September, and launched an air campaign that targeted the Syrian rebel groups that posed the most direct threat to Mr. Assad’s government, including some of the C. I. A.  groups. By   Russia had escalated its airstrikes to nearly 90 on some days. About 600 Russian marines landed in Syria with the mission of protecting the main air base in Latakia that ground force has grown to about 4, 000 throughout Syria, including several hundred special forces members. It took some time for the Russian intervention to have a significant impact on the Syrian battlefield, prompting Mr. Obama to predict that Moscow might become bogged down in its own Middle East conflict. “An attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire, and it won’t work,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference in October. “And they will be there for a while if they don’t take a different course. ” The C. I. A. moved to counter the Russian intervention, funneling several hundred additional TOW missiles to its proxies. One rebel commander, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of threats from more radical groups within the rebel coalition, said in October that his group could at that time get as many missiles as it wanted. “It’s like a carte blanche,” he said. “Just fill in the numbers. ” But Russian firepower eventually overwhelmed the rebel groups in the north. By early this year, attacks by Russian   bombers, fighter jets, attack helicopters and cruise missiles allowed the Syrian Army to reverse many of the rebel gains  —   and seize areas near the Turkish border that many thought the government could never reclaim. The flow of C. I. A. arms continued, but the weapons proved too little in the face of the Russian offensive. Jeffrey White, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer who now studies Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the Russians had built a capable intelligence network in Syria, giving them a better understanding of the terrain and location of rebel forces. That has allowed Russian troops to call in precision airstrikes, making them more effective against the rebels. The mismatch has been most acute in the last several months, with Syrian government forces, with Russian help, laying siege to the   parts of Aleppo. Losing their foothold in Aleppo, once Syria’s largest city, would be a big blow to the rebels. Syrian and Russian jets have carried out an indiscriminate pounding of Aleppo, including attacks on six hospitals in and around the city over the past week, according to a statement by Physicians for Human Rights. “Since June, we’ve seen increasing reports of attacks on civilians in Aleppo and strikes on the region’s remaining medical infrastructure,” said Widney Brown, the group’s director of programs. “Each of these assaults constitutes a war crime. ” Rebel groups in recent days have made surprising gains in a new offensive to try to break through Syrian military lines encircling Aleppo, but if it fails, rebels inside the city will face a choice between enduring the siege or surrendering. In recent interviews, rebel commanders said the flow of foreign weapons needed to break the siege had slowed. “We are using most of our weapons in the battle for Aleppo,” said Mustafa   a member of Suqour   one of the C. I. A.  groups. He said the flow of weapons to the group had diminished in the past three to four months. “Now we fire them only when it is necessary and urgent,” he said. Another commander, Maj. Mousa   of Division 13, a C. I. A.  rebel group operating in Idlib and Aleppo, said his group had received no missiles for two weeks. “We filed a request to get TOW missiles for the Aleppo front,” he said, but the reply was that there were none in the warehouses. Rebel leaders and military experts say that perhaps the most pressing danger is that supply routes from Turkey, which are essential to the C. I. A.  rebels, could be severed. “The U. S. is doing just enough to placate its allies and partners and says it is doing something, but does not seek to do what it takes to change conditions on the battlefield,” said Emile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and an Assad critic. Mr. Putin has achieved many of his larger goals  —   to prop up Mr. Assad’s government, retain access to the longtime Russian naval base on the Mediterranean Sea and use Syria as a proving ground for the most advanced Russian military technology. Some military experts remain surprised that Mr. Putin took the risky step of fighting   and equipped forces head on, but they also assess that his Syria gamble appears to be paying off. It is the type of Cold   battle that Mr. Obama, in October, insisted he did not want to enter. “We’re not going to make Syria into a proxy war between the United States and Russia,” he said. “This is not some superpower chessboard contest. ”",0
2885,Merkel Vows to Stay on Course Despite Party Setback - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   A day after voters in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s political home state delivered what amounted to a strong rejection of her refugee policy, the German leader acknowledged on Monday that she was “very dissatisfied” with the result but insisted that she would stick with her chosen course. Ms. Merkel, who was attending a summit meeting in China, waited 18 hours before addressing the unprecedented   finish of her   party in state elections on Sunday in the impoverished northeastern state of   where she has her own parliamentary constituency. The nationalist,   Alternative for Germany finished in second place, with 21 percent of the vote, behind the   Social Democrats, with almost 31 percent. Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats received 19 percent. Ms. Merkel’s bloc of Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, had never been overtaken on the right in any state or national election in the history of modern Germany, and the result prompted the chancellor’s critics from her own camp and across the spectrum to renew speculation about her future. “Right now, the chancellor is not hitting the right tone in almost all the areas that most concern her voters  —   refugees, Europe, public safety,” wrote Gabor Steingart, the publisher of the main business daily Handelsblatt, which has been among her strongest critics. “It is a remarkably pale light which is falling on the first stateswoman these days. This is what the twilight of a chancellorship looks like. ” Facing another election in two weeks in the   of Berlin, and three more state ballots next year before national elections in the fall, Ms. Merkel insisted that voters would eventually come to support her refugee policy. Germany has taken in almost one million refugees, many of them Muslims fleeing war in the Middle East, over the past year. Integrating many and deporting those who have no claim on asylum is the right course, she said. In a hasty meeting with German reporters broadcast live from China, Ms. Merkel said that national themes  —   in particular migration and integration  —   had been dominant in the vote and that “many people do not have sufficient confidence in our ability to solve this. ” “Now the name of the game is to regain trust,” she said. “Only with time can we solve the problems,” not just those concerning migrants but also those dealing with fears for the future in a rapidly changing world, she added. Ms. Merkel, who has been in power since 2005 and is Europe’s   head of government, indicated that she bore some responsibility for the result on Sunday because she is the leader of the Christian Democrats and chancellor in a coalition with the   Social Democrats. “Everybody has to reflect on how can we win back trust, and above all, of course, me,” the German news agency DPA quoted her as saying in an aside to reporters at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Hangzhou, China. Her party’s general secretary, Peter Tauber, was almost the only leading Christian Democrat talking to reporters in Germany on Monday after he conceded “bitter” defeat in Sunday’s vote. “Angela Merkel has led Germany through several crises,” Mr. Tauber said. “People can rely on the fact that she will this time, too. ” But Ms. Merkel, while still enjoying ratings that many leaders would embrace, has lost popularity since the weekend exactly a year ago when she threw open German borders to migrants then trapped in Hungary. Hundreds of thousands of migrants poured in over the months that followed, prompting her conservative allies in Bavaria’s Christian Social Union, in particular, to demand a limit on the number of asylum seekers. Ms. Merkel, the daughter of a Lutheran pastor in Communist East Germany, insisted that there was no way to impose a quota on those fleeing war and oppression. Some Bavarian conservatives used the vote on Sunday to reiterate their demands, indicating that Ms. Merkel faces a tough fight, possibly even in her own camp, if she decides next year to seek a fourth term as chancellor. Ms. Merkel declined on Monday, as she has in the past, to say whether she would run in 2017. The leaders of Alternative for Germany, the   group that finished ahead of Ms. Merkel’s party, were in a jubilant mood on Monday and vowed to keep up the pressure on the chancellor. Sunday’s loss “is even more bitter for the Christian Democrats because it comes on Merkel’s home turf,” said Frauke Petry, one of two national leaders of the   party. “And we will see to it that she continues to lose that ground. ” An analysis of the vote showed that the far right was particularly attractive to people who had not voted in previous elections in the state. Turnout went from 51 percent in the last state elections in 2011 to 61 percent. But all the major parties  —   the Social Democrats, the Christian Democrats, the   Die Linke and even the Greens  —   lost voters to the Alternative for Germany. Jörg Meuthen, another leader of the rightist party, said the group’s showing proved that it had become a mainstream force. “In the long term, we want to govern this country,” he said.",0

According to the Washington Examiner, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, “These changes will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House of Representatives so lawmakers can do the people’s work.

Politico quoted Democrat Caucus Vice Chairman Joe Crowley (  ) lauding the promise of “guerrilla tactics,” saying, “It’s a new day in Washington it’s a new way to fight. ” Representative John Conyers ( . ) suggests the $2, 500 fine is “clearly   …     intended to undermine the rights of members in the minority to freely express their views on the House floor, which is a critical means by which members communicate to the American public. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

We have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation, deflation or economic collapse. We view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output (stocks and bonds) have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself (GDP). While the Fed may ultimately attempt in December its second rate increase in ten-and-a-half years, it is important for investors to “see the forest through the trees,” and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen: 

From Sprott’s Thoughts: 
In our September report, we suggested short-term developments in gold markets often distract investors from more relevant long-term fundamentals, providing attractive entry points for the nimble-footed. On October 4, we believe just such an investment opportunity materialized in the gold complex. 
The spot gold price declined $44.28 on the day (3.4%), and 5% for the week (largest weekly decline since September 2013). As is always the case when gold corrects, financial media were instantly replete with naysayers forecasting the end of gold’s 2016 advance. In recent days, various investment banks have rushed to reduce their price forecasts toward the $1,050-to-$1,100 range. 
With all due respect to these market participants, we would suggest absolutely nothing of substance has changed in gold’s medium- and long-term investment fundamentals. 
What caused the early-October backup in the gold price? First, hawkish comments on 10/3/16 by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (2016 FOMC voter) were echoed by Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker (2018 FOMC voter) on the morning of 10/4/16. Then, before noon on 10/4/16, media reports surfaced that the ECB Governing Council was considering tapering its asset-purchase plan (later denied) and then that the BOJ was contemplating market intervention to weaken the yen. 
A fair number of human traders and algorithmic computers perceived these developments as a potential turning point for global-central-bank easing policies, and sell orders were reflexively generated throughout the gold complex. Once bullion penetrated its year-to-date uptrend, as well as the psychologically significant $1,300 support level, technically oriented CTA’s and high-frequency traders joined the fray. 
We would suggest these knee-jerk trading decisions have presented an especially fortuitous entry-point for investors contemplating a portfolio allocation to gold and gold equities. In short, we view the above quartet of early-October news items as little more than jawboning from central bankers stuck in an increasingly awkward policy pickle. 
Desperate to normalize policy after seven years of extended largesse, central banks are recognizing that aggregate debt levels remain too ominous, and economic growth too fragile, to exit from ultra-accommodative monetary-policy conditions. 
While the Fed may ultimately attempt in December its second rate increase in ten-and-a-half years, it is important for investors to “see the forest through the trees,” and recognize that macro fundamentals supporting the gold thesis only continue to strengthen. 
At Sprott, we have long maintained the central thesis for gold is more complicated than a simple hedge against inflation, deflation or economic collapse. 
We view gold as a mandatory portfolio asset in an investment landscape in which paper claims on productive output (stocks and bonds) have wildly exceeded reasonable relation to underlying productive output itself (GDP). 
In essence, the decoupling of financial-asset valuations from any rational underpinning of productive output portends two future developments which are both supportive to the gold investment thesis. First, as the financial system rebalances inflated paper claims back toward supporting output, gold should provide prodigious purchasing power protection, as it has in the past. MacroMavens highlights in Figure 1, on the following page, that even at today’s roughly 2,140 level, the S&P 500 Index still remains 70% lower in gold terms than at its March 2000 peak. During the past two corrections in the S&P 500, during which the Index declined 50.50% (3/24/00-10/10/02) and 57.70% (10/11/07-3/6/09), gold provided unparalleled portfolio protection. We expect the next correction in U.S. financial assets to prove no different. 
The second implication of the contemporary mismatch between paper claims and productive output is inevitable official policy response whenever elevated debt levels, weak economic growth, or both, conspire to destabilize the enormous global debt pyramid. Even in the bizarro world of floating exchange rates, central bank debasement of fiat currencies is perhaps the most fundamental investment thesis for gold. Bloomberg highlighted in an October 16 report that the balance sheets of the 10 largest global central banks now total $21.4 trillion in assets, an increase of more than 10% just from the end of 2015! 
This aggregate increase accrues largely from the efforts of the ECB and BOJ, which together have grown their balance sheets some $2.1 trillion since 12/31/15. While the Fed’s balance sheet has leveled off in the vicinity of $4.5 trillion in recent years, we remind readers that the Fed has felt compelled to purchase an average of $48 billion worth of Treasuries and MBS every month during 2016 to replace maturing paper. With global-central-bank printing remaining at such a frenzied pace, does the investment case for gold really diminish whenever a central banker floats hawkish commentary or the Fed attempts an annual 25 basis point rate increase? We think not. 
Our investment case for gold rests squarely on global monetary and economic imbalances. Among the many valuable measures in monitoring the gold investment thesis, we have always favored (for its clarity) the Fed’s own ratio of Total U.S. Credit Market Debt to GDP (Z.1 Report). As shown in Figure 2, above, the ratio of outstanding claims ($65.066 trillion total debt) to output ($18.437 trillion GDP) in the U.S. today stands at 353%, barely below its June 2009 peak. 
Contrary to popular belief, there has been no aggregate deleveraging of the U.S. financial system in recent years. Indeed, quite the opposite has been the case. Since December 2007, total U.S. debt has actually grown by $16.259 trillion, an increase of 33.32% (from $48.808 trillion to $65.066 trillion). Even more eye-popping has been a 48.34% explosion in nonfinancial credit (from $31.213 trillion to $46.301 trillion) during the same span. By way of comparison, U.S. GDP has expanded only $4.362 trillion during this entire period. 
Demonstrating the levitating effects of QE policies on equities and real estate, the Fed’s measure of total U.S. household net worth has expanded by a mind-boggling $31.345 trillion, or 54.31% , since year-end 2007 (from $57.718 trillion to $89.063 trillion). While we recognize the power of cognitive dissonance in all euphoric investment cycles, how can any investor rationalize that a $4.362 trillion increase in GDP could support a $31.345 trillion increase in household net worth? 
What magic can create “wealth” seven times faster than output? Our answer remains that central banks have fostered unprecedented and unsustainable inflation in financial asset prices. To those who view gold’s portfolio relevance as muted due to the lack of visible CPI-type inflation, we would suggest they are looking in the wrong place. Central banks have enabled absurd decoupling of paper claims from underlying output. There is already rampant inflation throughout the financial system! 
Importantly, we believe central bank policies of ZIRP, NIRP and QE have distorted economic decision making for so long that global economic growth has become remarkably unproductive. Every student of economics knows that marginal returns eventually approach marginal costs. 
At zero percent interest rates, earnings for all economic agents, on average, will eventually approach zero. Years of malinvestment, plummeting capex, declining productivity, and now an extending trend of declining corporate profits all suggest that the global economy is misfiring on many cylinders. Even worse, we believe, the global financial system has become so dependent on zero percent interest rates that any move toward normalization will have devastating impact on a wide range of financial asset prices. 
We are preparing an expanded strategy report which focuses on themes ranging from the broken nature of Fed models to the persistent decline in productivity trends to the rise of global populism to signs of incipient inflation. To those with a high tolerance for dense topics, we look forward to sharing this piece in coming weeks. 
As a precursor to this tome, we offer one vignette from MacroMavens, in Figure 3, below, to summarize our views on U.S. economic trends. One of the most reliable precursors of employment gains has always been the direction of corporate profits. The recently stubborn falloff in corporate profits suggests payroll statistics are about to endure significant stress. Hardly an environment for significant Fed tightening!

2890,Hillary Clinton Sells 20% of US Uranium To Russia WTF ?,"We Are Change 

Hey — had you heard that uranium is an incredibly scarce resource and that Russia is buying it all up? 
No, me neither. 
But that’s what I’ve discovered on the campaign trail. 
Apparently a few years back Hillary Clinton betrayed the country — yet again — by selling 20% of our precious uranium supply to Russia in return for yet more payola.
As secretary of state she “approved” a deal to sell Uranium One, a company that controlled a fifth of U.S. uranium production, to the Russian atomic agency Rosatom. In return she and Bill received vast amounts of payoffs from the Kremlin and related interests — most notably a $500,000 speaker fee for Bill from a Moscow-based investment bank, which works out at about $250,000 net of tax.
(Money also went to the Clinton Foundation charity, from which the Clintons personally steal money through a channel so clever and cynical that it remains hidden). 
The deal is a perfect example of “Clinton Corruption,” says Donald Trump. “As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take… control of about 20% of America’s uranium supply to the Russians.”
It shows the “long and lucrative history of financial deals with the Russians, particularly with the Russian government,” says Peter Schweizer, author of the book “Clinton Cash,” director of the film of the same name, and an editor at large for the always-reliable Breitbart website. Uranium is “a fundamental issue of national security,” Schweizer told Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business. “It’s not like oil and gas that you can find all sorts of places. They are precious few places you can mine for uranium, in the United States is one of those areas.”
Even the New York Times — a wholly owned subsidiary of the Worldwide Clinton-Illuminati-Spectre Cabal — was critical. “Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal,” it reported in a big expose published earlier this year, in which it even floated the prospect of a Putin “monopoly” of uranium down the road.
It’s all very, very troubling. Apart from just one teensy weeny little problem.
Uranium isn’t a scarce resource that Vladimir Putin, or anyone else, is about to control.
Uranium is a massive drug on the international commodity markets. There is a worldwide glut. It is produced all around the world, and there is so much of it washing around that the price is in free-fall — and has been for almost 10 years. Right now the world’s uranium miners are so desperate that they are actually giving it away for less — literally — than it costs them to dig it out of the ground.
Uranium prices have collapsed by a staggering 88% since their peak in the summer of 2007. They are down about three quarters since the February 2011 Fukushima nuclear reactor disaster in Japan, which caused that country to switch off most of its reactors and caused everyone else to review their nuclear-energy production.
As it happens, the price of this allegedly precious commodity just hit a new low of $20 a ton (In 2007 it was $160). It’s now half the price it was when the Russians took control of Uranium One. According to the World Nuclear Association, the miners’ trade body, that’s about 20% below the average cost of digging it out of the ground. Two thirds of the world’s uranium costs more than $20 a pound to mine.
The problem is that while lots of mines are producing it, hardly anyone wants it. Nearly all of the commercial use for uranium is for nuclear energy. Nuclear reactors are being mothballed. Plans for massive nuclear expansion are being shelved or reconsidered. Fukushima caused a massive political backlash against nuclear energy.
Even countries that still plan on building many more reactors — such as China and India — started slow-walking their plans and rethinking. And then the price of other sources of energy, such as oil and gas, collapsed. So there is even less demand for new reactors.
Meanwhile, despite the panic, U.S. uranium output isn’t very important anyway. According to the World Nuclear Association, the U.S. ranks ninth among global producers. Our production is less than one quarter of Australia’s and less than one tenth of Canada’s. The U.S. accounts for about 2% of total uranium production worldwide — meaning that the U.S. mines now in Putin’s hands account for about 0.4% of world output.
Whoa! You can really see why Vladimir Putin wanted “control” of it — and why the Clintons were able to charge him in return a stratospheric $250,000 net (plus, of course, the secret funds stolen from the Clinton Foundation) in return.
Why hasn’t there been an investigation? Where is the FBI when you really need it?
OK, maybe “technically,” Hillary didn’t personally actually “approve” the deal. Turns out she had no actual veto power over it. But she was one of many people who could have referred it to the president, who could have blocked it. There are lots of others who also approved it, including multiple regulators and stock exchanges around the world (Uranium One is actually a Canadian company). The fact that they all waved it through just shows how wide the Clintons’ tentacles really stretch.
But I always like to end on a positive note, and I have one now. If uranium really is a scarce and precious resource and Vladimir Putin is secretly trying to corner the market, as so many of these sources allege, then obviously sooner or later the price is going to explode. And if that’s true, I know an easy way you can guarantee yourself a fortune.
Just go out and buy stock in Uranium Participation Corp. URPTF, -0.36% a publicly traded Canadian company that functions effectively as a uranium trust. It simply owns a lot of uranium on behalf of investors. Its price has, of course, absolutely collapsed along with the underlying price of the uranium in its vaults, and the stock is now at record lows.
Although it is a Canadian stock, and its primary exchange is in Toronto, the stock also trades freely over the counter in the U.S.
I assume that all those people raging against Hillary’s evil uranium “sell out” to Putin, and warning about the coming uranium apocalypse, have plunged tons of their own money into the stock. Right?
And if they haven’t — what does that tell you?

2891,"Woes for ITT, a For-Profit School, Bode Worse for Its Students - The New York Times","The vise appears to be tightening at the   education giant ITT Educational Services. Its profits are collapsing, its stock is below $2, and last Monday the company got bad news from the Education Department in Washington, a main overseer. ITT, which operates 138 campuses in 39 states, said it had received a letter from the government demanding $44 million to cover potential obligations that might arise, such as student refunds. The department cited increased risks at ITT as the reason for the demand. A call for $44 million may not sound like a death knell. But it was just the latest in a series of setbacks at ITT. And if the past is prologue, the company’s woes could have dire consequences for its current and former students. The situation has uncanny echoes of a collapse of a   educational institution about two decades ago. According to its most recent financial statement, ITT provides   programs to 43, 000 students at ITT Technical Institute and Daniel Webster College locations. In April, the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools told ITT Technical Institute that its schools had not demonstrated that they met certain standards. ITT said it believed that the schools were in compliance, but acknowledged that if the schools lost the accreditation, they would lose access to government loan programs. As a consequence, the company said in a regulatory filing, “we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business. ” ITT may survive these threats. But if it doesn’t, thousands of customers will be left shouldering debt that they almost surely cannot pay off. How many students are we talking about? Two years ago, ITT had 191, 225 borrowers carrying $4. 6 billion in debt, a report published last fall by the Brookings Institution said. That averages out to about $24, 000 per borrower. That number has undoubtedly increased since then. Students who have taken out loans to attend a school that later fails encounter many problems. Consider what happened at the Wilfred American Educational Corporation, which operated beauty and secretarial schools back to the 1980s. Wilfred ran roughshod over students and profited on the taxpayers’ dime. In its heyday, Wilfred enrolled over 11, 000 students at 58 campuses across the country. It closed in the   after regulators uncovered routine falsification of federal student aid applications. To attend the schools, Wilfred students took out more than 61, 000 loans between 1986 and 1994, court documents show. Decades later, many of these loans are still outstanding. The company received $405 million in federal student aid between 1980 and 1989, documents show, accounting for almost all of its revenue. Former Wilfred students later confirmed in a lawsuit against the Department of Education that the company had obtained some of those federal loans without permission from students or by falsely certifying borrower eligibility. Under these circumstances, students qualify for what’s known as a “false certification discharge,” a loan forgiveness arrangement created by Congress in 1992. In such cases, the secretary of education is supposed to “discharge the borrower’s liability on the loan (including interest and collection fees) by repaying the amount owed on the loan. ” But the Education Department never notified the former Wilfred students that they could be eligible for loan forgiveness, lawyers for the students say. For years, debt collectors hounded borrowers for repayment. Many have had their tax refunds taken away. The department’s failure to alert these students to possible loan forgiveness is the subject of the 2014 lawsuit brought by former Wilfred students. The suit contends that the Education Department violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the activities of federal agencies. The Education Department has fought the lawsuit at every turn. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nicole Elam, an ITT spokeswoman, said in a statement that the false certification that occurred at Wilfred did not apply to ITT. “It’s not a fair comparison to raise it in any hypothetical involving our organization,” she said. Understandably, the Education Department doesn’t want to burden United States taxpayers by repaying Wilfred students’ loans. But the obligations are beyond onerous for the borrowers. Amounts owed have ballooned, thanks to interest costs and collection fees. And the debts have wrecked borrowers’ credit scores, making it impossible for many to rent an apartment or buy a car. Jane Greengold Stevens, director of litigation at New York Legal Assistance Group in Manhattan, represents the former Wilfred students in the lawsuit. She said that the average student’s loan was $2, 500 when it was taken out, but the average amount now owed has grown to $24, 000. In an interview, Ms. Stevens said she understood the government’s desire not to load forgiven student debts onto taxpayers’ shoulders. But the department, she added, “doesn’t seem to be taking into account the harm done to students who were desperate when they were recruited and who have lost part of their lives to these schools. ” The Education Department failed Wilfred students three ways, the lawsuit said. First, it didn’t take “reasonable steps to determine whether students’ eligibility for federally guaranteed loans to attend Wilfred was falsely certified. ” It erred again by enforcing Wilfred loan obligations without having taken those steps. Finally, the agency did not send notice about possible discharges “as required by statute and regulation. ” Lawyers for the former students began their battle with the Education Department in 2013 by asking it to notify all former Wilfred students that their loans could be forgiven. The department responded by saying it believed it had enough evidence to send notifications only to students who had attended one branch of Wilfred  —   in Philadelphia. But a 1996 documentation of Wilfred violations by a loan analyst at the Education Department, based on findings by its inspector general, concluded that fraud at roughly 50 of its locations was so pervasive that students submitting a valid application for a discharge should be approved. Anna Bernardez, of White Plains, is a plaintiff in the Wilfred case. In an interview, she harked back to 1987 when she attended a school in the Bronx, pursuing a degree in cosmetology. She dropped out after three months, and soon the school closed. “They made me sign papers, but I didn’t realize they were taking out loans in my name,” Ms. Bernardez said. What began as a $7, 000 loan ultimately grew to $22, 000. Repayment demands were unceasing. “It was a nightmare,” she said. “My credit was messed up I just started getting credit little by little now. ” Thirty years later. Last month, lawyers representing these students won a major court victory, allowing the suit against the Education Department to go forward. “The whole point of our lawsuit is that there are more than 50, 000 people out there who have no idea that the discharge application process exists,” Ms. Stevens said. “The Department of Ed is taking advantage of these people’s ignorance in the same way that the schools took advantage of their vulnerability. ” Wilfred dispensed 60, 000 loans. If ITT and other schools fail, hundreds of thousands of borrowers  —   maybe millions  —   could be in for the same treatment. Ugly, no?",0

2893,APOCALYPSE NOW: Trump Voters Warn Of ‘Revolution’ If Clinton Wins,"APOCALYPSE NOW: Trump Voters Warn Of ‘Revolution’ If Clinton Wins By Andrew Bradford on October 28, 2016 Subscribe 
There’s nothing wrong with being passionate when it comes to your political beliefs and the candidate you support. In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. 
Take for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : “People are going to march on the capitols. They’re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. “If push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.” 
Roger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: “It’s not what I’m going to do, but I’m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I’ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white — there’s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there’s no together. The country has never been so divided. I’m looking at revolution right now.” 
As Trump continues to talk of the election being “rigged,” his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: “If she comes after the guns, it’s going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won’t hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.” 
Retired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he’s ready to do whatever is necessary: “I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.” 
See if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be “heroes” in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children. Words can have consequences.

2894,Egypt Sends Submersible in Search for EgyptAir Jet’s Black Boxes - The New York Times,"CAIRO  —   Egypt has deployed a submersible to help find the wreckage of EgyptAir Flight 804 in the deep Mediterranean waters where it crashed, President Abdel Fattah   said Sunday, as he warned that it might take a “long time” before the cause of the crash was determined. An international flotilla of search ships, aided by surveillance planes, was scouring a section of sea 180 miles north of the port city of Alexandria, and retrieved some wreckage, belongings and human remains over the weekend. But the search crews have yet to find the main body of the plane and its cockpit data and voice recorders, commonly known as the black boxes. They hope the recorders will explain what caused the Airbus A320, carrying 66 people, to plunge from the sky early Thursday as it headed to Cairo from Paris. A statement from the Islamic State on Saturday failed to mention the EgyptAir crash, confounding speculation that the group, which claimed to have been behind the bombing of a Russian airliner in Sinai in October, might have been responsible. Although Egyptian officials initially pointed to terrorism as the most likely cause of the crash, Mr. Sisi stressed on Sunday that all possibilities were being considered. “All hypotheses are possible,” he said. “Please, let’s not jump to any conclusions. ” So far, the strongest clues have come from signals emitted by the stricken plane indicating that several smoke detectors were activated as it hurtled toward the sea. The French air aviation authority said that while those transmissions provided evidence of a catastrophic systems failure inside the plane, they did not provide enough information to determine what had caused the crash. The uncertainty added to the anguish of the relatives of the passengers, most of them Egyptian and French citizens. Funeral services for some crew members and passengers took place in Cairo and other towns over the weekend other families remained at two hotels near the Cairo airport, waiting for news. Six of the victims came from a single village, about 50 miles north of the Egyptian capital. On Sunday night at the Abu el Makarim mosque in central Cairo, men in EgyptAir uniforms stood solemnly as prayers were offered for Mohammed Farag, one of three security officers on Flight 804. “He talked with his hands,” Ahmad Shalash said, recalling Mr. Farag. “Wherever he went, laughter followed him. ”   women sat around Mr. Farag’s mother, her face streaked with tears as mourners whispered condolences and prayers in her ear. Several people expressed frustration with the slow progress in the search for bodies. Across town, hundreds of people, many of them in their 20s, attended prayer services Sunday night for Engy Selim, 26, a French teacher who died with her mother, Hala   a tour guide, on Flight 804. The two had spent more than a week vacationing in Paris, where the family owned a house, said Yousra   one of Ms. Selim’s closest friends. Four days after the downing of the plane, the crowd at the service on Sunday, at a mosque in the New Cairo district, seemed not to have moved on from the initial shock: Young people gathered in clusters, some smoking quietly and others whispering to one another about what may have happened to the plane. Ragia Mourad, a cousin of Ms. Selim’s, recalled learning the news. “They kept saying they couldn’t find the airplane, they couldn’t find the airplane, and we stayed in front of the TV, looking for any news, until we discovered the airplane,” she said, her voice trailing off. Ms. Reedy also struggled with words as she tried to summarize the essence of Ms. Selim, mentioning her smile, her love for her students and her ability to “forgive anyone. ” EgyptAir, in a statement on Saturday, condemned efforts by unidentified people to capitalize on the tragedy by falsely claiming to be raising money for the victims’ families. The submersible that Mr. Sisi said was headed for the search zone on Sunday is operated by the country’s Petroleum Ministry and can descend to a depth of 9, 800 feet. The vessel was not manned and is normally used for oil and gas exploration, said Hamdy Abdel Aziz, a spokesman for the Petroleum Ministry. Mr. Sisi said he hoped the submersible would find the flight voice and data recorders, although experts said it was not clear whether it had the necessary equipment to find them. Both flight recorders are fitted with acoustic beacons, or “pingers,” that can be detected from a distance of up to about three miles. But those pings can be detected only by using specialized underwater microphones attached to lengthy towing cables. Only a few organizations have that kind of equipment, and it was not believed that any of them had yet arrived in Egypt. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014 renewed the focus on efforts to make black boxes easier to find when a plane crashes at sea or in a remote area. One proposal involves using a satellite Internet system, much like the ones that provide     for passengers, to transmit flight data back to the airline headquarters in real time. In Washington on Sunday, government officials debated whether the Islamic State or some other terrorist entity had orchestrated the EgyptAir crash. Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the preponderance of evidence he had seen suggested terrorism might be less likely than initially thought  —   and that if the crash was an act of terrorism, it was more likely carried out by a “lone actor. ” “We’ve looked at the signals intelligence. We’ve looked at the manifests,” Mr. Schiff said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week. ” “We have not come up with any hard evidence of terrorism as of yet. ”",0
2895,Hillary Releases The Most Inspiring Video EVER Chronicling Her Historic Rise To The Top,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Here we are, on the cusp of what is most definitely the most important presidential election of our lifetimes. There’s a lot on the line that goes far beyond politics. It goes into the character of the candidates, and their fitness for office. In GOP nominee Donald Trump, we have an unstable reality star who is dangerously unqualified, temperamentally unfit, and nothing more than a bigoted demagogue who has managed to fleece half the nation into believing his authoritarian ways will solve all their problems. 
On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton taking up the mantle for the Democrats. She will take the nation forward into a brighter future, reassure and protect our allies, and continue the social and economic progress that President Obama has done so much for. We’re talking about a woman who has been First Lady, a United States Senator, and Secretary of State. She performed admirably in all of those roles. 
And now, at the end of what has been a bruising, ugly campaign thanks to the dangerous rhetoric of one Donald J. Trump, we have forgotten one thing: We are witnessing history. Hillary is the first woman to shatter the glass ceiling to become the nominee of one of America’s two major parties. It’s easy to lose sight of all of that in such a crazy election season, but we have much to celebrate. 
Luckily, Hillary’s campaign didn’t lose sight of that, and they released an amazingly inspiring video that chronicled her meteoric rise to the Democratic Party’s nomination for President. It goes from the announcement, through the primaries, and through the ridiculousness of having to run against Donald Trump. And here we are, waiting with bated breath on the eve of this stressful election, and Hillary has given us the priceless gift of something to celebrate in a world that feels quite bleak right now. Without further ado, here it is, The Story of Us, via Hillary’s Twitter: The story of this campaign. pic.twitter.com/8cft9HD0RI 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 5, 2016 
So, take a deep breath, watch that amazing video, and remember – VOTE BLUE. 
Here’s to you, Hillary, and hopefully, in two days we’ll be calling you what you’ve been destined to be called your whole life: MADAME PRESIDENT.

2897,"Muslims Blast Call To Prayer, So Infidel Mayor Returns With Nasty Surprise","Share This Residents were fed up with hearing the Islamic call to prayer blasting at 5 a.m. each morning, so Mayor Yair Revivo decided to give the Muslim community a taste of their own medicine. 
Although citizens were fed up, they were too afraid to call out a Muslim community for disturbing the peace by blasting their call to prayer in the early morning hours. However, as soon as the mayor heard what was happening, he decided to give the Muslims a taste of their own medicine. 
Regardless of which country Muslims infiltrate, they eventually overtake the politically correct majority with their incessant demands, compulsive behavior, and intimidating tactics. Unfortunately, even the last Jewish state on earth is slowly being driven out of their own land after millennia of thriving under religious persecution. 
As the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel is the only country in which Muslims and Jews can live free — that is, as long as the Muslim community is kept under strict control. Exacting the same racism, religious persecution, and terrorism they commit in every country to which they migrate, even the ever-progressing Jewish nation is finding it impossible to coexist with such barbarity. In an attempt to establish their religion as supreme, the Muslim community in Lod (Lydda) has been blasting the adhan, unconcerned with the non-Muslim population it disturbs and intimidates. 
Fortunately, there are still those who are willing to buck political correctness to stand against this bigotry. Hamodia reports that, in an attempt to combat the blatantly disruptive calls to prayer, Mayor Yair Revivo announced a new program to the city on Tuesday night. 
The Jewish leader has vowed that since the Muslims are blaring their adhan and refusing to turn it down to an acceptable volume, the city will blast the Jewish song “Shem Yisrael” at the same time. 
Aryeh Levi, a member of the city council, has begun singing the beautiful rendition of the Jewish prayer over loudspeakers, completely drowning out the unbearable adhan. Because the local Muslims were given chances to quiet their call to prayer but repeatedly refused, the Jewish community is invoking their country’s religious heritage to “fight fire with fire.” 
Revivo explained that the new program has nothing to do with Judaism or Islam but peace and quiet. Muslims pray 5 times a day, but the first call to prayer is around an hour and a half before sunrise, which is often as early as 5 a.m. Undeniably, this is incredibly disturbing for non-Muslim residents, especially those living closer to the mosques. 
In a statement, Revivo’s office said that “the use of loudspeakers for the call to prayer has over time turned into a national phenomenon, and causes much suffering and annoyance for residents, who are awakened from their slumber in the early morning hours and are subject to the call several times a day. Both Jews and Muslims who live near mosques have complained about the noise. The city has tried to limit this phenomenon using legal means, as the call to prayer is a serious violation of laws against noise, but so far we have been unsuccessful.” 
Lod is home to 45,000 Jews and 21,000 Arabs, however, it is the religious minority that repeatedly terrorizes their hosts. Whether by noise pollution or old-fashioned Islamic terrorism, Muslims in Israel are attempting to overthrow democracy and freedom for Sharia. If this happens, history shows us that the Jews will again be oppressed, executed, and exiled, just as the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled when he invaded and butchered the peaceful Jewish tribes of Medina . 
According to the Times of Israel , Revivo, who is Jewish, said Lod “would be an Arab city today if not for the garin torani — a group of religious Zionists who began working in Lod 20 years ago to strengthen Jewish identity there. 
Of course, Muslims immediately resorted to whining, angrily disputing being subjected to the same annoyance they create for others. 
Abed el Karim Azbargeh, an Arab member of the city council, said Revivo had chosen a Jewish religious celebration for “cheap politics” and had acted in a “disgusting and irresponsible” way. 
Muslims look us in the eyes and swear that “there is no compulsion in religion” while blasting the mandatory call for their mandatory prayers. Then, they demand special food, breaks, clothing, holidays, and other amenities at the expense of others. Unfortunately, appeasing these inherently violent worshipers does nothing but speed up their goal of establishing an Islamic state. Once they become powerful or numerous enough, the rest of the populace is too afraid to speak out.",0

Veteran forced to pay back bonus: ‘I was left nearly penniless’ By Arnaldo Rodgers on October 28, 2016 Veteran By Kait Richmond and Marisa Russell Robert Richmond dedicated 15 years to serving his country. Part of that time was rewarded with a $15,000 bonus, promised to him if he agreed to re-enlist and complete another six years of service. In November 2006 Richmond received the money. He honorably retired from the military in 2012, and two years later — nearly a decade after he got the bonus — he received a letter demanding he repay it. “I was left nearly penniless,” the father of two told CNN’s Chris Cuomo on “New Day” on Wednesday. 
Thousands forced to repay Richmond is not alone — thousands of other veterans were forced to repay millions of dollars in re-enlistment bonuses after the California National Guard awarded them in error. When officials realized their mistake, they wanted their money back — with interest.

2900,Trump Wins Israel With 49% Votes vs Clinton's 44%,"
Republican nominee Donald Trump won the US presidential vote among American citizens voting from Israel, according to an iVoteIsrael exit poll taken this week, but in an election plagued with low favorability ratings for both candidates, he had a far less impressive showing than past Republicans have in Israel.
As The Jerusalem Post exclusively reported on Wednesday, Trump received 49% of the Israeli-American vote, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton got 44%, according to the poll conducted by get-out-to vote organization iVoteIsrael and KEEVOON Global Research.
The majority of voters in Israel viewed the candidates unfavorably, with Trump receiving a 65% unfavorable rating and 32% favorable, and Clinton seen as 64% unfavorable and 34% favorable.
In fact, 49% of voters in Israel said the main reason they chose their candidate was because of the “danger of electing the other candidate.” More Trump voters (60%) chose this reason than Clinton voters (39%).
Despite Trump winning among Americans in Israel, more of them are registered Democrats (33%) than Republicans (27%). Of Trump’s votes in Israel, 25% came from Democrats, and 10% of Clinton’s votes came from Republicans.
iVoteIsrael’s poll found the states evenly split between the two major-party candidates, with New York, New Jersey, California, Maryland and swingstate Florida going to Trump, and Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and swing-state Pennsylvania choosing Clinton. The votes from Ohio, another swing state, were tied at 44%.
Trump’s margin of victory was larger among men only, 59% of whom voted for the Republican, while 52% of female voters chose Clinton.

2901,Blue-leaf begonias use quantum mechanics to survive low light environments,"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 14:18 UTC © Matthew Jacobs Begonia species adapted to deep-shade conditions display blue leaf iridescence, a striking form of structural color originating from specialized chloroplasts in the epidermis. There's a very good reason for this plant's iridescent color. In the fading twilight on the rainforest floor, a plant's leaves glimmer iridescent blue. And now scientists know why. These exotic blue leaves pull more energy out of dim light than ordinary leaves because of an odd trick of quantum mechanics. A team of plant scientists led by Heather Whitney of the University of Bristol in the U.K. has just discovered the remarkable origin and purpose of the shiny cobalt leaves on the Malaysian tropical plant Begonia pavonina . The plant owes its glimmer to its peculiar machinery for photosynthesis, the process plants use to turn light into chemical energy. Strangely enough, these blue leaves can squeeze more energy out of the red-green light that reaches the eternally dim rainforest floor. Whitney and her colleagues describe the blue leaves today in the journal Nature Plants . ""It's actually quite brilliant. Plants have to cope with every obstacle that's thrown at them without running away. Here we see evidence of a plant that's actually evolved to physically manipulate the little light it receives,"" says Whitney, ""it's quite amazing, and was an absolutely surprising discovery."" Slowing Down Light © Matthew Jacobs Begonia species adapted to deep-shade conditions display blue leaf iridescence, a striking form of structural color originating from specialized chloroplasts in the epidermis. These 'iridoplasts' contain highly-ordered grana whose arrangement enhances absorption Whitney and her colleagues made their fascinating discovery by working with a lab-grown crossbreed of two species of the the Begonia plant. The scientists couldn't simply use the native species found in the darkness of the Malaysian jungle, she says. It's absurdly delicate, grows slowly, and withers under anything less than perfect growing conditions. Instead, the scientists developed a much heartier breed that still sported the exotic blue leaves. The plant researchers then used an imaging tool called an electron microscope. Peering into the leaves' cellular structures, the scientists found that the plants had some peculiar chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are basically a plant's power generators—they're cellular capsules that hold all the machinery responsible conducting photosynthesis. In particular, Whitney and her colleagues noticed something funky with the spire-like structures called thylakoids found inside the chloroplast capsules. Thylakoids look like tiny towers, and the light that enters them is what's turned into chemical energy. Look inside the chloroplasts of most plants and you'd find these tower-like fairly randomly placed, like a slap-dash collection of buildings. But the thylakoids inside the Begonia's chloroplasts had a incredibly regular structure. Less like the irregular Manhattan skyline, and more like a planned city. According to Whitney, the rigid, precise structure of these thylakoids creates a couple of fascinating effects. First, their ordered placement means that the entire chloroplast capsules tend to reflect away blue wavelengths of light, which is why the leaves appear iridescent blue to our eyes. Losing this blue light isn't a problem for the Begonia plant's energy efficiency, since most blue light is absorbed by the rainforest growing above it anyway. Instead, the thylakoids are far better at absorbing red-green light, the flavor that tends to be most abundant in the perpetual dim of the rainforest floor. But here's the strangest quality of these cellular structures: Light itself actually slows down as it barrels through the Begonia plants' chloroplasts. That's due to the precise arrangement of the tower-like thylakoids, which together act like a dense crystal. While light always travels the same speed in a vacuum, it will slow down when passing through different types of matter. This effect is known in quantum physics as slow light . Combined with the increased uptake of red-green light, this effect increases the efficiency of the Begonia plant's photosynthesis up to 10 percent. Interestingly enough, Whitney says, the Begonia plants they studied had a mix of normal plant chloroplasts and the odd, highly ordered blue variety. ""We think these serve a function almost like a backup generator,"" she says, ""meaning the plant will use its [regular] chloroplasts if there's enough light, but can switch when the light levels get extremely low. ""It's just wonderful and logical to think that a plant has evolved an ability to physically manipulate the lighting around it in a variety of different ways. I think it really raises the prospect that this type of phenomenon might even be more widespread than we realize in the plant kingdom. Perhaps we just don't notice other plants that are doing this because they don't have a strange color.""",0

2903,Reporter: I Would Not Have Run Buzzfeed Story on Trump in Russia,"Rosie Gray, an   reporter who now works at The Atlantic magazine, told Breitbart News exclusively that she disagrees with the decision her old editor, BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith, made to run a fake news dossier against President Donald Trump accusing the    of having untoward relations with Russia. [“I would not have made that decision to run that,” Gray told Breitbart News on Tuesday when asked if she would have run either the BuzzFeed story containing the dossier or the previous CNN piece on live television and online which aimed to lend credibility to the dossier without actually publishing it. Gray does still consider Smith a mentor and a friend, however.  Gray’s decision to speak out publicly against her former employer, BuzzFeed, is noteworthy considering she was one of the top newsroom employees there. She also, in her new capacity as a reporter for The Atlantic, delivered one of the earliest and strongest hammer blows against Smith’s and CNN’s decision to publish the dossier, discrediting BuzzFeed and CNN. “It Is Fake News Meant to Malign Mr. Trump” read the headline on Gray’s exposé debunking BuzzFeed’s report on a supposed intelligence document alleging a number of salacious things about Trump and his team. “Michael Cohen, an attorney for the   has denied allegations contained in a dossier published by BuzzFeed News,” Gray’s   in The Atlantic reads, further blowing up the   BuzzFeed scoop. The document published by her old employer, Gray wrote, “alleges that Michael Cohen, special counsel to Trump, was central to ‘the ongoing secret liaison relationship between the New York tycoon’s campaign and the Russian leadership,’ and that he met secretly with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. ” But unlike BuzzFeed, which didn’t actually check to verify the allegations before it published the document, Gray actually checked to see if that specific allegation was true or not. And Gray found the first of many holes in BuzzFeed’s report, ripping her old employer’s fake news report to shreds by having made just a few phone calls to see if the allegations in the document were accurate. Gray wrote: Reached by telephone on Tuesday night, Cohen denied the dossier’s allegations. The story is ‘totally fake, totally inaccurate,’ Cohen said. ‘I’m telling you emphatically that I’ve not been to Prague, I’ve never been to Czech [Republic] I’ve not been to Russia,’ Cohen said. ‘The story is completely inaccurate, it is fake news meant to malign Mr. Trump.’ Cohen said that during the time the report places him in Prague, he was actually with his son visiting USC and meeting with the baseball coach. Gray, unlike BuzzFeed, actually called the source of the allegation to ask him if it was true before she printed it. And she called the University of Southern California, too, to verify that claim  —   and they confirmed it. Gray wrote at her new publication, The Atlantic: A USC baseball source confirmed Tuesday night that Cohen and his son had visited USC on August 29th. Cohen said that he was in Los Angeles from the 23rd through the 29th of August, and that the rest of the month he was in New York. He said that his only trip to an EU country over the summer had been a vacation to Italy in July. In one instance, the dossier places the alleged Prague travel in ‘  2016.’ Cohen said he was in New York for the entire month of September. Gray is part of a group of discredited   staffers who fled the publication in a recent mass exodus. Andrew Kaczynski, who was a lead researcher for BuzzFeed, went to work for CNN. And McKay Coppins, the largely discredited BuzzFeed scribe who inaccurately profiled Trump before he ran for president in a hit piece claiming Trump would never run for president, joined Gray in traveling to The Atlantic. Among other mistakes that BuzzFeed allowed its reporters to make, Coppins also inaccurately reported the fake news that Breitbart News was funded by Donald Trump during the campaign. BuzzFeed’s Smith, Gray’s old editor, has not immediately responded to a request for comment on Gray’s decision to admonish her old employer’s irresponsible editorial  . CNN in many ways was worse than BuzzFeed in what they did on this front: While CNN did not actually publish the document, anchor Jake Tapper and reporters Jim Sciutto, Evan Perez, and Carl Bernstein lent enormous credibility to the source of the document without verifying any of the now discredited allegations. The episode resulted in a very public blowup for both CNN and BuzzFeed, as at Trump’s first press conference as   earlier in January he blasted CNN’s Jim Acosta —  who broke journalistic norms in his attempts to interrupt the    —  as working for a “Fake News” outlet. Trump also blasted BuzzFeed as a “failing pile of garbage” during that press conference. UPDATE 3:10 p. m. ET: Gray confirms publicly she would not have made the same decision as Smith or CNN, but then tries to rationalize it in an unhinged  . ok so, before this becomes a thing, here’s what actually happened here   https:  .   —   Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) January 24, 2017,    I called Boyle for a story I’m working on.

2904,"Michael Moore SHOCKS the Internet: “If You Make This go Viral, Trump Will Win.”","0 comments 
In a four-minute speech beforeÂ an Ohio audience reportedly to publicize his new movie “Trumpland,” staunch liberal Michael Moore delved into the mindset of Donald Trump’s appeal. In doing so, he inadvertently made the best case for a Trump presidency we’ve heard yet. 
“Theyâre not racists or rednecks, theyâre actually pretty decent people,” Moore surprisingly said of Trump supporters. “So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.” 
Here is an excerpt from his speech: 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobodyâs going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. 
No politician â Republican or Democrat â had ever said anything like that to these executives. And it was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
Whether Trump means it or not is kind of irrelevant because he’s saying the things to people who are hurting. And it’s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten, working stiff, who used to be part of what was called the working class, loves Trump. He is the human Molotov cocktail that they’ve been waiting for; the human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.

2905,"Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras","Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras Because of Hillary Clinton, Emergency-Contraception Is Banned In Honduras By Eric Zuesse Of course, one of Hillary Clinton’s proudest claims is that as the U.S. Secretary of State she championed reproductive choice throughout the world. She championed it in words, but her actions were sometimes in the opposite direction, and there is perhaps no nation where her actions as the U.S. Secretary of State had a bigger impact than Honduras, which case will therefore be examined, and her impact on this documented, here: The reason that the morning-after pill, which enables raped women to avoid becoming pregnant from a rape, was made illegal by the government that now exists in Honduras, is that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton persuaded President Barack Obama not to terminate U.S. financial aid to the coup-regime that came into power there on 28 June 2009. Without that aid, the democratically elected President would quickly have been restored. Though the U.S. Ambassador in Honduras told Secretary of State Clinton that there was no way in which that coup was legal and that consequently it undoubtedly was a “coup” and that existing U.S. law therefore required U.S. funding of the Honduran government to cease immediately, she ignored the law, and she ignored everything except her friend Lanny Davis the lobbyist whom the coup-plotters had hired to represent them to Democrats (a different lobbyist was hired to represent them to the congressional Republicans). President Obama took his Secretary of State’s advice and refused to enforce the law, and Hillary Clinton publicly praised what the regime was doing. The regime was condemned throughout Latin America, because the coup, which consisted of the local aristocracy or ‘oligarchs’, overthrew the democratically elected President of Honduras, who had wanted a land-reform law to be introduced. Immediately after the coup that overthrew him, the newly installed regime allowed the aristocrats’ paid thugs to murder anyone who tried to lead the opposition; and therefore the regime that had been imposed by Honduras’s aristocracy and kept in power by America’s aristocracy, has remained stable since. However, after the coup, Honduras has had the world’s highest murder-rate. Thus, it’s a stable but now extraordinarily violent country. (Detailed documentation of every allegation in this paragraph can be found in the “Honduras” section of this article I earlier wrote about “Hillary Clinton’s Six Foreign-Policy Catastrophes” ; and that section on Honduras, in turn, links to 68 sources, which provide the sometimes gruesome details regarding Hillary Clinton’s impact upon the lives of the Honduran people since the coup. However, that article didn’t mention this matter concerning contraception, rape, and abortion; and, so, the present article will be an extension from that earlier one, dealing specifically with Hillary Clinton’s impact upon family-planning and reproductive choice in Honduras.) One feature of the new, U.S.-backed, regime, was the imposition of draconian fundamentalist laws against contraception and intensifying the abortion-ban. On 13 February 2012, the Center for Reproductive Rights headlined “Honduras Supreme Court Upholds Absolute Ban on Emergency Contraception, Opens Door to Criminalize Women and Medical Professionals” and reported: The Honduras Supreme Court has upheld the country’s absolute ban on emergency contraception, which would criminalize the sale, distribution, and use of the “morning-after pill” — imposing punishment for offenders equal to that of obtaining or performing an abortion, which in Honduras is completely restricted. “By banning and criminalizing emergency contraception, Honduras is telling the world it would rather imprison the women of its country than provide them with safe and effective birth control,” said Luisa Cabal, director of international legal programs at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Today’s decision from the Honduras Supreme Court blatantly disregards women’s fundamental reproductive rights and completely ignores the respected medical opinion of experts around the globe. It will cause significant harm in the lives countless women and doctors across the country. … Consequently, the hell in Honduras has been accentuated by punishment of women who have been raped, and punishment of doctors and pharmacists who try to help them. The President whom Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the ten main aristocratic families of Honduras , overthrew and prohibited from running for President ever again, Manuel Zelaya, had, in April 2009, vetoed a law that the Honduran legislature (controlled by those ten families plus another 15 or so ) had just passed to ban the morning-after pill. So, that law didn’t enter into force until the U.S.-imposed regime restored it. However, the restoration of the ban wasn’t final until this decision was handed down by the Honduran Supreme Court. As Amnesty International said at that time : On 1 February, the Supreme Court in Honduras upheld a decree imposing an absolute ban on emergency contraception. This decree was vetoed in May 2009 by the former President on grounds that it conflicted with the Constitution. The Supreme Court has now concluded that the decree is constitutional and that Congress can begin to develop laws enforcing a ban of the emergency contraceptive pill on the basis of its alleged “abortive” nature. The World Health Organization, Pan-American Health Organization, and several other expert bodies have clearly stated that the emergency contraceptive pill is not abortive; it is a form of contraception that works by ensuring the egg is inaccessible and impeding fertilization. The criminalization of the emergency contraceptive pill will have appalling consequences. For example, rape victims will be unable to prevent pregnancy … And so it has been in Honduras. During the period since the 28 June 2009 Honduran U.S.-backed coup, the hell in Honduras has been so bad that Honduras has become one of the top sources of illegal immigration into the United States. The world-record-high murder-rates and crushing poverty, with no opportunity for the public to ‘move up in the world’ other than through becoming one of the paid enforcers for the aristocrats, which often also entails leading the now-booming drug-gangs there, has essentially forced out of Honduras millions of residents, and many of them have escaped through Mexico into the United States, in order to be able to have a decent life, rather than murder and be murdered. Hillary Clinton’s opponent in the U.S. Presidential campaign, Donald Trump, never talks about the hell that Clinton and Obama have been imposing around the world (except regarding non-Christian-majority countries such as Libya), and he seems to view illegal immigrants as if U.S. foreign policies have nothing to do with creating the problems that those people are facing, but there is no indication that he would continue those policies, which have been causing them to be illegal immigrants here. To the contrary, his anti-interventionist foreign-policy proposals would be inconsistent with coups and invasions regarding any foreign country whose government is not posing an imminent threat to U.S. national security. Trump’s foreign-policy proposals are not in any way favorable toward those of Hillary Clinton (who is simply an extreme version of Obama’s worst policy-orientations). (And America’s own Federation of American Scientists has stated that Obama is lying in order to ‘justify’ his policy now to ignore existing in-force nuclear treaties with Russia as being supposedly not violations of them. So, though he may not be as much of a neoconservative as she is, he basically is one, too. His aggression against Russia is subtle , but forceful .) Consequently, at least regarding foreign policy, a President Trump would be authentic change, irrespective of whether a particular voter would approve of that change as opposed to continuing America’s existing foreign policy but in a more extreme way. Among other things, a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote to retain the status-quo in Honduras and around the world, but to go much farther in the same direction. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote to change that status-quo — to change (and in some important respects reverse ) that direction . The biggest impact of this election will be on foreign (including both economic and military) policy. Even domestically within the United States, the difference between the two candidates on foreign policies will have a much bigger impact, including possibly even nuclear war , than will the other policy-areas, which the general public erroneously think will have a bigger impact upon their lives and their future than will foreign policies. (And here are quoted recent reports in the Washington Post , Spiegel , Huffington Post , and other serious media, discussing her preparing her coming Administration’s plans and personnel for a war with Russia; and Obama is right now setting everything up for her to be able to start the war as soon as possible.) Regardless of whether the American public know it, the main impact of this Presidential election will be on foreign policy, including on the immense impacts that foreign policy will have domestically. So: this is not the time when the U.S. will be progressing but instead regressing, and intelligent voters will be aiming to minimize the harms, rather than to achieve progress. Progress, at this stage so late in the game, is still being hoped-for only by some fools who happen to be also progressives. Any intelligent progressive, at this late stage, is focused entirely upon minimizing the harm. And the maximum harm could happen with surprising rapidity. (Back in 1961, the estimation of experts was that — as one of the few who spoke publicly stated — “A nuclear war between the United States and Russia would be all over in 24 or 48 hours because both sides would let go with their full atomic arsenals.” The estimates today are far more precise but unpublished, and they’re all well under an hour — some as low as 20 minutes.) There wouldn’t be any surrender, nor any armistice. There would only be the end of civilization , and unspeakable misery (including details that are ignored by the major media, such as this ) until practically everyone is dead (from starvation if nothing else). Those are the stakes in this election. Even to be debating domestic issues at a time like this, simply doesn’t make any sense. But the situation in Honduras points up the ridiculousness, in a fundamentally different context, which is why I am writing about it now.",0
2906,UN Signs Up Syrian Olympic Swimmer to Shine Light on Refugees - Breitbart,"Geneva (AFP)  —   The UN said Thursday it had enlisted Yusra Mardini, the teenage Olympic swimmer who braved a Mediterranean crossing in a leaky dinghy fleeing   Syria, to help raise awareness about the plight of refugees. [The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said it had appointed Mardini as its newest Goodwill Ambassador, a role long famously held by US movie star Angelina Jolie.  Mardini “has become a powerful voice for the forcibly displaced across the world and a powerful example of their resilience and determination to rebuild lives and positively contribute to host communities,” UNHCR said in a statement. The   ’s story is indeed inspiring. In 2015, like millions of others, she fled her home in   Syria. During a perilous journey to the Greek island of Lesbos on board a packed dinghy, the engine failed and the craft began taking on water. Mardini and her sister jumped into the sea, grabbed a rope and spent the next     hours in the choppy water towing the boat to safety. Mardini, who has settled in Germany with her family, went on to take part in the first ever Olympic refugee team at the Rio de Janeiro games last year. “Yusra is a deeply inspiring young woman,” UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said. She added that the Syrian teen “represents the hopes, the fears and the incredible potential of the more than ten million young refugees around the globe. ” Mardini herself said she was thrilled with her appointment. “I could not be more proud to be part of this team,” Mardini told reporters in Geneva. “There is no shame in being a refugee if we remember who we are,” she said. “I am a refugee and I’m proud to stand for peace, for decency and dignity for all those fleeing violence. ”",0

2908,Crooked Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta Took Part In Satanic Blood Rituals And Black Magic,"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Crooked Hillary Campaign Chairman John Podesta Took Part In Satanic Blood Rituals And Black Magic The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. by Geoffrey Grider November 4, 2016 In what is undoubtedly the most bizarre Wikileaks revelation to date, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta was invited to a “spirit cooking dinner” by performance artist Marina Abramovic, to take part in an occult ritual founded by Satanist Aleister Crowley. In an email dated June 28, 2015, Abramovic wrote, “I am so looking forward to the Spirit Cooking dinner at my place. Do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining? All my love, Marina.” Tony Podesta then forwarded the email to his brother John Podesta (Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman), asking him, “Are you in NYC Thursday July 9 Marina wants you to come to dinner.” What is “spirit cooking”? Spirit cooking refers to “a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley” and involves an occult performance during which menstrual blood, breast milk, urine and sperm are used to create a “painting”. The Podestas’“Spirit Cooking” dinner? It’s not what you think. It’s blood, sperm and breastmilk. 
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 4, 2016 According to Marina Abramovic , if the ritual is performed in an art gallery, it is merely art, but if the ritual is performed privately, then it represents an intimate spiritual ceremony. The video embedded above depicts the bizarre nature of the ceremony. Abramovic mixes together thickly congealed blood as the “recipe” for the “painting,” which is comprised of the words, “With a sharp knife cut deeply into the middle finger of your left hand eat the pain.” The ceremony is, “meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism “As Above, So Below.” Marina Abramovic ‘Spirit Cooking’: “Abramovic is known for her often-gory art that confronts pain and ritual. Her first performance involved repeatedly, stabbing herself in her hands. The next performance featured her throwing her nails, toenails, and hair into a flaming five-point star — which she eventually jumped inside of, causing her to lose consciousness,” writes Cassandra Fairbanks. Another image shows Abramovic posing with a bloody goat’s head – a representation of the occult symbol Baphomet. Spirit cooking is also an “occult practice used during sex cult rituals, as explained in the book “Spirit cooking with essential aphrodisiac recipes,” notes Mike Cernovich. The revelation that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, is presumably interested in weird, gory occult ceremonies was too juicy for even Wikileaks to ignore. “The Podestas’ “Spirit Cooking” dinner? It’s not what you think. It’s blood, sperm and breastmilk. But mostly blood,” the organization tweeted. Some are even linking the spirit cooking revelation to claims that the Podesta emails contain “code for child sex trafficking” that is hidden behind mentions of types of food. Others are connecting it to Laura Silsby , the missionary who was jailed for six months after her organization, New Life Children’s Refuge, attempted to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti into the Dominican Republic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) November 3, 2016 Wikileaks emails reveal that Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin forwarded numerous articles about New Life Children’s Refuge to Clinton. “Julian Assange claimed that the Wikileaks would send Hillary Clinton to prison,” writes Cernovich. “The releases initially disappointed many people, this reporter included, as the evidence of corruption was slim. Assange was right. The real story was hidden in view.” While the child trafficking and pedophile connections to Clinton remain unproven, the fact that her campaign chairman is apparently into spooky occult rituals involving menstrual blood and semen is easily one of the most disturbing Wikileaks revelations to date. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE Geoffrey Grider NTEB is run by end times author and editor-in-chief Geoffrey Grider.

2910,"House Intel Chairman: No Evidence of Contacts Between Trump Campaign, Russian Agents - Breitbart","The chairman of the House Permanent Committee on Intelligence told reporters at the Capitol Monday he has yet to see evidence of contacts between President Donald Trump’s campaign and individuals in the Russian government or part of its extensive network of affiliated persons. [“As of right now, we have no evidence, but we will continue to ask for evidence and look for evidence,” said Rep. Devin Nunes (R. .) who called the press conference to deal with a number of issues, including a New York Times report that the members of the Trump campaign were in contact with Russian intelligence and that he was pressured by the White House to call reporters to knock down the Times story. ”  Nunes said his committee had not concluded its probe into contact between Russian operatives and any of the presidential campaigns. “Not only the three Americans named in that story but also any Americans with the Russians. ” Trump’s national campaign chairman Paul Manafort was named in the Times report, but the other two individuals were not named. Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign Aug. 19, shortly after the Republican National Convention. The hauling of citizens before a congressional hearing based on media reports would bring back the days of McCarthyism, he said. “I am trying to be very careful,” he said. “We can’t have the government —  the U. S. government —    the Congress or another branch of the government chasing down American citizens, calling them before the Congress as if they are some sort of secret Russian agents,” he said. “That is what I am concerned about here —   that we go off on some witch hunt against American citizens just because they appear in a press story somewhere. ” The congressman said he has yet to see any sign that members of the Trump campaign or transition team broke any laws dealing with foreign governments. There were, however, contacts between the Trump camp and the Russians that were completely   he said. After President Barack Obama issued his Dec. 29 sanctions against Russia, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, then designated to serve as Trump’s National Security Adviser, spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak a number of times. Those conversations were wiretapped by the Department of Justice and transcripts of the conversations were given to media outlets. If anything, the FBI should focus on how a DOJ wiretap transcript that had to be approved by the classified Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court went public, which is indisputably a crime, he said. Nunes said that even if Flynn discussed Obama’s December sanctions, he would have no problem —  even if Flynn told the Russians that the incoming Trump administration would ignore or ease that round of sanctions. Flynn has maintained that he did not discuss the sanctions. “If the discussions occurred around ensuring that there was no overreaction by the Russian government, so that the new administration could do like all the other previous administrations, who thought they could work with Putin, all three have been wrong,” Nunes said. “If that is just what General Flynn did, to try and keep the lines of communications open,” he said. “That did us a big favor. ” This comment incensed CNN reporter Jim Sciutto. Sciutto called out to the congressman: “Do you want an administration negotiating against another? Isn’t that one U. S. administration negotiating —  ” The congressman subdued a smirk as he cut Sciutto off, saying, “You want to investigate the Logan Act? You’re a Logan Act guy?” The 1799 Logan Act bans American citizens from negotiating with a foreign power without the approval of the federal government. Sciutto: “I didn’t mention the Logan Act, I’m just saying that if one administration —  ” Nunes cut him off again: “The Logan Act is ridiculous. You guys all know that. ” No one has ever been prosecuted for violating the Logan Act. The other contentious    was between the chairman and reporters, who kept insisting that there was something nefarious about the White House asking Nunes to talk to a reporter about the New York Times story. “It was kind of an odd story, I thought,” the congressman said. CNN reporter Manu Raju asked Nunes if he felt that his integrity was compromised when he spoke to the reporter at the behest of the White House. Nunes said he was not compromised at all. “If the White House asked me to talk to a reporter —     it was one reporter —  if the White House asked me to talk to you? Would that be OK or not OK?” Raju was silent for a long moment, then asked, “What is your response to that?” Raju: “You’re investigating this matter, the White House is urging you to knock down these stories that are leaving questions —  ” Nunes: “That doesn’t happen. That absolutely doesn’t happen. ” Following the press conference, Nunes met with other Republican members of the intelligence committee. As the committee moves forward with its investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election cycle, he pledged to hold regular press availabilities.",0
2911,A Bumblebee Gets New Protection on Obama’s Way Out - The New York Times,"The Obama administration, rushing to secure its environmental legacy, has increased protection for a humble bumblebee. The   bumblebee, once common across the continental United States, has been designated an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service: the country’s first bumblebee, and the first bee from the lower 48 states, to be added to the register. Seven bees were previously listed as endangered, but they are found only in Hawaii. Since the late 1990s, the population of the   bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent, a result of a combination of factors, including exposure to pesticides, climate change, habitat loss and disease, federal wildlife officials said. The species, once found in 28 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces, is found today only in small pockets of its   habitat. The designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees’ habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them. It is the latest in a flurry of   efforts to protect the environment and preserve President Obama’s legacy on climate change. In the last month, he has issued a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large areas of the Arctic and much of the Eastern Seaboard announced two new national monuments in Utah and Nevada, protecting 1. 65 million acres of federal land and denied six permits for oil exploration in the Atlantic, partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals. And the announcement about the bee came a day after the Fish and Wildlife Service said that   climate change is the biggest threat to the polar bear’s survival, and that without significant action to fight global warming, the bears will most likely vanish. Federal wildlife officials noted that the process of listing a species as endangered can take years, sometimes even decades. More than 300 species have been listed during the Obama administration, second only to the more than 500 species listed under President Bill Clinton. During the George W. Bush administration, just 62 species were added to the list. Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, said activists were worried “that we’re headed into another period like that, where hostility from the administration toward protecting endangered species causes them to shut the listing program down. ” The incoming Trump administration, however, would need to undertake a lengthy process to declare the   bumblebee population recovered if it wished to reverse this week’s decision, and it would be required by law to justify its action on scientific grounds. The role of these bees and other   insects is important, Tom Melius, the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Midwest regional director, said in a statement. “Pollinators are small but mighty parts of the natural mechanism that sustains us and our world,” he said. “Without them, our forests, parks, meadows and shrub lands, and the abundant, vibrant life they support, cannot survive, and our crops require laborious, costly pollination by hand. ” Around the world, the populations of bees, butterflies and other insects that promote plant growth are crashing, a threat not only to biodiversity but also to the global food supply. A study last year from a group associated with the United Nations warned that an increasing number of species that aid the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of food each year face extinction. “Obviously, it’s sad that anything has to get on the endangered list, but this really provides a great opportunity,” said Dennis vanEngelsdorp of the University of Maryland, a bee expert who applauded the government’s decision. “When you’re talking about saving the bumblebees, what you’re really talking about is saving the community. ” The kinds of measures that could protect the   bumblebee could help many other pollinators, as well, by restoring habitats and food sources and restricting the use of pesticides  —   especially   insecticides that have been linked to the decline in bee species. Such measures are especially important with native bumblebees, Dr. vanEngelsdorp noted, as opposed to honeybees, which are maintained in large colonies and trucked around the country for commercial pollination. The service is reviewing three other species of bees to determine whether they ought to be listed as endangered as well: Franklin’s bumblebee, the western bumblebee and the   bumblebee. When a species is listed as endangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to design a recovery plan, which is often carried out by other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities and tribes. Other federal agencies have to check that their actions will not hurt an endangered species or its habitat, particularly when it comes to land use planning. Bumblebees are particularly effective pollinators because, though they seem to prefer native flowers, they will pollinate pretty much anything and can fly in lower temperatures and lower light conditions than many other insects. They also use the technique of “buzz pollination,” in which they grab the   part of the flower in their jaws and vibrate their wings, shaking the pollen loose, a process that seems to benefit plants like tomatoes, peppers and cranberries, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Bumblebees are particularly important to agriculture, but agriculture is often unkind to them. A number of factors have reduced the habitat available to bees, including the use of pesticides and other chemicals, the domination of vast amounts of farmland by a single crop, and the use of some genetically modified crops and herbicides that prevent the growth of weeds in fields and wildflowers along their borders. Climate change may also be shrinking the bees’ habitat, because of drought, rising temperatures, more storms and mismatches in timing: Plants may start to flower at times when the bees are not ready to pollinate. It also presents serious threats to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies and other pollinators, such as honeybees. While these species may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bears or other mammals whose existences are threatened by a changing climate, placing them on the endangered list is a victory for the species and those who fight for it. “Now we have a symbol to rally around,” Dr. vanEngelsdorp said.",0
2912,WATCH: Trump Promises To ‘Teach’ Military Experts About Mosul (TWEETS),"Draft-dodger Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, is at war with a military expert who had the audacity to point out Trump’s obvious ignorance about the military operation against ISIS in Mosul, Iraq. 
Today, in an ABC News interview with George Stephanopoulos, Trump sounded off about Mosul. “So you can tell your military expert that I’ll sit down and I’ll teach him a couple of things.” 
In Trump’s experience-free opinion, Mosul is a “total disaster” because we gave too much notice of the attack. The attack on Mosul is turning out to be a total disaster. We gave them months of notice. U.S. is looking so dumb. VOTE TRUMP and WIN AGAIN! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2016 
Trump made similar comments during the last presidential debate . “The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.” 
Unfortunately for Trump, real military experts disagree. The next day, the New York Times reported that such warnings reduce civilian casualties and instill fear within the enemy, among other benefits. Then there was this quote: “‘What this shows is Trump doesn’t know a damn thing about military strategy,’ said Jeff McCausland, a retired Army colonel and former dean at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa.” 
Today, Stephanopoulos asked Trump about his tweet and McCausland’s comment. Trump doubled down . Oh, and check out how he first referred to General George Patton: “The Army War College – let me tell you, the element of surprise. I’ve been hearing about Mosul now for three months, ‘We’re going to attack. We’re going to attack.’ Meaning Iraq’s going to attack but with us, OK? We’re going to attack. Why do they have to talk about it? Don’t talk about it. Element of surprise. General George Patent [sic].” 
Trump subsequently correctly referred to Patton. But his later comments probably did nothing to reassure anyone about his suitability as commander in chief. Besides his desire to lecture McCausland, Trump brushed aside a challenge to his dire assessment of the Mosul operation. 
When Stephanopoulos noted that Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said 35 ISIS leaders have been killed, Trump insisted : “Excuse me: The resistance is much greater now because they knew about the attack. Why can’t they win first and talk later? Why do they have to say, three months before the attack, we’re going in?” 
Of course, Trump provided no evidence to support his argument that a surprise attack would have worked better. But why would he? In Trump’s mind, he knows better than anyone about fighting ISIS, as he said last year that: “I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me.” 
Fortunately, it looks like most Americans don’t believe him.

2913,Olivia Newton John's Daughter Is Vocal About Plastic Surgery Addiction...Here Are the Family Photos She Doesn't Show - Independent Journal Review,"Share on Twitter 
Chloe Lattanzi, actress and daughter of Grammy-winning singer and Hollywood actress, Olivia Newton-John, is talking openly about the body image struggles she had as a teenager—and the things she did to combat her poor self-image. Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
Appearing on Wednesday's episode of “The Doctors,” Lattanzi revealed that she had implants and plastic surgery when she was younger because she suffered from body dysmorphia . 
Body dysmorphia is a disorder which makes people obsess over parts of their body. 
People with the disorder imagine their bodies to be severely flawed, to the point that it makes it difficult for them to function normally. 
Lattanzi spoke about her particular experience with the disorder as a teenager, and the anorexia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression that accompanied it: 
“I went through this sort of chubby phase [as a kid]- I ate to comfort myself. I would see comments in magazines about how I was chubby. So around 16 I started to restrict food, exercise more.” Image Credit: Chris Weeks/Getty Images 
Over one summer in particular, Lattanzi lost a lot of weight, but her new thinness brought with it problems, too. 
She said she turned to plastic surgery and implants: 
“When I was in the height of my body dysmorphia, I had a whole bunch of fillers. I’ve had that all removed from my face because I like the way I look naturally.” 
Recently, Lattanzi saw some photographs of herself as a teenager and doesn't understand why she thought her appearance was so defective. Image Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images 
She says she's never shown the pictures to anyone before, but that they're a valuable tool for providing context to the mental illness from which she was suffering. 
Now, having recovered from body dysmorphia and anorexia, the 30-year-old says she regrets making so many changes to her appearance: 
“I look back at myself and I as a teenager and I’m like, 'What a beautiful young woman.' What was I thinking? Why was I so insecure?” Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
Lattanzi feels that social media's focus on appearance is a major culprit when it comes to young women struggling with negative self-image: 
“I think so many young girls are going through body dysmorphia — we’re constantly told how we’re supposed to look via Instagram and filters. There’s constant pressure for us to look perfect.” 
Now, Lattanzi says she's “stable and in a loving relationship,” but she's still plagued by some anxiety. 
She says the memory of her illness is a wound that may never completely heal. Image Credit: David Livingston/Getty Images 
Body dysmorphia affects about 1.7% to 2.4% of the general population—or one in 50 people. 
It is often accompanied by eating disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
Surprisingly, according to some studies, cases of body dysmorphia are more often found in men than women.",0
2914,Press release on Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s meeting with Namibian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
On October 26, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Namibian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who has come to Moscow on a working visit to attend the sixth session of the Russian-Namibian Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
The parties spotlighted the traditional high level of the two countries’ mutual political understanding. They discussed partnership prospects in many spheres, particularly energy, fishing, railway transport, mining, and supplies of food and equipment. They exchanged opinions on topical international and African issues, including the UN reform, and confirmed their shared determination to work for enhancing the United Nations’ role in global affairs. 
Ms Nandi-Ndaitwah highly evaluated Russia’s policy to promote peace and security, build up a broad international anti-terrorist front, and move towards a settlement in Syria. 
The parties expressed concern over the remaining hotbeds of tension in Africa – in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Western Sahara, Sahara-Sahel region and elsewhere, and spoke in favour of conflict settlement by political means through dialogue and compromise. Related ",0
2915,Do You Belong To An Extraterrestrial Lineage?,"According to Sitchin’s interpretation of Mesopotamian iconography and symbolism, outlined in his 1976 book The 12th Planet and its sequels, there is an undiscovered planet beyond Neptune that follows a long, elliptical orbit, reaching the inner solar system roughly every 3,600 years. This planet is called Nibiru (although Jupiter was the planet associated with the god Marduk in Babylonian cosmology).According to Sitchin, Nibiru (whose name was replaced with MARDUK in original legends by the Babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co-opt the creation for himself, leading to some confusion among readers) collided catastrophically with Tiamat (a goddess in the Babylonian creation myth the Enûma Eliš), which he considers to be another planet once located between Mars and Jupiter. This collision supposedly formed the planet Earth, the asteroid belt, and the comets. Sitchin states that when struck by one of planet Nibiru’s moons, Tiamat split in two, and then on a second pass Nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt. The second half, struck again by one of Nibiru’s moons, was pushed into a new orbit and became today’s planet Earth.


According to Sitchin, Nibiru (called “the twelfth planet” because, Sitchin claimed, the Sumerians’ gods-given conception of the Solar System counted all eight planets, plus Pluto, the Sun and the Moon) was the home of a technologically advanced human-like extraterrestrial race called the Anunnaki in Sumerian myth, who Sitchin states are called the Nephilim in Genesis. He wrote that they evolved after Nibiru entered the solar system and first arrived on Earth probably 450,000 years ago, looking for minerals, especially gold, which they found and mined in Africa. Sitchin states that these “gods” were the rank-and-file workers of the colonial expedition to Earth from planet Nibiru.

There is a lot of confusion about the origin of the word Nephilim and what it means. In Hebrew it literally means to fall. As in fallen angel. The Bible, the Talmud and the Koran (where they are referred to as Djinn) all speak of fallen angels. 

In the Book of Genesis in the Bible it relates how the Nephilim produced children with humans. One was even depicted as killing Japheth, Noah’s son, and taking his place whereupon he fathered many children with Japheth’s unsuspecting wife which eventually populated much of Northern Europe.

In the following video, journey into the world of Fallen Angels, Satan, Shadow People, Aliens, Demons, Anunnaki, Archons, Ancient Giants, “Ancient Aliens” & Genetic Hybrids. Almost all of what we know about the Nephilim comes from the Holy Bible in Genesis Chapter 6. If you’ve studies or looked into the Nephilim at all, or even if you haven’t, I’m sure you’ll find the video below refreshingly different than many other videos on the topic. I certainly did, and I’ve seen a ton.

2916,Was the airstrike in Syria Killing 22 schoolchildren another US false flag? Russian defense says so,"Was the airstrike in Syria Killing 22 schoolchildren another US false flag? Russian defense says so By Joachim Hagopian Posted on October 31, 2016 by Joachim Hagopian 
The Western media seizes every chance to twist the truth in favor of another round of Putin bashing as its worn out flimsy excuse to escalate further hostilities against Moscow in order to trigger World War III. 
The pathological liars of the West never fail to deceitfully add fuel to their propaganda war machine fire. The latest hype is blaming a Russian airstrike for destroying a school in the rebel held Idlib Province in northern Syria, killing 22 children and six teachers. 
Immediately the UN, as the Washington vassal it is, through the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), for added sensational effect no less, began opportunistically milking the tragedy for all it‘s worth, denouncing the killing as “an outrage” and probable war crime, adding that it’s the deadliest attack on a school in the near six-year Syrian conflict. What’s being left out of this heavily biased narrative is that the war in Syria was maliciously started by the United States, specifically the CIA funding protests in 2011 (actually as far back as 2005 ) targeting Assad as part of its infamous Arab Spring uprising in accordance with Empire’s illegal regime change policy. As an independent, secular leader unwilling to succumb to Empire’s pressure to allow a 2009 proposed Qatar gas pipeline to Europe be built through his country, the fixated neocons have been gunning for Assad’s removal ever since. 
Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov explained that after closer examination and careful analysis, the video released to Western media allegedly depicting the airstrike in Idlib Province consists of more than ten separate pieces of footage fragmented together. Thus, it appears to be a hoax designed to incriminate the Russian aerospace group for killing innocent kids. 
He added, “As one can see on a photo from the Russian drone, the roof of the school is not damaged and there are no bomb craters in the area adjacent to the school . . . All this means that the UNICEF leadership fell a victim to a new deception of swindlers in White Helmets. That is why, before making loud statements, UNICEF officials should check sources of their information in order not to undermine reputation of a respected organization.” 
Of course, this latest false flag isn’t the first time Russia’s been falsely blamed for attacks in Syria. Through CIA and military intelligence, the West has an elaborate network of anti-Russian and anti-Assad provocateurs waging staged events to implicate and vilify Putin and Assad as the enemy. General Konashenkov mentioned the White Helmets as part of the organized setup of US false flag operations in Syria. 
A former UK military intelligence officer owns the private security company responsible for training and handling the so-called White Helmets, discredited Syrian provocateurs pretending to be Syria’s Civil Defense corps regularly staging fake photo-ops after US backed terrorist groups kill innocent civilians making it appear that Assad and Putin are willfully and inhumanely murdering them. This latest school tragedy appears no different as incident after incident has been exposed in recent months. 
Like last month’s attack on that UN humanitarian aid convoy north of Aleppo, engineered by Western intelligence working with the terrorists to accuse Russia of yet another airstrike that didn’t happen, covering up the a rocket attack perpetrated by the US backed al Nusra Front (forget their recent name change designed to distance themselves from being US proxy war terrorists no different from al Qaeda or ISIS/Daesh/Islamic State). Bottom line, Terrorists-R-US, Inc . 
In this latest propaganda ploy, on-the-ground eyewitness reports vis-à-vis White helmets state that 10 airstrikes around midday on Wednesday were responsible for striking the residential compound containing two schools in session at the time resulting in the bloodbath. Of course the go-to propagandist organization out of London that the Western media never fails to quote, the already outed fraudulent Syrian Observatory of Human Rights consisting of one anti-Assad expatriated Syrian, began immediately pointing the finger at Russia, like Clinton, Obama and all the Western axis-of-evil liars determined to demonize Putin and Russia as false justification for starting their next world war . 
In response to the tragedy, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova on Thursday called for an urgent international investigation without delay. She had this reaction to the Western pressitutes blaming her nation: “This is not surprising, but at the same time it deserves the strongest criticism. Al-Jazeera, The Independent, and other mass media sharing the same attitude to the journalistic profession at once blamed the tragedy on Russia, on the Russian aerospace group and on the Syrian armed forces. They claimed outright that it was a bombardment carried out by Russia and Syria. This is a lie. Russia has nothing to with that terrible tragedy, with that attack.” 
Zakharova also mentioned concern that the UN humanitarian relief in Syria has not nearly been enough to evacuate the wounded and sick from East Aleppo after Russia and Syria agreed to a humanitarian pause there several days ago. However, US backed rebels and snipers fired on civilians attempting to leave the city. Moreover, the US took full advantage of the lull in the Russian-Syrian fighting by opportunistically resupplying their terrorists on the ground with 50 ton airdrops of fresh ammo and weapons. Again, clearly it’s the US that’s the war crime culprit, needlessly causing only more war and more deaths in the war ravaged nation reeling from nearly a half million lives lost. 
Another reality check for the Washington neocon war maniacs determined to blame Russia for all the ills of the world (including the corrupt US political system responsible for the rigged election ) as their deceptive sleight of hand brainwash to feebly cover up their own slaughterhouse carnage raping our planet, just one day prior to the Idlib school violence, the Beirut branch of Amnesty International (AI) chastised the US led coalition pretending to fight the terrorists for its wanton killing of civilians in Syria as “collateral war damage.” The inhumanities that Empire commits is never admitted or acknowledged but instead constant lies claiming that Russian and Syrian forces are cold-bloodedly mowing down innocents continue nonstop. The hubris and hypocrisy stemming from Washington’s rotten core is American exceptionalism at its diabolical worse. 
Deputy Director for research at the Beirut Amnesty International office Lynn Maalouf , stated, “It’s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria.” 
AI estimates that in 11 US coalition airstrikes since September 2014 killed more than 300 civilians in Syria. Maalouf maintains that in each case, “the coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects.” So who’s really the inhumane kid-killing bad guy in Syria? Definitely not Russia nor the Syrian government but once again the enemy of the world, the US Empire. 
Ultimately to silence this never-ending US blame game against Moscow, the Russian ambassador to the UN on Thursday began circulating the original September 9 US-Russian peace treaty to the UN Security Council as well as to the UN Geneva branch. This document clearly shows that Russia has exhausted every sincere effort to bring an end to the war in Syria and stop global terrorism but the United States and its Western lackeys have willfully and deceitfully sabotaged that process at every turn in order to save their precious terrorists and endless war on terror. The evildoers behind the lifted curtain are exposed and guilty as charged. 
Or how can we forget that Obama staged false flag attack in August 2013 when the liar-in-chief falsely blamed Assad for sarin gassing his own Syrian children in the nearby Damascus suburb of Ghouta . Despite the real child murderers being Obama and his backed rebels, he and Hillary created soon to be named ISIS, the Manchurian president given the mission to destroy America and his then recently resigned secretary of state designated to be his successor to finish the job were trying to launch airstrikes on Syria to start World War III over three years ago. Putin outsmarted the US traitors in charge by brokering the last minute deal for Assad to turn in his chemical weapons arsenal. But with White House approval, US backed terrorists guilty of the Ghouta massacre are still using their Saudi and Turkish supplied chemical weapons to kill Syrian civilians even to this very day. Where are the humanitarian cries about those war crime atrocities? 
Or what about all the civilians dying in Syria from mortar shelling of residential neighborhoods in West Aleppo? A mere one day after the Idlib school bombing, the US backed al Nusra fired rockets in two locations in West Aleppo, one a school killing six children under the age of 16 and injuring more than a dozen others. In response to the Thursday school bombing in West Aleppo by US backed terrorists, the Aleppo police chief Zuher Said Aldin commented, “There are no military units there, only schools. Nevertheless, militants carried out a strike on this area, moreover, when classes were underway. Innocent children were killed, they just wanted to study.” 
But where are all the humanitarian cries against US financed and supported terrorists constantly murdering innocents throughout the Middle East and North Africa? Conveniently absent, because the US plotters of wars around the world couldn’t care less about any dead children anywhere on this planet. 
Or the 10,000 civilians in Yemen slaughtered by the US backed Saudi coalition consisting of US Special Force boots on the ground and more al Qaeda and ISIS terrorists, deployed there as well, in addition to Israeli and Gulf State airstrikes and now US destroyers pounding the Yemen coast killing more civilians with cruise missiles after yet more US false flag claims that the Houthis fired missiles at the US Navy without any evidence to prove it. Where are the sanctimonious humanitarian cries over dead Yemeni children? 
This historic, incessant use of false flags designed to bri

2917,"Dredging of Miami Port Badly Damaged Coral Reef, Study Finds - The New York Times","MIAMI  —   The   dredging of Miami’s port to accommodate the newest generation of freighters, an undertaking that prompted a   battle with environmentalists, caused widespread damage to a portion of the area’s fragile and already distressed coral reef, according to a new report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report, based on a December survey undertaken by scientists for the agency’s National Marine Fisheries Service, found that as much as 81 percent of the reef near the dredging site was buried in sediment, and an Army Corps of Engineers contractor report from August shows up to 93 percent partial coral death because of sediment, despite a plan by the Corps to minimize the damage. The damage is particularly alarming because the world is rapidly losing its reefs, partly because of global warming, experts say. South Florida has the only coral reef in the continental United States and 80 to 90 percent of it has died or been badly harmed over the years, officials say. The causes include ocean temperatures that have dipped too low or risen too high, acidification, sewage and pollution. Several cycles of white plague disease, including one in 2014 that coincided with the dredge, have also badly hurt South Florida’s reef. White plague, a virus that bleaches and kills coral, has been destroying reefs around the world. “This Florida reef is as important to our country as the sequoias of California, and we are losing it faster than we can figure out why,” said Rachel Silverstein, the executive director of Miami Waterkeeper, a nonprofit environmental organization that has sued the Army Corps of Engineers over coral damage. “There are a lot of stressors that are impacting and killing coral reefs, but this is a   example of something we could easily have prevented. ” The agency’s analysis, obtained by The New York Times, contradicts a December report by the corps, which primarily blamed white plague for the coral damage on reef sections near the dredge. In the corps’s report, scientists said that white plague was responsible for 85 percent of the coral deaths in the upper and middle parts of the reef and in the control site, and for 18. 3 percent of the deaths of coral closer to shore. The report failed to highlight that 93 percent of the corals closer to the dredge had partially died because of sediment, compared with 7 percent at sites farther away, Ms. Silverstein said. Scientists for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disagreed with the corps’s emphasis on white plague disease. Rather, they concluded that the majority of the reef, stretching beyond 3, 000 feet, showed conclusive damage to corals by dredging sediment. The agency’s survey of the extensive damage comes at a time when Fort Lauderdale is seeking final congressional approval for the dredging of its own port, Port Everglades, one of the largest in the country. The dredging project to deepen the port cleared a crucial Senate committee last week as part of a larger water bill and is headed for the Senate floor. Coral reefs are critical to South Florida because they help lessen the damage from hurricanes, are important to marine biodiversity and lure tourists. Environmentalists have warned Congress and the state that the corps’s plan to lessen the damage to corals in that area is flawed because it does not take into account new information, much of it bolstered by state and county scientists, about the extent of the coral damage from the port of Miami’s dredge. Expansion of Port Everglades is expected to begin next year. The corps is still working on a final assessment of the Miami dredge’s effects on the coral, said Susan J. Jackson, a spokeswoman for the agency. Scientists will conduct dives this summer and then analyze their findings in the fall, she added. “The results of the assessment will aid us in determining whether any additional mitigation may be needed,” she said. As for Port Everglades, Ms. Jackson said in an email that “lessons learned from all dredging projects are important, and we’re taking them into consideration during this process. ” Ms. Jackson added that the corps’s plan to protect the coral near Port Everglades was already an improvement over the Miami strategy. The new plan includes planting 103, 000 new   corals across 18 acres of reef and relocating existing coral to another five acres. “We are confident in the extensive work we have done,” Ms. Jackson said. But environmentalists said the plan failed to take into account how much farther than anticipated the sediment spread from the dredge site in Miami, a crucial element. The sediment suffocates coral. They want to see the impact zone extended beyond about 3, 000 feet from the site. The Port Everglades plan also relies on a    survey of staghorn coral, which is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The vast majority of staghorn near the Miami dredge site was never relocated by the corps. Either it was missed in 2010 by contractors during the initial survey of the area, or the staghorn reproduced later. The corps ultimately agreed to rescue the remaining staghorn after a legal fight with Miami Waterkeeper and other groups. It also relocated 924 nonendangered corals. In addition, underwater monitors to measure the sediment failed to work, so the corps relied solely on divers to keep tabs on the coral. This time around, the Waterkeeper group is trying to set up independent monitoring of the coral before dredging begins to keep close track of possible damage. “The corps like to say they learned a lot of lessons, and they promise they won’t do this again in Port Everglades,” Ms. Silverstein said. “We would like to see less aspirational talk and more mandatory language protecting these reefs. ”",0

2919,Klein: New York Times Lobbies for Muslim Brotherhood,"TEL AVIV  —   The New York Times in recent days has run numerous articles and opinion pieces advocating against designating the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization amid reports the Trump administration is debating doing just that. [The Muslim Brotherhood openly seeks to establish a worldwide Islamic caliphate based on Sharia law. While many Brotherhood wings reject the use of violence as a strategic tactic, preferring instead a sophisticated gradualist strategy to achieve their aims, the Brotherhood has spawned terrorist organizations  —   most notably Hamas  —   that adhere to its philosophy of a world order based on Islam. The Brotherhood was also a central player in the   Arab Spring, revolutions punctuated by violence across the Arab world.  Designating the Brotherhood a terrorist organization would add the U. S. to the growing list of nations to do so, including Muslim countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Times’ propagation of the Brotherhood culminated in an editorial board piece published Thursday titled, “All of Islam Isn’t the Enemy. ” In the editorial, the newspaper warned designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization “would be seen by many Muslims as another attempt to vilify adherents of Islam. ”  The paper claimed that the possible designation “appears to be part of a mission by the president and his closest advisers to heighten fears by promoting a dangerously exaggerated vision of an America under siege by what they call radical Islam. ” The Times’ advocacy for the Brotherhood is particularly noteworthy since it separately posted a full Arabic document from 1991 in which an Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood member set forth a strategy for “eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within,” with emphasis on operations inside the U. S. In Thursday’s editorial, the newspaper laid out its case for the Brotherhood: There are good reasons that the Brotherhood, with millions of members, doesn’t merit the terrorist designation. Rather than a single organization, it is a collection of groups and movements that can vary widely from country to country. While the Brotherhood calls for a society governed by Islamic law, it renounced violence decades ago, has supported elections and has become a political and social organization. Its branches often have tenuous connections to the original movement founded in Egypt in 1928. Addressing the Brotherhood’s support for the electoral process and purportedly becoming a political organization, an extensive report on the Brotherhood by the Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at Israel’s Center for Special Studies explained the group’s use of some tools of democracy to advance the aim of achieving a world ruled by Sharia law, which is by definition  . Drawing from founding Brotherhood documents and original literature by Brotherhood leaders, the Center explained: Unlike the militant factions of other Islamist movements, which completely rule out democracy on the basis of it being a Western, pagan, and ignorant idea, the Muslim Brotherhood does use the term “democracy. ” In its view, however, it has two main connotations: a tactical, instrumental means of taking over countries through the use of the democratic process, and an “Islamic democracy” based on Sharia law (i. e. Islamic religious law) and a model of internal consultation within the leadership, [Brotherhood Founder Sheikh Hassan]   listed seven stages to achieve these objectives, each to be carried out in a gradual fashion. The stages are divided into social and political: the first three are based on educating the individual, the family, and the entire society of the Muslim world to implement Sharia laws in every aspect of daily life. The next four stages are political in nature, and include assuming power through elections, shaping a Sharia state, liberating Islamic countries from the burden of (physical and ideological) foreign occupation, uniting them into one Islamic entity (“new caliphate”) and spreading Islamic values throughout the world. Sharia law is explicitly  . For example, under Sharia,   cannot rule over Muslims a Caliph can come to rule through force and seizure of power a woman inherits half that of a man and   cannot inherit from Muslims. In the Times editorial, meanwhile, the newspaper claimed that those “advising Mr. Trump seem unwilling to draw distinctions” between the Brotherhood and its violent adherents. The paper continued: Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist, once called the Brotherhood “the foundation of modern terrorism. ” And Frank Gaffney Jr. an   analyst who heads a small think tank, recently told the Times that the Brotherhood’s goals are “exactly the same” as those of the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. Both of these statements are true. The Brotherhood’s historic ideological principles of establishing a worldwide Caliphate are indeed shared by the Islamic State and   although their tactics greatly differ. And Brotherhood ideology has served as the foundation for groups like  . The defining works of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader, ideologue and theorist Sayyid Qutb, considered the Brotherhood’s intellectual godfather, greatly influenced Osama bin Laden and   doctrine. An extensive March 23, 2003, article in the New York Times magazine by Paul Berman dissected Qutb’s writings as they relate to terrorist ideology. In the article titled “The Philosopher of Islamic Terror,” Berman documented the centrality of Qutb’s influence on  : The organization ( ) was created in the late 1980’s by an affiliation of three armed factions  —   bin Laden’s circle of ”Afghan” Arabs, together with two factions from Egypt, the Islamic Group and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter led by Dr. Ayman   Al Qaeda’s top theoretician. The Egyptian factions emerged from an older current, a school of thought from within Egypt’s fundamentalist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, in the 1950’s and 60’s. And at the heart of that single school of thought stood, until his execution in 1966, a philosopher named Sayyid Qutb  —   the intellectual hero of every one of the groups that eventually went into Al Qaeda, their Karl Marx (to put it that way) their guide. In recent days, the Times has featured numerous other articles arguing against branding the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization. An article on Tuesday warned, “Officially designating the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization would roil American relations in the Middle East. The leaders of some American allies  —   like Egypt, where the military forced the Brotherhood from power in 2013, and the United Arab Emirates  —   have pressed Mr. Trump to do so to quash internal enemies, but the group remains a pillar of society in parts of the region. ” “Critics said they feared that Mr. Trump’s team wanted to create a legal justification to crack down on Muslim charities, mosques and other groups in the United States,” added the Times. “A terrorist designation would freeze assets, block visas and ban financial interactions. ” A Times article on February 1 was titled, “Trump Pushes Dark View of Islam to Center of U. S.  . ” The article lamented a worldview that “conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world. ” A January 26 editorial titled “‘I Think Islam Hates Us’” informed readers the Trump administration “reportedly is considering designating the Muslim Brotherhood, which is involved in Muslim politics in a number of countries, as a terrorist organization. Some experts see the move as a chance for the Trump administration to limit Muslim political activity in the United States. ”  Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

2920,"Obama, Clinton and Putin Play on the Same Team-America Has Been Betrayed","

Obama and Putin are playing on the same team. They have a mutual goal. A close examination of the facts reveal that Obama is in bed with the Communists and is intent on the destruction of America. Hillary Clinton is part of the same cabal. If you don’t think so, ask yourself how she was able to sell 20% of America’s uranium to the Russians?
This article will demonstrate that B. Obama (Soetoro) is the manifestation of a decades-old plot designed to subvert the leadership of the United States, thus making America vulnerable to being conquered.
Is America Worth Dying For? I loathe the government that we are forced to endure every day, donâ€™t you, with every communication you engage in being monitored by a bunch of government voyeurs? However, I do love my country, the American people and the ideals for which we stand (e.g. one nation under God). Americaâ€™s present government is not worthy of one ounce of respect. However, the American Constitution and our traditions are indeed worth fighting for, but not with Obama at the helm.
I have often wondered if I had been a soldier in the Texan Army, would I have stayed, fought and died at the hands of Santa Annaâ€™s forces at the Alamo? If I had been a defender at Bataan, Wake Island, or Guam, in the early days of World War II and I knew death was certain, would I stand my post to the last minute? I would, if I knew my sacrifice was honorable and my leadership was patriotic and willing to make the same sacrifice.
America Will Soon Stand Alone As I have documented over the past several weeks, America will soon stand alone , with perhaps, only England as our last ally. Europe will soon be under the Russian sphere of control because of energy dependence on Russia. As a result, NATO will disintegrate. China has married their economy to the Russians based upon gas and oil and we will someday soon face their soldiers on the battlefield which will take place in our neighborhoods. Seemingly all of Latin America has turned their backs on the US and is allowing for Russian military bases and accepting Russian military equipment, thus, making a Red Dawn scenario a near certainty.
America stands on the edge of virtual extinction. The only question is whether Putin, after totally destroying the Petrodollar, will allow America to slowly crumble, or use the combined forces of the United Nations (e.g. North Korea, China, Latin America and Russia to invade). Either way, people like ex-CIA agent, Dr. Jim Garrow boldly proclaim that eventually 90% of all Americans will be left dead. And isnâ€™t that figure consistent with the globalist expressed desire to reduce the North American population by 90%?
And how does Obama respond to these threats? He has announced that he is reducing the American military to pre-World War II levels in yet another act of treason against the American people.
Back to the fundamental question, should we stand our ground and fight to the death? The answer is yes. However, I will not follow the psychopathic criminal that is in the White House. If America is to fall, and most of us will perish, we should not fall with a traitor at the helm. Though the heavens may fall, treason must not be allowed to prosper. The man with 11 social security numbers, several names (e.g. Barry Soetero) must not be allowed to remain in power. If I am to fall in defense of my country, I will do so with fellow Americans, not by following some mongrel masquerading as an American.
Obama Is the Soviet Fulfillment of Generations of Planning After Viktor Suvorov, a former Russian intelligence analyst, defected to England, he revealed Russiaâ€™s top-secret plans to attack the United States at some future date after undermining the United States from within through the subversion of their political leadership. Suvorov had worked as a Russian intelligence analyst as well as having worked for the GRU and with elite Russian special forces, Suvorov, warned the Americans ofÂ Russiaâ€™s true intentions Â after the Russian high command had succeeded in getting Pentagon officials to let down their guard and engage in a high level, but mostly one-sided,Â technology transfer . And under the wrong President (i.e. Obama), America would be weakened to the point to where it could not adequately defend herself.
Anatoliy Golitsyn, a high-ranking KGB defector fled to the United States in order to warn Americans about the secret Russian plan to attack the United States. Golitsyn is generally considered to be among the first and most revealing on the subject of the secret Russian plans to attack America after faking the demise of the old Soviet Union. He authored theÂ The Perestroika Deception Â in which Golitsyn wrote about the deceitful intent behind the Leninist strategy which the present-day Communists are actively pursuing as they fake American style democratization efforts in Russia. From within, American leadership would be compromised in key positions, and the fall of America would be orchestrated from within and under the leadership of an Obama type of President. Golitsyn and Suvorov were only two of dozens of Soviet defectors who told exactly the same story dating back to the 1960â€™s.
Obama Is the Pawn of the Russians to Conquer America From the official files of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, we find Allen Hulton , a 39 year veteran of the postal service, who provided a sworn affidavit to Maricopa County, AZ. Sheriff investigators.
Arpaio was leading an investigation to determine whether or notÂ former foreignÂ college student , Barack Obama, was eligible to be placed on Arizonaâ€™s 2012 election ballot. After reviewing Hultonâ€™s affidavit, it is apparent that 1960â€™s communist agitators and revolutionaries from the communist-inspired Weathermen Underground, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn were in fact the de facto adoptive parents to this foreign student destined to become the first illegitimate President of the United States. As a result, Obama was treated to the finest Ivy League education that communist backed money could buy as Hulton maintains that the Ayers told him that he was financing the education of a promising foreign student at Harvard. Hulton also testified that he met Obama while at the Ayerâ€™s home and he asked Obama what he going to do with all his education, to which Obama politely answered, â€œI am going to become the Presidentâ€. Readers should take note that this is an affidavit, and as such, is formally considered to be evidence, not conjecture or hearsay. There can be no other conclusion that the criminally convicted communist terrorist, Bill Ayers, began grooming Obama to become Americaâ€™s first communist President during Obamaâ€™s college years. Their relationship continues into the present time as it is on record thatÂ Ayers visited the White House Â in August of 2009. Please note the words â€œforeign studentâ€, which makes Obama ineligible to be in the White House.
Obamaâ€™s communist affiliations continued well into his adulthood and because of the good work of Joel Gilbert Â who discovered that Obama was active with a Weathermen Underground Â support group known asÂ The May 19th Communist Organization, in New York. Â Perhaps, this is why Ayers was visiting the White House. And speaking of Ayers and Dorne, adding more fuel to this communist fire, it is interesting to note that both Senior White House Advisors, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett were both Weatherman Underground â€œ Red Diaper Babies , in which they were the sonsÂ and daughters of well-to-do parents who desired communism and livedÂ out their dreams through their childrenâ€™s revolutionary activities. Other notable red-diaper babies also include such notables asÂ Rahm Emanuel Â andÂ Eric Holder . Jarrettâ€™s situation is particularly interesting in that her family and the Ayers family have been multi-generational friends which also included a marriage between the two families. Much of the Obama administration is a nest of communists and this should serve to gravely concern every American citizen. It was Ayers and Dorne who launched State Senatorial candidate Obamaâ€™s political career from their Hyde Park, IL. living room according to the late Larry Grathwohl a former FBI undercover operative who penetrated the Weathermen Underground. Hollywood could not write a movie this good, with this much intrigue.
Frank Chapman , a communist activist and a member of the communist front group known as the World Peace Council. ChapmanÂ clearly used the term â€œmoleâ€ to describe Obama. He said Obamaâ€™s political climb and subsequentÂ success in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries was â€œa dialectical leap ushering in a qualitatively new era of struggle.â€ Chapman further stated that, â€œMarx once compared revolutionary struggle with the work of the mole, who sometimes burrows so far beneath the ground that he leaves no trace of his movement on the surface. This is the old revolutionary â€˜mole,â€™ not only showing his traces on the surface but also breaking through. â€œ The Communist Party USA backs Obama to the hilt. â€ It is clear that Obama is their man! Obama is Putin 2.0.
The Middle East is turning away from the Petrodollar. Europe will soon abandon the dollar to buy Russian gas. The Petrodollar is the only thing of value backing the dollar. When the fall of the Petrodollar is complete, it will not take 30 days to witness the complete and utter destruction of this economy. Dr. Garrow believes when the economic collapse arrives, it will be masked with an EMP attack designed to accelerate the process of decline. In this scenario. the Naval War College predicts 90% of us will be dead within two years under these circumstances! And what is Obama doing about all of this? He is doing nothing!
To those who think this is far-fetched, read on and see what the defectors tell us is coming and it will be hard to deny Obamaâ€™s complicity.
Golitsynâ€™s Blueprint for Obama According to Golitsyn, the short-term strategic objective of the Russians is to achieve a technological convergence with the West solely on Russian terms and mostly through a series of one-sided disarmament agreements. He also stated that the Russians and the Americans would engage in joint military exercises just prior to Americaâ€™s fall and this is exactly what we find when we look at the historical record under Obama.
â€œIn 2010, American soldiers participated in theÂ 2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade Â alongside its European allies and members of theÂ CIS , marking the first time American soldiers have ever participated in the annual event on May 9. 
In 2010, American and Russian special forces conduct their first joint operation in Afghanistan and destroy four drug-producing labs that make heroin on October 31.Â Â (S. Shuster (Oct.2010).Â Russia returns to Afghanistan for drug raid . TIME Â World. Retrieved 6 February, 2010). 
In 2012, the United States, Russia and NATO hold missile defense exercises in Ottobrunn, Germany from March 26 to March 30. 
In 2012, Russian troops are allowed into the United States for the first time to participate in a joint U.S.-Russia military drill in Colorado on April 25. 
In 2012, American and Russian navies participate in theÂ RIMPAC 2012 Â naval exercises from June 29 to August 3 and this process is ongoing. 
In 2012, The United States and Russia hold joint naval exercises in the Norwegian Sea on August 22. 
In 2012, Russia sends aid to the United States in the aftermath ofÂ Hurricane Sandy Â on November 11. 
In 2013, American, Russian and NATO military forces perform a counter piracy exercise in the Gulf of Aden on February 26. 
In 2014, The United States, Russia and NATO announce plans to conduct a joint naval operation in the Mediterranean to protect a U.S. ship that will destroy Syriaâ€™s chemical weapons on February 14.â€ 
There are literally dozens more of these bilateral cooperative efforts involving the military forces of Russia and the United States. This is following a time when leaders like George Bush placed a missile shield in Poland and beefed up our support of NATO. It is clear that Obama is in bed with the Russians. AND PUTIN, OBAMA AND CLINTON ARE IN BED WITH THE GLOBALISTS WHO WANT WORLD WAR III.Â 
Golitsyn and the Scissors Plan Golitsyn Â stated that Russia, after lulling America to sleep, will join with China in order to attack the United States from both the outside and inside as he detailed thatÂ â€œ In each of these the scissors strategy will play its part; probably, as the final stroke, the scissors blades will close. The element of apparent duality in Soviet and Chinese policies will disappear. The hitherto concealed coordination between them will become visible and predominant. The Soviets and the Chinese will be officially reconciled. Thus the scissors strategy will develop logically into the â€˜strategy of one clenched fistâ€™ to provide the foundation and driving force of a world communist federationâ€Śbefore long, the communist strategists might be persuaded that the balance had swung irreversibly in their favor. In that event they might well decide on a Sino-Soviet â€˜reconciliation.â€™ The scissors strategy would give way to the strategy of â€œone clenched fist.â€Â The enemies now are gathered from within . At that point the shift in the political and military balance will be plain for all to see.
The inking of the recent energy deal which married the economies of the Russians and the Chinese is the manifestation of Golitsynâ€™s revelations.
As I stated earlier, the death of the Petrodollar means that you will not a have job to go to tomorrow. Because of Obama, the Chinese own our money. Which means they own your mortgage, retirement and savings accounts. Everything you own, is controlled by the Chinese. Soon, they will be coming to collect.
My insider military sources, as well as Dr. Garrow, tell me that plans for an American guerrilla warfare resistance are being put into play as we speak. This means that millions of us are going to die at the hands of foreign invaders and from being caught in the crossfire.
Conclusion I no longer believe in the America political process and for good reason (e.g. electronic voting machines). George Soros has proven what a rigged system we live under. Remember, Traitor-In-Chief #1 is Obama. Traitor-In-Chief #2 is Clinton and Hillary is the closer. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SOLD OUT FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ANGLE.

2921,6 ‘miracle’ drugs Big Pharma now regrets,"6 ‘miracle’ drugs Big Pharma now regrets With Big Pharma, first they promote it, then they discover the risks. By Martha Rosenberg Posted on November 1, 2016 by Martha Rosenberg 
Are you depressed? It may have less to do with your mood than your birth control pills, high blood pressure pills, antibiotics or even anti-hair-loss drug, according to new research. New risks have also emerged with popular gastroesophageal reflux disease medicines and even the top-selling painkiller, Tylenol. 
There are two reasons the risks associated with popular drugs seem to trail their aggressive promotion. Certainly, as millions use brand name drugs, dangerous side effects and adverse events are seen that did not emerge in much smaller clinical trials. Who knew? But also, as Intrepid Report has noted before, dangerous side effects that might be considered major drawbacks to prescribing the drugs often emerge only when drugs have gone “off patent” and all their profit potential is realized. For both reasons, drug safety activists recommend waiting five years before taking a “new” drug—until it is not “new” anymore. 
Here are drugs and drug classes that have raised new concerns. 
1. Proton Pump Inhibitors 
One of Pharma’s most successful gambits has been its proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like Nexium (the “Purple Pill”) and Prilosec that reduce stomach acid. To sell the drugs, Pharma aggressively raised “awareness” of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD a rare condition which, over time, can change the lining of the esophagus and lead to cancer. Actually, most PPI users have simple heartburn. Even babies are now given PPIs for “baby reflux” because they spit up 71 times a day—a normal occurrence that has been pathologized. 
are addictive. “Once a patient has taken a PPI for longer than a few weeks, acid hypersecretion can occur on discontinuation,” says a recent article in Pharmaceutical Journal. “This causes rebound symptoms, and frequently establishes a vicious cycle of drug reinitiation and long-term continuation.” 
Clostridium difficile (“C Diff”), bone thinning and fractures and vitamin and mineral deficiencies to chronic kidney disease and heart attacks. Now there is a new reported risk: dementia. 
JAMA Neurology of 73, 679 people 75 or older with no dementia and taking PPIs found the patients “had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI.” Other studies have also found a link. 
fluoroquinolone class which includes Cipro and Levaquin. Even as the FDA tries to curtail use of antibiotics on the nation’s farms to make animals grow faster (a use which accounts for most U.S. antibiotic sales) drug use on the farm is actually increasing. The FDA’s 2014 Summary Report on Antimicrobials Sold or Distributed for Use in Food Producing Animals reveals that cephalosporin sales increased by 57 percent between 2009 through 2014, sales of antibiotics like clindamycin increased by 150 percent and sales of antibiotics like gentamicin, a dangerous drug class, increased by 36 percent. 
1974, Navy recruits were given antibiotics to see if they would gain weight, and after only seven weeks, they did. Similar results were seen in children in Guatemala and in babies . But making people fat or encouraging antibiotic resistant microbes like MRSA are the least of the risks, it turns out. 
the bacteria in our gut, the microbiome, which antibiotics compromise as they kill the “bad” bacteria, are responsible for much more than good digestion. Antibiotics also affect the brain and “influence our mood and temperament,” says food expert Michael Pollan. “If you transplant the gut microbiota of relaxed and adventurous mice into the guts of timid and anxious mice they become less stressed and more adventurous.” Antibiotic-affected microbiomes may also be behind asthma and autoimmune diseases, acn published reports. 

The Doctors’ Case Against the Pill by Barbara Seaman was published, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson held hearings about clear links between the Pill and depression, blood clots and decrease in libido cited nowhere on the label. No women were asked to speak at the hearings, moving Alice Wolfson, a co-founder of the National Women’s Health Network, to say, “It must be admitted that women make superb guinea pigs. They don’t cost anything, they feed themselves, they clean their own cages, pay for their own pills, and remunerate the clinical observer. We will no longer tolerate intimidation by white-coated gods antiseptically directing our lives.” 
Fast-forward to this year, when medical studies again c links between birth control pills and depression, especially in young women, and corresponding higher use of antidepressant drugs. 
“The risk of depression has been recognized since women were able to get their hands on oral contraceptives,” says Cindy Pearson of the National Women’s Health Network. “It’s been reported by women for 50 years.” 
Sweetening the Pill: or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control might also be vindicated, writes Lara Prendergast. The book was called “a dishonest anti-Pill treatise” because the author “dared to point out that hormonal contraceptives are ranked by the World Health Organization as a class-one carcinogen alongside tobacco and asbestos,” she writes. 
about Propecia, a popular treatment for male pattern baldness linked to disturbing side effects in men including sexual dysfunction and actual reduction in penis size. At the time, Propecia’s label assured users that sexual side effects “went away in men who stopped taking Propecia”; however, the current label warns about sexual dysfunction like “erectile dysfunction, libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders; male infertility and/or poor seminal quality” that continues after discontinuation of treatment. 
BMJ found “the risk of erectile dysfunction was not increased for users of finasteride 1mg compared with unexposed men with alopecia [hair loss],” but reports of the disturbing side effects abound in medical j ournals and popular magazines. 
Men’s Journal last year. 
Post-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation . 
& Johnson to increase warnings in 2014. Unintentional acetaminophen overdoses cause as many as 26,000 hospitalizations and 458 deaths per year reported the FDA. 
Soon after the increased warnings, medical journals linked acetaminophen to birth defects in the children of women the drug such as poor motor development, behavior problems and language delays. A study in JAMA Pediatrics identified an increased occurrence of ADHD by the age of seven in children whose mothers took acetaminophen. A study in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children more likely to have behavior problems and slow motor development by the age of three if their mothers had taken acetaminophen. Not all medical voices concur. Some said the studies were poorly designed or that fevers , for which the mother presumably took acetaminophen, are responsible for the birth defects. 
In recent years, acetaminophen has been found to have psychological and mental effects not before described. The pain reliever may “blunt individuals’ reactivity to a range of negative stimuli in addition to physical pain,” says study. Another study found acetaminophen reduced the psychological pain caused by social rejection. 
6. Beta Blockers 
One out of Americans has high blood pressure and beta-blockers like atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol, propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace) and timolol (Timoptic) which treat the condition have been linked to depression for many years. 
early as 1967, the British Medical Journal reported that hypertensive patients treated with propranolol for cardiac arrhythmias experienced a rise in the incidence of depression. Still, it has not been known if patients’ depressions were caused by the actual actions of beta blockers (like blocking the effects of epinephrine/adrenaline and slowing heart rate) or mood conditions associated with the diseases for which beta blockers are prescribed such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. 
Hypertension found that beta blockers “may have a role in the pathogenesis or course of mood disorders” and increased hospital admissions for mood disorders. A “bidirectional relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease” exists, says the study , “because of the overlapping pathophysiological processes that underlie both conditions.” 
There is a lot of data that depression and cardiovascular disease are related . . . but current hypertensive practices do not consider depression,” said the study’s lead author Sandosh Padmanabhan. “There could be some people who are predisposed to depression who we should not be giving these drugs.”

2922,"Trump Takes Credit for Sprint Plan to Add 5,000 Jobs in U.S. - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump took credit on Wednesday for a decision by Sprint to add 5, 000 jobs in the United States as he tried to deliver on his promise to force corporate America to focus on job creation at home rather than abroad. “I was just called by the head people at Sprint, and they are going to be bringing 5, 000 jobs back to the United States,” Mr. Trump told reporters at his    estate in Florida. “They have taken them from other countries. They are bringing them back to the United States. ” Sprint later said that the jobs were part of a previously announced commitment by Japan’s SoftBank, which owns a controlling stake in the mobile phone carrier, to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50, 000 positions. That announcement, made by Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, followed a meeting with Mr. Trump this month. SoftBank is also a major investor in OneWeb, a satellite   that Mr. Trump said Wednesday would create an additional 3, 000 jobs in the United States. Although Mr. Trump claimed credit for SoftBank’s $50 billion investment in the United States, those plans predated the election, and Mr. Son has owned a controlling stake in Sprint, among other companies, for several years. A Sprint spokeswoman, Adrienne Norton, said that the 5, 000 jobs are part of the 50, 000 increase Mr. Son promised, but that the new positions would be financed by the mobile phone carrier. “It will be a combination of newly created jobs and bringing some existing jobs back to the U. S.,” she said. Since the election, Sprint shares have risen nearly 40 percent, partly on hopes that it could be acquired by its rival  . While antitrust officials under President Obama have been wary of deals in the telecom sector, Mr. Son and investors are hoping the Trump administration might look more favorably on any potential deal. In January, as part of a restructuring effort, Sprint cut 2, 500 jobs in call centers across the United States and at its headquarters in Overland Park, Kan. On Wednesday, the company said in a statement that it would be creating or bringing back jobs in a variety of departments, including customer care and sales, and that all would be added by the end of its 2017 fiscal year. It was not clear where in the country those jobs would be. “We are excited to work with   Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U. S.,” said Marcelo Claure, Sprint’s chief executive. In November, Mr. Trump reached a deal with Carrier to keep roughly 850 jobs at its factory in Indianapolis instead of shifting them to Mexico, which the company said it would do in February. Despite Mr. Trump’s pressure, Carrier and its parent, United Technologies, still plan to move more than 1, 000 jobs now in Indiana to Monterrey, Mexico. They are not the only ones. Another Indianapolis factory, owned by the ball bearing maker Rexnord, also plans to soon leave Indianapolis for Mexico, despite criticism from the   on Twitter and threats to impose steep tariffs on companies that move production abroad.",0
2923,Unthinkable,"Report Copyright Violation Unthinkable If it ever were discovered that the voting was total bullshit (and I'm not suggesting that) and that they decided in 2008 that Hillary was next, then chaos would ensue. It's just a passing thought but there has been so much fraud discovered so far by Hillary, like the debate questions given in advance and the meetings with reporters which influenced the Electoral College before the election. So you know what I think? I say we send in the military to grab all the voting machines and do the election entirely on paper. Even if it takes two weeks to count the votes. Just saying. Page 1",0
2924,Can normal transistors act like a qubit?,"Can normal transistors act like a qubit? page: 1 link Hi. I guess I have a question relating to quantum computing. Since qubits are what makes up quantum computers... That being a qubits can act like a transistor that can be either on, off, or both on and off at the same time. In usual computing... Transistors are either on or off. In quantum they can be both on and off at the same time... The question I have is simply this. Is it possible to make a transistor that can act as on, off, and on and off at the same time... Even if you had to add an extra layer of circuitry to get that same reading from that single transistor? I mean. A normal transistor operate that if it gets no voltage or low voltage then the transistor is in an off state. If it gets a certain voltage it is in an on state. Couldn't you make the voltage extra high to get a both on/off at the same time state? Or half voltage to get the same on/off state at the same time to essentially create a fake qubit scenario? There might have to be additional transistors to help make sure of that determination of a transistor appearing in an on/off state but couldn't it be possible? Perhaps a circuit of transistors could determine whether the proceeding transistor should act as both on/off by checking the voltage some how? Idk... Please answer me like I'm a drunk stupid idiot. Perhaps laymen terms? I can be quite the idiot sometimes. Thanks for hearing me out. I'm currently drunk and just pondering things link a reply to: DaRAGE I'm sure we could do weird stuff with circuitry to store more than one bit of data in the circuit, but that doesn't really give an advantage over just storing more bits with our conventional technology (which has been highly refined). The advantage of the qbit isn't really that it stores more information, it's that it can be used to process more information at the same time. Quantum + computing = quantum computing The key features of an ordinary computer—bits, registers, logic gates, algorithms, and so on—have analogous features in a quantum computer. Instead of bits, a quantum computer has quantum bits or qubits, which work in a particularly intriguing way. Where a bit can store either a zero or a 1, a qubit can store a zero, a one, both zero and one, or an infinite number of values in between—and be in multiple states (store multiple values) at the same time! If that sounds confusing, think back to light being a particle and a wave at the same time, Schrödinger's cat being alive and dead, or a car being a bicycle and a bus. A gentler way to think of the numbers qubits store is through the physics concept of superposition (where two waves add to make a third one that contains both of the originals). If you blow on something like a flute, the pipe fills up with a standing wave: a wave made up of a fundamental frequency (the basic note you're playing) and lots of overtones or harmonics (higher-frequency multiples of the fundamental). The wave inside the pipe contains all these waves simultaneously: they're added together to make a combined wave that includes them all. Qubits use superposition to represent multiple states (multiple numeric values) simultaneously in a similar way. Just as a quantum computer can store multiple numbers at once, so it can process them simultaneously. Instead of working in serial (doing a series of things one at a time in a sequence), it can work in parallel (doing multiple things at the same time). Only when you try to find out what state it's actually in at any given moment (by measuring it, in other words) does it ""collapse"" into one of its possible states—and that gives you the answer to your problem. Estimates suggest a quantum computer's ability to work in parallel would make it millions of times faster than any conventional computer... if only we could build it! So how would we do that? explainthatstuff.com If I understand correctly, a quantum computer will just be a smaller, more energy efficient version of a massive parallel computer.",0
2925,"Defining, and Proclaiming, a New Black Power - The New York Times","Black America has a lot of anthems. If you’re at a wedding in the Philadelphia area, for instance, and hear the opening keyboard blasts of “Before I Let Go” by Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, the secular spirit might compel you to the dance floor, spilling the “   ” of the first few seconds behind you as you sprint. For more than a century,   children have had a hard time escaping “This Little Light of Mine. ” And then there’s James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson’s “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing,” regarded as the black national anthem and so beautifully deceptive in its uplift that it makes you think you can sing even when you can’t. But the blackest anthem that doesn’t seem all that obviously black might be the one that opens “The Greatest,” the biopic from 1977 of Muhammad Ali starring Muhammad Ali. It’s “The Greatest Love of All,” a song of such earnestness and fulgent   that under no circumstances could it also be cool, under no circumstances could it be “Before I Let Go. ” Its sense of hope borders on the axiomatic  —   who doesn’t believe that children are the future? If you were young, black and near a classroom in the late ’70s or the ’80s, this was the song you sang, especially to commemorate a matriculation benchmark. I sang it at least twice going from one grade to the next. George Benson recorded the original, which twinkled. In 1985, Whitney Houston recorded the astronomical,   version everybody knows  —   a comet wrapped in cheese. That was the version my class had to sing. But I didn’t feel particularly black when I did it. For one thing, there were a few white kids at my school. But when you’re 9 or 10 and into lyrics, you notice how empowering  —   and how fun  —   these are to belt: “Learning to love   is the greatest love of all. ” That’s so Ali. He didn’t write the song. That was Michael Masser and Linda Creed, two white people, two weeks after she underwent a mastectomy. Its nondenominational radiance is the reason for its longevity: We should all be loving ourselves. But I’ve been hung up on what, for me, is the operative word. “Learning. ” That’s the black part: overcoming the institutional myth that there’s less  —   or nothing  —   to love. Ali overcame it. He learned. Then he taught. We’ve come some way since both 1977 and 1985. Now American culture is as much black culture as it’s ever been: from handshakes and slang to the embrace of the booty. We’ve learned to love it, and sometimes that’s a problem. Other races refract themselves through the predominant prism of black culture. But in the years between Barack Obama’s election and Donald J. Trump’s presidential candidacy, with the concentrated accretion of seemingly wrongful   deaths, with outspoken activist movements, with more black people speaking so blackly  —   influentially  —   on   platforms, artists have put their blackness at the center of American popular culture. And yet it’s a change from simply having just the artists there. They’re learning to explore the politics of their blackness. There’s too much going on at the moment for them not to. Things have taken such a turn into this sort of   that the charisma and racial stratagems of the flamboyantly ideological Johnnie Cochran have reappeared in two different O. J. Simpson television events. The black people shaping the culture have grown not just comfortable in their blackness but also defiant in its depiction, insistent in its inextricability from their art. They’re investigating blackness, not exclusively in terms of racism but as a matter of ontology: What is it? That’s the question that   Key and Jordan Peele transferred from their old Comedy Central show to “Keanu,” a disposable but slyly deep action comedy in which a black stoner and his preppy friend impersonate gangstas to rescue a cat. ABC’s “ ” took its black existentialism into current events and   criticism for its most recent season. Black creators are making work that follows and reflects black life on the ground: the protests over the deaths of black Americans, often involving the police the demands for reforming prisons and changing the way the justice system treats black and Hispanic men the fury over Hollywood’s indifference to sectors of the populace that straight white men don’t exclusively inhabit. The visual side of “Lemonade,” Beyoncé’s    “visual album,” steeps the songs in  : from the attire of the antebellum South to the legacies of black female struggle and strength. “Hey! I’m a keep running,” she sings. “’Cause a winner don’t quit on themselves. ” That’s Ali, too. In that same song, “Freedom,” Kendrick Lamar raps about himself as an object of persecution, by the news media and consequently by law enforcement. There’s blackness  —   the mere state of one’s racial self  —   and there’s being politically black, which amounts to the degree to which one wields or weaponizes or calls attention to one’s blackness. “Freedom” constitutes a wielding. This kind of blatant statement is new for Beyoncé, who before the advent of the Black Lives Matter movement was thoughtful about the politics of the beauty of black women’s bodies, and since its arrival has wed the complexities of feminism and the vicissitudes of marriage with political blackness. She’s learned. And people are listening. “Lemonade” is the No. 2 album in the country. George C. Wolfe’s new musical, “Shuffle Along,” centers on that sort of wielding. But he wants you to do the learning. The musical rebuilds one of the first black shows to make it to Broadway, a forgotten pageant of song, dance and romantic comedy that ran for 484 performances 95 years ago and was also called “Shuffle Along. ” Mr. Wolfe works from the inside out, making his show about the making of the original show. His ambition gives the new musical a   quality. It’s set entirely in its era. Yet every mouth that begins to sing  —   and the singing here is astounding  —   seems to open a portal that whisks 2016 back to 1921, bringing with it several eras in between. The history here lives, breathes and tap dances. And at its best, it cagily uses the pride of the present against the prejudice of the past. There’s some suspense among the     show’s creative team about whether white audiences will tolerate seeing two of the musical’s stars embrace during a number. Mr. Wolfe casually juxtaposes that question with an affair between one of the stars, Lottie Gee (Audra McDonald) and Eubie Blake (Brandon Victor Dixon) the married half of the show’s songwriting duo. The only person who’d be offended by this nowadays would be Mrs. Blake. The tensions in the show are entirely  . Black people performing in blackface is the one thing that everyone in both periods would agree is a problem. And Mr. Wolfe doesn’t overthink that. It is what it was, and what it was is  . Mr. Wolfe is after something sophisticatedly didactic if less immediately rousing  —   the show’s subtitle is “Or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed. ” He wants the   of the old show to inform his winking reproduction. It also presumes the core ticket buyer is white, as was the case in the previous century. To that end, the 2016 show critiques, celebrates and speculates about the 1921 version while also finding the elated white audiences on both ends of the timeline inevitable. Instead of rage, you get affectionate hindsight that cuts the pervasive melancholy. The show’s   creative team ended their collaboration more over money than racism. If it had managed to stay together, Mr. Wolfe wonders, imagine what it could have done for blacks in the American theater. That’s a question more or less asked during the encyclopedia entry of a finale, but a poignant one. The historical irony (look at all the people of color on Broadway now!) cries out for the emotional pragmatism that closes “The Greatest Love of All”: It’s a low note for a soaring   anthem. (Houston sang it as if she were taking us to the moon.) But it’s also black in that, like Mr. Wolfe’s musical, it’s got a touch of the blues. The matter that’s also got Mr. Wolfe bummed out  —   downright angry  —   is the question of appropriation. It insinuates that George Gershwin stole from “Shuffle Along. ” It’s a spurious charge but one meant to address the wider historical swamp of race, influence and theft. In the show’s most chilling wink, he makes the white Harlem Renaissance gadfly Carl Van Vechten into a villainous scold who attacks the show while damning it to irrelevance. Maybe Van Vechten is right. Yet his condescension feels wrong. Black parlance has a word for all of this waking up: “woke. ” The meaning has expanded from black people’s discovery and maintained awareness of trouble (“Stay woke! ”) to white people’s acknowledgment of black trouble and also their awareness that sometimes the trouble lies with them. There’s a symbiosis at work. At the same time that black artists are coming into a sharper phase of their blackness, white Americans are coming into their whiteness, reckoning with it and embracing it. Part of what’s brought them to this identification of politicized whiteness is what’s brought   minorities to their racial politics: oppression and injustice and anger. Earlier this week, Louis C. K. told the writer David Marchese, in a long, illuminating Q. and A. on Vulture, that white guys are doing fine. He was responding to a question about the sense of oppression coursing through the white male electorate. These guys feel they can’t speak their mind anymore. So they’re glad that Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump are speaking for them. But Louis C. K. suspects cultural hypochondria. “Nobody’s turning us down for a job,” he said. “There’s nothing that’s being taken away from us. ” Of course, that’s not entirely true. Some of the stuff being taken away from white people is stuff they previously took. Some of that stuff is being challenged, by the likes of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, who in February released a brick of an album that, in part, atones for white privilege by incorporating white guilt. But that reclaiming is being done by filmmakers as well. Ava DuVernay’s “Selma” shouldn’t have seemed all that subversive. But the movies so frequently favor black stories from white perspectives that placing a crucial moment of the civil rights movement in the hands of black leadership constituted revolt. The actor Nate Parker has directed a film, due in the fall, about Nat Turner’s slave rebellion that sets up a contrast with William Styron’s novel “The Confession of Nat Turner” from 1967 and implicitly rebukes D. W. Griffith’s racist landmark, from 1915, which seduces you to root for the Ku Klux Klan. They’re both called “The Birth of a Nation. ” There’s even a revisionist version of “Roots” that isn’t more than serviceable but is remarkably more handsome and better acted than the original. It’s as much about black power as the original was concerned with narrative racial balance. Hey, Beyoncé, Kunta Kinte now breaks chains all by himself, too. The gist of some of this rethinking is defensive. Some of it’s tentative, even the very best of it.  ? It does also feel, however, like artists learning  —   how to be politically black and commercial, entertaining and listenable. And some of the country is learning with them. But having to learn also feels weirdly new. In the 1970s, when Ali owned American culture, and black movies and music weren’t shy about black politics, there was nothing to be “ish” about.",0
2926,Tylenol During Pregnancy Linked to Autism,"by Alliance for Natural Health – USA 
Another in a long list of reasons to avoid this drug. 
A recent study found that boys exposed to acetaminophen (Tylenol) before birth were more likely to have symptoms of autism during childhood. 
This isn’t the first time that scientists have reported a connection between using this drug during pregnancy and brain and behavior abnormalities in children. Other studies show that exposure to acetaminophen raised the risk of developing ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) by 40%. Another study found that women taking it increased the risk of their child having behavioral problems by 70%. 
Pregnant mothers aren’t the only ones who should avoid acetaminophen and other common painkillers like NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)—a class that includes drugs like Advil, Celebrex, and Aleve. 
Consider the following: By the FDA’s own calculation , acetaminophen was the leading cause of liver failure in Americans between 1998 and 2003, and there’s no reason to think that this has changed in the years since. Every year, 78,000 people go to the emergency room from acetaminophen overdose , whether accidental or intentional. The problem is so bad that the FDA asked doctors to stop prescribing any medication that has more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per dose. Of course, this ignores the fact that if people feel the prescribed dose isn’t cutting the pain, many think nothing of taking an extra tablet or two. 
NSAID pain relievers like aspirin or ibuprofen are similarly problematic: One study conservatively estimated that 107,000 people are hospitalized each year for NSAID-related gastrointestinal complications and “at least 16,500 NSAID-related deaths occur each year among arthritis patients alone.” Another study showed that patients who take NSAIDs have a 90% greater likelihood of dying from all causes. Daily or long-term use of aspirin doubles the risk of internal bleeding and does not reduce heart attack risk for people with no history of heart problems. 
Getting back to acetaminophen in particular—given all of its terrible side effects, why does the FDA remain silent? The most likely answer is simply that it is a very profitable drug to sell.

2928,"Comedian Hasan Minhaj, Who Called Donald Trump ’White ISIS,’ to Headline WHCD","The White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) has tapped comedian Hasan Minhaj to headline the establishment media’s biggest annual event. [This year’s   dinner, which is set to take place April 29th, will feature members of Donald Trump’s administration and large swathes of media members. But the president, as he announced in February, won’t be attending the event.  Minhaj, however, a relatively unknown figure, has made a habit of hitting Donald Trump with personal insults. The Daily Show star called Trump “White ISIS” during last year’s primaries and was featured in a recent Daily Show segment that highlighted the president’s greatest tweet of all time. . @roywoodjr and @hasanminhaj announce the greatest Trump tweet of all time. pic. twitter.   —   The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) April 6, 2017,  Minhaj also mocked President Trump in a statement thanking the WHCA for selecting him to host. “It is a tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD!” Minhaj said. “Now more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press. ” While the WHCA dinner tends to feature a comedian who mocks the president and the press, the WHCA chief says picking an   host was not the message his organization wanted to send. “I was not looking for somebody who was going to roast the president in absentia. That’s not fair, and that’s not the message that we want to get across,” WHCA president Jeff Mason said Tuesday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “I was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to   …     the importance of a free press. ” Nevertheless, Minhaj’s being selected to headline the WHCA dinner will likely parallel the event’s past jeering of Trump. At 2011’s dinner, Trump was skewered by both Barack Obama and that night’s comedic relief Seth Myers. And if Minhaj goes full   while hosting, the WHCA dinner will likely intensify the hostility between the president and the media. Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
2929,Capitol Hill Source: Intel Chair Nunes Temporarily Vacated Russia Probe to Keep Focus on Russia,"A Capitol Hill source familiar with the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) told Breitbart News that Nunes stepped away from the committee’s investigation into Russia’s participation in the 2016 election cycle as a result of a coordinated political attack by the Left. [Nunes’ announcement came as the House Ethics Committee released a statement disclosing that the committee was investigating public allegations that Nunes made unauthorized disclosure of classified documents.  “This was a coordinated attack by   groups against Nunes,” the source said. “As the Ethics Committee does its inquiry, he could not have other Republican committee members constantly having to defend him instead of focusing on the Russia investigation and particularly the abuse of intelligence through the improper unmasking of Americans’ names for political purposes. ” Nunes was not pushed by House Republican leadership to recuse himself, but it was not helpful to have other Republicans, notably Sen. John McCain ( ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) join Democrats in questioning his motives and competence. Sunday, McCain told Martha Raddatz on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” Nunes was hindering congressional efforts to determine how the Russians interfered in the 2016 election cycle, when he communicated with the White House about information he gathered from a whistle blower with informing Democrats on his committee. “If we’re really going to get to the bottom of these things, it’s got to be done in a bipartisan fashion. And as far as I could tell, Congressman Nunes killed that. ” The Los Angeles Times reported March 22 that Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) top Democrat on the the Intel Committee told the paper: Schiff said he raised his concerns directly with Nunes after the Republican disclosed new information publicly and then to the White House. He stopped short of saying whether Nunes was improperly making classified information public, saying instead that his actions were “beyond irregular. ” Nunes’ actions further demonstrated the need for an independent inquiry into Russia’s actions during the campaign, Schiff said. “We’re the only investigation there is. If we don’t do it, no one is going to do it,” Schiff said. “Now, perhaps the White House would like it that way. But the American people, I think, want there to be a credible investigation. And if we’re not going to conduct it, then we need to have an independent commission do it. ” The recusal is temporary and as soon as possible, the chairman intends to resume full control of the committee as soon as the House Ethics Committee resolves the charges made by   groups, the source said. The source said Nunes hopes the Ethics Committee will work on his case during the Easter recess so the investigation can be wrapped up as soon as possible. Capitol Hill conservatives are now watching to see if Nunes will also recuse himself from the probe into former national security adviser Susan Rice.",0
2930,Vladimir Putin: Who will protect young boys from pedophiles and rapists in Europe?,"By Jonas E. Alexis on November 3, 2016 Putin: “Is this the result of erosion of the traditional national values? I don’t even know how to explain it. Maybe they have a guilty conscience because of the refugee crises. "" “Why can’t those people get a simple concept through their heads?” …by Jonas E. Alexis 

No, the Khazarian Mafia and their lackeys will never report that Vladimir Putin, the man who has been called all sorts of disgusting names, is actually fighting in order to save the moral fabric of Europe. In 2014, he argued that “ a faith in God and a belief in Satan ” are incompatible. 
Putin moved on to argue that any policy that puts “multi-child family and a same-sex partnership” on the same level is on “the path to degradation.” 
More recently, there have been numerous rape allegations in Europe. In fact, many so-called refugees have been literally caught with their pants down. The British newspaper the Independent has recently reported: 
“ A man who raped a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Austria has had his conviction overturned after judges found he may have believed the child consented. 
“Police said the 20-year-old Iraqi refugee, who has not been named, assaulted his victim in a toilet cubicle at the Theresienbad swimming pool in Vienna on 2 December last year. 
“The child reported the rape to a lifeguard and his attacker was arrested at the scene, reportedly telling officers in initial interviews that he was experiencing a ‘sexual emergency’ after not having sex in four months.” 
Obviously there is a problem here. Putin responded by saying: “ So, what’ going on now? A refugee raped a child in one of the European countries. The court let him free on two grounds: he doesn’t speak the language of the residence country, and he didn’t understand that [the] boy was against the rape. It’s just hard to imagine what Europeans are going… “Is this the result of erosion of the traditional national values? I don’t even know how to explain it. Maybe they have a guilty conscience because of the refugee crises. A society that cannot defend its children today, has no tomorrow. It has no future.” 
Indeed. We should add that the Neoconservative Mafia and their marionettes are largely responsible for the rape crisis in Europe. Never forget what flaming Neocon Daniel Pipes said. 
After postulating that “Western governments should respond by helping the rebels to prevent Assad from crushing them,” Pipes added back in 2013: “the West should prevent either side in the civil war from emerging victorious by helping whichever side is losing, so as to prolong their conflict.’” [1] 
Did you catch the diabolical proposition here? Pipes himself admitted that this ideology is really weird: “This policy recommendation of ‘helping whichever side is losing’ sounds odd, I admit, but it is strategic.” [2] 
Well, it is only “strategic” for Pipes and his minions, who have been waging a frontal war against the moral and political order from time immemorial. Their subversive movements across Europe have been responsible for Bolshevik Revolution, for Abu Ghraib, and indeed for the debacle in Syria. So, whenever people like Pipes beat the perpetual war drum, rest assured that rape will largely be the end result. 
Furthermore, if the so-called refugees are raping boys by the numbers, then European officials should fire a moral and political shot at people like Daniel Pipes and other people who don’t give a flip about saving both the Middle East and indeed Europe from slow destruction. If the late rabbi Ovadia Yosef was right, that Goyim are donkeys and that they “were born to serve” Jews, [3] then it doesn’t really matter who gets raped in the process at all. 
Yosef himself said that the Goyim “need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they’d lose their money. This is his servant… That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew.” [4] 
Well, the young Goyim are dying in Europe, and no serious politician gives a flip about them because those politicians, as we shall see in the next installment, are in cahoots with the Khazarian Mafia in Israel and other places. Putin again is trying to help Europe by indirectly appealing to an implicit moral law, which he says is imbedded in traditional values.

2931,"Prominent Psychologist Says, ‘Google has power to control elections, can shift millions of votes to Clinton’","Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Prominent Psychologist Says, ‘Google has power to control elections, can shift millions of votes to Clinton’ Prominent Psychologist Says, ‘Google has power to control elections, can shift millions of votes to Clinton’ The Free Thought Project November 1, 2016 1 Comment 
(RT) — People trust the “unbiased” internet search giant Google so much it can actually influence up to 10 million undecided voters to choose Hillary Clinton for president, prominent US psychologist and author Robert Epstein told RT following years of research. 
Despite being a supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee, Dr. Epstein believes Google’s unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a “threat to democracy.” 
RT: Robert, how did you discover that Google is possibly in cahoots with the Clinton campaign? 
RE: Well I didn’t find out that they were necessarily supporting Hillary Clinton, that’s not what I found at first. First, through several years of research, I found that they had the power to control elections, the power to shift the votes. So, that was more than four years of experimental research with more than 10,000 people in 39 countries. 
So, we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings Google can shift a lot of votes. More than 20 percent of undecided voters overall, and in some demographic groups up to 80 percent of undecided voters. People trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples’ votes. 
Now, more recently, many people have established that Google has a very close relationship with Hillary Clinton. That didn’t come from my research, that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people. 
RT: Are you going to take a look at Facebook and Twitter as well? It looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates. 
RE: Well, we know now that Facebook has the power to shift about 600,000 votes to Hillary Clinton on Election Day with no one knowing this is occurring. All they have to do is send out “Go out and vote” reminders to Hillary Clinton’s supporters, but not to Trump’s supporters. That would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home. So yes, we’ve looked at Facebook, we’ve looked at Twitter. But again, Facebook can shift 600,000 votes, Google can shift somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes. 
RT: Have you been able to find abnormal search results by Google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections? 
RE: We haven’t look carefully at too many countries. We’ve looked at the UK election in 2015, we looked at the national election in India, at the Lok Sabha election in 2014. What we do know is that it is the nature of Google’s algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another. That happens automatically. That happens, as Google would say, organically. So, this means that Google’s algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years, probably actually controlling the winner in as many as 25 percent of the national elections of the world. 
RT: What do you think about this threat of big data? Do you think Google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose? 
RE: Well, big data at the moment is a threat. It’s a threat to democracy, at least as we have it in the United States, it’s a threat to human freedom, it’s a threat to civil liberties. This is mainly because the technologies are very new, and new means of control, of surveillance, of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated – they’re not covered by any laws or regulations. So, the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly, and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies, we’ve not developed systems for regulating these technologies. Obviously, we must do so. 
RT: You’ve said that unlike Europe, Russia and China were able to overcome the Google monopoly, but a lot of people are still using this search engine. Do you think that the US company can manipulate public opinion in Russia as well? 
RE: Well, it’s hard for them to manipulate opinion if they don’t dominate that country. Google dominates most of the countries in the world. The only countries it doesn’t dominate are Russia and China. So, Russia and China are protected a little bit from Google, but Russia and China have their own problems. Russia has Yandex, China has Baidu, and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that Google is using and perhaps they’re already using these techniques. These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine. These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions. 
My newest research shows, for example, that Google seems to be favoring Hillary Clinton in its search suggestions, the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item, and from new research I’ve done, we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate, that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate. So, Google is not the only problem. Any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance, for manipulation, for control, and I think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world, not just Google. 
RT: How do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like Google? 
RE: Well, the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public. The private company does not have people who we voted on. The private company might be run almost like a monarchy, with the CEO having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do, even not having access to their internal records. So we would have no idea of exactly what they’re doing or how they’re doing it and how they’re making decisions. This is potentially very dangerous. The situation right now is unprecedented in human history. There has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws, beyond the reach of any regulations, and who don’t necessarily have the public interest in mind. 
RT: What about Donald Trump? In your opinion, what methods and tricks has Donald Trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race? 
RE: Well, I’ve said in writing, repeatedly and in many interviews that I’m a very strong supporter of Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is by far the better candidate, Donald Trump is a very weak candidate, he would not make a good leader, he would not make a good president. Plus, I know people in his family, it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president, I don’t think he wants to be president! I think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network, and I think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that. 
The private company might be run almost like a monarchy, with the CEO having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do, even not having access to their internal records. So we would have no idea of exactly what they’re doing or how they’re doing it and how they’re making decisions. This is potentially very dangerous. 
I made a prediction on Twitter recently, you can check this: I not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show. It will be a reality TV show about Donald Trump running for president, and that will be a hit show, so I think that’s his only interest here. Hillary Clinton will become our next president, it’s guaranteed and in my opinion Donald Trump has no interest, never had any interest in becoming president. 
RT: Do you believe that Hillary Clinton will become US president through the manipulation of public opinion? 
RE: Oh, Hillary Clinton is guaranteed to win this election, and I have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote, that those polls did not take into account the power that Google and other companies have to shift votes. That’s missing from these polls. So, once you realize the power that these companies have, Hillary Clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win, and she will win in the margin of somewhere between 2.6 million and 10 million votes. If we take the mean, the average of those two numbers, I guess you could say it’s pretty clear that she will win by approximately 6.5 million votes. 
RT: Given that the United States has such an expensive and powerful media industry, would you say that voters in the US have a real picture of the presidential campaign? 
RE: Well, voters in the United States I think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers, magazines and the internet, more than 400 different television channels. So I think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things, but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive. So, we’re getting one perspective from one magazine, another perspective from another magazine. 
But when you come to something like Google, there’s no competition. There’s no competitor. It’s a completely different kind of influence, it’s non-competitive. In other words, if you’re still trying to make up your mind and you go to Google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election, Google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily, easily tip your opinion one way or the other and there’s no competitor, there’s no way for anyone to compensate what Google just told you. 
So, this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence. It has no competition, there’s no corrective for it, and people trust Google – we know this from surveys – people trust Google more than they trust any newspaper, any magazine or any television station. People trust information that they get from a computer much more than information they’re getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased, because they know that people are actually giving them the information. But when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial, that information is objective and of course, that’s not really true, but that’s what people believe.",0
2932,"Donald Trump, Delta Air Lines, Michael Phelps: Your Monday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Donald Trump offered details of his   economic policies in a speech in Detroit. He promised to ease or freeze regulation, limit business income tax to 15 percent, and tear up the Paris climate agreement. He also said he would renegotiate trade agreements, end the estate tax, create jobs and exempt   expenses from taxes. Protesters interrupted sporadically. Watch excerpts here. On the same day, 50 senior Republican national security officials issued a warning that Mr. Trump would be “the most reckless president in American history. ” _____ 2. Hillary Clinton’s campaign criticized Mr. Trump’s economic plans on Twitter: “1. Lower wages 2. Fewer jobs 3. More debt 4. Tax breaks for the 0. 1%. ” She will lay out more of her economic ideas in Detroit on Thursday. Mrs. Clinton is starting the week in Florida, where her campaign is opening more than a dozen offices in hopes of cementing her lead and denying Mr. Trump a state crucial to his own strategy. _____ 3. At the Olympics, the enthusiasm of Brazilian fans has been straining the boundaries of sportsmanship. Still, world records continue to fall. And there was a quieter groundbreaking moment. A    fencer, Ibtihaj Muhammad of New Jersey, was the first U. S. Olympian to compete at a Games in a hijab. And a new athletic fad emerged: Michael Phelps and other swimmers are mottled with circular purple bruises because they are undergoing “cupping,” a technique used in Chinese medicine. It’s reputed, but not scientifically proven, to increase circulation. Our full coverage is here, and you can stream the Games here. _____ 4. Delta Air Lines canceled about 450 flights after the failure of a piece of electrical equipment at one of its Atlanta facilities caused its computer systems to crash worldwide. Aside from the toll on passengers, the airline is grappling with refunds, emergency accommodations and other expenses as yet untallied. Below, handwritten boarding passes. Southwest Airlines estimated its costs from a similar problem a few weeks ago at “tens of millions of dollars. ” _____ 5. Emperor Akihito of Japan raised the possibility of stepping down, a challenge to the cult of emperor worship created in the 19th century. At 82 and with a history of health problems, Akihito effectively urged the country to return to the temporal and temporary leadership of past centuries. _____ 6. Scores of people were killed and many others were seriously wounded in the latest burst of violence in the restive Pakistani city of Quetta. In an attack claimed by a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, a suicide bomber struck a hospital where dozens of lawyers had gathered to condemn the fatal shooting of a prominent colleague. _____ 7. Scientists are getting worried about how climate change is drying out peat bogs, making them more vulnerable to fire. Such bogs make up only about 3 percent of the earth’s land surface  —   mostly in northern Canada, Alaska, northern Europe and Russia. But, surprisingly, they contain more carbon than all the world’s trees and plants. _____ 8. Mexico has counted more than three dozen deaths and is still digging out from landslides after   rains from Tropical Storm Earl. One town was hit with a month’s worth of rain over 24 hours. And another big storm is heading toward Baja California and Mexico’s Pacific Coast. _____ 9. One of our most popular stories today looks at the troubling frequency with which corporate consultants double as scholars with think tanks that shape government policy across the political spectrum. For instance, Carol Browner, above, a former top environmental adviser to President Obama, was a paid consultant to the nuclear power industry while she held an unpaid position as a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. _____ 10. Finally, a wedding in Pennsylvania included a very special guest. The father of Jeni Stepien, the bride, was killed in a robbery 10 years earlier, so she invited the man who received his heart to walk her down the aisle. When the recipient, Arthur Thomas, arrived from New Jersey, he held out his wrist. “I thought that would be the best way for her to feel close to her dad,” he said. “That’s her father’s heart beating. ” _____ Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m.

2933,Comment on 10 Habits That Will Make Your Life Easier & More Peaceful by 10 Habits That Will Make Your Life Easier & More Peaceful - Wellness Solutions,"advertisement - learn more I am of no exception to this, as I have often found myself struggling with the demands of day-to-day existence, usually at the expense of my own well-being. Not wanting to perpetuate this lifestyle any further, I recently began making a more conscious effort to implement a number of habits into my routine in the hopes of bringing a little more peace and calm into my world. While many have proven ineffective, the following list of 10 habits did make the cut and have improved my life considerably. Why not try them out for yourself? They might just make your life easier, too. 1. Cut The Multitasking To me, multitasking is nothing more than a grand illusion of increased productivity. Doing several things at once may make us feel as if we are going to accomplish more and therefore have more free time afterwards, but in most cases multitasking ends up taking longer and resulting in poorer work. Rather than trying to cross 3 things off your To-Do List at once, instead really focus on one item at a time (with no distractions), and you might just surprise yourself by how proficient you can be. 2. Prepare Yourself The Night Before Life is full of the unexpected, but the majority of our days tend to feature predictable occurrences and tasks to be accomplished. A simple little habit that I’ve found helpful in mentally preparing myself for the next day is to quickly think about or write out what my day is likely going to offer the night before. I don’t have any science to back this up, but I’ve found it allows my mind to mentally prepare itself and handle the next day better. 3. Turn Off The Tech The continually expanding world of technology is a wonderful thing; however, the amount of time we spend connected to it daily is far past alarming. According to a report by Digital Trends , Americans spend an average of 4.7 hours per day on their phone, which is scary enough, but becomes frightening when we also factor in time spent on our computers and in front of a television. I’ve made a conscious effort to stay away from tech a half-hour before and after sleep as often as possible and have found that just that alone has had a drastic impact on my well-being. advertisement - learn more 4. Stay Hydrated… With Water! According to Sheila Tucker, MA, RD, LDN of Boston College , two-thirds of Americans do not drink enough water daily, meaning that we put our bodies (which are composed of approximately 60% water) through chronic dehydration. I personally can always tell when I’ve not consumed enough water in a day, largely through the difference in how well I can function. Staying properly hydrated can be one of the easiest and most powerful tools in feeling better and ultimately making your life easier. (Note: Remember that anything containing either caffeine or alcohol is a diuretic, meaning it fosters water loss rather than hydration.) 5. Get Rid Of What You Don’t Need We may not all be hoarders, but I’m sure that the majority of us have a number of things in our living space that we truly have no need for. I recently made the move from living in a house to a condo, and am amazed by how little I truly require to live my life happily. By getting rid of what you don’t need, you give what you do require more space to operate, ultimately making your life feel less cluttered and focused. 6. Don’t Be Afraid To Say “No” Saying “no” seems simple enough, but for many of us it is a struggle that makes our lives that much more complicated and unhappy. It may seem scary or confrontational at first, but saying “no” eventually becomes quite empowering, especially when what is turned down is replaced by something you are passionate about or would like to accomplish. 7. Plan Out Your Meals Finding time for this may sound like it wouldn’t make your life easier, but planning out your meals ahead of time has a number of great benefits, the first being that it allows you to save money when grocery shopping by only buying exactly what you need, which in turn limits food and money waste. A second benefit is that it results in you eating meals at home more often, which Michael Pollan spoke to the importance of in a 2007 Ted Talk . I’ve also found great peace of mind in always knowing what I am going to prepare ahead of time rather than having to come up with something on the fly every day. 8. Daily Movement Whether it be something as simple as an evening walk, or as stringent as a workout routine, I’m a huge believer in the importance of daily movement. This is especially important when we consider the amount of research that has emerged to show just how detrimental prolonged periods of sitting can be to our health. Amp up the benefit of your daily movement time by also cutting out technology while doing it. Need music to be active? Put your phone on airplane mode to limit its negative impact on you. 9. Meditate I hate to include it in the list because of how cliché the term has become, but the truth is, based on my first hand experience (and a wealth of scientific data), it really works. There are few things that I can say are capable of having as profound of a positive impact on my daily function as meditating does. We all have rampant minds, and taking even just five minutes a day to quiet it down can work wonders on your experience of peace and ability to handle life. Have trouble meditating? Here are 6 methods that can get anyone on board. 10. Remind Yourself Of What Gets You Going Sometimes it’s the quote, “if not now, when?” and other times it’s the words of accomplished individuals like Will Smith that get me fired up about life. We all have those people, sayings, or things that really speak to us and get our engines going at full steam. Take some time and think about what those things are for you, remind yourself of them daily, and see how much of an impact it has on your overall functionioning. What are your thoughts on these habits? Feel free to share any that you practice regularly through the comment section below to help make this article even more powerful for those who come to it next.

2934,George Soros wants to create color revolution in Southeast Asia,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 30, 2016 What if China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Russia end up forging an alliance, since they all realize that they have a common enemy? Would that be good news for the New World Order? In order to deal with Soros, Malaysian officials need to give Vladimir Putin a call. …by Jonas E. Alexis 

George Soros has again shown that Jim W. Dean was right all along. Soros, Dean says, “ refuses to die and join his victims.” Soros, Dean moves on to declare, has been involved in the “the age-old pump-and-dump stock manipulation scam” for quite a while. 
As we have argued elsewhere, Soros was involved in destroying the Russian economy in the 1990s. But he has created other covert activities as well. He was behind the Black Lives Matter movement . He wants to flood Europe with so-called refugees from virtually all over the Middle East while remaining silent about US officials supporting terrorist organs in Syria. In short, Soros still wants to move and shake the world. 
Soros has recently turned his attention to Southeast Asia. He wants to taste economic blood in that region. He has been in that part of the world before. And government officials know him pretty well. 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia declared back in 1997 that for people like Soros, “wealth must come from impoverishing others, from taking what others have in order to enrich themselves. Their weapon is their wealth against the poverty of others.” [1] The New York Times reported then: “Mr. Mahathir specifically blamed Mr. Soros for orchestrating Malaysia’s economic crisis—he told the assembled bankers and economists that Mr. Soros’s ilk had to be stopped.” [2] 
Mahathir said: “I am saying that currency trading is unnecessary, unproductive and totally immoral. It should be stopped. It should be made illegal. We don’t need currency trading.” [3] 
Mahathir was trying to articulate that rapacious usury is antithetical to the moral order and is therefore to be avoided. He has witnessed what usury, through “crony capitalism,” has done and how it precipitated the economic crisis in much of Asia, most specifically in South Korea and the Philippines. [4] The same “currency” has brought down economic progress in places like Thailand and Indonesia, where was a drastic decline in income. One scholar noted: 
“ The enormity of the shock is captured by the fact that in the worst-affected countries real GDP growth has turned abruptly from over 7 per cent per annum to negative. In Thailand growth fell from 6 per cent in 1996 to almost zero in 1997, with all the decline concentrated in the second half of that year, and has fallen by at least a further 5 per cent in 1998. In Indonesia the corresponding swing is from 8 per cent growth up to the third quarter of 1997 to an absolute decline of 15 per cent in 1998… 
“These huge aggregate income shifts were the result of a financial crisis reflected in precipitous currency devaluations and falls in equity prices. Currencies depreciated by up to 80 per cent in the worst case (the Indonesian rupiah) while equity and other asset prices fell by 50 per cent or more in the worst-affected countries. 
“The key factor behind this currency and stock market collapse was a massive reversal of foreign capital flows. It has been estimated that for Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines net private inflows dropped from US$ 93 billion to 12 billion – a swing of 11 per cent of GDP between the end of 1996 and the end of 1997.” 
Many countries in Asia were basically following capitalism by that time, and it was no accident that they had a huge debacle by 1997. [5] Mahathir, in that sense, was trying provide a response to that debacle. Soros didn’t like what Mahathir said because Soros is a capitalist and wanted to rip people in Southeast Asia off their labor. He fired back at Mahathir by saying: 
“Dr. Mahathir’s suggestion yesterday to ban currency trading is so inappropriate that it does not deserve serious consideration. Interfering with the convertibility of capital at a moment like this is a recipe for disaster. Dr. Mahathir is a menace to his own country.” [6] 
Mahathir seemed to have learned his lesson. By 2003, he created a storm of controversy by saying that “The Jews rule the world by proxy. They get others to fight and die for them.” [7] 
Some have said that Mahathir was promoting violence against Jews, but that itself is false. If a person says that the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, it does not necessitate the illogical idea that every single Japanese person is responsible for Pearl Harbor at all. Mahathir was making a general claim, and many Jews, including Henry Makow, agreed with him. Elias Davidsson of Jerusalem concurred as well. He said: 
“As a Jew myself (but opposed to Zionism) I need no encouragement from Malaysain PM Mahathir Mohammed to observe what should be obvious to the blatant eye: Namely that Jews effectively rule US foreign policy and thus determine to a great extent the conductof most countries… 
“So it is with the proposition that Jews control the world. Surely the do not control every single action; surely it does not mean that every Jew participates in the ‘control.’ But for all practical purposes the proposition holds. 
“Mahathir has neither asked to discriminate against Jews, let along to kill Jews. It is shameful to equate him to the Hitlerites.” [8] 
Mahathir added elsewhere that “a U.S. dominated IMF was ‘trying to change the Asian system.” [9] Obviously that “U.S. dominated IMF” was in concert with capitalism, which has been refined in the twenty-first century by people like Milton Friedman. [10] 
But Mahathir probably wouldn’t expect Soros to come back to Southeast Asia for round two. It has been reported that Soros is looking for a “color revolution” through his Open Society Foundation in Malaysia because he seems to think that there is a lack of “constitutional democracy.” [11] Like Rodrigo Duterte, Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak has recently been trying to build an alliance with China: “Malaysian Prime Minster Najib Razak heads to China next week to build closer ties and seek investment, which may further dent US aims in Southeast Asia after a push by President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines to bolster China ties.” [12] 
Obviously this is not good news for New World Order agents at all. It gets worse: “Both Malaysia and the Philippines have long been in dispute with China over the South China Sea. However, Kuala Lumpur may follow in the footsteps of Manila, seeking to ease tensions with Beijing in exchange for economic benefits.” [13] 
Soros again does not like that, and this might be one reason why he declared that “There is no Business like the Revolutions Business.’” Mathew Maavak of Risk Foresight at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) comments: 
“NGOs and the West-friendly media constitute a major subsidiary of the global social revolutions enterprise. Together, they seek out, identify and amplify public discontent in nations not aligned to the United States. 
“Such US-engineered activisms have never led to more equitable societies; rather they have engendered endless bloodshed and global terrorism. To the agitprop entrepreneur, the returns on revolutionary investments are immense. 
“A wealthy hedge fund manager can short a targeted market before executing a pre-planned ‘revolution.’ The resultant stock market and currency meltdown would provide self-evidentiary ‘proof’ to an anxious public, exerting more pressure on the government of the day to either capitulate or concede to ‘popular demands’ that are actually drafted abroad, likely by the IMF!” [14] 
Maavak, like other experts in Asia, are well aware that Soros was behind the economic crisis in 1997. He writes, “The entire region was in turmoil, and the name of George Soros featured prominently in this sordid saga. The ‘Reformasi’ [protest] movement led by sacked [Malaysian] Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim — who had close to ties to Washington hawks — failed to topple the government of the day.” [ 15] 
Perhaps Malaysia needs to do what China and Russia did: they need to kick Soros out of for good. Or perhaps they need to give Vladimir Putin a call and ask him how he did it. But what if China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Russia end up forging an alliance, since they all realize that they have a common enemy? Would that be good news for the New World Order? 
I guess US Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work has good reason to say: ““Our adversaries [Russia], quite frankly, are pursuing enhanced human operations and it scares the crap out of us.” [16]

2935,Once and Always a New Yorker - The New York Times,"I left Manhattan in 1988, the morning after marrying a peripatetic advertising executive whose career would take us to six different cities over the course of 26 years. On the ascent out of LaGuardia, I turned my head to the clouds and cried. Following stints in the Midwest, the   and New England, I eventually arrived in Texas with two babies, two dogs and the aforementioned husband. Last August, after delivering the younger daughter to college and graduating, myself, from the residential restriction in a divorce decree, I returned home. I was just one person, this moving day, one person and a new canine charge, Charles. Some people flee New York without reservation, while others depart uneasily, but certain that one day, they will make it back. The   is inspired, typically, by the universal tug of home and family, along with the draw of the city’s singular street life, culture and sensibility. The notion of change is inherent in any return, though, since the city will have evolved in your absence and you, too, may be different from who you were when you left. I knew, in 1988, that I would come back to New York. I was born on York Avenue and East 70th Street and raised in Westchester County, but returned twice after graduate school, living first on Central Park West and later on the Upper East Side. This time, in search of reasonably priced space that would accommodate two college students during vacations and Charles the terrier daily, I landed near where I began, on East End Avenue. I didn’t know that it would take so long to get here, or that so much would happen before I did. But I counted down, the whole time. Other former New Yorkers have done the same. “Moving back was in my head, and my friends will say that I’ve been talking about it forever,” said David Kurtz, 58, a film and television composer who lived in Los Angeles for 35 years. “I am very grateful for L. A. but this was always home, whatever all that means. ” The emotional bond with a place, of course, does not develop simply because you may have emerged from a delivery room within its ZIP code. Native New Yorkers are not the only ones who may feel like expatriates anywhere else. Mr. Kurtz grew up in Sayville, N. Y. on Long Island, but he formed a connection to Manhattan when he was a child. “My grandmother worked in Columbus Circle at the Diners Club. She loved to take me to Radio City for movies. And my grandfather worked the counter at Katz’s Deli. ” During high school, Mr. Kurtz took the train to Penn Station almost every Saturday for class in the Juilliard School   Division, and he credits his time there for solidifying his New York City identity. “It was more than a great musical experience,” he said. “It was my literal salvation. I blossomed in this city. ” While at the Manhattan School of Music in 1974, he lived on West 89th Street in the home of Isidore Cohen, then the violinist with the Beaux Arts Trio. “They rehearsed there all the time. Heaven!” The neighborhood, because of its proximity to Lincoln Center and its “European feeling,” was his first choice when he returned from California a year and a half ago. He had sold his Malibu house and bought an apartment on West 76th Street, off Central Park. “My L. A. friends say, ‘How are you going to live in that?’ and my New York friends say, ‘How did you find that?’ ” In March, he and Candace Bowes, a freelance advertising producer who spends weeks at a time working in Los Angeles, were married in the Ladies Pavilion in Central Park, down the street from their new home. “It was an iconic New York thing to do,” said Mr. Kurtz, who credits a confluence of events for his return, including his children leaving home, aging parents, immediate family who live here and a shift from composing for television programs to writing a screenplay. Like others who depart New York for places with more serenity and a quieter pace, Mr. Kurtz found he needed to create his own stimulation in California rather than find it in his surroundings. “The ocean, the environment, it became continuous and I lost the fascination,” he said. “Here, I’m in awe every day. I walk out the door, and the city is performance art. ” What a New York   will feel like depends on how long the person has been away and what his life was like at the time he left, said Christine Haney, the executive vice president of global relocation for Douglas Elliman Real Estate. “They come here because they have always loved the city,” she said. There is a certain age when people are unafraid to make changes and move anywhere, she added, but after they’ve gone down that path, “they want to come back and just enjoy. ” Once back in town, where they choose to rent or buy an apartment is often determined by how they will now spend their days, in addition to their budgets. “I had a client who said to me, ‘I am ready to go to Lincoln Center. I want to live facing the steps,’ ” said Annie Cion Gruenberger, an associate broker with Warburg Realty. “We went out and bought an apartment facing the steps. ” Susan Adler Funk, 56, loves seeing plays. She has at least six subscriptions to Off and Off Off Broadway theaters and attends between 50 and 60 performances a year. This past September, she and her husband, Allen Funk, 55, rented a   on Columbus Avenue and West 96th Street after selling a house in Sleepy Hollow, N. Y. where they had lived for three years following 18 years in and around Seattle and six in Washington, D. C. Also, the couple recently purchased a home in Flemington, N. J. where they intend to grow and sell grapes, “a retirement plan,” Ms. Funk said. “Every book that I own doesn’t have to be in this apartment. I am spoiled that way. ” When the grapes are in their infancy, the Funks will spend more time in New Jersey and keep their apartment as a   . Ms. Funk views herself as a Manhattan expatriate, despite a Rockland County, N. Y. upbringing, attributing that status to the years she lived here during her formative 20s. After college, she rented two apartments, first on Sutton Place and then on West 82nd Street. Following Harvard Business School, where she met Mr. Funk, a Los Angeles native and former newspaper publisher, she rented a   on West 77th Street. Now, as a   “fully formed” adult, she has returned to the city and, specifically, to the Upper West Side, for its energy and its closeness to the stage. “Theater is the reason I’m here,” she said. “I don’t know how the passion began, but I remember going to Playwrights Horizons when I first lived here and was poor and didn’t see much. ” Nostalgia is not part of the   for Ms. Funk, who, while in Seattle, started and ran a think tank focused on diversity issues in the technology industry and now is studying to become an accredited executive coach. “I actually tried to find where I used to live, but I couldn’t figure it out,” she said. Sometimes, though, returning to a place where childhoods happened, first jobs were held and mates were met can evoke strong sentiments about the passing of time and life choices. When people haven’t regularly seen the spots where seminal experiences occurred  —   both good and bad  —   they can feel walloped, emotionally. Across the street from the hospital where I was born is the hospital where my father died I have to bolster myself before walking by or choose a different route. “You have to be part psychologist,” said Ms. Haney of helping people relocate. “You have to be very sympathetic, very understanding of what they’re going through. ” In 1993, after six years of city life, Randy Gilman agreed to leave York Avenue and East 79th Street for Livingston, N. J. when her husband, Zvi Bolimovsky, expressed a desire to raise children outside Manhattan. “From Day 1, when I was pregnant, I was on a countdown to come back once my kids finished high school,” said Ms. Gilman, 63, who was born on Long Island and grew up near Hartford, Conn. After Ms. Gilman’s father died in 1990, her   mother, Evelyn, moved to Manhattan, renting an apartment at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, with a park view. Six years ago, when Ms. Gilman’s younger child was 15, the women bought, together, a    apartment around the corner, on Park Avenue and East 65th Street, into which the elder Ms. Gilman moved. After Ms. Gilman’s daughter graduated from high school three years ago, Ms. Gilman and Mr. Bolimovsky joined Evelyn Gilman, who is now 91, on the premises. “My daughter left in August and we moved in by October,” Ms. Gilman said. “I felt like I always belonged here. ” While leaving New Jersey stirred little emotion, sharing space with her mother, who has her own suite, has prompted Ms. Gilman to reminisce. “I feel sentimental about living with the beautiful art and artifacts that she accumulated on her many trips with my father,” Ms. Gilman said. “Living here also helps remind me about when I was a child and my parents took my sister and me to museums, theater and dance performances. ” When Charles and I landed in New York, there was no party, no ticker tape. The confetti was in my mind, raining down feelings of finish lines, relief, exhilaration, promise. People here ask where I lived before, and when I mention my 17 years in Texas, they seem uniformly horrified. They crinkle up their faces and ask, “Did you like it?” expecting a certain response. I would have provided that reply, at first. Now, I feel that I should defend the place that I desperately did not like, and that I would want to do this surprises me a little, but makes me feel encouraged about my time there. I tell the people about the efficient   and the civility of the children who shake hands when they are in preschool. I tell them that I raised two daughters there, two daughters who speak softly, saying y’all and ma’am and sir. I feel good about the place, standing in Carl Schurz Park on the East River, with Charles on a lead. I do, really, I do. This realization has played emotional tricks with my return, which, for years, I viewed as a simple construct, an escape from exile. Here, whatever was missing would suddenly exist, and I would feel energized, nurtured and safe. I would feel like me. I must say that this has happened, and in a magnified way  —   my old friends are more wonderful, the ballet more breathtaking, the brownstone facades more stunning. But is it home? Does it feel like home? I do not know. Sometimes, the transition is not what people envision it will be. After 40 years, Howard Bloomberg, 70, chose to return to Manhattan and his family’s Upper West Side neighborhood  —   not because he was nostalgic necessarily, but for its prewar architecture and residential ambience. “In 1976, I escaped. There was crime, filth, graffiti on the subway, you couldn’t see out the windows,” said Mr. Bloomberg, a retired investment banker who has lived in London, Boston and, most recently, New Hampshire. “But then, New York became a fabulous city, and it more closely resembled the time when I grew up. ” Mr. Bloomberg and his parents lived at 685 West End Avenue his grandparents, uncle and aunts lived at 697 West End Avenue. Mr. Bloomberg’s childhood apartment had bedrooms and baths on one side of a hall, and common rooms on the other. He hoped to duplicate that layout. But Mr. Bloomberg is not one to act rashly. He started his hunt in 2001, but it wasn’t until 2010 that he settled on Riverside Drive, across the street from Joan of Arc Park, where he used to play football. The    apartment in a 1902 building designed by Ralph S. Townsend overlooks the Hudson, has   ceilings and the details that Mr. Bloomberg was looking for. “I am very particular. It took three years to renovate. It didn’t even need a renovation,” he said. It took another two years to sell his house on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, delaying his return to the city until this spring. Mr. Bloomberg was ready to make the transition, to be less sedentary and more engaged in city life. “Over the decades, I’ve lost touch with just about everybody,” he said before he arrived in early May. “I look forward to having a big dinner party with them in my new apartment. It will be great fun, though we are no longer young men. ” Upon moving in, however, the anticipation turned rapidly to upset. Mr. Bloomberg walked into and out of five supermarkets, unable to navigate the narrow aisles. His phone wouldn’t work. His television and computer wouldn’t turn on. He was dismayed to see litter. After four days in the city, he thought to himself: “I can no longer cope. I don’t think I can possibly live here again. ” Now, some weeks later, Mr. Bloomberg is still here, though still out of sorts. He contemplated selling the apartment and leaving  —   where to, he was not sure  —   but the expense of such a turnaround dissuaded him. He did secure a New York City phone number. Adaptation, could it be? Expectations vary, according to Jeff Feuer, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate and Mr. Bloomberg’s real estate agent for 10 years. Typically, he said, the adjustment is a lot more difficult if you are leaving New York than if you are returning. “I have a house in Woodstock, and I love it,” he said, “but even after a couple of days, I just want to come back. ”",0
2936,East London Murder Suspect Used Welfare Benefits to Join Islamic State,"A follower of radical preacher Anjem Choudary is likely to have used his wife’s housing benefits to fund a journey to Syria to join Islamic State terrorists. [Shahan Choudhury, a former suspect in a teenage gang murder who was ‘radicalised’ in prison, disappeared from his London flat at the end of 2015. In 2016, his wife, Mehak, and their three young children, including a baby, joined him.  Mehak had received monthly housing benefit payments of about £1, 000 that she had failed to pass on in rent the month she left for the Middle East, The Sunday Times reports. Shahan Choudhury, of Tower Hamlets, east London, is just one of at least a dozen acolytes of Anjem Choudary to have joined Islamic State, with a further three being placed under antiterrorism controls. The hate preacher was jailed last year for recruiting for the terror group, after twenty years of freely preaching radical Islam in the UK. There are fears, however, that he is now influencing inmates. In 2005, when he was    Shahan Choudhury was charged with the murder of Karl Hamilton, a    hospital worker, allegedly over a £15 drug debt. He was acquitted in 2007, after spending 18 months awaiting trial on remand at Belmarsh   prison in   London, where his family say he was “brain washed”. “He was just like any other western kid when he went in but by the time he came out he was going on about religion and how the kuffar [ ] would all end up in the hellfire,” a relative said. Soon after leaving prison Shana had fallen in with Anjem Choudary and his notorious, marauding group of radicals of the now banned terror group  . Court documents relating to a separate case last summer cite police evidence stating that Choudhury “was believed to be a member of [ ] and had joined [Islamic State] in Syria”. His wife’s most recent tweets order Britons to travel to the Islamic State “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq “or wage jihad by himself w[ith] resources available to him”. Posting under the name Umm Umaarah, she also quotes Isis’s former external attacks chief: “Migrate or fight where u stand. ”",0

2940,Hillary In Prison Costume Annoys Liberals After They See What’s Behind Her,"Hillary In Prison Costume Annoys Liberals After They See Whatâs Behind Her Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
A womanâs Halloween costume is going viral after she snapped a quick picture and posted it to Twitter. Although a few panties were in a wad because she dressed as Hillary Clinton wearing a prison jumpsuit, liberals just about went into full meltdown after seeing what was behind her. 
The image was actually seen on the social media account of The Blaze reporter and famed conservative commentatorÂ Tomi Lahren Â after she shared one of her videos from Facebook. 
As it turns out, one of her subscribers had a picture that made for the perfect response. As can be seen, a woman decided to dress up as Hillary Clinton in a prison jumpsuit â but thatâs far from the complete picture. 
— Mr. Cards (@MrCards007) October 21, 2016 
Hitting her point home, it seems as though the womanâs significant other decided to dress up as Donald Trump, who was actually hauling Hillary Clinton off to jail. The visual created reflects Mr. Trumpâs promise given during the second debate when he said that he would put her in jail. 
Of course, others seemed to have loved the idea so much that they decided to duplicate the idea while putting their own spin on things: so my parents dressed up as trump & Hillary for prison for the costume party… pic.twitter.com/9RVAx4834z

With everything thatâs come out during the recent days, thereâs only one place that Hillary Clinton deserves to be. Between compromising the security of the American people through the use of her illegal email server to whoring out our country to fill her pockets, there isnât a single person who can argue that this woman is a criminal. 
Fortunately, it seems that FBI Director James Comey recently found his backbone and decided to actually start holding Hillary accountable. Letâs just hope Trump wins this election by a landslide and can follow through with that promise to lock Hillary away once and for all.",0
2941,"CBO Report: New Ryancare Saves Less than Previous Version, 24 Million Still Lose Insurance by 2026 - Breitbart","A new Congressional Budget Office report for Speaker Paul Ryan’s revised American Health Care Act reveals that 24 million people would still lose insurance by 2026 and the plan saves less money than the previous version. [In the revised version of Speaker Ryan’s   bill, 14 million people would lose coverage in 2018, and 24 million would lose coverage by 2026. These figures are similar to the CBO’s previous report on the Republican leadership’s bill.  Speaker Ryan’s revised bill, however, saves less money than the previous version. The current version would save $150 billion between 2017 and 2026, compared to the original bill that would have saved $337 billion. The changes to the bill were part of a “manager’s amendment” offered by GOP leaders to win more House Republican votes. The new CBO report was revealed amidst rancor between conservatives frustrated by the Republican leadership’s inability to repeal Obamacare. Speaker Ryan canceled Thursday’s vote on Ryancare because House leadership lacked the votes to pass the bill.   could be altered again, which might change the CBO score.",0
2942,$20 Billion in Tax Credits Fails to Increase College Attendance - The New York Times,"Taxpayers will file for $20 billion in tax credits for college expenses they paid in 2015, but while those who get them will no doubt be happy, new evidence shows they have no effect on encouraging people to attend college. The federal government provides over $30 billion annually in tax benefits for college. In addition to the two tax credits  —   the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit  —   benefits include a deduction for interest paid on student loans, a recently defunct deduction for tuition expenses, and the 529 and Coverdell   savings accounts. That is a lot of money. It’s about half of what the federal government spends on elementary and secondary education and   of what it spends on Pell Grants, which subsidize costs for   college students. The tax benefits were created to get more people into and through college. But researchers at Stanford and the University of California, Santa Cruz, have now shown that the largest tax benefit, the tax credits, have no effect on increasing education. The economists George Bulman and Caroline Hoxby scoured hundred of millions of tax returns searching for an effect of the tax credits and tuition deduction. They inspected detailed,   administrative data from the I. R. S. (The I. R. S. has developed secure mechanisms that allow these data to be analyzed without compromising the privacy of taxpayers.) These tax data have already generated a series of   studies, including two that exposed enormous variation across the United States in life spans and intergenerational income mobility. Dozens of data sets, including the I. R. S. data, show that college enrollment rises with income. If the tax credits help to increase college attendance, we should see this positive relationship between income and college attendance weaken where the tax credits phase out. (The tax credits phase out within certain income ranges, with their value dropping with each additional dollar of income. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is worth up to $2, 500 per student, but above an adjusted gross income of $160, 000 for a married couple, the credit drops steadily, until it reaches zero at $180, 000.) The intuition is that, in the phaseout region, rising income is offset by the decreasing credit, blunting the positive correlation between income and attendance. Statistical analysts call this method   design, because it relies on a change in the relationship between two variables. Mr. Bulman and Ms. Hoxby found the predicted relationship between adjusted gross income and the receipt of tax credits in the phaseout region: Credits drop as income rises. But they found no corresponding relationship between income and college attendance. College attendance rises unabated with adjusted gross income, with no change when the credits phase out. Why no effect? One explanation is that the credits primarily go to   and   families, whose decision on whether to send their children to college is unlikely to be affected by $2, 500. Another, compatible explanation is that the credits are delivered too late to affect enrollment. Families get them after tuition is due a family that pays tuition in September won’t get a tax credit until at least the following January. At that point the credit is a nice windfall, but has arrived too late to help pay the bursar. The complexity of the tax benefits also most likely undermines their effect. I discuss this in greater detail in a recent paper I wrote with Judith   which provides a comprehensive overview of the tax benefits for education. If the billions spent on the tax credits are to have any effect on college attendance, you would want them delivered when tuition bills are due. One proposal suggested by Ms. Hoxby and Mr. Bulman is to compute eligibility for the credits automatically, using income tax information when a dependent approaches college age. Families could then be notified of their eligibility. The authors also suggest that colleges file to receive the benefits directly from the Department of Education, so that a student need only present evidence of eligibility to have an account credited immediately. An even more comprehensive approach would be to consolidate the tax credits with the Pell Grant, creating a single grant program that pays college costs at the time of enrollment. Eligibility could automatically be calculated using tax data, with money delivered by the Department of Education. Families could apply by checking off a box on their tax forms. This approach would cut back substantially on paperwork, a relief for the millions of students who complete both the 1040 and the dreaded Free Application for Federal Student Aid in order to get federal grants, loans and tax credits for college. With a simplified application, and dollars delivered at the right time, the $30 billion now spent on tax credits could open college to many more students.",0
2943,"Polityka zagraniczna USA, Thierry Meyssan","Polityka zagraniczna USA Thierry Meyssan Działania różnych urzędów Stanów Zjednoczonych na arenie międzynarodowej są często nieskoordynowane. Na przykład w Syrii, gdzie formacje stworzone przez Pentagon walczą przeciwko formacjom stworzonym przez CIA. Natomiast w dwóch sprawach: podziału Europy na Unię Europejską i Rosję, oraz podziału Dalekiego Wschodu na ASEAN i Chiny – działają one całkowicie zgodnie. Jakie są cele polityki zagranicznej USA i czy można przewidzieć ową politykę?
Sieć Voltaire | Damaszek (Syria) | 29 października 2016 Deutsch ελληνικά English Español فارسى français italiano Português Türkçe русский Nederlands عربي Prognozując politykę zagraniczną USA na przestrzeni niemal stulecia, politolodzy dzielili polityków na izolacjonistów i interwencjonistów. Tych pierwszych zaliczali do „Ojców-pielgrzymów”, którzy uciekli ze starej Europy i chcieli zbudować nowy świat, oparty na wartościach religijnych, a zatem pozbawiony europejskiego cynizmu. Drugich zaś, do „Ojców-założycieli”, którzy nie tylko chcieli uzyskać niepodległość, ale i kontynuować na swój sposób projekt Imperium Brytyjskiego.
Dzisiaj taki podział nie ma już sensu, albowiem nawet tak wielkie kraje jak Stany Zjednoczone nie mogą być samowystarczalne. Dlatego w USA jest już regułą potępianie politycznych przeciwników izolacjonizmu, i jednocześnie nie ma tam ani jednego polityka, z wyjątkiem Rona Paula, który by tej [izolacjonistycznej] linii chciał bronić.
Spory toczą się pomiędzy zwolennikami wiecznej wojny i wyznawcami wykorzystywania bardziej miękkiej siły. A jeśli wierzyć pracom Marcina Gilensa i Beniamina I. Paige’a, to dzisiejsza polityka Stanów Zjednoczonych jest prowadzona przez grupy interesów, niezależnie od woli obywateli [ 1 ]. Zgodnie z logiką, w sporach tych można dostrzec wpływy – z jednej strony – kompleksu wojskowo-przemysłowego, który dominuje w gospodarce Stanów Zjednoczonych, a z drugiej strony – firm korzystających z rozliczeń bezgotówkowych przy opłatach za swoją produkcję (oprogramowanie, hi-tech, rozrywka), która tak właściwie jest raczej produkcją wirtualną, niż realną, czyli firmy te pobierają haracz tam, gdzie nie ma wojen.
Jednakże, taki punkt widzenia pozostawia z boku problem dostępu do użytecznych kopalin i źródeł energii, który był problemem dominującym w XIX i XX wieku, a dzisiaj, chociaż stracił swoją ostrość, to nie zniknął całkowicie.
Po ogłoszeniu „Doktryny Cartera” [ 2 ], która zalicza dostęp do węglowodorów na „Wielkim Bliskim Wschodzie” do kwestii „bezpieczeństwa narodowego”, Waszyngton stworzył CentCom [United States Central Command – Centralne Dowództwo Stanów Zjednoczonych], skierował do Zatoki Perskiej ponad 500.000 ludzi i ogłosił sprawowanie kontroli nad całym regionem. Wszyscy pamiętają jak Dick Cheney, upewniwszy się co do nieuchronności „peak oil” [szczytu wydobycia ropy naftowej], zaczął przygotowywać „arabską wiosnę” i wojny przeciwko tym państwom, które nie zechciały poddać się kontroli. Jednakże, polityka ta straciła sens, gdy tylko zaczęto ją prowadzić, albowiem Stany Zjednoczone, oprócz własnego wydobycia gazu łupkowego i ropy naftowej, przejęły dodatkowo kontrolę nad węglowodorami Zatoki Meksykańskiej. Dlatego w najbliższych latach Stany Zjednoczone nie tylko zostawią w spokoju „Wielki Bliski Wschód”, ale będą też zmuszone rozpocząć wielką wojnę z Wenezuelą, która jest jedynym krajem średniej wielkości, zdolnym konkurować, a nawet zagrażać [amerykańskiej] eksploatacji złóż w Zatoce Meksykańskiej.
W serii wywiadów dla „ The Atlantic ” prezydent Obama próbował uzasadnić swoją doktrynę [ 3 ]. Długo powtarzał jedno i to samo tym, którzy go oskarżali o niezgodność i słabość, zwłaszcza po sprawie „czerwonej linii” w Syrii. Rzeczywiście, powiedział on, że użycie broni chemicznej będzie czerwoną linią, której nie wolno przekroczyć, ale gdy jego administracja przekonywała go o tym, że Syryjska Republika Arabska zastosowała broń chemiczną wobec własnego narodu – Obama odmówił przystąpienia do nowej wojny. Nie wchodząc w dyskusję na temat zasadności tego oskarżenia, prezydent podkreślił, że Stany Zjednoczone nie powinny ryzykować życia swoich żołnierzy w tym konflikcie, i że zdecydował zachować ich siły do walki z prawdziwymi zagrożeniami dla narodowych interesów kraju. W tej powściągliwości tkwi cała istota „doktryny Obamy”.
Czymże są zatem owe „prawdziwe zagrożenia”? Prezydent nic o tym nie powiedział. Najlepiej będzie przyjrzeć się pracom Rady Wywiadu Narodowego USA ( US National Intelligence Council , NIC), pamiętając o sile wymienionych wyżej grup interesów. Okazuje się, że Stany Zjednoczone porzuciły stworzoną po 11 września „doktrynę Jerzego Busha młodszego” o globalnej dominacji, powracając do doktryny jego ojca – o przewadze handlowej. Po zakończeniu zimnej wojny (z woli jej uczestników), cały świat zajął się rywalizacją gospodarczą w ramach liberalnego systemu kapitalistycznego.
A dla większej pewności co do tego, że epoka konfrontacji ideologicznej jest już zakończona, prezydent Obama zbliżył się z Kubą i Iranem. Trzeba było zmniejszyć opozycyjność tych dwóch rewolucyjnych państw, które kwestionują nie tylko prymat Stanów Zjednoczonych, ale i zasady gry na arenie międzynarodowej. Nieuczciwość, jaką Stany Zjednoczone pokazały przy realizacji umowy 5+1, świadczy o tym, że nie chodziło im o irański program nuklearny, lecz jedynie o próbę przytrzymania na smyczy rewolucji chomeinistycznej.
To właśnie w tym kontekście następuje powrót do „doktryny Wolfowitza”, zgodnie z którą dobre są wszelkie środki, które służą okiełznaniu konkurentów, w tym także Unii Europejskiej [ 4 ]. Strategia ta, jak się wydaje, była korygowana w miarę rosnących obaw Waszyngtonu, obserwującego uważnie przebudzenie się Chin. Dlatego mówi się o strategicznym „zwrocie na Daleki Wschód"", który ma polegać na przerzuceniu tam wojsk z Bliskiego Wschodu, żeby kontrolować region dalekowschodni i powstrzymywać Chiny. I chociaż Pentagon nie wspomina już o szalonym neokonserwatywnym planie pokonania Chin, to jednak zamierza on ograniczyć rolę ekonomiczną tego państwa i nie dopuścić do rozszerzania się jego politycznych wpływów na świecie.
Jednakże to, co teraz widzimy jest zupełnym zaprzeczeniem strategii „zwrotu na Daleki Wschód”. Stany Zjednoczone z pewnością zwiększyły (nieznacznie) swoją obecność w regionie Azji i Pacyfiku, ale przede wszystkim zadbały o swoją silną obecność militarną w Europie Środkowej. A w czasie, gdy wojna wciąż szaleje w Palestynie, Jemenie, Syrii i Iraku, gdy zagraża nową pożogą Libii – zostaje rozpalony nowy konflikt na Ukrainie. Taki rozwój wydarzeń możemy zinterpretować na dwa sposoby.
Z jednej strony, możemy uznać, że zbliżanie się NATO do rosyjskich granic – i wojskowa reakcja Moskwy – niczym światu nie grozi. Rzeczywiście, angażowanie się w taki konflikt jest ryzykowne, a do tego zupełnie niepotrzebne. W takim wariancie, wojna na Ukrainie (wraz ze wszystkimi tymi sankcjami i kontr-sankcjami) nie będzie skierowana przeciwko Rosji, lecz będzie sztucznie sfabrykowaną – specjalnie dla Europy – projekcją rzekomego zagrożenia rosyjskiego, co pozwoli Stanom Zjednoczonym „bronić” swoich naiwnych sojuszników.
Lecz, patrząc z drugiej strony, dobrobyt gospodarczy Stanów Zjednoczonych opiera się na ich kontroli nad światowym handlem, a w konsekwencji – na utrzymaniu morskich dróg handlowych [ 5 ]. Zaś Rosja i Chiny, chcąc się rozwijać, pragną uwolnić się od amerykańskiej kurateli, a w konsekwencji muszą otworzyć kontynentalne szlaki handlowe. Taka jest istota projektu [przewodniczącego Chińskiej Republiki Ludowej] Xi Jinpinga, zakładającego budowę dwóch jedwabnych szlaków, z których jeden ma docierać, jak w czasach antycznych, przez Azję Środkową, Pakistan, Iran, Irak i Syrię do Morza Śródziemnego, a drugi ma prowadzić przez Rosję do Niemiec. Obie te drogi są dziś zablokowane: przez IPIS (ISIS) w Lewancie i przez Ukrainę w Europie.
Kwestia kontroli nad morskimi szlakami handlowymi stanowiła centralny punkt strategii amerykańskiej na początku XXI wieku, przy wsparciu piratów z Rogu Afryki [Półwyspu Somalijskiego] [ 6 ], a strategia ta skończyła się fiaskiem, gdy Moskwa i Pekin skierowały swoje okręty wojenne do tego regionu. Jednakże, mimo, iż Chiny mają do dyspozycji [od 2015 r.] dwukrotnie powiększone przez Egipt koryto Kanału Sueskiego, to przejście przez cieśninę Bab-el-Mandeb, pozostające oficjalnie pod kontrolą Republiki Dżibuti, kontrolowane jest w rzeczywistości przez Al-Kaidę za pośrednictwem Islamskiego Emiratu Mukalla [miasto Al-Mukalla na wybrzeżu Jemenu zostało zdobyte w kwietniu 2016 r. przez wojska Arabii Saudyjskiej – przyp. tłum.].
Oprócz kontroli morskich szlaków handlowych, należy też uwzględnić kontrolę nad operacjami finansowymi. W tym właśnie celu Ministerstwo Sprawiedliwości Stanów Zjednoczonych ogłosiło zasady, które Amerykanie starają się stopniowo narzucić bankom na całym świecie. Lecz tutaj także Rosja stworzyła swój własny system płatności Swift, natomiast Chiny zrezygnowały z wymienialności swojej waluty na dolary, by nie dać się skrępować amerykańskimi przepisami.
Jeżeli ta analiza jest prawidłowa, to wojny w Syrii i na Ukrainie trwać będą dopóty, dopóki Rosja i Chiny nie utorują sobie chociaż jednego bezpiecznego kontynentalnego szlaku handlowego do Europy Zachodniej. Właśnie w tym kontekście należy postrzegać wysiłki Stanów Zjednoczonych, podejmowane dla przeciągnięcia do ich obozu Białorusi, przeciwko której Amerykanie tak długo występowali. – Jest to jedyny sposób na poszerzenie ukraińskiej zapory i zbudowanie szczelnej przegrody pomiędzy Europą Zachodnią i Wschodnią.
Z tej perspektywy widzimy, że negocjacje handlowe, jakie Stany Zjednoczone prowadzą z Unią Europejską (TTIP) i państwami ASEAN (TPP) nie mają na celu umocnienia ich wymiany handlowej. Wręcz przeciwnie: ich celem jest wyeliminowanie z rynku Rosji i Chin. To niepojęte, że Europejczycy i Azjaci skupili się na wyborze standardów produkcyjnych, a nie na żądaniu udziału Rosji i Chin w tychże negocjacjach.
I wreszcie, końcowy wniosek jaki należy wyciągnąć z wywiadów Obamy dla „ The Atlantic ” sprowadza się do tego, że Stany Zjednoczone zamierzają odnowić swoje sojusze i dostosować je do nowej doktryny strategicznej. Dlatego np. popieranie reżimu Saudów, którzy gwarantowali dostawy ropy naftowej z Bliskiego Wschodu, nie jest już dla Amerykanów żadnym interesem i staje się nawet ciężarem. Podobnie jak „specjalne stosunki” z Wielką Brytanią, które niegdyś miały wielkie znaczenie dla warunków kontroli nad oceanami (Karta Atlantycka) i przy próbie ukształtowania świata jednobiegunowego (wojna w Iraku) – lecz dzisiaj nie są już żadnym konkretnym interesem i muszą być ponownie przemyślane. Nie wspominając już o kosztownym popieraniu Izraela, które nie służy już realizacji celów na Bliskim Wschodzie, i które może nie być kontynuowane, jeżeli Tel Awiw nie okaże się przydatny w innych częściach świata.
Powyższe uwagi nie uwzględniają obecnej kampanii prezydenckiej w USA, w której ścierają się: kompleks wojskowo-przemysłowy i ideologia WASP-owska, reprezentowane przez Hilarię Clinton, oraz, z drugiej strony, przemysł bankowych systemów płatności bezgotówkowej (toll industry) i zwolennicy umowy społecznej pt. „American dream”, reprezentowani przez Donalda Trumpa [ 7 ]. Agresywny charakter tej kampanii świadczy o konieczności przywrócenia równowagi między tymi siłami po okresie niepodzielnej dominacji militarystów (od 1995 r.).
Gdy obóz reprezentowany dzisiaj przez Trumpa wreszcie wygra, to powinniśmy zobaczyć zakończenie wojen [ 8 ], ale i erupcję despotycznego przymusu wnoszenia opłat z powodu istniejących patentów i praw autorskich. W przypadku zaś, gdy zwycięstwo tej grupy zostanie odsunięte w czasie, Stany Zjednoczone będą miały do czynienia z powstaniem rozwścieczonej ludności i zamieszkami. A wówczas przewidywanie polityki zagranicznej USA stanie się szczególnie trudne.

2944,Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump Is Not Qualified to Be President - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton declared herself the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee on Thursday and, looking to the fall election, said that her likely Republican rival, Donald J. Trump, was not qualified to be president. Asked by CNN’s Chris Cuomo whether Mr. Trump was qualified to hold the office they both seek, Mrs. Clinton declared emphatically, “No. ” She called the crash of an EgyptAir flight early Thursday an act of terrorism and went on to portray Mr. Trump as dangerously out of step with what a commander in chief would need to do to combat such attacks. She cited his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering American borders, his comments about diminishing the United States’ involvement in NATO and his remarks that he would negotiate directly with the North Korean dictator, Kim   as evidence of how “unmoored” Mr. Trump is on foreign policy. This month, when MSNBC asked a similar question, Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Trump had “given no indication that he understood the gravity of the responsibilities that go with being commander in chief. ” But she stopped short of emphatically declaring that he was unqualified. She did not mince words on Thursday, saying, “I have concluded he is not qualified to be president of the United States. ” In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Trump said that Mrs. Clinton was the candidate unqualified to president. “She has bad judgment,” Mr. Trump said in the statement, “and is unfit to serve as president at this delicate and difficult time in our country’s history. ” Mrs. Clinton’s statements come as she encounters a lingering threat for the Democratic nomination from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose supporters have become increasingly antagonistic toward her candidacy. Despite recent primary wins by Mr. Sanders, his path to the party’s nomination appears mathematically impossible, a fact Mrs. Clinton sought to make abundantly clear. “I will be the nominee of our party, Chris,” she told Mr. Cuomo. “There is no way I won’t be. ” On Thursday afternoon, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said in a statement that his candidate’s recent victories in Indiana, West Virginia and Oregon showed that voters there “respectfully disagreed with Secretary Clinton. ” He added, “We expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree,” and said that some polls showing Mr. Sanders faring better than Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Trump made it “clear that millions of Americans have growing doubts about the Clinton campaign. ” Throughout the interview, Mrs. Clinton appeared ready to put the primaries behind her and move on to Mr. Trump. Asked if she would consider naming Mr. Sanders her   nominee, in an effort to unify the party and bring in his liberal and young supporters, she demurred. “I think the thing that brings us together is Donald Trump,” she said. She declined to respond to Mr. Trump’s attacks on her husband, Bill Clinton, including an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night in which Mr. Trump brought up a   rape allegation against the former president. “I think people can judge his campaign for what it is,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I’m going to run my campaign. ” Asked if she had the urge to defend her family’s honor against the onslaught of attacks that will grow louder, Mrs. Clinton said: “No, not at all. I know that is exactly what he is fishing for, and I’m not going to be responding. ” The interview took place in Park Ridge, Ill. the Chicago suburb where Mrs. Clinton spent her childhood. Mr. Cuomo asked what advice her mother, Dorothy Rodham, would have given her in dealing with the likely battle that awaits her against an opponent unlike any she has confronted. “I think it would be the same advice that my mother always gave me,” Mrs. Clinton said. “Which is everybody gets knocked down and knocked around in life. The real test is whether you get up and keep going. ”",0

2946,Migrants Applying For Asylum in Australia from Middle East Camps Fail Security Checks,"Dozens of asylum seekers who applied for resettlement in Australia have been rejected after failing security checks or being deemed economic migrants rather than genuine refugees, according to Sky News. [Federal Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton told the Australian parliament that thirty applicants had been rejected after being red flagged by Five Eyes  —   the   intelligence sharing network formed by Britain, the U. S. Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.  “We have taken a long period of time to look at the biometrics and look at individual cases,” Mr. Dutton told Sky News. “We have excluded a large number of cases and I think we have ended up with people who are deserving of support, who were targeted by the IS particularly in Syria and Iraq. We’ve chosen people who will make a big contribution and who will want to educate their kids and integrate into Australian society. ” “We should be very pleased and proud as a nation that we have been able to help,” he said, claiming that Australian government has placed an emphasis on sheltering refugees from the Middle East’s embattled Christian and Yazidi minorities. “We were very clear when we set up this programme that we wanted to concentrate on persecuted minorities. Like the Yazidi women who have watched family members slaughtered, their sisters and daughters abducted and murdered these are genuine refugees. ” Australia has experienced a number of terror events since Islamic State proclaimed a worldwide caliphate under Abu Bakr   in June 2014. In September 2014, Abdul Numan Haider stabbed two police   officers in Endeavour Hills, Melbourne. In December 2014 Iranian migrant Man Haron Monis took 18 people hostage in a Sydney cafe, killing one after a long   before armed police stormed the premises. In October 2015   Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar shot and killed an unarmed police support worker at the News South Wales Police headquarters in Paramatta. At least another 15 major terrorist attacks have been foiled in Australia before they could take place since 2014.",0
2947,Conviction Against Brendan Dassey of ‘Making a Murderer’ Is Overturned - The New York Times,"A federal judge on Friday overturned the murder and sexual assault convictions of Brendan Dassey, one of the defendants whose case was the subject of the wildly popular Netflix documentary series, “Making a Murderer. ” Mr. Dassey, 26, must be released from prison within 90 days unless the authorities schedule a new trial, according to the order from a federal judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. In 2007, Mr. Dassey was convicted of participating in the murder and sexual assault of Teresa Halbach, a    photographer, and sentenced to life in prison. The   series by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, released in December, suggested that police investigators unfairly questioned Mr. Dassey, then 16, without a lawyer or parent present. It suggested he was mentally unfit, was coerced into a confession that he later recanted, and that his   lawyer, Len Kachinsky, was content to cut a deal. In the   court order, the judge, William E. Duffin, said state courts erred in finding that investigators never made Mr. Dassey promises during his interrogation on March 1, 2006. “The investigators repeatedly claimed to already know what happened on October 31 and assured Dassey that he had nothing to worry about,” Judge Duffin wrote. “These repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey’s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey’s confession involuntary under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. ” The documentary also questioned the conviction of Mr. Dassey’s uncle, Steven Avery, who was also convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Mr. Avery was not affected by the court order on Friday. “Today there was a major development for the subjects in our story and this recent news shows the criminal justice system at work,” Ms. Ricciardi and Ms. Demos said in a statement. “As we have done for the past 10 years, we will continue to document the story as it unfolds, and follow it wherever it may lead. ”",0
2948,"Ahead of Trump Presidency, Global Investors Sell Bonds and Grab Stocks - The New York Times","Global investors have rendered their verdict on Donald J. Trump as president: Sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent United States economy. From Indonesia to the United States, government bonds are undergoing a sharp   as investors  —   large sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds, as well as the accounts of American retirees  —   restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect will be a   Trump presidency. Across the board, the yields of these bonds, which move up as their prices decline, are pushing higher. The yield on the   United States Treasury note  —   a benchmark for mortgages and other lending rates  —   has risen to 2. 2 percent from 1. 5 percent in less than two months. For such a widely held and traded security, that is an unusually abrupt move. Other   bonds have had similar reactions. The yield on Germany’s   notes has gone to positive. In just a week, it has gone to 0. 35 percent from negative 0. 15 percent. And the Swiss   is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory. If the trend continues, it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent economists, like the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low growth, zero interest rates and deflation. A series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the election, including higher wages in the United States and signs of increased inflation in Europe. But what has resonated deeply with countless   investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is Mr. Trump’s promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy  —   in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts  —   away from global central banks. “It does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this way,” said Luciano Siracusano, chief investment strategist for WisdomTree asset management in New York. “This is a very   agenda, and we have not had that in a while. ” After the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central banks, investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on   government bonds. Until recently, it has been a   trade, with global growth stagnant, governments divided and political risk omnipresent. The numbers tell the story. According to J. P. Morgan, central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on $26 trillion in bonds, or 49 percent of the tradable market for these securities. That figure is up from 40 percent in 2002, and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation (political and economic) have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds. Most investors, and many policy makers as well, have become fed up with this   stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the United States but also in Europe and Japan. “Investors have been frustrated with the limits of monetary policy,” said Michael Zezas, a bond strategist with Morgan Stanley. “There has been a presumption of the necessity of fiscal stimulus. With a Trump presidency, the political rationale aligns with the economic rationale. ” Soaring bond yields are not the only way that this new “reflation trade” is playing out. Investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like copper, the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month. Bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest rates, which help their lending margins. Even the   stock price of Deutsche Bank, for example, has bounced back by nearly 20 percent in the last week. More broadly, the Standard  Poor’s   index gained 3. 8 percent last week, while on Monday, the major market measures ended largely flat. Of course, such an investment trend carries with it serious risks. If bond yields shoot up too starkly, investors in the stock market will get jittery and all the fast money that has recently piled into stocks could turn tail, leaving chaos in its wake. For example, $22 billion has poured into   funds that invest in the United States stock market in the last three days alone. Moreover, a sharp increase in bond market rates will put pressure on emerging markets, which have enjoyed a renaissance in recent months. Stock markets ranging from Brazil, India and Taiwan have been down sharply over the last week. The   fund that invests in these and similar countries and is the market’s truest gauge of sentiment toward developing markets is off more than 7 percent since Mr. Trump was elected. It is worth recalling that the   taper tantrum in 2013, when panicky global investors escaped en masse from most of the major developing economies, was driven by an expectation of higher interest rates and a strong dollar  —   which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now. A   inflationary surge could also force the Federal Reserve to be overly aggressive in raising rates, a dynamic that no investor wants to see. The trick, of course, for a Trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand and, in addition to pushing for a building boom, cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures. That could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control. For now, such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in Mr. Trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low growth, low interest rates and intense regulatory scrutiny, all of which pushed them into the safety and security of   government bonds. Some even suggest that a President Trump will not be unlike President Reagan in showing a devotion to bedrock   principles, even if many of those philosophies were called into question when American investment banks nearly torpedoed the global economy. “The global impact of this stuff is that once you start it, you can’t stop it,” said Arthur Laffer, a   evangelist who advised Ronald Reagan and was among a core group of economists who cobbled together Mr. Trump’s own   program. “That is the way it was with Reagan. ”",0
2950,"N.C.A.A. Tournament Reality: The Haves Get In, the Have-Nots Get Left Out - The New York Times","BUFFALO  —   Fans grumbled loudly last March when the N. C. A. A. men’s basketball tournament’s selection committee declined to include Monmouth in the field, and Commissioner Bernadette McGlade of the Atlantic 10 denounced St. Bonaventure’s snub, declaring herself “shocked” and saying, “It’s a tremendous disservice. ” This year, though, officials from midmajor programs and conferences  —   those outside the five autonomous leagues that dominate the top level of college football, plus the Big East  —   mustered little beyond shrugs for a field even more lacking in teams from their cohort, which supply the vast majority of Division I’s 351 members. They seem to have made peace, or at least a truce, with an indisputable reality: The midmajor team selected for an   berth is an endangered species. “The system is not designed to be totally fair,” Doug Elgin, the Missouri Valley Conference commissioner, said. “That’s the way of Division I basketball. It’s always been that way. ” Elgin once sat on the selection committee, and he currently serves on the men’s basketball oversight committee. “It’s not a complaint,” he added. “It is simply a statement about the current system. ” Elgin expressed respect for the “process and integrity” of the selection committee. That Illinois State, a member of his conference, did not receive a berth was “disappointing” but “understandable,” he said. “I’m not whining,” he said. “I’m just saying. ” The principle of equal access still exists: The tournament’s   field consists of the champions of the 32 Division I conferences  —   meaning all 351 teams begin the season with a chance  —   and the 36 “best” remaining teams. But for the event that most prominently symbolizes the N. C. A. A.’s     ethos  —   and that provides the vast majority of the association’s revenue  —   the trend line is striking. Midmajor teams received seven of those 36   bids in 2011, the year the tournament expanded to 68 teams. The next few years that number was 11, 11 and 10, before dropping back to seven again. Last year, there were six, this year four, and of the best four teams that did not make the cut, only one was a midmajor. “There seems to be a bias somewhat inherent in the structure,” Richard Ensor, the commissioner of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, said. It has become obvious that playing, and beating, other good teams is by far the most effective way to land in the committee’s good graces. The rating percentage index, or R. P. I. which situates teams’ winning percentages in the context of their schedules’ strengths, remains the committee’s primary mechanism for sorting teams. Since teams play the majority of their games   those in power conferences have more opportunities to notch quality wins. Cutting a swath through one’s midmajor league, by contrast, can prove insufficient by itself. Illinois State was   in M. V. C. play this season, but when it lost the conference tournament final to Wichita State, and didn’t have other quality wins to overcome that, it was out. The powerful influence of   quality wins can be seen most clearly in certain seeding choices. Wichita State was   and highly rated by advanced metrics that the N. C. A. A. has sought to embrace. Yet it beat just one tournament team  —   No. 16 South Dakota State  —   and wound up slotted on the No. 10 line, indicating that had it not won its tournament, it might not have qualified at all. Meanwhile, Gonzaga, another midmajor, was awarded a No. 1 seed not only for going   but for beating two eventual   champions and several other   squads. “You have to have something that gives you the opportunity to do some of those comparisons,” Mark Hollis, this year’s selection committee chairman, said. Hollis, of Michigan State, added, presumably in reference to scheduling and defeating tough nonconference competition, that “programs that have done it have been recognized and have been rewarded in the tournament process over the years. ” It is natural that the power conferences would receive a disproportionate share of   bids, since it is natural that they would produce more good teams tested against better competition. Wake Forest and Belmont, for example, have about the same enrollment, but only one receives tens of millions of dollars in annual conference payouts and plays North Carolina and Duke every year. Still, Cinderella’s carriage is probably not a permanent pumpkin. It has been less than a decade since a prominent midmajor, Butler, as a member of the Horizon League, made consecutive appearances in the national title game, and only four years since Wichita State mounted its own Final Four run. Some midmajors have become   whether via realignment (Butler joined the Big East) or sui generis achievement (Gonzaga). But those are the lucky few. Observers now describe a vicious cycle in which fewer   bids for leagues and teams lead to fewer resources and less exposure, leading to declines in recruiting and performance, leading to fewer   bids. The resources that come with tournament berths are not only abstract. In addition to standard   payouts, leagues receive “units” of roughly $250, 000 for each appearance a member makes in the tournament (one unit for a berth, a second if it wins its first game, and so on). Units from one appearance continue to pay for six years. There are also less immediately tangible benefits. For instance, Bloomberg found increases in donations to small colleges that pull off big upsets. “Getting selected has some significant impact on institutions, and even more on the smaller ones, like St. Bonaventure,” said the athletic director there, Tim Kenney. “You get financial benefit from the units. You get an increase in donations  —   having been part of schools that have won before, you definitely get an uptick  —   and you’re able to tell your story more. ” “It helps in recruiting,” Commissioner Amy Huchthausen of the America East Conference said. “All those downstream effects that can be generated from getting just two teams in are really helpful. ” Those few programs that have, against the odds, developed consistently competitive teams in midmajor conferences have their own challenges. Scheduling quality opponents frequently requires playing in their arenas, in a sport in which the home team wins   of the time, and playing excellent basketball in November and December, in a sport in which   teams can cohere over months, go on a run in February and March against their   league rivals and still scramble into the bracket. And since playing hungry, ascendant midmajors carries the substantial risk of a loss, few good teams see an upside in agreeing to the games. “The better you get, the more difficult it is to get   teams on your schedule,” Elgin said. “It’s a    game. ” Illinois State Coach Dan Muller devised a quintessentially 2017 mousetrap on Monday, tweeting at the power conferences that he wished to schedule games. Mississippi’s athletic director took the bait, tweeting back, “We’d love to match up. ” On Tuesday, Illinois State’s athletic director, Larry Lyons, said he hoped to find a mutually agreeable date. Reflecting on the larger problem, though, Lyons joined his compatriots in stolid resignation. “I wish I had a better answer for how to fix this,” he said, “but I don’t. ”",0
2951,The Art Market’s Reaction to Trump? Sales This Week Offer First Test - The New York Times,"At Rockefeller Center on Sunday, milling outside Christie’s sales rooms  —   where private clients sipped mimosas as they took in one of Monet’s grainstacks  —   people in the art world sounded guardedly optimistic about how the auctions will perform this week, after a period of uncertainty exacerbated by the contentious American presidential election, Britain’s “Brexit” vote in June and China’s slowing economy. “There has been a lot of insecurity and it’s hard to say exactly what will happen,” said Jay Gorney, a collector, curator and former dealer, predicting that “good things will do extremely well. ” The sales of Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art that start Monday offer the first test of how the art market will react to a Trump presidency and whether it will continue a softening trend that, for the past year, has had potential sellers reluctant to consign their best works. “If you’ve got something great, you don’t sell it because you’re uncertain what you’re going to get for it,” said J. Tomilson Hill, the vice chairman at the Blackstone Group and art collector, about the prevailing mood. “Sellers are largely sitting on their hands. ” The result is that each of the three major auction houses  —   Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips  —   are entering this week’s sales with fewer trophies of more than $20 million than they have had in the recent past. Over all, the estimated sales in postwar and contemporary art are half what they were last year. The evening auctions of postwar and contemporary art at the three houses, for example, are expected to draw about $536 million, compared with $1. 2 billion for the same auctions in November 2015. “They gathered the best material they could with a lot of sellers cautious and not willing to commit,” said Neal Meltzer, an art adviser. “Supply is the issue more than demand. ” In the days before the sales, collectors, art advisers and auction specialists were pointing to encouraging signs, citing the postelection stock market highs, the  “Brexit” London sales in June and Sotheby’s London auction of David Bowie’s art collection last week, which had a   rate of 100 percent and set new top prices for 59 artists. Moreover, many collectors are sanguine about the effects of Mr. Trump’s victory, both in the United States and around the world. “I feel great,” said the real estate developer Arnie Rosenshein. “I was for Donald Trump. ” Yet history suggests that single events rarely affect sales, art experts say. “The market has been pretty impervious to just about every event with the exception of the global meltdown of 2008,” said Robert Manley, who recently became Phillips’s new   of 20th century  contemporary art after 16 years at Christie’s. Donald B. Marron, a financier and longtime collector, said he expected the auctions to be largely business as usual. “Clearly this is a surprise and in one sense makes everybody cautious until they see how everything works,” Mr. Marron said. “On the other hand, if you want to judge by the markets, less regulation is seen as positive. My guess is, it will be like most auction seasons: good pictures will do well. ” Despite the challenging timing of the sales, the auction houses have managed to squeak out a few prizes. Sotheby’s secured Edvard Munch’s 1902 painting, “The Girls on the Bridge,” one of only two in private hands with this subject matter that is expected to sell in Monday night’s Impressionism and Modern auction for more than $50 million. It is one of only three works in the sale with a guarantee  —   a pledged minimum price the others are a Picasso and a van Gogh. The auction house also secured the collection of Steven and Ann Ames, New York arts patrons, for its Contemporary sale Thursday evening  —   albeit with the help of a $100 million guarantee. It includes two colorful paintings by Gerhard Richter (one from 1986 and one from 1988) each estimated at $20 million to $30 million. Christie’s’ highlights include a 1977 Willem de Kooning work, “Untitled XXV,” one of the artist’s large “pastoral” paintings, which is expected to sell for around $40 million on Tuesday night, at its Postwar and Contemporary sale. On Wednesday night, Christie’s Impressionist and Modern star lots include the Monet grainstack from 1891, which is expected to sell for more than $45 million, and a 1961 example of Jean Dubuffet’s Paris Circus series, estimated at $15 million to $20 million. Earlier the same night, Phillips has Mr. Richter’s “Düsenjager,” estimated at $25 million to $35 million, part of a small group of warplane pictures created between 1963 and 1964. (Paul Allen is the seller.) After Sunday’s brunch preview at Christie’s, not everyone came away impressed. “The estimates are 40 percent lower than last year,” said Jacques Seguin, a Swiss collector. “The electricity is not there. ” As for the auction houses, they say they learned from last year, when they priced estimates too high, and they are hopeful that the certainty of the election’s outcome could make some buyers more confident about bidding. “Some people are very happy with this result and will feel richer and more inclined to buy art, and some people will feel destabilized by the unknown and still more inclined to buy art,” said Simon Shaw, Sotheby’s worldwide   of Impressionist and Modern art. “There’s a lot of demand out there. ” So much demand, auction houses say, that in many cases sellers  —   including the undisclosed consignor of the de Kooning at Christie’s, for example  —   have declined guarantees. “They’re not in need of selling,” said Brett Gorvy, Christie’s worldwide chairman for postwar and contemporary art. “They’d rather have the painting back” if it doesn’t sell. Given a shortage of masterpieces, auction houses have been forced to get creative. Phillips is selling Roy Lichtenstein’s “Nudes in Mirror” (1994) which was slashed by a deranged woman in 2005 while on exhibition in Vienna. Typically, an auction house would play down that kind of damage to a painting. Instead, Phillips has produced a separate section of the catalog detailing its history. “It may not add to the value but it adds to the story,” Mr. Manley, of Phillips, said. “We’ll find out on Nov. 16 what the market thinks. ”",0
2952,E.P.A. Chief Doubts Consensus View of Climate Change - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said on Thursday that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming, a statement at odds with the established scientific consensus on climate change. Asked his views on the role of carbon dioxide, the   gas produced by burning fossil fuels, in increasing global warming, Mr. Pruitt said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” that “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. ” “But we don’t know that yet,” he added. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis. ” Mr. Pruitt’s statement contradicts decades of research and analysis by international scientific institutions and federal agencies, including the E. P. A. His remarks on Thursday, which were more categorical than similar testimony before the Senate, may also put him in conflict with laws and regulations that the E. P. A. is charged with enforcing. His statements appear to signal that the Trump administration intends not only to roll back President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, but also to wage a vigorous attack on their underlying legal and scientific basis. A report in 2013 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of about 2, 000 international scientists that reviews and summarizes climate science, found it to be “extremely likely” that more than half the global warming that occurred from 1951 to 2010 was a consequence of human emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A January report by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded, “The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 2. 0 degrees Fahrenheit (1. 1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other   emissions into the atmosphere. ” Benjamin D. Santer, a climate researcher at the Energy Department’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said, “Mr. Pruitt has claimed that carbon dioxide caused by human activity is not ‘the primary contributor to the global warming that we see.’ Mr. Pruitt is wrong. ” “The scientific community has studied this issue for decades,” Dr. Santer added. “The consensus message from many national and international assessments of the science is pretty simple: Natural factors can’t explain the size or patterns of observed warming. A large human influence on global climate is the best explanation for the warming we’ve measured and monitored. ” The basic science showing that carbon dioxide traps heat at the Earth’s surface dates to the 19th century, and has been confirmed in many thousands of experiments and observations since. Mr. Pruitt has faced frequent criticism for his close ties to fossil fuel companies. In his previous job as the attorney general of Oklahoma, he sought to use legal tools to fight environmental regulations on the oil and gas companies that are a major part of the state’s economy. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times found that energy lobbyists had drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. the Interior Department, the Office of Management and Budget and even Mr. Obama, outlining the economic hardship caused by the environmental rules. But in a sign of how far outside mainstream views Mr. Pruitt’s remarks on Thursday have placed him, even executives of some of the nation’s largest fossil fuel producers said they were surprised by his comments. Interviewed at CERAweek, an annual conference of major energy producers this week in Houston, Wael Sawan, an executive vice president at Shell Energy Resources, said he was “absolutely convinced CO2 can cause serious damage to not only this generation but future generations. ” Mr. Pruitt spoke at the Houston energy conference on Thursday afternoon in a session moderated by Daniel Yergin, a prominent energy economist and a member of a White House advisory panel. Mr. Yergin did not ask Mr. Pruitt any questions about his remarks from Thursday morning, saying later that he had been unaware of the comments when interviewing him. Mr. Pruitt did not clarify his comments or respond to reporters who sought to question him. He said at the energy conference that the Obama administration had gone too far with some environmental rules and that he intended to work more closely with industry and individual states to address pollution issues. “The future ain’t what it used to be at the E. P. A. ,” he said. Mr. Pruitt’s remarks come as the Trump administration prepares to roll back Mr. Obama’s two signature policies to address global warming: a pair of sweeping regulations intended to curb carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles and power plant smokestacks. At the same time, the White House is considering a 17 percent cut to the budget of NOAA, one of the nation’s premier agencies of climate science research, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post. Mr. Pruitt’s remarks on Thursday were consistent with his past public statements questioning the established science of   climate change, but in denying the role played by carbon dioxide, they go a step further. In addition to putting him at odds with the consensus of climate scientists, Mr. Pruitt’s remarks also raise the possibility that, as the Trump administration moves forward with unwinding Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations, it could put the administration in violation of federal law. In 2009, the E. P. A. released a legal opinion known as an endangerment finding concluding that, because of its contribution to global warming, carbon dioxide in large amounts met the Clean Air Act’s definition of a pollutant that harms human health. Under the terms of the Clean Air Act, one of the nation’s most powerful environmental laws, all such pollutants must be regulated by the E. P. A. A federal court upheld the finding, and the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to it. Thus the E. P. A. remains obligated to regulate carbon dioxide. In his Senate hearing, Mr. Pruitt said that as administrator of the E. P. A. he would not revisit that 2009 legal finding. “It is there, and it needs to be enforced and respected,” Mr. Pruitt said. But energy lobbyists close to the Trump administration have since urged the new administration to consider building a legal case against the endangerment finding. Advisers to Mr. Trump’s transition team said they read Mr. Pruitt’s remarks as a signal that he intends to do just that. “President Trump’s campaign commitment was to undo President Obama’s entire climate edifice,” said Myron Ebell, who worked on Mr. Trump’s E. P. A. transition team but has no role in policy making. “They’re thinking through the whole thing, and based on what Scott Pruitt said this morning, I do think they are looking at reopening the endangerment finding. ” Mr. Trump is expected to announce an executive order next week directing Mr. Pruitt to begin the legal process of unwinding the climate change regulations on emissions from power plants.",0
2953,Virgil: The Deep State Strikes Again with Rachel Maddow Department of Homeland Security Leak,"A few days ago, under the headline, “The Department of Homeland Security Takes on President Trump,” Virgil took note of a leak from the department, observing that the Deep State is “Always doing something . . . to undermine the Trump administration. ”[Now, thanks to another leak from DHS, it’s time for an update: On March 2, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow had a scoop —  paid for, of course, by American taxpayers.  Media Matters for America, the lefty outfit founded by David Brock, wrote up the segment under the headline, “Rachel Maddow Exclusive Debunks ‘Extreme Vetting’ Propaganda Of Muslim Ban. ”   Maddow begins by saying, “Now tonight, we have got this, this is another leaked report. ”  It was a document dated March 1, apparently written by DHS’ Office of Intelligence and Analysis.  Maddow pointed to a graphic of the document, highlighting the words “for official use only. ” In other words, the viewer was getting the good stuff.   Further describing the paper, she added: It was coordinated with Customs and Border Protection, State Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement —  ICE, National Counterterrorism Center, and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The immediate question that comes to mind, of course, is: Is the paper for real?  Could it be a fake?  Maddow said it was genuine:  I’m not going to tell you how we got it, but the Department of Homeland Security has tonight confirmed to us that this is authentic, that this is real. Here Virgil might pause to make a point: He finds it curious that DHS would be in such a hurry to confirm the document’s authenticity.  Did the   people, having been contacted by Maddow, demand to see the original so that they could study it, word for word?  After all, it’s possible to imagine that it could have been a hybrid document —  that is, part real, part fake, with, maybe, some sneaky interpolations aimed at making an   point.   Moreover, a close look at the actual document, including watermarks or metadata, might have helped authorities to identify the leaker.  And why, in any case, was DHS in such a hurry to help out MSNBC?  Why confirm it on a deadline?   Is that the Trump administration policy —   to serve, in effect, as a   for the MSM?  To facilitate the work of leakers, and “leakees”?  Did anyone think about saying to MSNBC, “No comment”?  Or even, “The possession of a such a document, by anyone outside of the Department, is a violation.  So you’ll soon be hearing from law enforcement wondering how you got it”?  Given that none of that seems to have happened, is Virgil too paranoid if he suspects that maybe at least some among the DHS   staff are happy to see items leaking out?  Now of course, Virgil presumes that the leaking,   confirming, was the work of Deep Statists —  that is, career staffers, as opposed to Trump appointees.  And in fairness to the new Trump people, they haven’t had a whole lot of time to put their own operation together.  Still, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly was confirmed to his post on January 20, six weeks ago.  And he spent more than four decades in the Marines, including time at the Pentagon —  so he knows his way around a bureaucracy. So Virgil might ask: When does Team Trump plan on getting control of the DHS career staff?  Today?  Tomorrow?  Never?  Meanwhile, let’s take a closer look at the document in question.  It was entitled, “Most     Violent Extremists Radicalized After Entering Homeland. ”  And then Maddow got to her meat:  Oh, and what’s the key finding here?  What’s the key judgment here?  This is it, “We assess that most     violent extremists likely radicalized several years after their entry into the United States, limiting the ability of screening and vetting officials to prevent their entry because of national security concerns. ” And then to Maddow’s conclusion: Since the radicalization of   newcomers couldn’t be judged or predicted, there was no point in even trying —  just let ‘em all in.  As Maddow put it: Oh, right, so much for extreme vetting, right?  The whole justification, the whole explanation from this administration for the Muslim ban was to stop people coming into this country, at least for a while, right?  At least for a while, it’s a temporary travel ban so we can get the extreme vetting, In other words, Maddow seems to be saying, if we’re operating from ignorance, as to who’s a potential threat, then the best thing to do is operate from even more ignorance.   We can observe: Not everyone agrees with the DHS leakers that it’s hopeless to assess danger and who could be dangerous.  In fact, lots of good cops would say otherwise, and common sense says the same thing.  Meanwhile, even if Maddow, relying on that DHS paper, is correct about   “unknown knowns. ” There’s still such a thing as retrospective analysis —  that is, examining the data, whatever it might be, after the fact, in order to identify correlations and patterns.  That sort of analysis can then be used to build better predictive models.  But of course, first you have to have the data hence the value of   at every opportunity —  including at the entrance door.    Of course, Maddow’s mission the other night was something much different: She wanted to put yet another knife into “extreme vetting” and what she called “the Muslim ban”:  I look at this, and you know what I think? I think the Muslim ban is dead. Maddow is referring, of course, to Trump’s January 27 Executive Order, the one that has been clobbered by the MSM and waylaid by the courts.  That order was never a “Muslim ban” but, rather, an attempt to restrict entry from seven countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.  Indeed, the word “Muslim” doesn’t even appear in Trump’s document the phrase “Muslim ban” was applied by opponents, not proponents.  To be sure, the idea of some sort of restriction on potentially dangerous people was a key element of Trump’s campaign.  As candidate Trump said back in December 2015: Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.  That is to say, it’s part of the reason why he is now the 45th President.  And in fact, Trump’s instincts about homeland security have ample justification, even if the Deep State doesn’t agree.   According to the Pew Center, for example, public opinion in the Muslim world shows considerable support for Sharia law and other radical ideas, including terroristic violence.  Indeed, our friend common sense tells us that the experience of traveling to the US from a village, in say, Yemen, can be, to put it mildly, psychologically disorienting.   In fact, a recent   illustrating this   has gone viral.  It shows two people on the subway: on the left, a woman in a niqab —  that is, a   veil, including the face —  and on the right, a drag queen, glammed up to the max, with flaming red hair, dressed in short shorts, long legs akimbo.  The woman in the niqab seemed placid enough as she sits next to the drag queen, but one can only guess the impact on, for instance, a hormonal young man from a repressed culture.     Actually, we can do more than guess as to what can happen. We can review recent history, which is littered with cases of younger Muslims, mostly male, acting violently in America:  We can note that each incident was slightly different. The Tsarnaevs were born in the former Soviet Union and spent their lives within the US welfare system before plotting  .  Abdulazeez was born in Kuwait before moving to the US he had a job.  And of the two San Bernardino shooters, Farook —  who worked for the same county government that he then massacred —  was born in the US of Pakistani parents, while Malik was born in Pakistan, having gained lawful permanent residence in the US not long before she started killing Americans.  And Mateen, the Orlando shooter, born in New York, was of Afghan heritage.    So we can see: Some were born in the US, some not.  Some seemed to have issues of mental illness,   and drug abuse, and confusion over sexual identity.  Some were single, some were married, and some were married with children.    About the only thing that unites the four cases is that the perpetrators were Muslim.  So at the risk of being   correct, that fact would seem to suggest the general area where the search for greater public safety could begin.  Yet, of course, Maddow and her allies on the left don’t concur they insist on seeing the issue only through the lens of their own PC.  And to preserve the plausibility of their increasingly stressed PC worldview, lefties are willing to play   —  or, some might say, twist the truth.  This verbal gamesmanship from the   at Vox, trashing Trump’s January 27 order, is typical: None of the perpetrators of the major US terrorist attacks carried out in the name of Islam in the past 15 years have come from the nations on that list.  [emphasis added]  Yes, we can pause over that slyly insinuated word, “major. ” Because in fact, at least two attacks in the last decade, in North Carolina and in Ohio, were carried out by individuals from the targeted countries.  But evidently, homicidalists’ plowing vehicles into pedestrians counts only as “minor. ” Speaking of   we can return to that DHS document, the one on Maddow’s program, asserting that dangerous radicalism often emerges only after an immigrant had lived here for a while, thus “limiting” the value of vetting, extreme or otherwise.  So we must ask: If we aren’t sure who, precisely, could be dangerous, doesn’t that suggest a general strategy of caution?  Mightn’t we look, for example, at the fate of Europe —  where there have been tens of thousands of murders, and other serious crimes, at the hands of   terrorists —  and start drawing some obvious conclusions? With that thought in mind, perhaps the Department of Homeland Security could contact  Rachel Maddow and volunteer to go on her show with just that message: Better safe than sorry.   Maybe the DHS   team could actually seize an opportunity to advance the Trump agenda.  But would Maddow even agree to such a booking?  That’s an unknown.  All we know for sure is that the Deep Statists at DHS, and their friends at MSNBC, know exactly how to connect with each other. ",0
2954,Adelson boosts Trump with $25 million to defeat Clinton,"Adelson boosts Trump with $25 million to defeat Clinton 
American-Jewish billionaire Sheldon Adelson has reportedly given $25 million to a super PAC dedicated to defeating Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
Just a couple of weeks ago Adelson was frustrated with Donald Trump’s “lack of focus” and misdirected attacks at fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan. However, Fox News reported Monday that the casino magnate had added $25 million to the millions he’d already donated to Trump’s campaign. The report also indicated he may give more by the end of the week. 
His change of heart reportedly came in the wake of FBI Director James Comey’s announcement Friday that the bureau had discovered hundreds of thousands of emails that may be relevant to the bureau’s ongoing investigation into Clinton’s possible misuse of emails, and timing may indicate that Adelson now believes the GOP candidate has a real shot at winning the election. 
The donation, described to Fox News as a “massive” amount of money to be spent in the final week of the campaign, was given to Future 45, a pro-Trump super PAC. Future 45’s latest ad argues that the Democratic nominee cannot be trusted with the presidency as the Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars from regimes around the world that persecute women and minorities. 
A source told Fox News that Adelson is considering contributing up to $25 million more as the White House race enters its final few days. 
In May, Adelson bucked a substantial number of Republican Jews who opposed Trump — even though by that time it was clear he would be the party’s presidential nominee — endorsing the pugnacious real estate magnate and reality TV star and appealing to other top Republican Jewish donors to follow suit. 
The New York Times reported at the time that Adelson was prepared to spend up to $100 million to elect Trump, a greater sum than he has invested in previous elections. 
In the following months, however, Adelson seemed to sour on Trump, instead focusing on congressional races amid fears of the Republicans losing control of Congress due to Trump’s weak polling numbers and numerous controversial statements. He gave at least $40 million to super PACs focused solely on the fight for Congress, and the $10 million he initially dedicated to a pro-Trump super PAC was spent only on advertising in states with competitive Senate races. 
Trump’s campaign has been plagued by charges of anti-Semitism, racism and sexism, and the nominee has been accused of running a divisive, hate-driven campaign. 
Adelson is a prominent donor to Jewish causes and a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

2955,Goldman-Sachs Says an Asteroid Mining Rush Is Coming - Breitbart,"  made its case for mining platinum in space in a   note to its clients. [According to the Business Insider report, Noah Poponak and a team of analysts have made a forceful argument for the costs versus benefits of chipping platinum from roaming asteroids:  While the psychological barrier to mining asteroids is high, the actual financial and technological barriers are far lower. Prospecting probes can likely be built for tens of millions of dollars each and Caltech has suggested an   spacecraft could cost $2. 6bn. They’re not wrong. Where once it could cost a whopping $35 million to put a single person in orbit, Virgin Galactic will soon be doing the same thing for about $250, 000. $2. 6 billion also isn’t that crazy when compared to the roughly $1 billion for a mine on our own planet. And if that’s not convincing enough, consider that even choosing a relatively small asteroid could yield between $25 and $50 billion worth of platinum: Space mining could be more realistic than perceived. Water and platinum group metals that are abundant on asteroids are highly disruptive from a technological and economic standpoint. Water is easily converted into rocket fuel, and can even be used unaltered as a propellant. Ultimately being able to stockpile the fuel in LEO [low earth orbit] would be a game changer for how we access space. And platinum is platinum. According to a 2012 Reuters interview with Planetary Resources, a single asteroid the size of a football field could contain $  $50bn worth of platinum. There’s only one real downside, and it’s a problem on the inverse: Access to that much platinum would essentially destroy its value. Poponak and his team estimate that “successful asteroid mining would likely crater the global price of platinum, with a single    asteroid containing nearly 175X the global output, according to MIT’s Mission 2016. ” Yes, you read that right: that single asteroid could produce 175 times the platinum of every other mine on Earth combined. The report concludes that the project could be even less expensive than estimated, “given trends in the cost of manufacturing spacecraft and improvements in technology. ” And finally, that “given the [capital expenditure] of mining operations on Earth, we think that financing a space mission is not outside the realm of possibility. ” It is virtually inevitable that such a mining venture will occur, and the first to accomplish it will essentially seize control of the global platinum market. Only one question remains: Who will it be? Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",0
2956,UAE Arrests Foreign Couple for Premarital Sex After Doctor Discovers Pregnancy,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has arrested a South   engaged couple on “adultery” charges after a doctor discovered the    was pregnant. [As reported by the UK Independent:  The South African man and his Ukranian fiancee were reportedly arrested after a doctor in Abu Dhabi who treated Ms Nohai for stomach cramps discovered she was pregnant. Emlyn Culverwell‚ 29, and Iryna Nohai, 27, have not yet been charged by authorities in the Islamic country, who are reportedly still investigating. South Africa’s foreign ministry said it was unable to help the couple as it is a matter of domestic UAE law, the South African News24 website reports. Mr Culverwell’s mother, Linda, said she was unable to get any answers from either the authorities in Abu Dhabi, the South African Embassy in the UAE or the South African consulate there. The company Culverwell works for informed his family that Nohai would have to undergo further testing before charges were filed, to determine precisely how long she has been sexually active. This prompted Culverwell’s mother to exclaim, “For heaven’s sake, how can they supposedly determine that?” The Independent explains that all sex outside marriage is technically illegal in the UAE, but normally the law is not vigorously enforced against Western couples who live together. Such couples do, however, run into trouble if an unmarried woman gives birth, or even if a married woman has a baby that appears to have been conceived before the date on her marriage certificate. Unmarried sex is considered adultery in the Emirates and carries a penalty of at least one year in prison. Custody of children can be removed from women found to have engaged in adulterous relationships. In one of the more notorious cases, a British woman who reported she had been raped by two men in Dubai was charged with illegal extramarital sex, but the charges were dropped after an international outcry. A 2015 report by the BBC found that hundreds of women are imprisoned in the UAE after being accused of extramarital sex, including migrant workers who have been sexually abused. Some of them were sentenced to flogging as well as prison time, although the BBC found no evidence that the floggings were actually carried out.",0
2957,All Eyes Are on Chris Christie as Trial in Bridge Scandal Starts - The New York Times,"It might be easy to forget, now that he has endorsed and defended Donald J. Trump to the ridicule and anger of fellow Republicans he called friends, that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was himself once a leading, if not the leading, presidential hopeful in his party. Then came revelations of a scheme so preposterous that it was hard to believe: Aides to the governor had deliberately created a traffic jam at the world’s busiest bridge as political payback. The trial in the George Washington Bridge   scandal, which is scheduled to open on Thursday with jury selection, will play out like a documentary on the rise and fall of Mr. Christie’s presidential ambitions, a   tale of how he and his aides built his administration and his 2013   campaign with an eye to winning the White House, then scrambled to contain the damage as inquiries into the lane closings began to wreck those hopes. Mr. Christie has not been charged. But he will loom large in the story laid out by both sides in the courtroom. The governor is expected to be on a list of people who federal prosecutors say knew about the scheme to create gridlock in order to punish a mayor who had declined to endorse him. And while prosecutors have fought back against a defense lawyer’s assertion that the case is “criminalizing normal politics,” their argument in court filings is that the lane closings were precisely that: normal politics. At least, normal Christie politics  —   aggressively transactional and focused above all on winning. In the prosecutors’ portrayal  —   and defense lawyers do not really disagree  —   the Christie administration treated the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the $8    bistate agency that operates the bridge, as an arm of the governor’s campaign for a second term, using it to cajole mayors into endorsing Mr. Christie and to discipline them if they did not. An entire department of the governor’s office was focused on gaining the support of local officials, as Mr. Christie sought the sort of landslide victory that would allow him to argue that he was the Republican best able to take the White House. “It offers a glimpse at the kind of machinations that went into shaping a candidate with national ambitions,” said Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor of political science and law at Montclair State University. “Not just all of the kind of   inside politics that many people find really distasteful, but the enormous extent to which the administration would flex its muscles to paint Chris Christie as this candidate that had such broad appeal. ” Nearly three years after the mystery of the lane closings captivated New Jersey, the trial will finally answer big questions. Perhaps biggest of all: When and how did Mr. Christie know about the plan, as the prosecution’s star witness has said he did? And who else was involved? Mr. Christie was always expected to coast to victory in his 2013   bid. But he wanted to break the record set by his mentor, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who won   with 69 percent of the vote. And he wanted to demonstrate to national Republicans that he could win crossover support from women, Hispanics, black voters and Democrats, even in a state where they far outnumber Republicans. Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, the town on the New Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge, was 47th on a list of 100 Democratic mayors that the Christie administration was especially hoping to win over. On Aug. 13, 2013, after confirming with an aide who had tried to court the mayor that he was not going to support Mr. Christie, Bridget Anne Kelly, a deputy chief of staff to the governor, sent an email to David Wildstein, a Christie ally at the Port Authority: “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee. ” They waited a month  —   to achieve maximum impact, prosecutors say  —   until the first day of school, in a week that included Yom Kippur and the Sept. 11 anniversary, and closed two of the three access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge. They did not tell local officials, who were soon overwhelmed by traffic, with ambulances, school buses and commuters gridlocked for hours. Mr. Wildstein went to the bridge to admire his handiwork in person, and texted Ms. Kelly about children stuck on buses. “Is it wrong that I am smiling?” she replied. As drivers fumed, the Port Authority police instructed them to call Mayor Sokolich, who in turn called, emailed and texted Bill Baroni, Mr. Christie’s top appointee at the Port Authority. Mr. Baroni refused to respond, as did the governor’s office. “Radio silence,” Mr. Wildstein wrote to Mr. Christie’s campaign manager. The lanes were closed for four days, until the executive director of the Port Authority, an appointee of New York’s governor, discovered a query from a traffic columnist about the delays and ordered the lanes reopened. That November, Mr. Christie won his huge margin of victory, with 60 percent, though he fell short of Mr. Kean’s record. In his victory speech, he urged Washington to learn from his electoral success. But reporters, and the State Legislature, which Democrats control, continued to press questions about the bridge. The governor’s office and Port Authority officials said the lane closings were part of a traffic study Mr. Baroni told a legislative committee that not telling the mayor or local police had been a “communications breakdown. ” That story came apart in January 2014, when a legislative subpoena revealed Ms. Kelly’s email. Mr. Wildstein began to cooperate with federal prosecutors, and pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy against civil rights. Ms. Kelly and Mr. Baroni were indicted later the same day. Mr. Wildstein will be the witness to watch during their trial, at the federal courthouse in Newark. Once the author of a widely read and widely feared (and anonymous) political blog, he was hired to be a kind of enforcer at the Port Authority, as New Jersey sought to take back some of the power Mr. Christie believed had been shifted to New York. Court filings suggest that Mr. Wildstein will help the government establish the traffic jam as part of a pattern of retribution. Christie officials had punished another Democratic mayor, Steven Fulop of Jersey City (No. 34 on the administration’s list of 100 mayors) after he reneged on what they thought was a deal to support the governor. Mayor Fulop had represented a Port Authority tenant in its bid to get a lease extension. Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Baroni had helped him get the terms he wanted and Mr. Christie’s campaign manager urged them to “continue throwing the   name around when discussing this with him,” so the mayor would understand that the governor had helped him, and expected help in return. When Mr. Fulop told the Christie campaign he would not give his endorsement, the administration canceled a special “mayor’s day” of meetings between Mr. Fulop and   Port Authority and Christie administration officials. Mr. Wildstein also said early on that “evidence exists” that Mr. Christie knew about the lane closings as they were happening. Court filings suggest that at least part of that evidence may be photographs of Mr. Christie laughing with Mr. Baroni and Mr. Wildstein at a Sept. 11 memorial service that week, during which, Mr. Wildstein has said, the lane closings were discussed. “The photos will provide corroboration,” a court filing explains, before proceeding into a lengthy redaction. The names of other unindicted    —   people who joined in the conspiracy but are not charged  —   are likely to come out at the trial. There is another list, of people who knew about the conspiracy but did not join in it, which almost certainly includes Mr. Christie. It was unclear whether that means the governor knew about the plot before it began, as he has strenuously denied, or while it was going on, which he has vacillated about in his public comments. Mr. Christie did not respond to requests for comment about the list. And lawyers for Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly have said the two were hardly alone in planning the scheme or covering it up. In court papers, Mr. Baroni’s lawyer pointed out that Mr. Christie acknowledged, in an internal report on the lane closings, that canceling the meetings with Mr. Fulop had been his idea. The lawyer also revealed a text from another witness expected to testify for the government, Christina Genovese Renna, to a Christie campaign aide, sent during a January 2014 news conference when the governor said his senior staff and campaign chief, Bill Stepien, did not know about the lane closings. “He just   lied about senior staff and Stepien not being involved,” Ms. Renna wrote. (Mr. Christie and Mr. Stepien’s lawyer say this does not prove any involvement.) Ms. Kelly, in her only public statement after the indictment, said it was absurd to suggest that she would act on her own to order the lane closings or cover them up. In her lawyer’s telling, the governor’s office was less worried about figuring out what had happened with the lane closings  —   the senior staff all knew exactly what happened, they say  —   and more concerned with figuring out what evidence existed, and how it might damage Mr. Christie’s national ambitions. It did. Significantly. Mr. Christie’s approval ratings in New Jersey, commanding when he was   in 2013, fell, and they have lagged at record lows since the bridge scandal. Speaking to reporters last month, Mr. Christie played down the importance of the trial. “I know you guys all hope for this story to go on forever,” he said. “But unfortunately for you, I suspect by the time we get to October or so, it will finally be over. ” Opening arguments are scheduled for Sept. 19.",0
2958,"Turkey Referendum: Opposition Parties Cry Fraud, Demand Recount of ’Yes’ Vote","Turkey’s opposition parties are demanding a recount following Sunday’s referendum to install a presidential system of government greatly expanding the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. [The Republican People’s Party (CHP) the secularist main opposition party, has demanded a recount. On Sunday, the Turkish newspaper Sabah, which typically published   stories, reported that the CHP would seek recounts of up to 40 percent of the votes cast, alleging that bribery and intimidation had occurred to keep the “yes” votes high. Reuters had reported the CHP’s recount demands to be higher  —   a 60 percent vote recount  —   arguing that a number of unverified ballots had made their way into the vote totals.  The Turkish Supreme Election Board (YSK) the electoral oversight agency, had announced it would count as valid unverified ballots lacking an official YSK stamp required from the voting stations, unless individual claims of fraud arose against them. “This referendum will always be remembered as illegitimate,” CHP deputy leader Bülent Tezcan argued on Monda. “The only way to end ongoing discussions over the referendum’s legitimacy is to annul it. What is necessary is the annulment of this referendum. ” Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the CHP, also condemned the move to validate ballots after they are counted. “You cannot change the laws of the game during the match,” he argued. “The electoral body has made the referendum’s legitimacy disputed. ” Hurriyet cites CHP leaders who say they are building a case, including video of suspicious activity at voting stations, to bring to both the YSK and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The Democratic People’s Party (HDP) a   leftist party, will also contest the results. “There were ballot papers without stamps on their backs. This shows no commitment to the laws of the election process,” HDP spokesperson Osman Baydemir protested, estimating that more than 600 ballot boxes that the YSK ended up counting were “illegal” because of their improper lack of stamping. The stridently   HDP entered the referendum vote at a greater disadvantage than any other party. After the Turkish Parliament elected to strip HDP members of legislative immunity, police arrested the party’s   Figen Yüksekdağ and Selahattin Demirtaş, on charges of “aiding terrorism” by allegedly supporting Kurdish separatist groups. Another dozen HDP members were arrested in November along with Yüksekdağ and Demirtaş. The Organization for Security and   in Europe (OSCE) which sent international observers to follow the election, has already condemned the vote as illegitimate. “We observed the misuse of state resources, as well as the obstruction of ‘no’ campaign events. The campaign rhetoric was tarnished by some senior officials equating ‘no’ supporters with terrorist sympathizers,” Tana de Zulueta, who observed the election on the group’s behalf, said. Cezar Florin Preda, another observer, argued the referendum “took place on an unlevel playing field and the two sides of the campaign did not have equal opportunities. ” Even before Sunday’s election, Erdogan had reportedly condemned the OSCE for meddling in Turkish affairs. “The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says if the result is ‘yes,’ that means there are a lot of problems. Who are you?” Erdogan asked on Saturday, according to Iran’s   PressTV. “First of all, you should know your place. This is not your duty. ” Official Turkish government numbers showed Erdogan’s push for a presidential system won by 51. 4 percent of the vote, with an estimated 48. 6 percent of the country voting “no. ” Electoral maps showed Erdogan winning big in the nation’s heartland and suburban areas, but the “no” vote sweeping the big cities  —   Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir  —   and the largely Kurdish Southeast. Following his victory, Erdogan delivered a speech praising the country: “For the first time in the republic’s history, Turkey changed its governmental system through civilian means. ” He added that efforts to “belittle” the election results would “be in vain. ”",0
2959,Mother And Daughter Remind MSNBC Reporter That Trump Has Black Supporters,"Sharpton Attacks O’Keefe, So O’Keefe Releases Brutal Expose on Sharpton… BOOM! 
If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire, though, MSNBC is by far my favorite — and trust me, a year-and-a-half of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the left-slanting morass. 
MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet — or, at the very least, another culture, a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness. 
This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what I’m talking about perfectly. He had found a mother and daughter in line, apparently for early voting. They were also African-American, which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult, by liberal media standards.   
However, when he asked them about criticism of Trump’s African-American outreach, the mother and daughter blew him out of the water. 
“Well, I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans,” Trina, the daughter, told MSNBC. “He’s trying to address a problem. It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong, and you have a plan that wants to help people.” 
“That’s what a president should do for us. He should reach out and try to help people and address problems that’s going on in our country.” 
“Some of the criticisms have been about (Trump’s pitch to minority voters) ‘What do you have to lose?’” Rascon said to Gloria, the mother. “What do you think about that criticism?”  ",0
2960,Poll: Public Overwhelmingly Supports Trump Push to Limit Migration - Breitbart,"Donald Trump’s   immigration reform is getting strong majority support from the public, despite the left’s portrayal of the policy as hateful and incompetent, and despite Democratic voters’ determination to obstruct the new president. [Reuters commissioned the poll and then tried to hide the resulting good news for Trump under a misleading headline, “Exclusive: Only a third of Americans think Trump’s travel ban will make them more safe. ”  But the most direct question in the poll showed a   advantage for Trump’s policy, of 48 percent support to 41 percent opposition.  However, that      “blocking refugees and banning people” question is an unreliable guide because most Americans want to help both their fellow Americans and foreign strangers. Also, Americans’ generous attitude ensures that they are often reluctant to display favoritism to their fellow nationals or opposition to foreign migrants, so pollsters often use indirect questions to tease out their hidden views. One indirect question used by Reuters’ pollster asked if the United States should “limit the number of refugees allowed into the country. ” That question scored 66 percent support to 26 percent opposition, showing overwhelming yet hidden support for Trump’s new policy of welcoming a limited inflow of refugees while excluding hostile migrants.  Better still for Trump, the “strong” support for his   policy was three times as large as the “strong” opposition, 32 percent to 10 percent, and the GOP voters’ response was very similar to the response from   independents. Trump’s policy has ignited a debate on refugee inflows from Muslim majority countries. But the core part of Trump’s policy is a shift towards rejection of   migrants whose culture and ideas are hostile to Americans’ traditions of personal independence and small government. Here is the critical passage from Trump’s   immigration policy: In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including “honor” killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. The American public’s contradictory emotions slide in various directions, depending on minor changes to questions. For example, when asked by Reuters’ pollster if the U. S. should “open our borders to refugees of foreign conflicts,” the percentage of respondents strongly supporting an apparently unlimited number of refugees jumped up to 19 percent, almost double the 10 percent in the prior “limit the number of refugees” question.  That question and answer suggests that Americans do not recognize the “open borders” term as a     for mass migration by 100 million people from Africa, Arabia and Asia. The new poll was conducted by Ipsos polling, from Jan. 30 to Jan. 31, on behalf Thomson Reuters. It included roughly 1, 201 adults, with 453 declared Democrats, 478 declared Republicans, and 149 declared independents. Many polls show that the public wants the federal government to cap or shrink immigration. For example, a September poll by Ipsos showed that only 12 percent of respondents strongly opposed plans to “change the legal immigration system to limit legal immigration. ” Four times as many, or 57 percent, back reductions in legal immigration, while 13 percent did not take a position. In 2016, under policies set by President Barack Obama, roughly one new immigrant or foreign   joined the U. S. workforce for every two Americans who entered the workforce.

2961,WWN Guide To Blowing Your Hand Off With A Firework,"0 Add Comment 
SOME people fail to plan their purchase and use of fireworks to such an extent that they don’t have the most basic knowledge on how to blow their hand or the hand of a friend, family member or stranger off. 
Luckily WWN has compiled a handy guide on the matter, leaving no one in doubt as to how to make counting to 10 on your hands that much harder. 
Where to buy 
If you want to guarantee your hand will be blown off, any lad selling fireworks out of the back of a van should do the trick. Not only are the prices low, but he will enforce a strict ‘if you lose a finger, I’ll be fucked if it’s my fault’ policy. 
Name brands 
Make sure to buy cheap name brands with the fake CE quality mark. The less it looks like the really trustworthy brand’s logo the better. And if your local firework merchant has the latest ‘massive yoke and that makes a huge bang and that’ from China, be sure to purchase 10 and strap them together. 
Don’t go up the North 
The drive up can be a hassle, there’s a lad we know, who knows the lad selling them out the back of his van, you’d be mad to buy them in an actual shop. 
Cut the fuse shorter to add a bit of danger into your life 
The fuses on fireworks and bangers are notoriously long, the wait for the bang and fizz can be agonising. Why not add the threat of a life changing injury into proceedings and reduce that fuse. 
Still don’t feel the buzz of the danger? 
You could always glue that firework to your hand before lighting it.",0
2962,Clinton Campaign Says FBI Has “Double Standards” as Podesta’s Bestie Runs the New DoJ Email Investigation,"
When I was reading the news this morning, I discovered a quote that was so very ironic, I wanted to think that it was satire.
But it wasn’t.
The Clinton campaign had the audacity to say that the FBI has double standards.
“It is impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. He also called on Mr Comey to “immediately explain this incongruence and apply the same standard to Donald Trump’s associates as he has applied to Hillary Clinton’s.” ( source )
BWHAHAHA.
LOL.
ROTFL.
Excuse me, I can’t stop laughing…a nervous, manic kind of laughter that also makes one of my eyes twitch.
Why?
This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to pull in young voters and calling them “F*&$ing dumb” behind their backs. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who is trying to connect with the American people at the same time as saying she has no clue about real life due to her background. This is coming from the spokesperson of a woman who preaches honesty and integrity and practices neither, saying in a paid speech that sometimes you have to lie. I have never heard a more ridiculous, two-faced audacious comment in my whole life. And considering I write about politics, I’ve heard a lot over the years.
Speaking of double standards, did you hear the latest about the re-opened email investigation? 
The incestuous connection between the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice continues. The person in charge of the new investigation is none other than Peter Kadzik. Kadzik has a long history with both the Clinton family and campaign manager John Podesta.
And by long, I mean…
Kadzik represented John Podesta after he perjured himself during the Monica Lewinsky case Kadzik lobbied for Marc Rich, a fugitive that was pardoned by then-President Bill Clinton Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch as Attorney General Kadzik had a celebratory dinner with Podesta the day after the Benghazi hearings Kadzik denied a request from Republicans to appoint special counsel in the last Clinton email investigation Kadzik and Podesta appear from Wikileaks to be the best of friends, celebrating birthdays and other occasions together Those are some of the links between Kadzik and Clintonland – check out this very thorough report on Zero Hedge for all of the details.
Can you imagine the hue and cry if Donald Trump’s nearest and dearest ran the investigation about his alleged links with Russia? How is this possibly okay?
Open letter to Peter Kadzik 
After stumbling across Kadzik’s email address in an online group (by the way, it’s pkadzik@gmail.com – don’t they every learn about email security?) I sent this very polite email suggesting that he recuse himself from the investigation.
Dear Mr. Kadzik:
When I learned that you were to be the person in charge of the investigation into Huma Abedin and her emails, I was curious to learn about your connections. With just a teeny tiny bit of Googling, I was aghast to discover that you have a close friendship with John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager.I was further discomfited by the fact that you have direct connections with the Obamas and the Clintons themselves.
While I’m sure you take your job very seriously, it seems to me a direct conflict of interest for you to handle this investigation. I strongly urge you to do the right thing and recuse yourself from overseeing this investigation. If you find the emails without merit, there was always be a cloud over your findings due to your close connections with the Clintons, President Obama, and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.
Please hand this over to independent investigators who can do this job without the appearance of bias.
Sincerely,
Daisy Luther

2963,VP Mike Pence Tells U.S. Naval Academy Grads the ‘Best Way to Ensure Peace’ - Breitbart,"Vice President Mike Pence delivered words of encouragement to the class of 2017 at the United States Naval Academy on Friday. He told them to look toward their future, to write a heroic story of service, selflessness, and leadership with their lives, and that President Donald Trump is the best friend the armed forces of the United States will ever have. [“People follow people they trust,” said Pence. He admonished the graduates to cultivate in themselves what he considers to be among the most important qualities of leadership: “humility, orientation to authority, and  . ”  He told them to consider others more important than themselves and to be servant leaders. As for the president, Pence said, “President Donald Trump is the best friend the armed forces of the United States will ever have,” promising the graduates that no matter where they serve, Trump will always have their backs. He said that he and the President pledge to provide the armed forces with the resources they need. “Let me be clear, the era of budget cuts of the armed forces of the United States is over,” said Pence. He mentioned the $54 billion increase in defense spending in the President’s FY2018 budget, noting that a portion is allocated to “rebuild[ing] the Navy with 8 new battle force ships headed for the sea. ” The Vice President stated that President Trump is reaffirming America’s role as leader of the free world. While we must always work and hope and pray for peace. The best way to ensure peace is for our adversaries and our enemies to know America is prepared to lead and fight and win any contest, any struggle, anywhere on behalf of freedom. He told the graduates that they will be the “instruments of American policy. ” President Trump is currently on his first trip overseas as president, visiting Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican. While in Saudi Arabia, Trump pushed for countries to fight against terrorism, mentioning terror 31 times in his speech to Arab leaders. Pence commented that just yesterday the Navy conducted Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea. The Vice President urged the graduates to “act every day not for self, but for country. ” Pence encouraged the graduates, “if you’re of a mind, have faith that He who planted this miracle of Democracy on these wilderness shores and has seen her through every trial and has seen you through the challenges of the last four years, will never leave you, never forsake you and that no matter where your path may lead, He will always be there to calm the storm and guide you home. ” He concluded, “May God bless you with fair winds and following seas. God bless the Navy and the Marines and God bless the United States of America. ” Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
2964,"Your Wednesday Briefing: Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, iPhone - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Electoral map shrinks for Sanders and Cruz. After Donald J. Trump’s sweep of five primaries in Eastern states on Tuesday, and Hillary Clinton’s victories in four of five, there are few chances for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders to catch up in the delegate count. Here are our takeaways and what the candidates said after the results. Both   are looking ahead to the general election. Mr. Trump is giving a speech on foreign policy in Washington today, while Mrs. Clinton is sharpening her pitch for November. • On Capitol Hill. The Senate is near a deal for at least $1. 1 billion to fight the Zika virus, but the measure faces resistance from House Republicans. Despite lawmakers’ bickering, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, can point to some legislative victories, complete with Democratic support. • Sentencing for former House speaker. J. Dennis Hastert, 74, the   Republican House speaker in history, is expected to be sentenced today in federal court, after pleading guilty last year to a banking violation tied to accusations of sexual abuse. One of his accusers is suing him for $1. 8 million, the money he had been promised as compensation for the abuse. • Taking their lumps. Apple posted its first quarterly decline in revenue in 13 years, hurt by a drop in iPhone sales in China, the company’s most important market after the U. S. The restaurant chain Chipotle had its first quarterly loss as a public company, and Exxon Mobil was stripped of its top credit rating for the first time since the Great Depression. • At the Supreme Court. The justices will consider an appeal today from Bob McDonnell, the former Virginia governor who was convicted of public corruption for trading political favors for gifts and loans. The case could produce a major ruling placing limits on bribery laws. In a    decision on Tuesday, they said it was unconstitutional to demote a police officer based on the mistaken assumption that he had engaged in political activity. • Iraq in turmoil. Iraq’s Parliament has begun voting on a cabinet after protesters demanded government reforms and leaders untainted by corruption or sectarian connections. The political stalemate and the drop in prices of oil, the country’s main source of revenue, aren’t helping the effort to defeat Islamic State militants. • Police playbook gains a chapter. Police departments around the U. S. are turning to crisis intervention training in response to   shootings of people with mental illnesses.   percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder. Separately, John R. Kasich often speaks about mental health on the campaign trail, and as his brother, Rick, has struggled with bipolar disorder. Rick Kasich gave us his first extended interview. •  A Volkswagen executive’s 2006 PowerPoint presentation laid out a strategy for rigging pollution tests. • Comcast is in talks to buy DreamWorks Animation, the boutique studio run by Jeffrey Katzenberg. • The founder of Chobani, a yogurt maker, surprised his 2, 000   employees with shares worth up to 10 percent of the company. • Here are snapshots of the U. S. and global markets. • Prince left no will, sister says. In newly filed court documents, the musician’s sister says that he died without a spouse, children or surviving parents, and that he had no will. That will surely complicate his financial estate and musical legacy, which includes a trove of unreleased songs. • Gaining new insights. Runners now have an exact schedule that will predict how their performance will decline as they age. Police officers are using artworks in museums to sharpen their ability to notice details. • Scoreboard. The Toronto Raptors and Atlanta Hawks are each one win away from advancing in the N. B. A. playoffs after their victories on Tuesday night. There were no N. H. L. games, which meant hockey players could work on having a good night’s sleep. • U. S. math scores decline. The average performance of the nation’s high school seniors dropped in math from 2013 to 2015, but it held steady in reading, according to results of a test released today. • Recipes of the day. Make a big batch of   oatmeal and you’ll have breakfast for days. Radish sandwiches are great for lunch or   hors d’oeuvres. Or try this classic tuna sandwich. While some Americans may snicker at snooker, it’s one of Britain’s most popular games, with millions who play and who watch live coverage on the BBC, and it’s growing in countries like China. The annual World Snooker Championship continues this week in Sheffield, England. The   winner Ronnie O’Sullivan was eliminated on Tuesday. Like cricket, another British creation, it has complicated rules. Snooker uses a larger table, and narrower pockets than the older game of billiards. It’s played with 15 red balls, a white cue ball and six balls of other colors. In short, once all 15 red balls have been pocketed, the colored balls  —   each worth a different number of points  —   must be sunk in a specific order. A “snooker” occurs when a player’s cue ball gets boxed in and can’t make contact with the ball he is next supposed to sink without fouling. The game was invented in 1875 by a British military officer stationed in India named Neville Chamberlain (no, not that Neville Chamberlain). At the time, the word snooker was a derisive term for a new cadet. The game is believed to have adopted the name because of the cadets’ susceptibility to crafty play.

2965,Exposed: Stunning CNN Super Damage Control In Response To “Damning” Videos (VIDEO),"in: Mainstream Media , Multimedia , Propaganda , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , US News “There is no evidence that anything described on these tapes actually took place”– CNN News Analyst, Gloria Borger Now is the greatest time ever to wake up politically to what is really happening in America and in the world. It’s the perfect time to wake up and see the corrupt ruling elite in action and in real-time. Mass deception is at an all-time high. Every day the deceivers speak on TV, boldly telling us more and more lies without shame. Your enslavement is at stake and they are the chosen mouthpieces to make this happen. These master deceivers and sorcerers are the reason humanity is where it is today. They are the reason why the 9/11 criminals got away with it and they are the reason for the post-9/11 march toward the new world order that we are in now. They (the deceptive mainstream media) are the reason for the alternative media and for the truth movement. I’m sure most readers already know this very well. It only follows then that historic revelations and leaks of corruption and lawlessness call for historic lies, deceit and counter propaganda in order to implement some level of damage control. And frankly that is exactly what we are seeing coming from CNN and the rest of the (Hillary supporting liberal left) corporate media in response to the recent Project Veritas Action bombshell revelation of corruption videos produced by James O’Keefe. The video tells a very clear story of corruption going all the way up to the DNC and now Hillary herself. The video conversation cannot expose Hillary and the DNC any more right? We’re all thinking, there is no way around these very damning videos right? Actually, there is one thing about the ruling elite and their play-along stooges, there is no situation, no accusation, no video or audio proof, no firsthand testimony, no form of evidence that is too much for them to outright deny, discredit, downplay, ignore or deflect. None whatsoever. So as truth seekers, rather than getting upset with the tactics employed by the criminal elite and their minions, let’s admire them and list them for all of us to see. The following are just some of the excuses and tactics being employed by the talking heads; in this case I will only quote two individuals from a recent CNN panel discussing the topic of the new revelations of Clinton, DNC corruption. First there’s Gloria Borger- CNN Chief Political Analyst who appears to be the “expert” propagandist being rolled out in front of the CNN cameras. The other being Van Jones- Clinton supporter and former Obama senior adviser. The quotes from these two individuals are not just a display of propaganda but examples of professional political damage control. That is, lies to keep the masses confused and in the dark to what is really happening: Below are some of Gloria Borger’s recent statements followed by my responses. 1- “We don’t know where the video was gotten” Since when does CNN carefully check their sources? Truth seekers that challenge the mainstream media’s sources all the time get accused of being “conspiracy theorists”, of “harassing” fake victim’s families and they get treated like criminals. All that aside, sorry Borger, but the source of the video is not the issue here to begin with. What is seen happening in the video and what is being said in the video is the main issue. We’re talking about DNC-Hillary associated criminals talking in front of the camera about things no one is supposed to know about corruption inside the Hillary-DNC team but now they do. 2- “We don’t know how it (the video) was edited” With this statement, senior CNN political analyst Gloria Borger attempts to push the conspiracy (without her actually saying it) that perhaps these videos are a fabrication with carefully constructed fake voice-overs, perhaps photoshopped images and video special effects that make this situation look like it’s really happening when it’s not. You know. The kind of stuff that THEY (the controllers) would do. Again, the authenticity of the video is not the issue. Remember this is the same CNN that tried to sell us on the laughable Bin Laden death hoax videos of 2011 and the fake ISIS beheadings in 2014. Did CNN question the authenticity of these videos? Now all of sudden all videos are hoaxes until somehow confirmed by CNN to be “authentic”. This may quietly be the most stunning thing Borger says here. Notice how they are slowly ushering a world where a firsthand video produced by we-the-people or the average person which SHOWS you their corruption is by default not “authentic” until proven otherwise by them (the mainstream media)! 3- “There are so many unanswered questions to this story” Really? What unanswered questions? This is Borger’s way of suggesting that there is a pile of “questions” out there that are not being asked that would immediately change the context of the reality of these damning videos. Of course we’re never told what are these “questions”. It’s like they are borrowing this term from the truth movement to defend themselves. When critical thinking truth seekers say they (we) have “questions” our questions are concrete and definitive. Borger thus floats the idea of “unanswered questions” without the need to be specific knowing that the concept of having “questions” sounds fundamentally very reasonable. 4- “You see this story, um, it first appears in Breitbart…” Again, Borger is appealing to the viewers emotions and hearts instead of their critical thinking mind by resorting to the notion that if the story first appeared on a website that our viewers are told not to believe or trust (“one of our enemies”) then the whole story is questionable solely on this premise. These are all tactics from a pro who knows how to twist the narrative to deceive the viewers who follow them. Of course Borger knows she’s blowing smoke at her viewers and that attacking the messengers in this case has no merit given the context of these videos but that’s all part of the propaganda tactic. 5- “I think however this is a story that needs a lot more reporting on it” As mentioned earlier, Borger is implying without actually saying it that since CNN or the Hillary-mainstream complex hasn’t acknowledged the videos then as a whole we are far from the point of being able to say these videos and thus the evidence in the videos are authentic. Because of this previously suggested delusional lie Borger adds to the point by suggesting that THEREFORE “a lot more reporting” needs to be done. In other words she’s saying- yeah, we’ve seen the videos but since CNN hasn’t approved it yet, who knows how real it actually is ? Now here is a statement made by Van Jones who adds his own layer of super damage control propaganda: 6 – Jones states that because the report comes from James O’Keefe that ALONE (get this) is “reason to withhold judgment”! Throughout the CNN report O’Keefe is repeatedly referred to as “discredited” and a “criminal” by several members of the CNN panel including Democratic strategist Maria Cardona and CNN Senior Investigative Correspondent Drew Griffin who tries to sound official when he announces the DNC official response that: 7 –“There is no evidence that anything described on these tapes actually took place” It’s amazing how the professional liars attempt to side-step reality in a generation (today in 2016) where the ruling elite are desperately trying to keep the masses dumbed-down smack in the middle of a historic information age where all corruption is now being fully revealed. How do you side-step reality under these circumstances? Question the authenticity of any evidence that exposes what you are doing. This is apparently the strategy including brushing off the revelations as “locker room talk” , another new term we can expect to see used much more frequently in the future (including “bar room talk” etc). The “locker room talk” tactic allows them to take anything said on camera and insert it into this imaginary box, the “locker room talk” box. The sheep will accept the new term not even knowing why. Because it’s what George Orwell described as newspeak . This was the biggest thing that jumped out at me after watching this CNN segment posted by Project Veritas Action. It doesn’t matter how much corruption and evil they (we) expose. We now know exactly how the establishment will respond every time. They will question the authenticity of that new revelation, they will demonize the messenger who exposes them, they will look to press criminal charges if possible on whoever exposes them, and they will present the evidence as “unproven” until they themselves approve of it. Then they will ratchet up their own counter “leaks” and allegations (beware, we should be expecting a huge counter propaganda move very soon!!) as a counterattack and to distract the public from the Clinton leaks that are coming out seemingly every day now. This, my friends, is how professional political propaganda works. This is similar to the careful skill and delicacy involved in the “plausible deniability” tactic described by Scott Foval in the recent videos. It’s subtle and it’s a skillful way of doing something without showing the strings that connect to the puppet master giving the orders, in this case Hillary and the DNC. What all of this means is that it really is time for everyone to wake up and realize once and for all that the mainstream media is constantly lying to us and we can’t expect them to turn on their own kind. We can’t expect the mainstream media to take our side and help us expose the corruption when they themselves are a large part of that corruption. It really is time to spread this awareness and to truly prepare for a new paradigm which is already well underway. Let’s signal to these liars at CNN that they are exposed and their time is coming. There is too much goodness in humanity for the dark and oppressive mainstream media led machine to continue doing what its doing to humanity. Their lies and deceit must be exposed. Endless wars must stop. The US empire and their global propaganda and information control must be acknowledged for what it is. Thankfully, one of the little things all of us can control which is very effective is our ability to share this information and help spread it across the globe. Let’s do that! Submit your review",0

2967,Nanny State Health Warning: Burnt Toast Can Give You Cancer - Breitbart,"Don’t eat burnt toast or fish ‘n’ chips or over crispy roast potatoes  —   or you may end up getting cancer, a UK government agency has warned. [According to the   warning by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued today in a campaign launched on its website, these foods should be avoided because they all contain higher levels of acrylamide, a chemical which has caused cancer in mice.  The campaign  —   called Go For Gold  —   says that acrylamide is produced when starchy foods such as bread and potatoes are cooked for long periods at higher temperatures such as baking, frying, grilling, toasting, and roasting. The FSA claims: The scientific consensus is that acrylamide has the potential to cause cancer in humans. Which, according to its critics, is precisely the kind of      junk science which gives      junk science a bad name. As Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs says, this is a classic case of “mission creep” from a government agency. “They should be dealing with real safety issues like the handful of restaurants who are putting out genuinely dangerous food,” he said. “This sort of thing undermines public faith in scientific advice and terrifies people. “People just don’t know what to eat anymore because they’re not being given clear advice. ” Indeed. Neither Cancer Research UK nor the European Food Standards Agency have been able to find a major health risk issue, despite their best efforts. The quango was set up in 2000 under Tony Blair in response to a spate of food poisonings in restaurants. Few would argue that ensuring basic standards of hygiene and safety in the food supply is a legitimate public health goal, but the FSA soon got bored of that and became part of the nanny state. Amongst its dubious achievements are telling football fans to substitute sparkling water and grapes for beer and crisps when watching the World Cup, defining cheese as ‘junk food’ and lobbying for bans on advertising. It is a classic example of bureaucratic expansion. As its mission crept, its budget grew, and although it has been trimmed somewhat in the era of   austerity its annual income exceeds £130 million and it apparently still has time to tell people not to fluff their roast potatoes.",0

2969,California Today: How Badly Do You Want That New Rail Line? - The New York Times,"Good morning. We’re trying something new this week: California Today, a morning update for our California readers. Tell us what you’d like to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com Across California, public transit agencies are pushing ballot measures in search of money for just about everything related to transit: new rail lines, highway widening and even pothole filling. Santa Clara County will vote in November on a   sales tax to finance transportation projects. Similar measures will be on the ballot in Sacramento County and, very likely, San Diego County. Possibly several other Bay Area counties as well. Los Angeles County decided last week to put a   tax on the ballot for the third time in just eight years. These small sales tax increases have become perhaps the only realistic way to pay for ambitious transportation projects, said Brian D. Taylor, a professor of urban planning at U. C. L. A. “Voters and elected officials have become very hostile to increases in fuel taxes,” he said. In 2008, voters in Los Angeles approved a   sales tax increase for 30 years. That has financed projects like the   rail line connecting downtown to the beach, which just opened. (Never mind that the trip is often still faster by car.) Four years later, voters rejected a plan to extend that Los Angeles County sales tax another 30 years. Now we’re headed to the ballot box again  —   only this time, the sales tax hike would be permanent. • With concerns about climate change growing, Oakland banned the transport and storage of large coal shipments, halting a plan to a use a former Army base to ship coal to China and other overseas markets. • After last week’s Supreme Court ruling, will undocumented immigrants in California, and around the country, go back to avoiding the authorities?

Now, the Center for Biological Diversity wants to bring the bears back to the California. Grizzly bears are endangered. In the continental United States, they live only in Yellowstone National Park and a few other remote locations. The bears, the group said, would not be running around downtown San Francisco. They could be safely reintroduced in the remote Sierra Nevada. On its website, the group describes grizzlies as eating mostly nuts, berries, fish and small animals, and only “the occasional person who pokes a camera in their face. ” (Not exactly reassuring.) This past week, a black bear, known as a skittish animal, clawed its way into a tent and scratched a man who was camping about 30 miles from Los Angeles. Grizzlies are far larger and more aggressive than black bears. For now, federal and state officials, convinced that a   grizzly bear would eventually end up in a campground, have not yet shown interest in bringing them back.

2972,Ukraine just officially declared itself an illegitimate state up for grabs,"October 27, 2016 -  By Eduard Popov for Fort Russ - translated by J. Arnoldski - 


Last week, an event occurred capable of revolutionizing not only Ukraine, but all of Eastern and part of Central Europe. On October 20th, the Ukrainian parliament adopted the Declaration of Memory and Solidarity of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland and Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. This document condemned the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and modern Russian policy and remarked that “the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact concluded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany led to the Second World War.” 
Let’s set aside pseudo-scholarly interpretations of what is officially called the Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact but is more famously known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. This agreement was preceded by Western countries’ (England and France’s) unprecedented concessions to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. These included the betrayal of Czechoslovakia by the Munich Agreement (which British Prime Minister Chamberlain praised as “peace for our time”) followed by the invasion of the country in late September 1938 by the troops of Hitler’s Germany, Poland, and Hungary. Stalin’s USSR (of which I am no supporter) consistently sought to create a common European system of defense against Hitler’s Germany in contrast to the USSR of Lenin and Trotsky which in the early 1920’s sought to bring revolutionary war to Europe. But England, the chief architect of interwar Europe, deliberately pushed Hitler to the East for the Third Reich and Soviet Union to collide.  
As early as 1934, the foreign policy leaders of the Second Polish Republic had concluded a nonaggression pact with Germany 5 years before the analogous agreement concluded by the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but refused to sign a nonaggression pact with the USSR. Poland paid for its anti-Soviet (in fact anti-Russian) policies and complicity in the occupation of Czechoslovakia with the loss of its independence and enormous human losses. England paid for such with a one-on-one war with Hitler’s Germany that lasted a whole year, during which only the insular island position of the English saved them from German occupation. Soviet Russia paid for this with the bloodiest war in its history, from which it emerged as the victor and liberator of all of Europe. The leaders of today’s Europe are not inclined to gratitude towards Russia for its historic mission and the millions of Russians who laid down their lives on the altar of European freedom. 
Ukraine, a state which can count only a quarter century of existence, has no historical tradition, historical memory, nor strategic thinking. Thus, its current establishment is incapable of even thinking about the immediate consequences of its resolution on the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. And these consequences will be very bitter for Ukraine. 
Today’s Poland is already talking about restitution, i.e., the return of Poles’ property in the Kresy, i.e., the eastern lands which belonged to Poland before the Second World War and amount to 5 regions of modern Ukraine (Galicia and Volyn) and Western Belarus and Lithuania. By condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Ukraine is automatically condemning its sovereignty over 5 western regions therin recognized as illegally seized from Poland.  
Not so long ago, Verkhovna Rada Speaker Parubiy called for a visa regime to be introduced with Russia, thereby depriving 5 million Ukrainian “guest workers” of bread and solid earnings. The consequences of the Rada’s resolution on October 20th go even further by questioning the territorial borders of contemporary Ukraine, of which President Putin once said half belong to Russia and half to Eastern Europe. 
The condemnation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact done to curry favor with the Poles is not Ukraine shooting itself in the foot, but shooting itself in the head to spite its Russian neighbor.  
Poles will undoubtedly take advantage of Ukrainians’ fantastic foolishness and will one day demand that their lands be returned, in particular Lvov, their “Cemetery of Eaglets” that is so sacred to Poles’ historical memory. They will also demand their territorial share of Czech Republic, the lands of Transcarpathian Rus that they lost in 1945 and are now Ukraine’s, Romanian Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina which were annexed in 1940 and transferred to Soviet Ukraine, and Hungary’s part of Transcarpathia, now also part of Ukraine. All of these lands were acquired by Ukraine thanks to Stalin’s Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, who has now been condemned by the Verkhovna Rada as the initiator of the Second World War.  
Ukraine’s state actors, being so devoid of any historical and state experience and tradition, do not bother to look so “far” (beyond their own noses) into the future. The issue of territorial claims being raised against Ukraine by its current allies in the West is only a matter of time. As long as the West needs Ukraine as a springboard for war against Russia, Ukraine’s sovereignty over its western territories criminally acquired thanks to Stalin and Molotov will not be challenged. But as soon as the situation changes, the West will suddenly “remember” the territory of Soviet Ukraine, which today’s successor state of Ukraine has called “the totalitarian USSR”, and demand that its historical debts be paid off. 

This will concern not only Ukrainians, but also Belarusians, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Romanians, and Russians. The Ukrainians have launched a domino effect whose consequences will be felt across all of Europe.

2974,Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis,"Former DEA Prescription Head Drops a BombShell — Congress Protects Big Pharma & Fuels Opioid Crisis   Source: Claire Bernish Congress would rather protect the profits of pharmaceutical companies than the health of those addicted to dangerous opioid drugs, says a former head of the DEA responsible for preventing abuse of medications. 
Joseph Rannazzisi, former Deputy Assistant Administrator at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, asserts Big Pharma and its lobbyists have a “stranglehold” on legislators in Congress and have engineered the protection of a $9 billion per year industry over the health of American citizens, according to a report from the Guardian . 
“Congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive,” he said, according to the outlet. “As long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists, nothing’s going to change.” 
Rannazzisi explained lobbyists have spent millions thwarting legislative and policy efforts to provide guidelines for reducing the prescribing of opioid medications closely related to heroin — and helped limit the DEA’s powers to discipline those who dispense unusually high dosages of the same. 
A pharmacist himself, Rannazzisi severely criticized lawmakers he claims hold a double standard — publicly vowing to combat the opioid epidemic, while essentially working on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to ensure the industry’s profits. 
“These congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re-election, it’s a sham,” he told the Guardian . “The congressmen and senators who are championing this fight, the ones who really believe in what they’re doing, their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence.” 
With the unique insight of having been an insider, Rannazzisi excoriated the duplicity evidenced between legislators’ public lamentation of addiction and deaths from the opioid crisis during election years, and private efforts to protect drugmakers from liability. 
And he would know. According to Rannazzisi’s LinkedIn profile, as Chief of Diversion, he had been tasked with “oversight and control of all regulatory compliance inspections and civil and criminal investigations of approximately 1.6 million DEA registrants”— but if the standards are lowered by Congress to allow greater leeway in prescribing opioids, the threshold of criminality is raised. 
As the Guardian points out, legislation to fight the opioid epidemic, Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act , did, in fact, pass in July — but partisan controversy erupted when Republicans failed to provide funding to give the law sharp teeth. Democrats then issued a report titled “ Dying Waiting for Treatment ” in response, which “likened the Republican response to the opioid crisis to ‘using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam.’” 
Indeed the report sharply criticized the bill, equating its policies to ‘empty promises’ for the lack of financial follow-through. 
As the Washington Post detailed in a report earlier this month, the DEA launched an aggressive campaign to rein in distribution of opioids by pharmaceutical manufacturers to illegal ‘pill mills’ and corrupt pharmacies, who cared little whether the drugs wound up on the streets. 
Headed by Rannazzisi, the Office of Diversion Control sent investigators into the field, and began issuing hefty fines and filing lawsuits against the distributors responsible for the proliferation of opioids on the streets. 
But the disproportionately powerful pharmaceutical industry — fearing a potential significant loss in profits — fought back. Hard. 
According to the Post , the deputy attorney general summoned Rannazzisi to a meeting in 2012, concerning the cases of two unnamed major drug companies. 
“That meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that’s all that meeting was about,” the now-retired DEA official told the Post . 
Then, in 2014, came what constituted a hand out to the pharmaceutical industry by the Department of Justice and congressional legislators: the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act — legislation initiated by the Healthcare Distribution Management Association — the industry group representing distributors at the heart of the controversy. 
An analysis of lobbying records by the Post found “the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016.” 
Rannazzisi argued his case to congressional staffers in a phone conference in July 2014, and recalled telling them, “This bill passes the way it’s written we won’t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won’t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations.” 
Stunned at the massive — and ultimately successful — effort to take the bite out of DEA attempts to hold distributors and drugmakers responsible for their role in an epidemic estimated to take 19,000 lives every year, Rannazzisi likened the legislation to a “free pass” for legal drug pushers. 
“This doesn’t ensure patient access and it doesn’t help drug enforcement at all,” he told the Guardian. “What this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process. What this bill does is take away DEA’s ability to go after a pharmacist, a wholesaler, manufacturer or distributor.” 
“This was a gift. A gift to the industry,” he added. 
After heading the diversion office for a decade, Rannazzisi retired in 2015 — likely disgusted over legislators’ dedication to the legal drug industry, rather than the people whose interests they’re ostensibly obligated to protect. 
“The bill passed because ‘Big Pharma’ wanted it to pass,” he told the Guardian in no uncertain terms. “The DEA is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency. When I was in charge what I tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and they’re not going to like being regulated.” 
Big Pharma relies overwhelmingly on lobbyists filling the coffers of politicians to ensure they ignore the crisis gripping the nation. As the Center for Public Integrity found , the Guardian noted, Purdue Pharma — at the heart of the epidemic for its highly-addictive drug introduced in the late 1990s, OxyContin — spent a breathtaking $740 million in the last ten years on congressional lobbying efforts. 
However, Big Pharma’s power to influence policy and legislation extends far beyond simple but effective lobbying — the government-run Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee (IPRCC) has been accused by Sen. Ron Wyden of being a tool to “weaken” CDC guidelines for limiting overprescribing of opioids. 
Wyden wrote to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell of his concerns the IPRCC had been staffed with ‘experts’ with conflicts of interest for their close ties to Big Pharma, including a scientist with a $1.5 million endowment from Purdue, reported the Guardian . 
“You’ve got a panel that’s certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing. That’s something you’ve got to root out,” Wyden asserted . “The role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly. Science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests.” 
Families of countless addicts and victims of the opioid industry would undoubtedly find the direct influence of Big Pharma’s pro-opioid cash appalling — yet it continues to this day. Policies and legislation have not yet been given the appropriate funding needed to effectively combat the problem, which swirls out of control while politicians and drugmakers reap blood-tainted profits. 
“Corporations have no conscience,” Rannazzisi flatly told the Guardian . “Unfortunately, with my job, I was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids. If one of those CEOs went out there and talked to anybody, or if one of those CEOs happened to lose a kid to this horrible, horrible domestic tragedy we have, I’d bet you they’d change their mind. 
“When you sit with a parent who can’t understand why there’s so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace, and why isn’t the government doing anything, well the DEA was doing something. Unfortunately what we’re trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws. Share This Article...",0

2978,"Janet Reno, First Female US Attorney General, Dies At 78","Janet Reno, First Female US Attorney General, Dies At 78 11/07/2016 
NPR 
Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as attorney general of the United States, died early Monday from complications of Parkinson’s disease. Reno’s goddaughter Gabrielle D’Alemberte and sister Margaret Hurchalla confirmed her passing to NPR. 
Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends, D’Alemberte told The Associated Press. She was 78. 
Reno served longer in the job than anyone had in 150 years. And her tenure was marked by tragedy and controversy. But she left office widely respected for her independence and accomplishments. 
She was not President Bill Clinton’s first choice to head the Justice Department, nor his second. But after his No. 1 pick went down in confirmation flames, and his second choice also proved controversial, Clinton finally turned to Reno. 
She was an unexpected pick. She had no connections to Clinton or Washington. But Clinton wanted a woman, and Reno was a big-time prosecutor, holding the top prosecutor’s job in Miami-Dade County, a position she had been elected to four times over 15 years. 
Jamie Gorelick, who would later become deputy attorney general, was assigned to prep Reno for her confirmation hearing. “She was the least air-brushed candidate we have ever had for a Cabinet-level position,” says Gorelick. “She was herself, and she didn’t change herself for Washington.” 
Reno arrived at the Justice Department knowing no one, and was immediately plunged into the siege at the Branch Davidian compound outside Waco, Texas. Four federal agents had been killed and 16 wounded while serving a warrant to search for illegal guns. Seven weeks into the siege, pressed by the FBI, Reno authorized a raid on the compound, resulting in 76 deaths, including as many as 25 children and the Davidian leader David Koresh, who ordered his followers to set fire to the compound. 
In two sets of Waco congressional hearings over the next two years, Reno would successfully quell critics on the right and left. 
“What haunted me,” Reno explained at one hearing, “was that if I did not go in, I might be sitting there 10 days [later] … when [Koresh] came out with explosives, blew himself, some agents and the entire place up.” 
Years later, however, in an interview with NPR shortly before leaving office, her regret was palpable. “We’ll never know whether it was a mistake or not, in one sense,” Reno admitted. “But knowing what I do, I would not do it again. I would try to figure another way.” 
“Waco didn’t make her hesitant: It made her insistent about getting her own information,” observes Walter Dellinger, who served in two top Justice Department jobs under Reno. 
Dellinger believes, for instance, that it may have been the Waco experience that led Reno to go personally to Miami in April 2000 to see if there was a way to avoid a forcible removal of 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elián González from the home of a great-uncle so the boy could be returned to his only living parent, in Cuba. 
Elián had been rescued at sea after his mother and eight others drowned trying to get to the United States. Rescued by fishermen and brought to the U.S., he was soon turned over to his great-uncle. The Cuban community in Miami was in an uproar over the idea of returning the boy to his father, who lived in Cuba, and the furor soon bled over to Congress. 
But when negotiations with the great-uncle failed, armed federal agents, acting on Reno’s orders, raided the home, removed Elián, and turned him over to his father, who had come to the U.S. to receive his son. When the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene, the two returned to their home in Cuba.

Over the course of time, Reno would become embroiled in many controversies. She sought the appointment of a series of independent counsels to investigate four fellow Cabinet members and President Clinton himself. But she refused to authorize an independent counsel investigation of contributions to the Clinton-Gore campaign after Justice Department lawyers concluded no crime had been committed by either the president or vice president. 
The decision so infuriated Republicans that some called for her impeachment. “This is the most politicized Justice Department in the history of the United States,” railed Dan Burton, the Republican chairman of a key House oversight committee. 
At 6 feet 2 inches, however, Reno stood tall in the political crosswinds. Gorelick observes that when members of Congress, like Burton, were unhappy with a government official, they threatened to call that official to testify. But Reno, who had served as a staffer in the Florida state Legislature, always said, “Fine, I’ll be there.” As a result, says Gorelick, “eventually all those who were threatening her with a hearing stopped doing that, because she prevailed in every outing that I can recall — she just went in there and laid out her views and bested those who would challenge her.” 
The controversies that the Justice Department faced during Reno’s reign often eclipsed the many things that went well: the quick apprehension and successful prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers, for example; the pursuit of bombers of women’s health clinics that provide abortions; and the solving of the so-called Unabomber case. 
After nearly two decades of fruitless pursuit, the FBI still had no idea as to the identity of the man dubbed the Unabomber, who had killed three people and injured 23. Then, in 1995, the bomber sent a letter to The New York Times offering to cease his terror campaign if the Times or the Washington Post would publish his 35,000-word manifesto against modern industry and technology. Neither newspaper was inclined to do that initially, but Reno, the daughter of two newspaper journalists, persuaded the newspaper owners to jointly publish the essay in the interests of public safety. 
It paid off. The Unabomber’s brother recognized the style and ideas in the essay and tipped off the FBI, ending the bomber’s long reign of terror. Theodore Kaczynski, aka the Unabomber, is now serving a life term in a maximum security federal prison. 
In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. She did not slow down, but her hands sometimes shook so hard you could hear them knocking against the table at a congressional hearing. She even joked about the disease, claiming that “shaking sometimes helps,” as in playing a steel drum or balancing her kayak. 
That combination of toughness and self-deprecating humor, plus her determination to protect the Justice Department from improper influence, made her a hero to many who worked for her. 
“Janet Reno led with her values,” says former Deputy Attorney General Gorelick, the department’s No. 2 official. “And that meant that if she decided that a certain path was the right thing to do, the people around her believed her and would charge up any hill behind her. … I’d never seen that before in quite the same way.” 
Florida gubernatorial candidate and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno speaks at the Florida Democratic Party State Conference on April 13, 2002, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. She lost the Democratic primary. 
Reno won enormous respect inside the department as well, because of her work ethic and dedication to understanding issues in the many parts of the Justice Department — from national security, to environmental questions, to the generally obscure field of Indian law. 
U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch called her “one of the most effective, decisive and well-respected-leaders in [the department’s] proud history” who “never shied from criticism or shirked responsibility.” And former Attorney General Eric Holder said that “in a city where too many compromise their values for short term political gain, Janet Reno stood out as a person of integrity and of enduring values.” 
Former Solicitor General Dellinger believes that Reno was prepared for the attorney general’s job early in life by her intellect and ungainly height. “This is a woman that went to Cornell and Harvard Law School at a time when very few women went to Harvard Law School, went through junior high and high school being twice as tall as anybody else and probably twice as smart … and that’s really, really tough.” 
There were, of course, ups and downs in the eight years of Reno’s reign. But she said she always took the long view of her job. 
“If the end brings me out right, what people said about me won’t make any difference, and if the end brings me out wrong, 10 angels saying I was right won’t make any difference,” she said in an interview with NPR in 1997. 
President Clinton made little secret of his frequent displeasure with Reno and the wall of separation she erected between the Justice Department and the White House. Still, he never asked her to resign. Reno was the last Cabinet member he reappointed after his re-election in 1996. 
“It was actually quite wonderful,” said Dellinger. “She just decided to stay, and it turns out that nobody could fire her.” 
The tension between Clinton and his attorney general was apparent even as Clinton’s time in office drew to a close. In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes , Clinton went out of his way to praise friends and foes alike, but when it came to his evaluation of Reno, he was tepid, to say the least. 
“Good woman,” he said. “Tried really hard to do a good job. She’s a good person.” 
“At least he didn’t say I was a bad person,” replied Reno, with a laugh. “I’ll take what I can get!” 
Indeed, by the end of her tenure, Janet Reno had outlasted her critics and earned such a reputation for integrity and independence that comedian Will Ferrell’s parody of her became one of the iconic skits on NBC’s Saturday Night Live . The recurring skit was inspired by reports that Reno had cut quite a figure dancing at a Justice Department party. 
On the last episode of the “Janet Reno’s Dance Party” parody, Ferrell, wearing a blue dress and pearls, reminisces about past glories and laments that the end of the party is near. Then, suddenly, the real Janet Reno comes crashing through the wall of the set, wearing the same blue dress and pearls as Ferrell, to deliver one of Ferrell’s signature lines: “It’s Reno Time!” 
“Oh, Janet,” he says to the real Reno, as he mourns the end of the skit’s run, “what do you do when you get sad?” 
“I just dance,” Reno replies, commanding the orchestra, “Now, hit it!” as she breaks out her best moves to “Twist and Shout.” It was her last day in office.",0
2979,You Can't Be Intersectional While at the Same Time Being Elitist and Exclusionary,"By Djuan Wash / filmsforaction.org 
One cannot claim to be intersectional while at the same time being elitist and exclusionary. Everyone isn't hip to what heteronormativity, heterosexism, cisgendered, cissexism or many new-age terms mean. You can't write people off for not being where you are or prescribing to your beliefs. Being intersectional means to love and support people where they are and assist them in their efforts at gaining a better understanding of intersectional social justice. While the work ultimately lies on the individual to read/research further once you enlighten them, you can't do that if you brow beat them for being ignorant. If you're unwilling to meet people where they are, you're not being intersectional, you're being an asshole.

2981,If You Thought The Trump Child Rape Case In NY Couldn’t Get Much Worse — You Were Wrong,"By Joe Clark Crime , Election 2016 , Politicians Behaving Badly , Politics , Videos November 1, 2016 If You Thought The Trump Child Rape Case In NY Couldn’t Get Much Worse — You Were Wrong   
On November 9, 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could become the first president-elect to be named as a defendant in a child rape case. 
A woman named Katie Johnson filed a 100 million dollar federal lawsuit against Trump in a New York federal court this summer. 
Johnson filed a similar federal lawsuit in California on May 2, but her case was thrown out due to a clerical error. 
The alleged victim later refiled her case in a New York federal court. 
Johnson accuses Trump along with his long time friend Jeff Epstein, who’s also a billionaire financier and convicted sex offender, of raping a woman when she was only 13-years-old in 1994. 
In a court affidavit, the alleged victim, who is identified in court documents as “Jane Doe,” said that Trump hit her and raped her while she was tied to a bed in Epstein’s posh upper east side New York apartment. 
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from an underage girl. He served 13 months of an 18-year prison term before being released. 
In the affidavit, Johnson also mentions that Trump threatened her life. 
The alleged victim’s accounts are corroborated by two witnesses (identified in court records as “Joan Doe” and “Tiffany Doe”), who allegedly worked as “party planners” for Epstein. 
“I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop,” Tiffany Doe alleges . 
Tiffany Doe also claimed to have witnessed Trump force Jane Doe and an unidentified 12-year-old girl (identified in court records as Maria) to perform oral sex on him, then continue to physically abuse the girls after the act concluded. 
In court documents, Tiffany Doe said that part of her job was to “personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that Mr. Epstein hired and his guests.” 
According to the former “party planner,” both Trump and Epstein threatened Jane Doe if she ever revealed what they had done. They used Maria’s disappearance as collateral that they would make good on their threat, implying that they had the girl murdered. 
“I personally witnessed Defendant Trump telling the Plaintiff that she shouldn’t ever say anything if she didn’t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female Maria, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed,” Tiffany Doe alleged. 
When Tiffany Doe stopped working for Epstein in 2002, she said the billionaire threatened to kill her and her family if she ever came forward about his activities. 
“I fully understand that that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger,” she said. 
A federal judge has ordered a hearing concerning Johnson’s case to be held on December 16.

2982,Rally in Kiev: “We Must Drive the Russian Language into the Ghetto!” - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
About a hundred activists from the Ukrainian nationalist “Svoboda” party and several public organizations, on 17.11.16 in Kiev picketed the building of the constitutional court of Ukraine, which hosted a hearing on the fate of the “language law of Kivalov-Kolesnichenko” . 
Protesters held posters saying: 
“We will speak in Ukrainian so that Russia does not ‘defend’ Russian-speakers” 
“Don’t arrange yourself for someone else’s language in your own country” 
“Russian language is the weapon of Moscow, don’t speak in Imperial!” 
“The law on language Putin-Kivalov – in the trash!” 
“One language, One nation! One Ukraine!” 
“A United Ukraine, where there is only one national language” 
“Oust russifiers from state posts” 
“Let’s put an end to Russification!” 
“Down with Moscow’s written law of Kivalov-Kolesnichenko” 
“Only the evil enemies of Ukraine support Moscow language, Russian world, war!” 
“Let’s defend the Ukrainian language, it’ll be a native state” 
Deputies and public figures addressed those who gathered. 
“There, where there is the Russian language, there are occupiers,” said the Deputy of the Kiev City Council from “Svoboda” Igor Miroshnichenko” in his speech. “There, where there is Russian language, there are separatists and the ‘Russian world’, which the enemy with weapons comes to defend. There are no allusions that Moskals can trample our land. That’s why it is necessary to do everything to make on our land Russian-speakers to disappear, like ‘dew in the sun’. 
Russian language in Ukraine can only be in one status, it should be superfluous. It clings to our children like garbage – in schools, on the street, on television, in the media. That’s why it is necessary to do everything to throw this garbage out of our house. 
Russian language is needed in order to interrogate the occupiers. Russian language is needed in order to understand the intentions of the enemy. It is those who work in the security services who must possess it. Unfortunately, in our special services the Russian language is used.” 
T he Deputy compared the condition of the Ukrainian language in Ukraine and, in particular, the quota for Ukrainian content on radio and television, with a ghetto. “While it’s Russian language that we must drive into the ghetto, Russian songs. I want for them such ghettos in Ukraine that they were creating centuries back for us in their land. We don’t want to create ghettos in their house. You want to sing in Russian – go to Moscow”, he said.

2983,Private Equity Energy Funds Did So Badly They Might Have to Do the Unthinkable – Pay Clawbacks,"by Yves Smith 
The law firm Akin Gump issued a warning that might chill the bones of some private equity general partners: clawbacks may be a-comin’. From the firm’s website : 
In recent months, managers of private equity funds in the energy sector have been facing a scenario they likely never imagined: having to return millions of dollars of their “carried interest” earnings back to investors. 
For newbies to this private equity practice, private equity funds typically pay the profit share, prototypically 20% once a target rate of return has been met. What creates the possibility of a clawback is the fact that for most US funds, the profit computation and any payouts are made every time a portfolio company is sold. By contrast, in “European” deals, the carry fees are paid only at the end of the fund’s life. 
The conventional US approach, combined with strong general partner incentives to realize profits on at least some promising deals early in the fund’s life, means that the general partners can pay themselves carry fees that are more than they deserved once the impact of doggy companies, which are sold late in the fund’s life, are factored in. Hence the limited partnership agreements provide for “clawbacks,” as in the recovery of overpayments of carry fees. 
Yet as we’ve written, clawbacks are almost never paid in practice. Why? First, the clawback provisions have tax language that is very favorable to the general partners, and has the economic effect that they can hang on what are excessive carry fees based on raw cash flows. Second, possession is 9/10ths of the law. In those instances where the general partner owes limited partner clawbacks, the general partner usually goes to the limited partners and offers them a special deal (details often unspecified!) on their next fund. Needless to say, this approach has the desirable effect of pre-committing those limited partners. 
Akin Gump flagged specifically the lousy performance of some unnamed energy funds. In light of the discussion above, the limited partners have been sufficiently burned that they have no intention of investing in energy funds any time soon, and may also be willing to be atypically forceful about getting money back. Recall that limited partners fetishize maintaining friction-free relationships with general partners. Again from the firm’s missive: 
Several energy-related funds that were formed in nascent stages of the boom now have terms ending during collapse-protracted downturns. Managers may feel as though they could recoup some losses if they could delay liquidating assets until oil recovers further. Many fund agreements provide for a one or two year extension of the fund’s investment period at the manager’s discretion; however, to the extent that this option has already been exhausted, some managers are now going back to investors to seek additional time and, potentially, additional capital. To placate investors in such cases, a manager may need to reduce or eliminate management fees charged to a fund for the duration of any extension period. Unfortunately, apart from extending a fund’s investment or harvest period, managers have little recourse after a fund’s inception. 
In other words, Mr. Market did not bail these funds out and a day of reckoning is coming. 
Interestingly, Akins Gump uses pain in the oil patch to argue that general partners should consider building in better means for assuring that general partners can pay clawbacks back if they are due and owing. What this document reveals is that limited partners have signed up for clawback agreements that are likely to be empty in practice. The money went years ago into the firm’s carry pool, and hence for payouts to senior and mid-level staffers. The top dogs may have tied the money up in investments or property (houses, art) that they can’t readily liquidate. Or the funds may be beyond their reach entirely by having gone to outlays (political fundraising or a campaign, big gifts to charities) or an ex-wife. People below the senior level may have moved on. And perhaps as important, all the true partners (owners of the management company) have vis-a-vis everyone else who is in the firm is moral suasion. How far do you think that is going to go in getting people to write checks to disgorge monies they banked or worse spent, years ago? 
What is striking about the Akins Gump article is that the firm is giving what amounts to marketing rather than legal advice: 
The best way a manager can avoid the predicament of having to return a large sum to investors in respect of a clawback is to build preventative measures into the organizational documents of the fund or the vehicle earning the carry at the outset (i.e., escrows at the carry level or the contractual ability to get any distributions back from employees). 
Mind you, the private equity business has been around for 40 years, and has had large and supposedly savvy institutional investors for 30 plus years. The general partners have always been expose to the risk of paying clawbacks when their limited partnership agreements allow for them. So what is different now? 
Perhaps it is that investors are more acutely aware of the risk of investing at the peak of cycle than in the past, and the example of what happened to energy funds has made them realize that they could see problems like that on a broader basis. Moreover, given that the mainstream media is much less reverential in its treatment of private equity than in the past, if a meaningful minority of funds were to post overall crappy returns, resulting in meaningful clawbacks due, the press is more likely to expose the failure of investors like public pension funds to get insistent about getting their money back. Limited partner suing general partners is unheard of, but in a weak returns environment, private equity would no longer be a “must have” portfolio allocation. So Akins Gump appears to be alerting the industry to a risk that they had been able to cavalierly ignore that may start to bite them. 
And another reason for concern: 
Further, although Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to executive compensation could impose a mandatory return-of-incentive compensation scheme on certain financial institutions, it is unlikely that the proposed rules, in their current formulation, would apply to carried interest distributions, but they are subject to further clarification. 
The suggestions acknowledge that money-driven private equity professionals wouldn’t be happy with a “wait until the dust has settled” European structure. Some of the ideas include escrowing some carry but not so much as to demotivate staffers (30% was the suggested level), interim clawbacks that require the general partner “to reckon with any shortcomings as they occur.” A modified deal-by-deal structure would require the general partner to tally up losses and writedowns and earn back the shortfall before any more carry could be paid. 
Akins Gump curiously omitted another option: a performance bond. It’s not hard to imagine that Wall Street firms would be willing to insure this risk (or at least after the general partners paid a first loss amount) for a suitable fee. 
Nevertheless, this alert to general partners, as occurs so routinely in private equity, illustrates how remiss the limited partners have been. It would be gratifying if the underlying assumption in the Akins Gump piece were correct, that the deterioration in private equity profit generation is leading to contract terms becoming less one-sided in favor of general partners. But given the degree of complacency among limited, don’t expect these changes to take place any time soon. 0 0 0 0 0 0",0
2984,Tesla Reports Another Fraudulent Quarter,"Financial Markets , Market Manipulation , U.S. Economy accounting fraud , Elon Musk , Tesla , TSLA admin 
Tesla created massive confusion in the financial reporting and analyst community by allegedly coming clean and report actual GAAP quarterly financial results for its 3rd quarter. But of course, just like the entire U.S. Banana Republic, the use of extreme obfuscation, deceit, propaganda and lies once again is the norm with Tesla’s quarterly report. 
TSLA’s use of revenue recognition, deferred revenue and operating leases and its definition of “free cash flow” are enough to create a dedicated forensic accounting case study at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where I did indeed nearly ace a forensic accounting course. 
I don’t have enough time to lay out all of specifics and I’m not getting paid to write this blog post – but suffice it to say that several items in Tesla’s financials this quarter serve as big red flag warning flares. Of course, the market probably won’t care, as it seems that the market cap of a company’s stock is directly proportional to the grandiosity of the Company’s accounting abuse and fraud. And there’s no one in DC to enforce the laws already in place that are designed to prevent this fraud because the guys running these companies make substantial contributions to the Establishment politicians – just ask Jeff Bezos and Hillary Clinton. 
But I’ll point out some of the glaring problems in TSLA’s “GAAP” accounting based on cursory sleuthing. 
First and foremost, in his description of the results for the quarter, Musk stated that “residual lease risk” exposure was 32% of deliveries, down from 36% in Q2. But this is a highly deceptive metric. IN FACT , deferred revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the quarter soared to 61.4% from 44% in Q2. Deferred revenue is the amount of revenue that is subject to “residual risk” from leasing financing. This number is found on the liability side of the balance sheet. The deferred revenue liability account went from $558 million in Q2 to $1.4 billion in Q3. This is a huge jump in amount of risk-infused lease-based financing used to generate sales. 
In and of itself, using deferred revenue accounting to this degree is highly subjective and susceptible to fraudulent risk assumptions. But the fact that Musk tries to mask the truth by using a bogus metric to make it seem like TSLA’s exposure to the residual risk embedded in the profoundly questionable leases used to generate revenues and unit sales is a loud signal that there’s fraud embedded in TSLA’s “GAAP” financials. 
When you look at what is being reported as “GAAP operating income” consider that a huge proportion of that income is subject to the risk of coming back at the company in form of “one-time” GAAP charges which result from having to reverse out a large portion of the “GAAP” revenues when the value attached to the cars that will likely come flying back at TSLA when the leases expire is substantially lower than the amount guaranteed by TSLA. This “GAAP” presentation makes a farce of bona fide accounting standards. 
Another huge red flag is the huge jump in accounts payable. In June, accounts payable were 87% of revenues. But by September, accounts payable were more than 100% of revenues. The only reason TSLA would stretch out its payables like this is if it needed the cash. Not paying bills for a company like TSLA is a source of free financing. But this is an extreme slow-down in bill payments. There’s no way to know for sure what’s going on, but something is wrong. 
A third huge red flag is the way in which Musk throws around the term “free cash flow.” His definition is just as fraudulent as Amazon.con’s definition. At this point in time, because TSLA has only released an 8k which does not contain an GAAP statement of cash flows, there’s no way to know the amount of free or negative free cash flow attributable to TSLA’s operations. That is, “free cash flow” in the context of the deceitful manner in which TSLA’s financials are presented. 
Having said that, Musk states in the 8k that TSLA generated “positive free cash flow.” No, Elon, you did not. Buried in the 8k is a section titled, “selected cash flow information.” He lays out his definition of “free cash flow” showing $176 million defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less capex. The GAAP definition of free cash flow, however, also includes debt repayment and other sundry items that drain cash. We won’t know the full extent of these items until the 10Q is released. 
However, TSLA reported that it payed down $178 million on its borrowing facilities. Using GAAP free cash flow, this takes Elon free cash flow negative. Furthermore, if TSLA had maintained accounts payable at 86% of revenues, this would have sucked another $324 million of cash from TSLA’s operations, leaving the Company with a free cash flow deficit of $326 million. 
There’s a lot more going on with TSLA’s operations that is deceitful, if not outright fraudulent. This is just the “low hanging fruit.” At some point the capital markets will stop funding this fraud and that’s when the fun begins. Of course, by that time insiders will have sucked $100’s of millions of wealth out this Company that will never be retrievable. In just the last 12 months, insiders have unloaded 4.1 million shares, or roughly $860 million worth of stock. Oh wait, there was one open market purchase of stock by an insider of a whopping 1,394 shares. 
It’s my view the idiotic shareholders who give money to TSLA deserve what they’ll get eventually. But then again, many of them are sheeple who have placed trust in financial fiduciaries, like pension managers and investment advisors, to invest their savings. Share this:",0
2985,ISLAM NOT WELCOME: Obama just got TERRIBLE NEWS – THIS could END his MUSLIM “REFUGEE” Program… FOREVER!,"ISLAM NOT WELCOME: Obama just got TERRIBLE NEWS – THIS could END his MUSLIM “REFUGEE” Program… FOREVER! Oct 28, 2016 Previous post 
The brilliant lawyers at Judicial Watch just did something that is sending SHOCK WAVES through the Obama White House. They are filling official requests to learn every detail about President Barack Obama’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to import thousands of Muslim Syrian “refugees” into America. And they are already taking Obama to court to force him to turn over this information. 
This bold legal action will expose Obama’s corruption to sunlight, and could quickly be the end of the Syrian refugee program. Incredible! 
Judicial Watch is suing the Department of State for documents related to President Barack Obama’s Refugee and Resettlement program as part of an investigation into the Obama administration’s plan to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, the conservative foundation announced Monday. 
The suit was filed in Washington, D.C., after the State Department failed to respond to two Freedom of Information Act requests from Judicial Watch in 2015. In May, Judicial Watch sought records related to the State Department’s agreements and interactions with voluntary agencies that help place and assist new refugees. In September, Judicial Watch sought records regarding an August meeting between State Department representatives and a South Carolina non-profit. 
“The Obama administration doesn’t want Americans to know about how it places refugees from terrorist states in their local communities,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says in a statement Monday. “The fact we had to file a federal lawsuit to obtain basic information about Obama’s

2986,White House Pulls Back From Bid to Reopen C.I.A. ‘Black Site’ Prisons - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump White House appears to have backed off for now on its consideration of reopening overseas “black site” prisons, where the C. I. A. once tortured terrorism suspects, after a leaked draft executive order prompted bipartisan pushback from Congress and cabinet officials. On Thursday, the White House circulated among National Security Council staff members a revised version of the draft order on detainees that deleted language contemplating a revival of the C. I. A. prisons, according to several officials familiar with its contents. The draft order retains other parts of the original that focus on making greater use of the military’s Guantánamo Bay prison, which the Obama administration had tried to close. Those sections, reflecting repeated vows from President Trump, include a call to bring newly captured terrorism detainees there and to freeze plans for any more transfers. After news outlets reported details of the original draft on Jan. 25, lawmakers erupted in outrage, and both the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and the C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, disavowed any prior knowledge of the contemplated order. Elisa Massimino, the president of Human Rights First, who had been among those who criticized the original draft, praised the revisions. “It sounds like a smart reaction to the reaction to the leaked draft,” she said. “Transparency is a good corrective to overreach, and it provides the opportunity for more careful consideration of the broader implications of an order like this. ” In addition to the change on C. I. A. prisons, the revised draft, unlike the original, would not revive a 2007 executive order issued by President George W. Bush, and later rescinded by President Barack Obama, that laid out a limited understanding of which torture techniques count as war crimes under the Geneva Conventions. Such a move would reduce the legal risk to interrogators who employ harsh tactics not on that list, like prolonged sleep deprivation. The revised draft would also not revoke two executive orders governing detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, as the original would have. The first bars the C. I. A. from operating prisons and requires all interrogators to adhere to techniques approved in the Army Field Manual. The other was Mr. Obama’s   directive to close the Guantánamo prison within a year. However, the revised draft is said to have a provision asserting that all contradictory sections of previous orders are revoked, which would implicitly repeal the part of Mr. Obama’s Guantánamo order that declared an intention to close the prison by the   deadline. The revised draft was circulated inside the National Security Council on Thursday, with a deadline for concurring or providing comment by Friday, one official said. The official said the draft had been held much more closely than the original one had been, apparently to prevent further leaks. The White House had distributed its original draft executive order on detainees in an email to council staff members at 8:41 a. m. on Jan. 24, giving them until 10 that morning to provide any comment. It was one of at least five significant draft orders distributed to them at the same time and with the same quick deadline, two of which Mr. Trump signed in the next few days. The staff members urged the White House to slow down and get input from affected agencies and departments. They forwarded the email with the draft executive order on detainees to other officials in the government, who provided it to still other people, until it was leaked. The text of the original draft was first reported by The New York Times on Jan. 25. In response to the news reports, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, falsely said that the draft was not a “White House document. ” After The Times then reported details about when and how the White House had circulated it, Mr. Spicer said that it had not been “derived from White House sources” and suggested that its origins traced to input provided to the Trump transition effort. As BuzzFeed reported, the Trump draft order had lifted verbatim sections from a draft order written in 2012 by policy advisers to the Mitt Romney campaign. But the language in the Trump White House version had been revised, including to take account of subsequent legal and geopolitical developments and to substitute terms like “fight against radical Islamism” for “global war on terrorism. ” By Jan. 27, Mr. Trump foreshadowed that his flirtation with reviving a C. I. A. interrogation program had come to an end, at least for the time being. At a news conference, Mr. Trump said that while he personally supported waterboarding and thought torture worked, Mr. Mattis, who opposes torture, “will override because I’m giving him that power. ”",0

2988,Hillary Clinton's Dirty War,"Bank Accounts for Paying Terrorists, Unseen Victims Finally Revealed. Contains images some viewers might find disturbing. 
Hillary Clinton used her power within Obama's state department, to control money for ISIS terrorists, and then to try to cover up the exposure of these Swiss and other bank accounts used for this purpose. This testimony by an officer in charge of tracking terrorist financing, is confirmed with recently leaked information (by WikiLeaks and others). 
""Accidental"" attacks by misused US aircraft have been happening, in a desperate attempt to break out the US armed and paid (directly and indirectly) ISIS forces from Aleppo, to prevent further evidence from being captured. Both Kurdish and Syrian government forces encircling ISIS in Aleppo have been thus attacked so far. And, the US-backed ISIS forces themselves, have been ruthlessly attacking civilians in surrounding areas, with the same objective - with the consequences seen here. Tags",0
2989,"Here’s PROOF The Gold Price is Based On Cost, Not Supply and Demand","Tweet Home » Gold » Gold News » Here’s PROOF The Gold Price is Based On Cost, Not Supply and Demand 
Gold’s true value is not based on its cost of production, but rather it’s high-quality store of value as a basis of money in the global economy. The reason the value of gold will skyrocket going forward is quite simple: 

From SRSRocco : 
The notion that the gold price is based on the economics of “Supply & Demand” turns out to be incorrect as the cost of production is the leading factor. This is also true for most commodities and energy. 
Unfortunately, economists and most analysts in the precious metals community will continue to believe that the economic principle of supply and demand determines price. If we look at the data provided in this article, the individual will see how closely related the cost of gold production is to the spot price. 
That being said, the information in this article is only to show the “commodity pricing mechanism” of gold, not its true store of value. There’s a big difference which 99% in the Mainstream media do not understand… and probably a good percentage in the precious metals community as well. Top Two Gold Miners Cost Of Production vs. The Gold Price 
I decided to take the data from the top two gold miners, Barrick and Newmont, for this exercise as they are the largest two gold producers in the world. Yes, I could have spent several days compiling data from the top 20 gold miners, but I don’t have the luxury of being paid by a financial institution for my analysis. Regardless, Barrick and Newmont provide a good representation of the cost of producing gold in the entire industry. 
According to my “Adjusted Income Approach” in determining the full cost of production, I constructed the chart below. One thing that is not included in the adjusted income approach is dividend payouts. I included this in my total cost per ounce for Barrick and Newmont: 
Here we can see that as the price of gold increased over the past 15 years, so did the cost of production for these top two gold miners. In 2000, the total average cost to produce gold for Barrick and Newmont was $243 versus the spot price of $279. Thus, the average profit margin was 13% for these gold mining companies that year. 
As the average price of gold surged to a record $1,669 in 2012, the average cost to produce the yellow metal for Barrick and Newmont increased to $1,386 . Yes, it’s true that these two gold miners enjoyed a 17% profit margin that year, but what is wrong with that?? Companies must have profits so they can pay for new projects, shareholder dividends or surplus cash for lean years when losses are incurred. 
If we compare the increase in the gold price from 2000 to 2012 versus the cost of production, we will see a very interesting similar trend: 
Gold Price Increase vs Cost Of Production 2000-2012 
Gold Price Increase 2000 – 2012 = 498% 
Gold Cost Increase 2000 – 2012 = 470% 
While the average gold spot price increased 498% from 2000-2012, the cost of production for Barrick and Newmont jumped 470%. To put it another way, the difference between the increased cost of production (470%) and the average spot price (498%) in the 2000-2012 time period, was a lousy 6%. 
Does the gold mining industry deserve a paltry 6% profit margin over that time period?? Which means… the economists can throw out the window the worthless principle of supply and demand. 
So, why did the cost of gold production increase so much since 2000?? Could it have anything to do with the increased cost of energy?? Well, yes it did. I wrote about this in my previous article, Why Most Analysts’s Gold & Silver Forecasts Are Wrong . 
In the article, I show how the price of a barrel of oil increased from $20 in 2000 to $112 in 2012. Thus, the gold cost of production increased nearly five times on the back of a five times increase in the price of oil during that time period. 
Now, if we look at the data for 2015, the top two gold miners profit margin fell to 3.8% as their cost per ounce was $1,116 compared to the $1,160 spot price. The reason the cost of production declined in 2015 versus 2012, was due to the oil price (as well as other energy inputs) falling more than 50%. 
Okay, I imagine many reading this article would wonder why I have stated that the gold price will skyrocket in the future as the price of oil collapses towards $12 by 2020. This doesn’t make sense because a lower energy price would also dictate a lower cost of production… hence the gold spot price will fall as well. 
As I stated in the beginning of the article, this information only pertains to the “commodity pricing mechanism” of gold, not is true “high-quality store of value.” Gold or silver (to a lesser extent) are not commodities, rather they function as money or stores of wealth. There is a much different way to attribute value to these precious metals than their cost of production. I will touch on that at the end of the article, but there is more information about the cost of gold production we need to understand first. Gold Cost Of Production Understated Due To Massive Share Dilution and Increased Debt 
The gold cost of production for Barrick and Newmont are understated due to the massive amount of share dilution and increased debt. First, let’s look at the change in outstanding shares for these two gold mining companies: 
Barrick and Newmont’s outstanding shares have more than tripled from 526 million in 2000 to 1,695 million (1.69 billion) shares in 2015. Basically, these two gold mining companies could not afford to expand production from just their surplus profits. Instead, they resorted to issuing more shares to purchase new gold mines or fund new projects. 
Which means, the shareholder took some of the burden for the increased cost or expanded production. While its hard to put a figure on how much higher the cost to produce gold would have been if the shareholder was not used to fund this activity, we can safely assume that it would be higher than it is today. 
Secondly, the total liabilities for these two companies have surged to $32.9 billion in 2015 versus $3.8 billion in 2000: 
Here we can see that Barrick and Newmont’s total liabilities are nearly ten times higher than they were in 2000. Of course, some readers will say that these companies expanded production and increased gold projects have also increased their total assets. Yes, this is true… but, if we look at their net increase in gold production since 2000, something seems very wrong here: 
The net result of the increased gold production for Barrick and Newmont since 2000, turns out to be 1.7 million oz, or 17%. Even though these two companies enjoyed higher production in past years, they only produced 17% more gold in 2015 than they did in 2000. Which means, a lot of their new projects were used to offset declines or shut-downs of other mining operations. 
We can clearly see from the data above, these two gold miners cost of production would be higher if shareholder dilution and the increased debt was removed from the equation. The Cost Of Gold Production is Not It’s True Store Of Value 
While the data proves that the mining industry has used its shareholder and debt increase to artificially lower the true cost of producing gold, this is not the ultimate methodology to value gold. Gold’s true value is not based on its cost of production, but rather it’s high-quality store of value as a basis of money in the global economy. 
The reason the value of gold will skyrocket going forward is quite simple. The world has been bamboozled by the Wall Street, Central Banks and the financial media to put 99% of its investment funds in Stocks, Bonds and Real Estate. As oil production and consumption increased in the past, this allowed Global GDP and net worth to grow. 
Unfortunately, the net energy of a barrel of oil supplied to the market has been declining which has pushed its price to record highs. The first warning light was the U.S. Housing and Investment Banking collapse in 2008. To prop up the system, the Fed and Central Banks have thrown in trillions of dollars of liquidity. This has inflated the value of most Stocks, Bonds and Real Estate. 
As the price of oil continues to fall, along with production, this will cause a huge DEFLATIONARY WAVE of destruction throughout the global economies. The 99% of investors finally getting PRECIOUS METALS RELIGION , will move into physical gold and silver to protect wealth. 
This will not be a matter of “Supply & Demand”, rather it will be due the world realizing how little high-quality stores of value there are in the world . As most Stocks, Bonds and Real Estate values continue to plummet, more and more investors will seek the safe-haven status of physical gold and silver.

2990,U.S. TRUCKING COMPANIES SLASH FLEETS AMID “TEPID SHIPPING DEMAND”,"Home › ECONOMIC › U.S. TRUCKING COMPANIES SLASH FLEETS AMID “TEPID SHIPPING DEMAND” U.S. TRUCKING COMPANIES SLASH FLEETS AMID “TEPID SHIPPING DEMAND” 0 SHARES 
[10/31/16] For months now we have been writing about the collapse of class 8 truck orders. For the month of September, net class 8 orders were down 16% YoY while LTM orders were down a staggering 41%. In fact, the level of trailing 12-month net orders is the lowest since January 2011 with YoY changes now in negative territory for 19 consecutive months. 
Therefore, it should come as little surprise that large trucking companies in the U.S. are being forced to slash fleets amid slumping demand and slack capacity. According to the Wall Street Journal , several U.S. trucking companies, including Swift, Werner and Covenant, have all been forced to cut 1,000s of trucks from their fleets as “overcapacity has driven down pricing.” Of course, all this means that class 8 truck manufactures are unlikely to see an uptick in new orders anytime in the near future with Werner promising it won’t add trucks “until they see meaningful improvement in the freight and rate markets.” 
“We haven’t seen any difficulty in finding trucks,” said Ken Forster, chief executive of logistics company Sunteck Transport Group, a broker based in Jacksonville, Fla., that finds and books trucks for freight shippers. “It’s clear that overcapacity has driven down pricing.” 
In quarterly earnings reports this month, Swift Transportation Co., Werner Enterprises Inc. and Covenant Transportation Group Inc. said they have pulled a combined hundreds of trucks from service since the second quarter. 
Idling trucks is a way large fleets can quickly reduce capacity to match demand, which has stagnated this year amid uneven retail imports and sluggish growth for manufacturers. 
Swift, the country’s largest truckload carrier, counted 581 fewer trucks in the third quarter than it did this time last year, and plans to cut an additional 200 trucks in the fourth quarter. The company’s fleet tops 19,000 big rigs. 
Werner, the fifth-largest U.S. truckload carrier, according to SJ Consulting Group, said it cut its fleet by 240 trucks in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year earlier. The company posted a 41% drop in third-quarter net profit, to $18.9 million, and said in its earnings statement that it won’t add trucks “until we see meaningful improvement in the freight and rate markets.” 
That said, we wouldn’t hold our breath waiting for demand and pricing to rebound. As Barclays points out, consumer goods imports have continued to remain very weak in 2016 which they think could “ presage a slowdown in household demand. ” Moreover, Barclays points out that amongst durable goods orders only autos have held up over the past several months amid overall declines for the larger basket though even autos have seemingly “ reached a plateau.” Post navigation",0
2991,The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed,"The FBI's Clinton Investigation Is Wider Than Assumed   Source: Moon of Alabama 
The Washington Post editors today added to their hypocrisy with three additional anti-Comey op-eds: 
I interpret that as naked fear that their candidate Hillary Clinton may now loose. That fear is justified. 
The Wall Street Journal today added to its so far excellent reporting on the Clinton issues by revealing the much bigger story behind it: FBI in Internal Feud Over Hillary Clinton Probe - Laptop may contain thousands of messages sent to or from Mrs. Clinton’s private server (open copy here ). 
According to the reporting, based on FBI sources, FBI agents in New York and elsewhere have been looking into the Clinton Foundation for several months. They suspect that this ""charity"" was selling political favors by then Secretary of State Clinton in exchange for donations that personally benefited the Clinton family. 
The Justice Department blocked further aggressive investigations into the issue, allegedly because of the ongoing election. A high FBI official, Andrew McCabe, also showed disinterest in a further pursuit of the issue. McCabe's wife had just tried to get elected as state senator and had receive a campaign donation of nearly $500,000 from Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton friend and at times board member of the Clinton Foundation. The FBI agents pursuing the investigation into the Clinton Foundation were not amused. 
The separate investigation into former Congressman Weiner for sexual contacts with minors was looking for pedophile stuff on Weiner's electronic devices. It didn't find any as far as we can tell, but found some 650,000 emails archived on a laptop. Several thousand of these emails were sent or received by Weiner's spouse, the intimate Clinton aide Huma Abedin. They came through Clinton's private email server. At least some of these thousands of emails are likely copies of those that were deleted from Clinton's server when the (separate) investigation into it started. They may be evidence that Clinton sent and received classified documents through her unsecured system. Some of these emails may also contain serious dirt related to the Clinton Foundation. 
Thus we have three ongoing FBI investigations: into Clinton's private email-server used illegally for official State Department business; into the Clinton Foundation and its role in peddling political influence in exchange for donations; into the personal conduct of Anthony Weiner. 
Additional investigations that may come up are on: the mixing of donations to the Clinton Foundation and personal compensation for Bill Clinton for holding highly paid speeches; for profit activities by the group of people running Bill Clinton's businesses as well as the Clinton Foundation financing; inappropriate hindering of the FBI investigations by the Justice Department and/or by McCabe. 
With such a list of potentially very serious scandals pending it is highly understandable that FBI director Comey went public and did not follow the advice from the Justice Department to pursue these issues only on a reduced level. It would have been political suicide to try to keep this silent. Way too many FBI agents eager to pursue these case were in the known and would have talked, as they do now, to the media. 
If Clinton gets elected she will be hampered by these scandals for the next two years. The Republicans in Congress will jump on these issues as soon as possible. There will be endless hearings with large media coverage. The only question is when the first attempts at an impeachment process will be made - before or after she moves back into the White House. She and her family may be better off with her losing the campaign. Share This Article...",0
2992,Kellogg’s Brand Falls from 60 to 84th Place with Consumers in 4 Years - Breitbart,"Continuing its business slump, a new review of Kellogg’s brand, as calculated on the value of the company’s name, shows the company took another dip, falling from 74th most valuable brand to 84th over last year’s rating. In addition, the company’s brand fell 24 spots since 2014. [According to calculations by Brand Finance’s Brand Directory, Kellogg has been steadily falling at least since 2014. According to the group’s ratings, the cereal giant figured in as the 60th most valued company in 2014. But over each of the ensuing years, that assessment has dropped.  In 2015, Kellogg was the 68th most valued company in the country in 2016, it fell eight more slots to 76 and with its latest measurement, Brand Finance says Kellogg has fallen eight more slots to 84. The company has seen a drop of 24 slots in just four years. Brand Finance calculates a company’s brand on its earnings, stock, and profits and then measures all that to determine how much a given company would pay to license its brand as if it did not own it. The Brand Finance rating isn’t the only example of trouble for the breakfast food company. The   company has also seen its stock falling since last year. Kellogg’s stock closed last week at $72. 61 per share, down from its   high of $87. 16. Kellogg has been experiencing major business contractions, too, especially over the last year. The company has been desperately cutting its work force and downsizing facilities at least since last December. In January, Kellogg announced that it was cutting another 250 employees from its U. S. workforce, and by February, it had closed 39 distribution centers and laid off its entire U. S. sales force. The company’s contraction came after Kellogg decided to cut its advertising with Breitbart News at the end of 2016, thereby snubbing Breitbart’s 45, 000, 000 readers. In November, Kellogg noted that the conservative readers at Breitbart News are not “aligned with our values as a company. ” While the decision by Kellogg to cease advertising made virtually no revenue impact on Breitbart. com. it did represent an escalation in the war by leftist companies like Target and Allstate against conservative customers whose values propelled Donald Trump into the White House. After the cereal maker turned its back on conservative customers, Breitbart News launched its #DumpKelloggs petition, which has been signed by more than 450, 000 people. Finally, according to advertising industry watchdog, Adweek, Kellogg’s decision to pull advertising from Breitbart and the ensuing controversy over the move inflicted massive,   damage to the cereal company’s brand online.

2993,Political Correctness for Yuengling Brewery; What About Our Opioid Epidemic?,"We Are Change 

In today’s political climate even our beer is up for debate. And why shouldn’t it be? This is America. We debate things here. That’s how democracy works. (At least when the issues aren’t taboo.) Recently, it’s shown up in the state of Pennsylvania with Eric Trump, Donald Trump’s son, garnering an endorsement for the Republican candidate from Yuengling, America’s oldest brewery.
And now the debate turns to political action.
With the most recent statement from Richard “Dick” Yuengling Jr., the 73-year-old owner of D. G. Yuengling & Son’s, located in Pottsville, Pennsylvania — the seat of Schuylkill County — Yuengling said that his company was “behind” Trump. Inevitably, a lashing out occurred in the digital realm with regard to political correctness and expressively personal views. Customers weren’t pleased. They were offended. In fact, some even claimed that they’d never drink Yuengling again.
This is what democracy is, and should be. Sure. And yet, something is lost in the politicized scramble of this ugly election year.
A Pennsylvania state representative, Brian Sims, announced on his Facebook page that he was saying “GOOD BYE” to Yuengling Brewery.
“I’m not normally one to call for boycotts but I absolutely believe that how we spend our dollars is a reflection of our votes and values! Supporting Yuengling Brewery, that uses my dollars to bolster a man, and an agenda, that wants to punish me for being a member of the LGBT community and punish the black and brown members of my community for not being white, is something I’m too smart and too grown up to do.” 
Sims represents the 182nd district of Philadelphia , which includes a majority of Center City, in addition to parts of Rittenhouse Square, Grays Ferry, and South Philadelphia. I live here. I walk those areas of the city.
And I see, feel, and hear other elements of our society that go unnoticed or receive little to no attention. To observe this sort of outcry against a presidential candidate is expectantly what democracy was birthed upon, as we know in the city of Philadelphia. We take action. (We like to think.) However, along the way I’ve seen the incessant results of many issues that get buried, in favor of political expediency and trending topics that ultimately define our aggressive actions towards “voting with our dollars”.
If that’s the case, then what about all the other detriments to our standard of living? For instance, the opiate epidemic that is sweeping Pennsylvania and the surrounding states and the rest of the country by storm.
According to a June 2016 report from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health , entitled “The Epidemic of Overdoses From Opioids in Philadelphia”, drug deaths involving the fatal use of opioids, from 2000-2014, had tripled. In 2014, approximately 47,000 people died from overdoses in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Sixty-one percent of that total was attributed to the use of opioids.
“Since 1999, the number of prescriptions for pharmaceutical opioid pain relievers in the U.S. more than quadrupled.” 
Opioid-related overdose deaths in Philadelphia were nearly three times higher in men than among women in 2015. Those deaths were also more than two times as high among whites, as opposed to deaths among African Americans.
Between 2003 and 2015, in Philadelphia, cocaine and benzodiazepines were detected in overdose deaths in tandem with opioids at a rate of 70% and 90%, respectively. During that same period, overdose deaths related to heroin more than doubled in the city, with approximately 400 deaths reported in 2015.
In that same year, there were nearly 700 drug overdose deaths in Philadelphia. That’s more than twice as many deaths from homicide in that same year.
From 2014-2015, 10% of the nearly 1,300 overdose deaths in Philadelphia were from non-residents. Most of those non-residents were people from New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and other parts of Pennsylvania.
Once the president is elected, these issues won’t go away. In fact, they’re extant — some as a surrogate to the system we attribute to healthcare. (One of the most hotly contested issues of partisan bickering in the country.)
Additionally, these effects are increasingly felt in Philadelphia hospitals.
“The percentage of Philadelphia hospital emergency department visits related to opioid overdoses increased from approximately 0.4% in 2007 to nearly 0.7% in 2015. In 2015, there were over 6,500 emergency department visits for opioid overdoses. For each opioid-related death, there were approximately 12 hospital emergency department visits.” 
So while the country politically corrects itself — whatever that means — myriad issues get buried beneath picking and choosing a side, in response to the emotional disturbances of partisan bickering.
Rather than dealing with facts, the web of society becomes entangled with He Said, She Said.
Ultimately, this coercive cultural backwardness and evolutionary substandard, the rattle-mouthed bickering of intellectual thought and deceptive, manipulative action, that matches up more closely with the reptilian species, rather than the spirit of the human heart and the cultural celebration of life and all its wonder, is exactly what gave rise to Trump.
And our opioid epidemic.
Somewhere along the way, the facts were buried beneath the lie. And the truth has become something else, entirely.

2994,Wall Street And The Pentagon,"  
Introduction: Wall Street and the Pentagon greeted the onset of 2016 as a ‘banner year’, a glorious turning point in the quest for malleable regimes willing to sell-off the most lucrative economic resources, to sign off on onerous new debt to Wall Street and to grant use of their strategic military bases to the Pentagon. 
Brazil and Argentina, the most powerful and richest countries in South America and the Philippines, Washington’s most strategic military platform in Southeast Asia, were the objects of intense US political operations in the run-up to 2016. 
In each instance, Wall Street and the Pentagon secured smashing successes leading to premature ejaculations over the ‘new golden era’ of financial pillage and unfettered military adventures. Unfortunately, the early ecstasy has turned to agony: Wall Street made easy entries and even faster departures once the ‘honeymoon’ gave way to reality. ; The political procurers persecuted center-left incumbents but, were soon to have their turn facing prosecution. The political prostitutes, who had decreed the sale of sovereignty, were replaced by nationalists who would turn the bordello back into a sovereign nation state. 
This essay outlines the rapid rise and dramatic demise of these erstwhile ‘progeny’ of Wall Street and the Pentagon in Argentina and Brazil, and then reviews Washington’s shock and awe as the newly elected Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte embraced new ties with China while proclaiming, ‘We are no one’s ‘tuta’ (puppy dog)!’ 
Argentina and Brazil: Grandiose Schemes and Crapulous Outcomes 
The international financial press was ecstatic over the election of President Mauricio Macri in Argentina and the appointment of former Wall Street bankers to his cabinet. They celebrated the ouster of the ‘evil populists’, accusing them of inflating economic results, reneging on debt obligations and discouraging foreign lenders and investors. Under the Macri regime all market obstacles were to be removed and all the bankers trembled with anticipation at the ‘good times’ to come. 
After taking office in December 2015, President Macri unleashed the ‘animal instincts’ of the market and the carrion birds flocked in. US ‘vulture funds’ scooped up and demanded payment for on old Argentine debt ‘valued’ at $3.5 billion – constituting a 1,000% return on their initial investment. A devaluation of the peso of 50% tripled inflation and drove down wages by 20%. 
Firing over 200,000 public sector employees, slapping 400% price increases on utilities and transport, driving small and medium size firms into bankruptcy and enraged consumers into the streets ended the honeymoon with the Argentine electorate quite abruptly. This initial massive dose of free enterprise ‘medicine’ was prescribed by the local and Wall Street bankers and investors who had promised a new golden era for capitalism! 
Now that he had banished the ‘populists’, Macri was free to tap into the international financial markets. Argentina raised $16.5 billion from a bond sale taken up by the big bankers and speculators, mostly from Wall Street, who were eager to cash in on the high rates in the belief that there was no risk with their champion President Macri at the helm. Wall Street based its giddy predictions on a mere three-month experience with Mauricio! 
But then… some of the hedge fund managers began to raise questions about the viability of Mauricio Macri’s presidency. Instead of reducing the fiscal deficit, Macri began to increase public spending to offset mass discontent over his triple digit increases in utility fees and transportation, the mass layoffs in the public sector and the slashing of pension funds. 
The major banks had counted on the abrupt devaluation of the currency to invest in the export sector, but instead they were confronted with a sudden 11% appreciation of the peso and a skyrocketing inflation of 40% leading to high interest rates. As a result, the economy fell even deeper in recession exceeding minus 3% for the year. 
While most Wall Street bankers still retain some faith in the Macri regime, they are not willing to fork-over the kind of cash that might allow this increasingly unpopular regime to survive. What keep Wall Street on board the sinking ship are the political and ideological commitments rather than any objective assessment of their protégée’s dismal economic performance. Wall Street counts on free market bankers appointed to the ministries, the massive purge of social services (health and education) personnel and the lucrative bond sales to cover the burgeoning deficit. They hope the vast increase in profits resulting from increased utility fees and the sharp cuts in salaries, pensions and subsidies will ultimately lead them into the promised land. 
Wall Street has expressed dismay over Macri’s failure to stimulate growth – in fact GDP is falling. Furthermore, their ‘golden boy’ failed to attract productive investments. Instead thousands of Argentine small and medium businesses have ‘gone under’ as consumer spending tanked and extortionate tariffs were slapped on vital public utilities and transport – devastating profits. Inflation has undermined the purchasing power of the vast majority of households. Wall Street speculators, concentrating on fixed-rate peso denominated debt, are at risk of losing their shirts. 
In other words, the administration’s ‘free enterprise’ regime is based largely on attracting foreign loans, plundering the national treasury, firing tens of thousands of public sector workers and slashing spending on social services and business-friendly subsidies. Macri has yet to generate any large-scale investment in new innovative productive sectors, which might sustain long-term growth. 
Already facing growing discontent and a general strike of private and public sector workers, the ‘bankers’ regime’ lacks the political links with the trade unions to neutralize the growing opposition. ORDER IT NOW 
To hold back the growing tidal wave of discontent, President Macri had to betray his overseas investors by boosting fiscal spending, which has had little or no impact on the national economy. 
Wall Street’s hopes that President Mauricio Macri would inaugurate a ‘golden era’ of free market capitalism lasted less than a year and is turning into a real fiasco. Rising foreign debt, economic depression and class warfare ensures Macri’s rapid demise. 
Brazil: Wall Street’s Three Month ‘Whirl-Wind’ Honeymoon 
Most of the current elected members of the Brazilian Congress, Senate and the recently-installed (rather than elected) President, as well as his cabinet, are in trouble: The hero, Michael Temer and his argonauts, chosen by Wall Street to privatize the Brazilian economy and usher in another ‘golden dawn’ for finance capital, now all face criminal changes, arrest and long prison sentences for money laundering, bribery, fraud, tax evasion and corruption. 
In less than four months, the entire political edifice constructed to impeach the elected President Dilma Rousseff and then de-nationalize key sectors of the economy, is shaking. So much for the financial press’s proclamation of a new era of “business friendly” policies in Brazilia. 
The pundits, politicians, journalists and editors, who prematurely celebrated the appointment of Michael Temer to the Presidency by legislative coup, now have to face a new reality. The key to understanding the rapid collapse of the New Right project in Brazil lies in the growing ‘rap sheets’ of the very same politicians who engineered the ouster of Rousseff. 
Eduardo Cunha, the ex-president of the Congress in Brasilia, used his influence to ensure the super majority of Congressional votes for the impeachment. Cunha was godfather to ensuring the appointment of Michael Temer as interim president. 
Cunha’s influence and control over the Congress was based on his wide network of bribes and corruption involving over a hundred members of congress, including the newly anointed President Temer. 
Once Cunha secured the ouster of Rousseff, the Brazilian elite washed their collective hands of the ‘fixer’, overwhelmed by the stench of his corruption. In September 2016, Cunha was suspended from Congress and lost his immunity. One month later, he was arrested on over a dozen charges, including fraud and tax evasion. It was public knowledge that Cunha had squirreled away a ‘tidy nest’ of over $70 million in Swiss banks. 
Cunha directed (extorted) public and private firms to finance the campaigns of many of his political colleagues. He had intervened to secure bribes for President Temer, his foreign minister and even the next presidential hopeful, Jose Serra. One of the most powerful representatives of the new regime, Moreira Franco, Grand Wizard of the Privatization Program, was ‘in hock’ to Cunha. 
As all this has come to light, Cunha has been negotiating a plea bargain with the prosecutor and judges in return for his ’singing’ a few arias. He is facing over a hundred years in jail; his wife and daughter face trial; Eduardo Cunha is prepared to talk and finger political leaders to save his own neck. Most knowledgeable observers and judicial experts fully expect Cunha to bring down the Temer Administration with him and devastate the leadership of Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, as well as ex-president Fernando Henrique Cardoso’s Brazilian Social Democratic Party. 
The Brazilian elite, Wall Street bankers and their mass media propagandists, who wrote and directed the impeachment plot scenario are now discredited and bereft of political front men. Their expectations of a new ‘golden era of free market capitalism’ in Brazil has turned into a political mad scramble with every politico and corporate leader desperate to save his own skin and illicit fortune by denouncing each other. 
With the demise of the ‘Brazilian takeover’, Wall Street and Washington are bereft of key markets and allies in Latin America. 
The Philippines: The Duterte turn from the US to China 
In April 2014, Washington ’secured’ an agreement granting access to five strategic military bases in the Philippines critical to its ‘pivot to target’ China. Under the outgoing President ‘Noynoy’ Aquino, Jr. the Pentagon believed it had an ‘iron-clad’ agreement to organize the Philippines as its satrap and military springboard throughout Southeast Asia. Washington even prodded the Aquino government to bring its Spratly Island dispute with China before the obscure Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. Washington anticipated using the Court’s ‘favorable’ ruling as a pretext to confront the Chinese. 
All this has changed with the June 2016 ascent to the Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte: In only four months, all Washington’s imperial designs had been swept off the table. By October 21, 2016 President Duterte announced he would end military exercises with Washington because they threatened Philippine sovereignty and made his country vulnerable to a military confrontation with China. He promised to end sea patrols of disputed waters that the US uses to harass China in the South China Sea. 
In advance of the Philippines President’s meeting with China, he had already declared that he would not press the Dutch-based ruling over the South China Sea island dispute against Beijing but rely on diplomacy and compromise. During the China meeting President Duterte declared that the two countries would engage in a constructive dialogue to resolve the Spratly Islands as well as other outstanding issues. The ‘agreement’ over US access to bases in the Philippines was put in doubt as the President declared “a separation from the US” and promised long-term, large scale economic and investment ties with China. Undergirding the Philippines pivot to China were 13 trade and investment agreements worth more than $20 billion, covering financing of infrastructure, transport, social projects, tourism, industry and agriculture. ORDER IT NOW 
The military base agreement, signed by the notoriously servile ex-President Aquino without Congressional approval, was review by the Philippine Supreme Court and can be revoked by the new President Duterte by decree. 
Inside of four months, the US strategy of armed encirclement and intervention against China has been dealt a major blow. The newly emerging China-Philippines linkage strikes a fatal blow to Washington’s overtly militarist ‘pivot’ against China. 
Conclusion 
2016 opened with great fanfare: The defeat of the two major center-left governments (Argentina and Brazil) and the advent of hard-right US-backed regimes would inaugurate a ‘golden era of free market capitalism’. This promised to usher in a prolonged period of profit and pillage by rolling back ‘populist’ reforms and creating a bankers paradise. In Southeast Asia, US officials and pundits would proclaim another ‘golden era’, this time of rampant militarism, encircling and provoking China on its vital sea lanes, and operating from five strategic military bases obtained through a Philippine Presidential decree by an unpopular and recently replaced puppet, ‘Noynoy’ Aquino, Jr. 
These dreams of ‘golden eras’ lasted a few months before objective reality intruded. 
By the autumn of 2016 the rightist regimes had been replaced in the Manila by a colorful ardent nationalist, while the ‘banker boys’ in Brasilia faced prison, and the ‘Golden Boys’ of Buenos Aires were mired in deep crisis. The notion of an easy Rightist restoration was based on several profound misunderstandings: 
1) The belief that the reversal of social reforms and denial of popular demands would smoothly give way to an explosion of foreign financing and investment was shattered when private bond purchases profited the financial sector but did not bring in large-scale productive investment. Devaluation of the currency was followed by skyrocketing inflation, which led to fiscal deficits and the loss of business confidence. 
2) Washington’s promotion of ‘corruption investigations’ started with prosecuting democratically elected center-left politicians and ended up with the arrest of Wall Street’s own protégés encompassing the entire right-wing political class and decimating the ‘Golden’ regimes. 
3) The belief that long-term hegemonic relations, based on client regimes in Asia, could resist the attraction of signing trade and investment agreements with the rising Chinese mega-economy, while sacrificing vital economic development, and relegating their masses to more stagnation and unemployment, collapsed with the massive electoral of nationalist Rodrigo Duterte as President of the Philippines. 
In fact, these and other political assessments among the decision makers in Washington and on Wall Street were proven wrong leading to a strategic retreat of the empire in both Latin America and Asia. The policy failures were not merely ‘mistakes’ but the inevitable results of changing structural conditions embedded in a declining empire. 
These decisions were based on a calculus of power, rooted in class and national relations that may have held true two decades ago. At the dawn of the new millennium the US still dominated Asia and China was not yet an economic alternative for its neighbors eager for investment. Washington could and did dictate policy in Southeast Asia. 
Twenty years ago, the US had the economic leverage to sustain the neoliberal policies of the Washington Consensus throughout Latin America. 
Today the US continues to pursue policies based on anachronistic power relations, seeming to ignore the fact that China is now a world power and a viable economic trade and investment alternative successfully competing for markets and influence in Asia. Washington is failing to compete in that marketplace and, therefore, can no longer rely on docile client state. 
Washington cannot effectively control and direct large-scale capital flows to shore-up its newly installed rightist regimes in Argentina and Brazil as they crumble under their own corruption and incompetence. Meanwhile the world is watching a domestic US economy, mired in stagnation with its own political elites torn by corruption and scandals at the highest level, and staging the most bizarre presidential campaign in its history. Corruption has become the mode of governing under conditions of deregulation and rule by political warlords. Political allegiance to the empire and open doors to foreign pillage do not attract capital when those making political decisions are facing prison and the business ‘doormen’ are busy stuffing their suitcases with cash and making a mad-dash for the airports! 
For Wall Street and the Pentagon, Latin America and Asia are lost opportunities – betrayals to be mourned at the officers clubs and exclusive Manhattan restaurants. For the people in mass social movements these are emerging opportunities for struggle and change. 
The strenuous US effort to rebuild its empire in Latin America and Southeast Asia has suffered a rapid succession of blows. Washington can still seize power but it lacks the talent and the favorable conditions to hold it. 
The vision of a Brazilian state, build on the edifice of the privatized oil giant, Petrobras, and the political incarceration of its left adversaries, with foreign capital attracted and seduced by political procurers, pimps and prostitutes, has ended in a debacle. 
In this vacuum, it will be up to the new governments and peoples’ movements to seize the opportunity to advance their struggles and explore political and economic alternatives. The aborted rightist power grab inadvertently has done the peoples’ movements a great favor by exposing and ousting the corrupt and compromised center-left regimes opening the door for a genuine anti-imperialist transformation.

2995,"Julian Assange: ’When You Read a Newspaper Article, You Are Reading Weaponized Text’ - Breitbart","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange recently discussed the topic of “fake news” and how WikiLeaks’ pure   approach has prevented them from becoming “weaponized text. ”[CNET reports that Assange appeared via   in a discussion with Australian comedian Chas Licciardello in Sydney, Australia this week. During the interview, Assange discussed the idea of “fake news” and how WikiLeaks’ refusal to editorialize their content and rather provide pure data to the public has allowed them to publish facts without bias.  “What is special about WikiLeaks is that it’s not just another damn story,” said Assange, “it’s not just another damn journalist putting their damn byline, advertising themselves and their position on another damn story. ” “You’re not reading   knowledge,” Assange said in discussing WikiLeaks vast database of information. “When you read a newspaper article, you are reading weaponised text that is designed to affect a person just like you  …     I think that is the real beauty of WikiLeaks  …     it is that sea of information, that treasure, that intellectual treasure, that rebel library of Alexandria you can go into. ” Surprisingly, Assange said that he was quite happy to see the narrative of “fake news” being pushed by the media, claiming so far WikiLeaks has a 100% correct record when it comes to verifiable information. “When the narrative of fake news came out and was then taken off effectively by the   press and pushed around  …     I could see exactly where that was going. I was rather happy about it,” Assange said. “WikiLeaks is very happy that there is a narrative about fake news out there because we have a perfect record of having never got it wrong in terms of authentications. ” “The real value in WikiLeaks is it is a wonderful library that you can trust  …     But the library has to be marketed. And so the   business, which we’re also in  —   I view that as a kind of marketing effort for what is much more substantial, which is our archive,” he continued. “We try and maximize the value of the information to readers. So that’s publishing it at the moment when they most want to read it, when they most want to know what it contains. And that’s definitely before an election rather than after election. ” When asked about the accuracy of the released emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Assange said, “We had lots of critics in the Democratic Party, liars in the Democratic Party  …     saying that what we published was not accurate  —   trying to imitate it, sometimes saying it directly. And of course we could mathematically prove that they were liars. And it’s not every day that you can mathematically prove that your critics are full of it. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

2998,Oregon Man Accused of Trying to Shove Co-Worker Inside Wood Chipper,"An Oregon man who worked for a tree service company is accused of trying to shove his coworker inside a wood chipper. [Scott Edward Iverson, 26, of Stayton, is being charged with attempted murder and   assault, WSB reported.  Police say that Iverson was with several other coworkers at a job site Thursday when he allegedly approached the victim, who was loading brush into the wood chipper, from behind. Iverson allegedly put him in a chokehold and pushed his upper torso into the mouth of the wood chipper. KPTV reported that the victim told police he tried to fight off Iverson while Iverson made another alleged attempt to shove his body into the machine —  this time, head first. The station reported that another employee saw what was happening and intervened in the situation, separating Iverson from the man. Iverson fled the scene, but police found him the next day in a restaurant in Stayton.

2999,NY Times: Trump Supporters are Threatening a ‘Violent Revolution’ if Hillary Wins,"The propaganda popsicle stand that is The New York Times is floating the idea that Trump supporters are calling for a new American Revolution if Hillary wins. 
But beneath the cheering, a new emotion is taking hold among some Trump supporters as they grapple with reports predicting that he will lose the election: a dark fear about what will happen if their candidate is denied the White House. Some worry that they will be forgotten, along with their concerns and frustrations. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict. 
Jared Halbrook, 25, of Green Bay, Wis., said that if Mr. Trump lost to Hillary Clinton, which he worried would happen through a stolen election, it could lead to “another Revolutionary War.” 
“People are going to march on the capitols,” said Mr. Halbrook, who works at a call center. “They’re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there.” 
“If push comes to shove,” he added, and Mrs. Clinton “has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.” 
What’s ominous about this level of programming is that we know the system is already gearing up for this possibility with an election military drill that could go live at any time until a month after the election, as previously reported: 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
It appears that the system is gearing up to handle outbreaks of violence, chaotic rallies and poll stations, and the possibility that the people of the United States may become very dissatisfied with the outcome by using military force and martial law. 
The drill could, of course, go live at any time; Homeland Security and the military are prepared to contend with a period of unrest, and restore order to a divided and broken country – regardless of whether people like their new leader or not. 
As you know, DHS is already monitoring this election and prepared to take over its ‘critical infrastructure’. The scope of this drill would, of course, take things much further: 
Hi Guys, 
I got some gouge from a former military colleague who is in contact with active duty personnel and he received an email about an upcoming drill. We need confirmation on this, but if we put it out there we might get a leaker to come forward and confirm: 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre. 
2nd Phase: LROL (Limited Rule of Law) – Military/FEMA consolidating resources, controlling water supply, handing out to public as needed. 
3rd Phase: AROL (Authoritarian Rule of Law) – Possible new acronym or term for “Martial Law”. Curfew, restricted movements, basically martial law scenario. 
Source said exercise involves FEMA/DHS/Military 
If the Powers That Shouldn’t Be are planning to steal this election for Hillary as hard as it appears they are , then it makes sense they’d be planning to try and clean up their mess afterward. 
Either way, the people have about reached their limit and are sick and tired of this level of corruption coming out of this government… and we know what happened the last time America finally got fed up with a tyrannical government.

3000,High School Senior Headed for the Army Not Allowed to Wear Army Sash at Graduation - Breitbart,"A California high school senior headed for the Army is not allowed to wear an Army sash with his robe and mortarboard at his graduation Friday. [Elias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U. S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his school’s policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.  “It means something really honorable to me, it’s a whole new life transition to me,” Elias said. Elias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed. “It’s kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness,” Joe said. “We push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, ‘We need you all to be the same because we don’t want to hurt anyone else’s feelings. ’” His father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to “open community dialogue” about the situation. “We’re simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change,” Joe said. The Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military. “We are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support,” a spokesperson for the district said. Although Elias says he is not happy about not being able to wear the sash, he is “committed to following every order they give” him since he is not one to stray from the rules. The school said that students can wear sashes during other graduation events and before and after the ceremony. A high school senior in Indiana was also told not to wear her Army sash at graduation May 25 because the school district wanted to focus on “high school accomplishments” at the graduation ceremony. In 2016, a Maine high school senior was told by his school’s superintendent that he could not display his Army sash at graduation, but could display it at the school’s senior awards ceremony.",0

3002,What Happened to the FBI?,"Share This 
When FBI Director James Comey announced on July 5 that the Department of Justice would not seek the indictment of Hillary Clinton for failure to safeguard state secrets related to her email use while she was secretary of state, he both jumped the gun and set in motion a series of events that surely he did not intend. Was his hand forced by the behavior of FBI agents who wouldn’t take no for an answer? Did he let the FBI become a political tool? 
Here is the back story. 
The FBI began investigating the Clinton email scandal in the spring of 2015, when The New York Times revealed Clinton’s use of a private email address for her official governmental work and the fact that she did not preserve the emails on State Department servers, contrary to federal law. After an initial collection of evidence and a round of interviews, agents and senior managers gathered in the summer of 2015 to discuss how to proceed. It was obvious to all that a prima-facie case could be made for espionage, theft of government property and obstruction of justice charges. The consensus was to proceed with a formal criminal investigation. 
Six months later, the senior FBI agent in charge of that investigation resigned from the case and retired from the FBI because he felt the case was going ""sideways""; that’s law enforcement jargon for ""nowhere by design."" John Giacalone had been the chief of the New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., field offices of the FBI and, at the time of his ""sideways"" comment, was the chief of the FBI National Security Branch. 
The reason for the ""sideways"" comment must have been Giacalone’s realization that DOJ and FBI senior management had decided that the investigation would not work in tandem with a federal grand jury. That is nearly fatal to any government criminal case. In criminal cases, the FBI and the DOJ cannot issue subpoenas for testimony or for tangible things; only grand juries can. 
Giacalone knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would be toothless, as it would have no subpoena power. He also knew that without a grand jury, the FBI would have a hard time persuading any federal judge to issue search warrants. A judge would perceive the need for search warrants to be not acute in such a case because to a judge, the absence of a grand jury can only mean a case is ""sideways"" and not a serious investigation. 
As the investigation dragged on in secret and Donald Trump simultaneously began to rise in the Republican presidential primaries, it became more apparent to Giacalone’s successors that the goal of the FBI was to exonerate Clinton, not determine whether there was enough evidence to indict her. In late spring of this year, agents began interviewing the Clinton inner circle. 
When Clinton herself was interviewed on July 2 – for only four hours, during which the interviewers seemed to some in the bureau to lack aggression, passion and determination – some FBI agents privately came to the same conclusion as their former boss: The case was going sideways. 
A few determined agents were frustrated by Clinton’s professed lack of memory during her interview and her oblique reference to a recent head injury she had suffered as the probable cause of that. They sought to obtain her medical records to verify the gravity of her injury and to determine whether she had been truthful with them. They prepared the paperwork to obtain the records, only to have their request denied by Director Comey himself on July 4. 
Then some agents did the unthinkable; they reached out to colleagues in the intelligence community and asked them to obtain Clinton’s medical records so they could show them to Comey. We know that the National Security Agency can access anything that is stored digitally, including medical records. These communications took place late on July 4. 
When Comey learned of these efforts, he headed them off the next morning with his now infamous news conference, in which he announced that Clinton would not be indicted because the FBI had determined that her behavior, though extremely careless, was not reckless, which is the legal standard in espionage cases. He then proceeded to recount the evidence against her. He did this, no doubt, to head off the agents who had sought the Clinton medical records, whom he suspected would leak evidence against her. 
Three months later – and just weeks before Clinton will probably be elected president – we have learned that President Barack Obama regularly communicated with Clinton via her personal email servers about matters that the White House considered classified. That means that he lied when he told CBS News that he learned of the Clinton servers when the rest of us did. 
We also learned this week that Andrew McCabe, Giacalone’s successor as head of the FBI Washington field office and presently the No. 3 person in the FBI, is married to a woman to whom the Clinton money machine in Virginia funneled about $675,000 in lawful campaign funds for a failed 2015 run for the Virginia Senate. Comey apparently saw no conflict or appearance of impropriety in having the person in charge of the Clinton investigation in such an ethically challenged space. 
Why did this case go sideways? 
Did President Obama fear being a defense witness at Hillary Clinton’s criminal trial? Did he so fear being succeeded in office by Donald Trump that he ordered the FBI to exonerate Clinton, the rule of law be damned? Did the FBI lose its reputation for fidelity to law, bravery under stress and integrity at all times?

3003,Samsung to Buy Harman International in an $8 Billion Bet on Cars - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   Samsung Electronics is spending $8 billion to get inside your car. Samsung, the South Korean electronics giant  —   which already makes popular but recently   smartphones  —   said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Harman International Industries, an American automotive technology company, in an ambitious push into a whole different kind of mobile. Harman is best known for making car audio systems under brand names popular with audiophiles such as   and JBL. But Harman’s appeal to Samsung comes from what it calls its connected car business  —   an operation that supplies a car’s navigation services, its onboard entertainment systems and its connectivity to the rest of the world. “The vehicle of tomorrow will be transformed by smart technology and connectivity in the same way that simple feature phones have become sophisticated smart devices over the past decade,” Young Sohn, the president and chief strategy officer of Samsung Electronics, said in a news release. The deal marks the latest ambitious foray by an established name in the technology world into a new generation of smart objects sometimes collectively called the internet of things. Under this vision, everything from home security systems to refrigerators will be connected to the internet, gathering data and controllable at the touch of a smartphone icon. Much of that focus has come down to cars. Last month, the American chip maker Qualcomm agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductors for $38. 5 billion, which would give it a presence in the market for making a new generation of chips for smart cars. With cars likely to get more screens and more computers, the purchase gives Samsung a stake in what could be an industrywide boom. It also could provide insight for the company’s varied components businesses. Samsung can learn firsthand from Harman what it needs to do to sell its screens, chips and memory to carmakers. Other major technology names are also betting on mobile and smart gadgets. In July, SoftBank of Japan struck a deal to acquire ARM Holdings, a British chip designer with a focus on mobile devices, for $32 billion. Last year, Avago Technologies bought Broadcom, which provides chips for the Apple iPhone, for $37 billion. It is far from certain whether those technologies will end up being the ones that power the smart gadgets of tomorrow. Apple and Google have expressed interest in developing cars, while traditional automotive suppliers have also looked to move up the value chain. Samsung’s $   offer for Harman represents a 28 percent premium from where its shares traded on Friday, but that is still well below the roughly $145 that each Harman share was fetching early last year. Harman’s results from its professional solutions business  —   which makes sound and lighting for concerts and other events  —   have weakened. The company has said it will work to bring the operations back to their previous strength. Samsung has largely benefited from the new mobile world, as growing demand for smartphones bolstered sales of its displays and microchips. But the company has faced difficulties selling its own branded phones, including a drop in market share, as Apple captured more of the high end and a new generation of   Chinese manufacturers increased pressure on the bottom. The company regained some ground with the Galaxy 7 line of curved phones. But last month, in an embarrassing turnabout, it discontinued its new, premium Galaxy Note 7 after several caught fire. The stumble wiped $2 billion off its profit and cast a shadow over the Samsung brand name. The deal for Harman is a rare one for Samsung, which keeps tight control of its supply chain  —   often owning its suppliers outright  —   and has mostly eschewed big deals to fill in holes in its portfolio. Samsung said that it would also have access to Harman’s designers and engineers, which would allow for more collaboration. It did not give details on what sorts of services they would aim to build together. It said that Dinesh Paliwal, Harman’s chairman and chief executive, would continue to run the operation, and that it would keep the company’s facilities. The deal is expected to close in  . Samsung was advised by Evercore, with Paul Hastings as legal counsel. JPMorgan and Lazard advised Harman, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz as legal counsel.",0
3004,Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction,"Teens walk free after gang-rape conviction Judge said group who left girl, 14, for dead appeared 'repentant' Published: 20 mins ago 
(Deutsche Welle) In the wake of the news that a group of teenagers were unlikely to see any real punishment for gang-raping a 14-year-old girl and leaving her for dead, citizens of the German city of Hamburg called for new rules regarding violent crime committed by minors. On Monday, an online petition calling for the teens to see jail time had garnered some 21,000 signatures. 
“The sexual self-determination and integrity of a woman must have more weight than any concern for the perpetrators,” [of sexual crimes,] says the petition. 
According to an update on the Change.org petition, state prosecutors in Hamburg have said they will explore a way to make sure that the teens are punished despite laws that make it difficult for minors to be prosecuted and sentenced to detention.",0
3005,Kiefer Sutherland Returns. This Time the Oval Office Is His. - The New York Times,"TORONTO  —   Kiefer Sutherland was playing tour guide. On the set of the new ABC series “Designated Survivor” here earlier this month, he clutched a pack of Camels and walked,   slapping, through a replica of the West Wing, pointing out where the president’s chief of staff sits, running his hand along the curved wall of the Oval Office. In front of a painting of George Washington, he offered this historical nugget: “He was actually quite handsome but the painter hated him. Unflattering. ” Later, while ruminating on President Washington’s dental problems, Mr. Sutherland stood in a hallway with his back to another presidential portrait: his own. The placard beneath read Tom Kirkman. After spending nearly a decade protecting the president on the Fox series “24,” Mr. Sutherland now requires his own detail. On “Designated Survivor” he plays a   cabinet member who ascends to the Oval Office when Congress is wiped out by an attack during a State of the Union address. The actor leaves behind the   antics of the counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer to play a policy wonk thrust into a job he never wanted. Mr. Sutherland hasn’t exactly disappeared since “24” ended its regular series run in 2010. Among other gigs, he did two “24”  projects, and appeared in   fare, including Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia,” and “Forsaken,” a western with his father, Donald Sutherland. And in August, he released his first album, “Down in a Hole,” filled with   country songs that he helped write. He’s been touring extensively, recently appearing at the Grand Ole Opry. But these have mostly been quiet endeavors, at least relative to the cultural noise generated by “24. ” Mr. Sutherland’s first network series   the   “Touch” on Fox, failed to find an audience, and was canceled after two seasons. If the public wants a repeat of Mr. Sutherland leading a slick drama that giddily seizes the   political moment, then “Designated Survivor”  —   a glossy   of political thriller, “The West Wing”  nation building and domestic drama  —   might be the show that delivers him back to the affections of the mainstream. Mr. Sutherland, 49, sat on a leather couch in the president’s private office  —   slight his arms tattooed prone to long, circular sentences  —   remarking on the difficulty of not appearing too presidential amid such surroundings (even if they are fake). “The set’s so good that you can’t help standing a little straighter,” he said. “There’s something about how significant that office is. We watched Kennedy’s kids play there, Nixon getting himself out of Watergate. It does have an impact on your performance. ” With an   narrative driving this election cycle, Mr. Sutherland’s respectful nostalgia for political office seems surprisingly  . Television politicians these days are mostly venal, their cutthroat egoism wrung for drama on “Scandal” and for laughs on “Veep. ” “BrainDead,” this summer’s satire from the creators of “The Good Wife,” targeted elected officials by planting   space bugs in their skulls. But “Designated Survivor” leans more toward the idealism of “The West Wing. ” David Guggenheim, a   writer known for “Safe House,” had long been intrigued by the concept of the designated survivor, the person in the presidential line of succession selected to wait in a secure, undisclosed location when all other members of government are gathered elsewhere. After his usually encouraging friend Simon Kinberg (a producer of films, including “The Martian”) expressed little enthusiasm about one of his movie pitches in a   email exchange, Mr. Guggenheim  —   hoping to redeem himself  —   pulled out the designated survivor idea and hit send. Mr. Kinberg loved it, and Mr. Guggenheim wrote the script in two weeks. They took it to Mark Gordon, a veteran producer (“Grey’s Anatomy”) who immediately envisioned Mr. Sutherland as the lead. “Most actors are known for the thing that made them famous,” Mr. Gordon said. “Jack Bauer was active and macho, but Kiefer’s actually such a gentle, gracious guy. He can be the idealized president that we all wish we had. ” In Hollywood, an Everyman in the White House is often played for laughs: Chris Rock in “Head of State” Kevin Kline in “Dave. ” But the “Designated Survivor” premise  —   an entire government up in flames  —   is   almost shockingly grim. Mr. Guggenheim needed Mr. Sutherland to tilt the story away from tragedy. “We were killing   people right off the top but I didn’t want the show to live in that darkness,” he said. “I did want Tom to represent optimism. We pointed Kiefer toward ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. ’” The   common sense that drives President Kirkman is, said Mr. Sutherland, a retort to cynics. “The lack of knowledge and understanding of how difficult it is to govern has led to some very poor ideas in our society,” he said. “Maybe showing the rebuilding of a government in action will help dial down the rhetoric that’s out there. ” Mr. Sutherland has found himself in the political fray before. “24” made its debut in November 2001 amid intense    anxiety. Jack Bauer’s propensity for grisly torture methods meant “24” was read by some as a revenge fantasy for a grieving country, and eventually criticized by others for wallowing in   violence at a moment where “enhanced interrogation techniques” became a national ignominy. “Once I was in an airport waiting to get on a plane and a woman looked at me and said: ‘How can you make that   show?’ It’s like: What are you talking about? We had the first   president on TV we had the first female president on TV,” Mr. Sutherland said. ‘‘When Jack Bauer was on his deathbed he didn’t ask for a priest he asked for an imam to apologize. I wish the show hadn’t become so politicized in the end, but I have no regrets. ” He may be particularly sensitive to the   label because in Canada he’s considered   royalty. To Americans, he’s known as Donald Sutherland’s son, but to many Canadians, he’s the grandson of Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier who brought universal health care to Canada and helped form the federal party that would become the   New Democratic Party. As children, Mr. Sutherland and his twin sister, Rachel, spent time in Canada’s parliament in Ottawa. “I remember eating hot dogs in the House of Commons and waiting for my grandpa,” he said. “I loved the debates. ” His mother, the actress Shirley Douglas, continued the activist tradition. In 1969, when she was involved with the Black Panther Party, she was arrested in Los Angeles, said Mr. Sutherland, not without pride. Mr. Sutherland’s parents divorced when he was 4, and Ms. Douglas relocated the family to Toronto four years later. The city now passes for his hometown he takes the subway to the suburban set every day, and his mother and sister live here. But as a student Mr. Sutherland attended six schools in five years. He dropped out at 16 when he was cast in the Canadian film “The Bay Boy,” arriving in Hollywood soon after. The welcome mat was out for   Packers: He roomed with Robert Downey Jr. and rose quickly, landing a string of 1980s hits: “Stand By Me,” “Lost Boys,” “Young Guns. ” “You think: ‘This is great, this is going to be the rest of my life.’ Then somewhere around 30 you get a knock back and realize, ‘Oh no, you should have held on tight. ’” He married and divorced young his daughter, Sarah Sutherland, now 28, plays Julia  ’s daughter on “Veep. ” The career lull of Mr. Sutherland’s early 30s was followed by “24,” a show that Natascha McElhone had never seen when she signed on to “Designated Survivor” as first lady. She didn’t know what friends meant when they joked: “Jack Bauer becomes president?” “Kiefer has large reserves of vulnerability,” she said. “There’s something quite breakable inside, which I think is not just endearing but unusual. He’s also quite a worker bee. ” An executive producer on the show, Mr. Sutherland has made suggestions that have been incorporated into it, including having Kirkman wear glasses (for a Clark Kent effect) and making Kirkman an independent (circumventing Republican and Democratic baggage) according to Mr. Guggenheim. For a Canadian with a green card, Mr. Sutherland is oddly smitten with the mythic American West. In the 90s, he had a ranch in Montana, and roped in rodeos, feeding on   country   like Merle Haggard and Johnny Cash. After listening to one of Mr. Sutherland’s early efforts at songwriting, his friend and writing   Jude Cole, encouraged him to record. “I said: ‘There’s a heartbreaking quality to your voice. No, you’re not this fantastic singer, but there are a lot of smooth singers out there, and there’s not a lot of Kris Kristoffersons,’” Mr. Cole said. An actor who crosses over into music can invite mockery or oblivion, but Mr. Sutherland was willing to take that risk. After years of playing guitar in his trailer, and with Mr. Cole running a music label, Ironworks, he was ready to put his own music out there. “I was prepared for a brutal beating, but the nice thing about finally getting to the age where I’m at is, well, as long as they’re not going to kill me, O. K. ” (The reviews have been mostly positive, if begrudging: “  …    actually kind of decent,” read the headline on the A. V. Club’s take.) Loss and drinking are common themes the title track is about a friend who drank himself to death. Mr. Sutherland’s drinking has been a tabloid punch line in the past: In 2005, he hurled himself at a  decorated Christmas tree in a London hotel lobby and a D. U. I. arrest led to a brief jail stint. Yet he seemed ambivalent when asked if his relationship to alcohol had changed. “It’s been a part of my life, there’s no denying that,” he said. “It’s not something I do alone. I like going out with friends after work. It’s a way of letting loose. Having said that, I can tell you that if I look back on my life any of the negative things that have happened usually have [drinking] as a root cause, whether it was a D. U. I. or fighting, or a breakup, a relationship not working. There’s a price to pay for it. If you take a look at the songs, none of them are positive. ” As an actor, Mr. Sutherland is used to telling other people’s stories. But the album is intensely personal a “journal,” he has said. The song “Calling Out Your Name” is about his split from Julia Roberts in 1991. Even after decades in the public eye, Mr. Sutherland said he found this level of exposure new, and perhaps liberating. “I would never ordinarily be that confessional, and when I first got onstage, it took me a moment to surrender,” he said. “But when I did that became one of the great experiences of my life. I’m grateful for how gracious people have been. It’s affected how I approached this part. I could let a bit more of myself into the character. It’s more personal. ” Whether this incarnation of Kiefer Sutherland  —   or any  —   can ever eclipse one of the most   roles in television history, only the public will decide.",0
3006,The Editorialists Have Spoken Will Voters Listen? - The New York Times,"The Atlantic magazine has made only two presidential endorsements in its   history: one for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and one for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The third comes Wednesday afternoon, when the magazine posted an editorial endorsing Hillary Clinton for president and dismissing Donald J. Trump as “the most ostentatiously unqualified   candidate in the   history of the American presidency. ” For good measure, it calls him “a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a   and a liar. ” One day earlier, the Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter wrote, in his editor’s letter for the November issue, “Through word or action, Trump has promoted gun violence, bigotry, ignorance, intolerance, lying, and just about everything else that can be wrong with society. ” That came after USA Today made the first presidential endorsement in its history  —   or, more accurately, a “disendorsement,” as it came out against Mr. Trump (“unfit for the presidency”) but not for Hillary Clinton or some other alternative. This is the time in the election cycle when media columnists write about whether endorsements have much to do with the outcome. The answer is usually, if not always, “no. ” But the question takes on another dimension this year because of the sheer weight of the endorsements against Mr. Trump. They are overwhelmingly against him, and they just keep coming, in language that is notable for its blunt condemnation of the candidate and its “save the Republic’’ tone. The endorsements are coming not only from the usual mainstream media suspects but also from newspapers that either never before supported a Democrat or had not in many decades  —   The Dallas Morning News, The Arizona Republic, The Cincinnati Enquirer  —   or had never endorsed any presidential candidate, like USA Today. The Wall Street Journal has not gone there, at least not yet, but a member of its   editorial board has: Dorothy Rabinowitz, who called Mr. Trump “unfit. ” What’s most striking is the collective sense of alarm they convey  —   that Mr. Trump is a “dangerous demagogue” (USA Today) whose election would represent a “clear and present danger” (The Washington Post, The Cincinnati Enquirer) or, as The Atlantic editor Scott Stossel said in an interview Tuesday, “a potential national emergency or threat to the Republic. ” That’s the same base line the magazine used when it decided to break its founding vow to be “the organ of no party or clique” and endorse Johnson in 1964 and, more dramatically, Lincoln in 1860. And yet, for all the   dismay in America’s editorial boardrooms, a huge portion of the country just doesn’t see it the same way at all. National polls aren’t great for predicting the final outcome in the Electoral College. But they do capture the sense of the country. And right now The New York Times’s polling average  —   of various national surveys  —   shows that 41 percent of the country would choose Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton if the election were held now. (With 45 percent, she still holds an edge.) The split between editorial opinion and a significant portion of voters, especially Republican voters, has been around for decades. But this campaign takes that schism to a whole new level  —   not just because of the mix of publications weighing in against the Republican nominee but also because of the contrast between their apocalyptic view of a Trump presidency and his supporters’ belief that he will indeed “make America great again. ” Then again, as the language of the editorial warnings hits   decibel levels, so does the language of the attacks against the mainstream media. Mr. Trump is stoking those attacks, depicting the media as among the “special interests” that have “rigged the system against everyday Americans,” as he put it in New Hampshire last week. Which brings us to the question of how many minds it all changes.   Trump supporters will no doubt view the editorials as more evidence for Mr. Trump’s case that the media fix is in. Mr. Trump recently said as much when he celebrated the loss of subscriptions the more surprising Clinton endorsements have caused in some cases, saying in a Twitter post: “The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas  Arizona papers  now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!” (The Fox Business host Charles Gasparino provided one possible motive: “A jealously rooted hate” over his wealth, “his beautiful wives” and his television success.) A driving question is whether they factor into the mix with truly undecided voters. That is, and will remain, hard to determine. I did stumble upon some interesting data from Google, which can provide a sense of what people look for on its ubiquitous search engine. Searches for Mrs. Clinton spiked by nearly 50 percent in Dallas County after the Dallas Morning News recommendation in early September, though not as much as they did for the American swimmer Ryan Lochte  —   after his legal trouble in Brazil  —   or for the game between the Cowboys and the Giants. She trended in Cincinnati’s Hamilton County after The Enquirer’s endorsement, and in all of Arizona after The Republic’s endorsement, though data from Hamilton County shows she was behind subjects like “Clown Sightings” and “National Coffee Day” on the list. Mr. Stossel of The Atlantic said he was aware of the divide in the country. “People who support Trump have legitimate grievances and he is speaking to them in ways that clearly resonate,” he said. (The editorial, whose language was shaped by the Atlantic correspondent Jeffrey Goldberg, addresses them by saying that Mr. Trump failed to present “realistic policies to address” their “legitimate anxieties. ”) Mr. Stossel knows that the power of endorsements can be limited. But, he said, “One hopes that our endorsement, along with many of these others, will have an amplification effect that sort of ripples out. ” “If it affects only a few people at margins in a few key states,” he said, “that may make a difference. ” “Given our previous endorsements, we’re two for two,” he noted. The streak will stand or fall Nov. 8.",0
3007,"Lansing, Michigan, Will No Longer Declare Itself a ’Sanctuary City’","Michigan’s capital city rescinded its decision to declare itself a “sanctuary city” after the city council held a vote Wednesday evening regarding Lansing’s sanctuary status. [Lansing City Council voted   to reverse a decision made April 3 in a   vote that deemed the city a “sanctuary city” in writing, the Detroit Free Press reported.  A letter the city council received from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging the council to remove all references to “sanctuary city” from its resolution is behind the change in course, the Associated Press reported. The term “sanctuary city” has sparked much debate as some cities decide to fight President Trump’s decision to crack down on cities that refuse to have their law enforcement agencies cooperate with U. S. immigration authorities. “The term ‘sanctuary’ in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting  —   so distracting in my opinion that’s it’s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,” said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke. “It’s basically a ‘don’t ask’ policy, which was outlined by the mayor’s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. ” The council’s decision does not change the recent executive order penned by Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero, which prohibits Lansing police officers and city employees from asking about immigration statuses “except as required by federal or state statute or court decision,” M Live reported.",0
3008,"Breaking Trust, Breaking the Bank - The Inside Story of Russia's Biggest Bank Robbery - John Helmer","Reality check media Breaking Trust, Breaking the Bank - The Inside Story of Russia's Biggest Bank Robbery 
Benedict Worsley is implicated in the disappearance of $3 billion from the Trust Bank of Moscow Originally appeared at Dances with Bears 
Investigators searching for $3 billion in funds missing from Trust Bank of Moscow, the biggest Russian bank fraud in history, have found Benedict Worsley, the Cyprus-based manager of the bank’s offshore operations, at a heavily fortified house in the south of France, where he is guarded by British gunmen formerly employed by the British secret services. 
The High Court in London has revealed that in return for cash and a promise of immunity from prosecution, Worsley has agreed to cooperate in the search for the missing money. He is now reported to be employed by Otkritie Bank, which is being financed by the Central Bank of Russia, to operate the old Trust Bank. However, sources close to the Central Bank say that officials at the bank are anxious to see Otkritie start repaying the bailout loans, and reluctant to soften the terms or extend the repayment dates as Otkritie is reported to be requesting. Suspicion is also rife in Moscow banking circles, according to one source, that “ well-known names in high places were beneficiaries of the Trust Bank loans. They don’t want to be identified or obliged to repay. ” They, according to a Cyprus source and another in London, who knows Worsley, are “threats to Worsley, and he knows it.” 
Worsley refuses to respond to emails, and he has closed the Cyprus office of Teos Management, where until late last year, he used to manage Trust Bank’s loans through dozens of companies he created and directed, on instruction from the bank, its control shareholder Ilya Yurov, and others. Yurov has testified in the London court that he ordered forensic accountants to trace what had happened to the bank’s loan funds. The Russian state Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) amd Otkritie Bank have also been searching. To substantiate their application to the High Court for a freeze on Yurov’s assets in the UK and Switzerland, they have reportedly identified asset value and bank accounts worth $830 million. For more details of the Yurov scheme, read this . For the High Court records, click to open . 
One source for Worsley’s operations has not been made public before. This is the archive known as the Panama Papers , compiled by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington. According to the ICIJ, it obtained its “ data through three massive leaks. The largest one comes from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, whose inner workings were exposed in the Panama Papers investigation published in April 2016 in conjunction with Süddetsche Zeitung and more than 100 other media partners .” 
It is far from easy to find Benedict Worsley in the Panama Papers data base assembled by the ICIJ. For example, here is what turns up when the search box cue is Benedict Worsley . Most of the listed entities were either deactivated before Yurov took over Trust Bank, or are unconnected to both Russia and Cyprus, where Worsley and Yurov have operated. One entity, Benedict Investment Corporation, was created by GSL Law in Cyprus in 2002, and is still active. GSL is a Russian law firm, based in Moscow, which provides offshore services. It doesn’t appear to have been involved with Worsley and Trust Bank. 
However, Benedict Worsley can be found in the Panama Papers, not by searching for his name, but by searching for companies he created, managed, and directs still. In order to open Worsley’s file in the Panama Papers, it is necessary to know the names of several of his companies first. Some of these names have not been detected in the Cyprus searches before. 
Here is the asset map for Worsley in the Panama Papers archive:",0

3010,The Average American Has No Money,"Marc Faber Blog October 28, 2016 
They could essentially monetize everything, and then you have state ownership. And through the central banking system, you introduce socialism and communism, which is state ownership of production and consumption. You would have that, yes, that they can do. 
The BoJ owns more than 50 percent of Japanese ETFs (exchange traded funds), which own large parts of the underlying companies. So indirectly they may own 20 percent of the Japanese companies, and they can go up to a higher level. 
I don’t think the central bankers are intelligent and smart enough to understand the consequences of their monetary policies at present. They focus on inflation but in my view they shouldn’t do anything. They don’t focus enough on what it does to the average standard of living of the people, to the average household income. 
The developed market central banks can go on for quite some time.If Zimbabwe prints money, the pain is more obvious right away because if you are Zimbabwe, and you print money and the others don’t, and the currency collapses, and you feel the pain much sooner. 
If the major central banks, the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB), the BoJ, the Bank of England, and the Chinese monetize and print money in concert and agreement with each other, they all talk to each other; then the currencies don’t collapse against each other. There may be fluctuations, but we don’t have a general collapse of a currency. 
Paper money, in general, can then collapse, and it has to a large extent against asset prices like real estate around the world over the last 30 years, against equity prices, against bond prices—which have been rallying since 1981—and against precious metals since 1999. 
Asset price inflation is less obvious to the average person in the street. The average American has no money, so he doesn’t care if prices for paintings and real estate go up—until it touches him.",0
3011,Blog: Our Country Has Become Worryingly Desensitized To Violence In Hot-Sauce Names,"Email 
As a parent, you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her. I know that I won’t be able to protect my 9-year-old James from every bad thing out there, but on a recent trip to the grocery store, I was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend: Our country has become desensitized to violence in hot-sauce names, and it’s a big problem. 
You can’t walk down your grocer’s sauce isle without being bombarded by hot-sauce names that romanticize violence. Tears of Blood, Nuclear Bombardment Chile Extract, and Death on the Toilet have become standard fare in the hot-sauce industry. An innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers, and our impressionable children, to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh, brutal deaths, and massive ass damage. 
As soon as the hot-sauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like Cremation in a Bottle Pepper Sauce and Ass Grave Cajun Sauce to appear on store shelves, any shred of decency went out the window. An arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name, society be damned. And it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hot-sauce labels. 
Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. 
I took my son James to my favorite Mexican restaurant this past weekend, and he didn’t even blink when he saw a bottle with “Volcanic Crucification” written out in flames. If he isn’t bothered by this, who’s to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called Ghost Pepper Throat Thresher? 
I pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce. 
It wasn’t always like this. Hot sauce has always been hot, but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today. Names like Frank’s Red Hot let you know you were in for some serious heat, but left something to the imagination. But there is no longer a moral standard for hot-sauce names. Now, all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friend’s refrigerator door. 
Whether it’s Screaming Suicide Moruga Scorpion Sauce or Habanero Holocaust Sauce, the lengths to which today’s sauces are going to outdo one another with disturbingly violent names has gotten out of control. And if you’re a parent, you know that we must do something to stop this, before it’s too late for our children.",0

3013,"Amy Krouse Rosenthal, Children’s Author and Filmmaker, Dies at 51 - The New York Times","Amy Krouse Rosenthal, a prolific children’s book author, memoirist and public speaker who, dying of cancer, found an extraordinarily large readership this month with a column in The New York Times titled “You May Want to Marry My Husband,” died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 51. The cause was ovarian cancer, which she learned she had in September 2015, her agent, Amy Rennert, said. Ms. Rosenthal’s bittersweet paean to her spouse of 26 years appeared as a Modern Love column in the online Style section of The Times on March 3 and in the Sunday newspaper section on March 5. The column has drawn almost four and a half million readers online. “I want more time with Jason,” she wrote. “I want more time with my children. I want more time sipping martinis at the Green Mill Jazz Club on Thursday nights. But that is not going to happen. I probably have only a few days left being a person on this planet. So why I am doing this? “I am wrapping this up on Valentine’s Day,” she continued, “and the most genuine,    gift I can hope for is that the right person reads this, finds Jason, and another love story begins. ” Her husband said in a statement afterward, “When I read her words for the first time, I was shocked at the beauty, slightly surprised at the incredible prose given her condition and, of course, emotionally ripped apart. ” Since 2005, Ms. Rosenthal has written 28 spirited children’s picture books, two quirky, poignant memoirs (“Textbook Amy Krouse Rosenthal,” in 2016, and an alphabetized “Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life,” in 2005) delivered TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) Talks and NPR commentaries and produced short films and YouTube videos of what she called social experiments, with titles like “ATM: Always Trust Magic,” “The Money Tree” and “The Beckoning of Lovely. ” “I tend to believe whatever you decide to look for you will find, whatever you beckon will eventually beckon you,” she told one audience. She beckoned her readers and viewers. In a video called “17 Things I Made”  —   among them were her books and even a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  —   she welcomed fans to join her at Millennium Park in Chicago, on Aug. 8, 2008, at 8:08 p. m. to make an 18th thing. Hundreds showed up. “Amy ran at life full speed and heart first,” Maria Modugno, her editor at Random House, said in a phone interview. “Her writing was who she was. ” She started writing ad copy after graduating from Tufts University in 1987. After nine years at Foote, Cone  Belding (now FCB) Ms. Rosenthal was on maternity leave with her two toddler sons and infant daughter at McDonald’s when she experienced what she called a “McEpiphany,” deciding to become an author. What she described as her plastic fork in the road led to countless dead ends, however, until she published “Little Pea,” about a pod denied his favorite dessert (spinach) until he finished all his candy (which he detested). The book received favorable reviews, and her course was set. Her other books included “Spoon,” “Duck! Rabbit!” and “Little Oink. ” In The New York Times Book Review in 2009 Bruce Handy said of her work: “For all I know, she may suffer torment upon torment in front of a blank screen, but the results read as if they were a pleasure to write. ” He added, “Her books radiate fun the way tulips radiate spring: they are elegant and  . ” Amy Renee Krouse was born on April 29, 1965, in Chicago to Paul Krouse and the former Ann Wolk, both publishers. Both survive her. Besides her husband and parents, she is survived by her sons, Justin and Miles her daughter, Paris her sisters, Katie Froelich and Beth Kaufmann and her brother, Joe Krouse. “I was simply born with a fondness for letters and language and predisposed to enjoy playing around with them and it,” Ms. Rosenthal wrote in a memoir. Ms. Rennert, her agent, said Ms. Rosenthal had completed seven more picture books before her death, including a collaboration with her daughter called “Dear Girl. ” But even before her diagnosis, she suggested that her energy and imagination were not boundless. Her favorite line from literature, she once said, was in Thornton Wilder’s play “Our Town,” as spoken by the character Emily as she bids the world goodbye: “Do any human beings ever realize life while they live it?” When she reached 40, Ms. Rosenthal began calculating how many days she had left until she turned 80. “How many more times, then, do I get to look at a tree?” she asked. “Let’s just say it’s 12, 395. Absolutely, that’s a lot, but it’s not infinite, and I’m thinking anything less than infinite is too small a number and not satisfactory. At the very least, I want to look at trees a million more times. Is that too much to ask?”",0

3015,Gorsuch Supreme Court Nomination Gains More Democratic Support - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   A third Democratic senator announced his support on Sunday for President Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, though Republicans still face the difficult task of gaining enough Democratic votes to confirm Judge Gorsuch without potentially having to change longstanding Senate practice. The senator, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, is among a group of 10 Democratic senators who represent states that voted for Mr. Trump and who are up for   in 2018. So far, two others  —   Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota  —   have announced their support for Judge Gorsuch. That leaves Republicans, who hold 52 seats in the Senate, five Democratic votes short of breaking any filibuster mounted by Democrats. If the Republicans do not have enough votes to break a filibuster, they could invoke the   nuclear option, allowing them to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees and hold a floor vote. Judge Gorsuch could then be confirmed by a simple majority. Mr. Donnelly said in a statement that he would vote for Judge Gorsuch because “he is a qualified jurist who will base his decision on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers. ” Mr. Donnelly said he believed that the Senate should keep the   threshold to end a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, said on the CBS program “Face the Nation” that he planned to decide Tuesday or Wednesday how he would vote. “I think the   margin requires some level of bipartisanship, and whether it’s on legislation or a major appointment like this, that it isn’t bad for the country that you have to have people and ideas that have some level of   from both parties,” he said. But Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana  —   a state won by Mr. Trump  —   said Sunday evening that he would oppose Judge Gorsuch, dealing a big blow to Republicans’ hopes of reaching 60 votes. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a vote for Monday on whether to send Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to the Senate floor. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that Judge Gorsuch would be confirmed this week. “How that happens really depends on our Democratic friends, how many of them are willing to oppose cloture on a partisan basis to kill a Supreme Court nominee  —   never happened before in history, the whole history of the country,” Mr. McConnell said. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said on the same program that Republicans would not secure 60 votes. “So instead of changing the rules, which is up to Mitch McConnell and the Republican majority, why doesn’t President Trump, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate sit down and try to come up with a mainstream nominee?” Mr. Schumer said. Mr. McConnell said any change to the precedent on filibustering Supreme Court nominees would not endanger the filibuster that can be used for legislation, calling it “a longstanding tradition of the Senate. ” Another Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn of Texas, defended Mr. McConnell’s approach. “If they filibuster Neil Gorsuch, they are going to filibuster everyone that this president might propose,” Mr. Cornyn said on “Face the Nation,” referring to Democrats. “They realize that this is their last gasp to try to prevent him from being confirmed. But they won’t. ” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri  —   a state that voted for Mr. Trump  —   announced Friday that she would oppose Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. Ms. McCaskill published a post on Medium in which she described the “difficult decision” she faced. “I am not comfortable with either choice,” she wrote, but then added: “I cannot support Judge Gorsuch because a study of his opinions reveal a rigid ideology that always puts the little guy under the boot of corporations. He is evasive, but his body of work isn’t. ”",0
3016,"Connie Kopelov, of First Same-Sex Couple Legally Married in New York, Dies at 90 - The New York Times","Connie Kopelov, whose wedding to Phyllis Siegel in 2011 was the first legal   marriage in New York City, died in Manhattan on Saturday. She was 90. Her death was confirmed by Ms. Siegel, who said Ms. Kopelov had been in the late stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Ms. Kopelov and Ms. Siegel had been partners for 23 years when they were married by the city clerk on July 24, 2011  —   the same day that a state law took effect allowing   couples to marry. That morning, Ms. Kopelov, then 85, and Ms. Siegel, 76, were the first couple through the door of the marriage bureau, on Worth Street in Lower Manhattan. The City Council speaker at the time, Christine C. Quinn, a lesbian and prominent gay rights activist, stood in attendance around 9 a. m. as the clerk, Michael McSweeney, said, “I now pronounce you married. ” Ms. Siegel held Ms. Kopelov’s head and kissed her on the left cheek. Ms. Kopelov smiled and held her marriage license aloft. “I lost my breath,” Ms. Siegel said in March, recalling the moment. “It was just the most exciting loss of breath I’ve ever had. I just was so happy. ” From that day on, Ms. Siegel said, people would stop them on the street and congratulate them. Constance Kopelov was born on April 14, 1926, in the industrial city of Kokomo, Ind. to Samuel and Bessie Kopelov. She graduated from Northwestern University in 1947 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and later earned a master’s from Goddard College in Vermont in 1974. In 1955 she moved from Chicago to New York City, where she held positions in  union organizations, including the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the Workers Defense League. Her work often focused on women’s issues, and she taught courses on women’s labor history at Cornell University and New York University. “She was always fighting for an issue,” Ms. Siegel said. “She was always for the underdog. ” Besides her wife, Ms. Kopelov is survived by a sister, Deborah Dorosin. Ms. Kopelov and Ms. Siegel met in the   through their involvement with an advocacy group, Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders. New York State’s legalization of   marriage followed a multiyear legislative battle that ended with the State Senate’s narrow approval of the Marriage Equality Act in June 2011. The law took effect one month later, on a Sunday, after which hundreds of gay and lesbian couples turned up at town halls and city clerks’ offices across the state. New York became the sixth and largest state to allow   couples to wed, a milestone that energized   advocates as they pushed their campaign across the country. Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution guarantees all Americans, including   couples, a right to marriage. In 2012, just shy of their first wedding anniversary, Ms. Kopelov and Ms. Siegel were honored as grand marshals of New York City’s Gay Pride Parade, along with the singer Cyndi Lauper and Chris Salgardo, the president of the cosmetics company Kiehl’s. The couple were chauffeured down Fifth Avenue in a lime green convertible.",0
3017,Nuclear weapons: how foreign hotspots could test Trump’s finger on the trigger,"November 11, 2016 Nuclear weapons: how foreign hotspots could test Trump’s finger on the trigger 
On Donald Trump’s first day in office he will be handed the “nuclear biscuit” – a small card with the codes he would need to talk to the Pentagon war room to verify his identity in the event of a national security crisis. 
Some presidents have chosen to keep the “biscuit” on them, though that is not foolproof. Jimmy Carter left his in his clothes when he sent them to the dry-cleaners. Bill Clinton had it in his wallet with his credit cards, but then lost the wallet. 
Others have chosen to give the card to an aide to keep in a briefcase, known as the “nuclear football”, together with a manual containing US war plans for different contingencies and one on “continuity of government”, where to go to ensure executive authority survives a first nuclear strike. 
The “biscuit” and “football” are the embodiment of the awesome, civilisation-ending power that will be put in Trump’s hands on 20 January. They only become relevant in very rare moments of extreme crisis, but a US president’s ability to manage crises around the world will help determine whether they become extreme.",0
3018,Mistrial for 2 Ex-Officers in Albuquerque Killing of Mentally Ill Man - The New York Times,"ALBUQUERQUE  —   After two full days of deliberations, a jury here announced on Tuesday that it had failed to reach a verdict in the murder trial of two former police officers for the 2014 shooting death of a homeless man with paranoid schizophrenia. “Police officers have a very difficult job,” the special prosecutor, Randi McGinn, said after the announcement. “The discussion we need to have as a community is, do we want a Dirty Harry or do we want a peace officer? This is the discussion we need to have here in Albuquerque. ” After polling the six men and six women on the jury, Judge Alisa Hadfield declared a mistrial. It was not immediately clear if prosecutors would seek another trial. The two former officers, Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, had each faced a   murder charge in the shooting of the man, James Boyd, who had been illegally camping on a craggy mountainside on the city’s east end. Mr. Sandy also faced a lesser charge of aggravated battery. “These are two good men,” Sam Bregman, one of the defense lawyers, said after the announcement. “Let these two good men get on with their lives. ” The case went to the jury on Thursday after 12 days of testimony. Halfway through the trial, Judge Hadfield granted a defense motion to dismiss voluntary manslaughter charges against Mr. Sandy and Mr. Perez, ruling that prosecutors had failed to provide enough evidence to support the charge. The case highlighted the challenges posed by the growing number of people with severe mental disorders who, in the absence of adequate mental health services, become entangled with the police. “These officers have suffered the consequences of decisions by elected official to not allocate sufficient resources for the mentally ill,” Mr. Bregman argued in his closing statement. Testifying that they used their training to guide the decisions they made on March 16, 2014, both former officers took the stand in their own defense  —   a rarity because of the risks it carries, said Douglas Colbert, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey School of Law who has written extensively about police misconduct. “Police testimony could eliminate a juror’s uncertainty and lead to conviction,” Professor Colbert said. On the other hand, “the officer may gain sympathy from the juror who now understands the officer’s tough,   decision to make or subjective fear or danger. ” Much of the encounter was registered on body and helmet cameras worn by some of the officers, including Mr. Perez. The video, when released, prompted large street protests here. Only three of the 12 jurors voted to convict the officers. Ms. McGinn said the division among them mirrored the split in the community, where some saw the actions in the video as justified and others did not. By the time the two officers arrived at the standoff with Mr. Boyd, the episode had been going on for more than two hours. His conversations with police officers had ranged from calm and humorous to delusional. Holding a pocketknife in each hand, Mr. Boyd repeatedly said that he had worked for the Defense Department and that he could get the officers killed “with a phone call. ” In his testimony, Mr. Perez, 35, drew a distinction between the images registered by his helmet camera and the encounter as he experienced it, using still frames from the video as his guide. When he arrived at 7:10 p. m. Mr. Perez said, Mr. Boyd went from calm to threatening “almost instantaneously,” and he refused to obey orders to drop the knives and get on the ground. “Going frame by frame like that, we’re able to pick apart every little detail,” Mr. Perez said. “The way it happened that day, it happened in the blink of an eye, at the speed of life. ” He told Ms. McGinn that he never saw Mr. Boyd lunge toward the officers but that he “had a feeling he was going to lunge forward. ” That distinction framed Ms. McGinn’s closing argument. The trial, she told jurors, was ultimately about the “  argument” that “anticipatory shootings” are justifiable and the “modern, 2014 version” that the police may not shoot unless someone is in fact attacking them. “Society gives police officers a tremendous amount of power,” Ms. McGinn said. “We give them guns  —   not just side arms, but long guns  —   and we give them a license to kill. But it is a limited license. ” Officers had hastily devised a plan to subdue Mr. Boyd before dark, but nothing appeared to go as expected. He stood unfazed when a   grenade exploded near him. Mr. Perez testified that from where he stood, Mr. Boyd seemed to be “within arm’s reach” of a K9 officer, Scott Weimerskirch, who was retrieving his dog. Mr. Boyd was, in fact, 10 feet away. Mr. Perez said he saw Mr. Boyd move a hand toward his waistband and “perceived an immediate, deadly threat. ” Mr. Sandy, who was standing behind Officer Weimerskirch, said Mr. Boyd pulled out his knives and took a slight step to the left. “He was going to try to flank us,” Mr. Sandy, 41, testified. “He was going to attack us from a different angle. That’s when I made the decision to shoot. ” Mr. Sandy and Mr. Perez each fired three shots, striking Mr. Boyd in the arms and back as he turned away from the officers, his backpack slung on his shoulder. Mr. Sandy retired after the shooting, and Mr. Perez was fired. During the trial, Ms. McGinn portrayed Mr. Sandy differently from Mr. Perez. She began her   of Mr. Perez by thanking him for his service  —   he is a decorated Iraq war veteran who had a spotless record with the Albuquerque police until Mr. Boyd’s shooting. “I can’t tell you how sorry I am that you were sent up there into the mess some other officer created,” she told him. In contrast, she portrayed Mr. Sandy as an officer with a tarnished record, whose actions fueled the confrontation. Mr. Sandy spent time on the stand discussing his firing from the New Mexico State Police in 2007, after he was caught moonlighting while on the job. He also apologized for saying that he was going to shoot Mr. Boyd “with a Taser shotgun” almost as soon as he arrived at the scene.",0

3020,Of a Frog’s Slap Shot and Saliva - The New York Times,"You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva. But then, who even knew that frogs could play electronic games? So let’s start with that. Alexis C. Noel, a Ph. D. student in mechanical engineering at Georgia Tech, and her supervisor, David L. Hu, were watching a viral YouTube video in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an   game. It appears to be winning. They started wondering how  —   in reality  —   frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them, and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying. “It’s been an adventure ever since,” Ms. Noel said. First, the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye, requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot   video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta. Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue. Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university. “I needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva,” she said. With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction, the viscosity  —   or stickiness  —   of the saliva, and the softness of the tongue tissue, they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on. What they found was that frog saliva, which is normally 50, 000 times stickier than human saliva, flows freely when it hits an insect. That makes the saliva a   fluid, which means that the speed at which it flows (to be precise, its shear rate) changes how viscous it is. In the case of frog saliva, the faster it is forced to flow, the looser it gets. When the frog tongue hits a cricket, the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice. By the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back, in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack, the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket. There is one more step. The frog has to get the cricket unstuck and into its stomach. What helps here is that frog swallowing involves retracting its  eyeballs  —   so violently that it loosens up the saliva again. The researchers published their findings in Royal Society Interface. Dr. Hu said the detailed understanding of how the process worked had obvious applications for the growing field of soft robots made of very flexible materials. Not that they will have tongues, but they may need to grab and release  —   who knows what  —   with appendages more like tongues than metal claws. Ms. Noel said her research was “all about how you grab things with very soft surfaces. ” She is also studying cat tongues, for instance. They are covered in tiny little curved spikes, like claws, which, oddly enough, are very good at detangling snarls in fur.",0
3021,"OMB Director Mulvaney: Americans 1st Budget Increases Defense, Border Security, Education Funding, Cuts at State Department and EPA","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   On Wednesday Director Mick Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget gave some insight into the shift in department funding of President Donald Trump’s “America First Budget” ahead of its Thursday release. [“This is the America First Budget,” Mulvaney told reporters at a White House briefing. “In fact we wrote it using the President’s own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies. We talked to him and we wanted to know what his policies were and we turned those policies into numbers. ”  Mulvaney said increases like the $54 billion increase to the Defense Department would be offset in other areas of the budget blueprint to prevent any further increases in the budget deficit. The Director made clear that this does not mean that the budget is balanced. “There’s more money for enforcing security at the border. There’s more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. There’s more money for things like private and public school choice. ” The State Department and and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will also see cuts according to Mulvaney. He went on to say that reductions in the State Department were not a reflection of the President’s support, but rather that areas like foreign aid that face cuts, simply fall under the State Department portion of the budget. The State Department reductions will be around 28 percent according to Mulvaney. Mulvaney went on to state that the budget being released is not a full budget, but rather a blueprint and only deals with the portion of the budget that makes up discretionary spending. He said that those who oversee the various departments are being given great flexibility in managing funds within their own departments. He also stated that the core functions and beyond of the EPA can be satisfied with the dollars included in this budget. Asked if the budget assumes passage of the House Republican Leadership’s American Health Care Act, Mulvaney said generally no, adding that will be dealt with in a budget to be released in May. The budget to be released on Thursday morning will also show suggestion for ending funding for public broadcasting according to Mulvaney. NASA will see a very slight reduction in funding around one percent, but Mulvaney was clear that some areas within that area of the budget will see increases. He said space exploration remains among the President’s priorities. This budget will not be a    spreadsheet. Mulvaney said that the budget will show money allocated for moving forward with building a wall along the U. S. southern border. He said that the budget in May will show more, but that this budget includes allocation for pilot cases to find most cost efficient, safest and most effective ways to complete the wall. Director Mulvaney said that the budget will be available online starting at 7 a. m. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana ",0
3022,WikiLeaks Expose Hillary Clinton’s Daytime Drinking,"Hillary Clinton spent a whole afternoon drunk and unresponsive while her campaign staff tried to reach her, a new WikiLeaks email reveals. 
Via YourNewsWire 
An Aug. 8, 2015, email exchange with the subject “Have you sent her the docs?” between campaign chairman John Podesta and top aide Jennifer Palmieri revealed the two discussing whether to call Hillary and “sober her up some.”
John Podesta also suggested Hillary’s judgement might be impaired considering her drunken state. “Should I call her and talk this through or better leave with you?” Podesta asked at 2 p.m.
“I’m worried she’ll get on with Cheryl [Mills] and we’ll end up in a bad place.” Two hours later Palmieri decided it was time drunk Hillary was roused from her unresponsive state. “I think you should call her and sober her up some,” she said.

3023,It’s Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post,"It’s Over For Hillary After People See What She Snuck In Her Online Post Posted on November 1, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton 
Social media seems to be a tricky tool for Hillary Clinton, as she made a major mistake in what she shared online when she was either inebriated or hopped up on medication to treat what’s been plaguing her throughout this election. Shocked viewers couldn’t believe what was seen in her post, which she didn’t catch until it was way too late. 
Although we’ve seen how good Hillary is at hitting the “delete” button, she didn’t get to it quick enough after what she mindlessly posted that proved what Americans have suspected. Evidently, she didn’t realize she was making a point against herself when she made the comment with the post that said, “A guide to help you make your choice for president,” which mad the mistake all the worse for her. 
Either Hillary takes full responsibility for being corrupt by apparently admitting to it, or the person that does her social media is paying a big price today. Without reading what she was sharing, Hillary blindly posted an article from the super liberal news site, Slate, assuming that if it was from them, it was pro-Hillary, when the title of the piece called her out for being one of the “most corrupt, least popular candidates of all time.” A guide to help you make your choice for president. https://t.co/QzK7XZYmJW 
— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Urging her followers in the comment with the post to use it as a guide for making the best presidential pick, it was the best and most honest advice she’s ever given. It’s for this reason that the post was likely an accident since we all know that Hillary is incapable of being truthful, but karma, in this case, ensured she was. The irony of the situation isn’t lost on conservatives but apparently was on Slate, whose piece was actually meant to promote the Democratic candidate but came across as just the opposite. 
The truth has a sneaky way of coming out as it did in this headline, which calls attention to this woman’s lack of character and qualifications for the presidency. For once, there’s finally some common ground conservatives have found within this liberal publication’s pages, and that’s that Hillary Clinton is corrupt and incapable of being a leader.",0
3024,Mexican Cartels Ramp Up Smuggling near Texas Border,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   The drug cartels that operate in this border city have kicked up their drug trafficking and human smuggling activities since the new year began. [The increase in criminal activities has been reflected in the seizures made by state officials where drug cartels have resorted to primarily using large shipping trucks and passenger buses to conceal their actions.   Drug traffickers have been using large trucks, passenger vehicles, and passenger buses to move product into this border city. Once here, the criminals hide their wares in stash houses until the “pateros” or smugglers are able to get their merchandise into Texas.  Since the beginning of 2017, federal and state authorities have begun setting up checkpoints in the various highways that lead to this city. The checkpoints have been designed with the intent of stopping the smuggling routes into this border city and on to Eagle Pass, Texas. Inside the stopped, vehicles authorities have found marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs. Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “J. M. Martinez” from Piedras Negras, Coahuila. ",0
3025,Confronting China      : Information," Confronting China By John Pilger
 TJC: Please tell us about your new film, The Coming War on China .
JP: The Coming War on China is my 60th film and perhaps one of the most urgent. It continues the theme of illuminating the imposition of great power behind a facade of propaganda as news. In 2011, President Obama announced a pivot to Asia of US forces: almost two-thirds of American naval power would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific by 2020.
The undeclared rationale for this was the threat from China, by some measure now the greatest economic power. The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, says US policy is to confront those who see Americas dominance and want to take that away from us.
The film examines power in both countries and how nuclear weapons, in American eyes, are the bedrock of its dominance. In its first chapter, the film reveals how most of the population of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific were unwittingly made into nuclear guinea pigs in a programme whose secrets  and astonishing archive  are related to the presence of a missile base now targeting China. The Coming War on China will be released in cinemas in the UK on December 1st and broadcast on ITV (in the UK) on December 6th.
TJC: How do you assess Australias role in Americas Pivot to Asia?
JP: Australia is virtually the 51st state of the US. Although China is Australias biggest trader, on which much of the national economy relies, confronting China is the diktat from Washington. The Australian political establishment, especially the military and intelligence agencies, are fully integrated into what is known as the alliance, along with the dominant Murdoch media. I often feel a certain sadness about the way my own country  with all its resources and opportunities  seems locked into such an unnecessary, dangerous obsequious role in the world. If the pivot proceeds, Australia could find itself fighting, yet again, a great powers war.
TJC: With regards to the British and American media, how can the US get away with selling China as a threat when it is encircling China?
JP: Thats a question that goes to the heart of modern-day propaganda. China is encircled by a noose of some 400 US bases, yet the news has ignored this while concentrating on the threat of China building airstrips on disputed islets in the South China Sea, clearly as a defence to a US Navy blockade.
TJC: Obamas visit to Japan, and particularly to Hiroshima, was a really cynical act. What was your impression of Japan and the political situation there?
JP: Japan is an American colony in all but name  certainly in terms of its relationship with the rest of the world and especially China. The historian Bruce Cumings explores this in an interview in the film. Within the constraints of American dominance, indeed undeterred by Washington, Japans current prime minister Shinzo Abe has developed an extreme nationalist position, in which contrition for Japanese actions in the Second World War is anathema and the post-war peace constitution is likely to be changed.
Abe has gone as far as boasting that Japan will use nuclear weapons if it wants. In any US conflict with China, Japan  which last year announced its biggest ever defence budget  would play a critical role. There are 32 US military installations on the Japanese island of Okinawa, facing China. However, there is a sense in modern Asia that power in the world has indeed moved east and peaceful Asian solutions to regional animosities are possible.
TJC: Do you think the new trade and investment deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and especially the Transpacific Partnership (TPP) will affect Chinas business operations?
JP: Its difficult to say, but I doubt it. What is remarkable about the rise of China is the way it has built, almost in the blink of an eye, a trade, investment and banking structure that rivals that of the Bretton Woods institutions. Unknown to many of us, China is developing its New Silk Road to Europe at an astonishing pace. Chinas response to threats from Washington is a diplomacy thats tied to this development, and which includes a burgeoning alliance with Russia.

3026,CNN’s Chalian: ’There are People in This Government’ Who Are ’Pretty Committed’ to Taking Trump Down - Breitbart,"While discussing the New York Times’  report that President Trump called FBI Director James Comey a “nutjob” and told Russian officials that firing Comey relieved “great pressure” on Friday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Situation Room,” CNN Political Director David Chalian argued the Trump White House does have a point about leaks, and that while “It’s not going to save them from their real legal and political troubles,” “there are people in this government who seem pretty committed to taking him down. ”  Chalian began by saying, “We saw that the White House tried to explain what he meant by pressure was that the grandstanding and politicization of Comey put such pressure  —   nobody is going to buy that excuse.   …     They  —   clearly, the president is saying here that he felt pressure was alleviated on this investigation by getting rid of Comey. So, that’s going to be legal problem one, potentially. ” He continued, “Secondly, think about this, Wolf. This is extraordinary. This is the official government document of a meeting of the president of the United States and Russian officials inside the Oval Office, and it’s being read to a New York Times reporter. They have a point about leaks. It’s not going to save them from their real legal and political troubles, but it is extraordinary to see and another warning sign to Donald Trump that there are people in this government who seem pretty committed to taking him down. ” Later on, Chalian added that Trump has “gone back and forth” about his rationale for firing Comey.

3027,U-Turn: Merkel Considers Annual Migrant Number Cap,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party is considering setting a flexible limit on the number of migrants allowed into the country each year. [In 2015, as the migrant crisis gathered pace, Mrs. Merkel told the German people there was “no limit” to the number of migrants she was prepared to allow into Germany annually.  The possible change in policy follows a similarly stark shift in rhetoric from the chancellor towards mass migration and Islam in the past months  —   after her party suffered losses to the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in local elections and Mrs. Merkel prepares to stand for a fourth term as chancellor later this year. The CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) has also been pressuring for change, and the chancellor will need their support to win power this year. The CSU is advocating a 200, 000 limit, which has been rejected by Mrs. Merkel in favour of a less rigid “breathing benchmark”. CSU MP Stephan Mayer and his colleague Armin Schuster of the CDU wrote in a letter to the chancellor and CSU leader Horst Seehofer that “the proposal envisages a concept for the establishment of a ‘breathing’ benchmark for the possible admission of people in need of protection in Germany”. “I believe it is in the interests of both the CDU and CSU sister parties that we enter the federal election campaign united,” Mr. Mayer told CSU members at an annual retreat, according to Die Welt. At the beginning of December, the chancellor shocked many by announcing she believes the full Islamic face veil, or “burqa” has no place in her country and should be banned. A few months previously, the chancellor’s party had their worst election result ever in the famously liberal capital of Berlin. The AfD, by contrast, saw huge gains in the city, receiving just under 15 per cent of the vote.",0
3028,"‘Chairman Cash’ – John Podesta is Paid $7,000 a Month by Foundation Run by Banker With Ties to Financial Crisis","Trending Articles: Trending Articles: ‘Chairman Cash’ – John Podesta is Paid $7,000 a Month by Foundation Run by Banker With Ties to Financial Crisis   Source: Michael Krieger, Liberty Blitzkrieg 
Last Friday, I published a post titled, John Podesta’s Sister-in-Law Lobbied For Raytheon While Hillary Was Secretary of State , which understandably got totally buried in the madness surrounding the latest FBI news. Here’s the first paragraph of that post: 
The Podesta family seems particularly adept at earning extraordinary sums of money via selling out the American public. Earlier this year, I highlighted how John Podesta’s brother Tony was paid $140,000 per month by the medieval monarchy of Saudi Arabia. After all, who cares about women’s rights when the pay is good? 
Indeed, it’s not just relatives of Podesta who know how to rake in the cash. John is no slouch either, as Politico explained in an article published earlier today. 
Here are a few excerpts: 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show. 

In February of last year, as Podesta was working to lay the groundwork for Clinton’s soon-to-launch campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he signed the contract with the Sandler Foundation, which was started by Herb Sandler and his late wife Marion Sandler. 
The contract — a copy of which was included in emails illegally obtained from Podesta’s Gmail account and disseminated Monday by WikiLeaks — is still active, according to Herb Sandler, who said that it calls for Podesta to provide advice on grant-making and other foundation functions. 
It’s unusual for the full-time chairman of a general-election presidential campaign to maintain an active side deal with a major donor to that campaign — let alone to raise money from that donor for the campaign. 
The WikiLeaks cache shows that Podesta provided Sandler with philanthropic advice and assortments of cheeses and pastas as gifts on the holidays, while Sandler offered all manner of political observations and once tried to get Podesta to arrange for former President Bill Clinton to write a blurb for a book written by one of Sandler’s friends. 
Lobster risotto? 
But Sandler brushed aside any concerns about potential conflicts of interest. 
“I have never asked for anything of any political person — zero requests ever,” Sandler said. “If they’re responsive, it’s because they regard me as thoughtful, and a major contributor to Democratic causes,” Sandler said, adding that Podesta “knows that he doesn’t get bullshit from me. He knows I have no hidden agenda. He knows that my values are similar to his and that we care about people and not the billionaires, even though I ended up by some crazy thing to be one.” 
Neither Podesta nor the Clinton campaign responded to questions about the contract. 
Herb Sandler’s Clinton-related giving picked up last December after a visit from Podesta. 
The campaign’s finance director Dennis Cheng responded “ Great!! ,” calling Podesta “#ChairmanCash.” 
“Chairman cash.” A new meme has just been born. 
The very next day, Sandler gave $1.5 million to Priorities USA Action, to which he has now given a total of $3 million, FEC records show. 
The family’s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that Herb and Marion Sandler ran for decades, a bank that became World Savings. It would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt, securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008. Not long before the burst and subsequent recession, the Sandlers sold the bank for $25.5 billion to Wachovia, earning $2.6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation. Wachovia was later acquired by Wells Fargo. 
The Sandlers met Podesta when they helped seed the Center for American Progress, the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of Democratic administration in exile during George W. Bush’s presidency. Tax filings show that the Sandler Foundation has donated more than $37 million over the years to CAP, which worked to support President Barack Obama’s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with Clinton. 
Center for American Progress…where have we heard that before? Oh yeah, in last week’s post, Dennis Kucinich’s Extraordinary Warning on D.C.’s Think Tank Warmongers , we learned: 
The self-identified liberal Center for American Progress (CAP) is now calling for Syria to be bombed, and estimates America’s current military adventures will be tidied up by 2025, a tardy twist on “mission accomplished.” CAP, according to a report in The Nation, has received funding from war contractors Lockheed Martin and Boeing, who make the bombers that CAP wants to rain hellfire on Syria. 
Remember peasants, war is ok if “liberals” do it. Now back to Politico … 
The WikiLeaks emails reveal that Podesta and his team at the Center for American Progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the Sandlers related to the 2008 housing collapse. That included an October 2008 “Saturday Night Live” sketch in which an actor playing Herb Sandler thanked members of Congress “for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity.” 
Podesta wrote to his colleagues that he’d talked to Herb Sandler, and “they are obviosly [sic] upset. Weird that snl should pick them out.” 
After doing some research, a subordinate replied that “it appears default rates on their stuff was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to almsot wachovia failure — athough herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions problems.” Sandler told POLITICO that any suggestion that his bank’s products contributed to the collapse were “a bunch of bullshit,” pointing out that their bank used a risk-averse approach to their loans, which had among the lowest default rate in the industry. 
But Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative nonprofit that monitors the giving of major liberal donors including Sandler, argued that Podesta’s newly revealed contractual relationship with Sandler stood in stark contrast to Clinton’s efforts to cast herself as tough on the financial industry. “This is another instance where the Clinton campaign has been revealed to have surprising links to some of the most dubious parts of the finance industry,” Walter said. 
The Sandlers’ philanthropy increasingly has focused on fighting financial inequality and the role of big money in politics — a subject about which Herb Sandler and Podesta emailed frequently, according to WikiLeaks. 
Interesting considering he is big money in politics, and seems to have no problem endlessly cheerleading the chosen candidate of America’s oligarchs. 
Sandler explained to POLITICO that during the process of working to launch the center, he realized “we had been picking his brain ad nauseum” for years without paying Podesta as a consultant — a scenario Sandler called “very unfair.” That led to the consulting contract, which Sandler cast as “a ripoff” for Podesta. “I’d pay a lot more for that advice,” Sandler said, calling Podesta “one the most intelligent, decent, thoughtful human beings I’d ever met.” 
In March, as Clinton’s Democratic primary campaign against Bernie Sanders grew increasingly bitter, Sandler emailed Podesta just to check up. 
“How are you?” Sandler wrote . “MIss you.” 
Call me crazy, but if he was really so focused on solving income inequality why wasn’t he supporting Bernie Sanders? 
But hey.",0

3031,Rep. Diaz-Balart: Liberals Against Trump Who Favored Obama’s Cuban Ban ’Hypocrites’ - Breitbart,"Florida Congressman Mario   attacked the “double standard and hypocrisy” of opponents of President Donald Trump’s executive order on migrants from   countries, noting that many did not oppose a similar move by President Barack Obama that stranded thousands of Cubans throughout the Western Hemisphere. [In a Monday post on Facebook, Rep.   ( .) issued a statement clarifying the conditions of President Trump’s executive order implementing a hold on allowing migrants from seven   countries to enter the United States. Noting that the “ban”  —   which has not stopped many from the seven nations who have cleared extra screening from entering the country  —   was “only temporary until the Trump administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries,” he added that he was disturbed by the lack of concern for Cuban refugees who suffered similar delays thanks to an Obama administration policy.  “I am struck by the double standard and hypocrisy of those who are offended by this executive order, but who failed to challenge President Obama when he took similar action against Cuban refugees,” Rep.   wrote, noting, “especially since President Obama’s action was meant to appease the Castro regime and not for national security reasons. ” Rep.   concludes by clarifying that the seven nations mentioned in President Trump’s executive order  —   Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Libya  —   were part of a list compiled during the Obama years, and not the product of   policy.  The Trump administration chose the nations singled out in the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015, adding an extra section on Syria given the rapid deterioration of that nation’s control of land in the face of a   Islamic State onslaught and civil war between the forces of dictator Bashar   and largely Sunni Muslim rebel groups. As Rep.   notes, the Obama administration policy toward Cuba did not have a national security rationale. In his last week in office, President Obama repealed a longstanding executive order policy known as “Wet   Foot,” which allowed Cubans who reach U. S. territory to remain here legally. The intent of the executive order was to protect Cuban refugees fleeing the political and economic oppression of the Communist Party that has ruled the island nation for over half a century. The execution of the “Wet   Foot” repeal occurred hastily, and confused Custom and Border Patrol (CBP) officers into detaining Cubans with legal visas to enter the United States for hours. Among these were many elderly Cubans who had procured legal tourist visas from the U. S. embassy in Havana in order to visit their relatives at home. Elderly Cubans with health problems later told media in Miami that they had been detained and interrogated for hours, often without food, for suspicious behavior like mentioning the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act. In addition to those stranded at airports with legal visas thanks to Obama’s   policy, thousands of Cubans attempting to reach the United States through Central America and Mexico now have no way to escape the dire conditions in detention centers in nations like Panama. This week, 18 Cuban refugees announced a hunger strike to be allowed to either move north or settle in Panama, neither of which they have been allowed to do. The Mexican government has also ramped up operations to deport Cuban refugees while publicly condemning the Trump administration for considering deportations of Mexicans illegal present in the United States. Rep.   appears to be alone among   members of the House of Representatives in highlighting the relative lack of support for Cuban refugees from the left compared to the outpouring of rage by small leftist groups in American airports this weekend. Rep. Carlos Curbelo ( .) for example, issued a “  ” statement, expressing hope that the Trump administration will modify its policies once a more streamlined mechanism for vetting refugees is put in place: One Miami Republican lawmaker, @RepCurbelo, has commented on Trump refugee order https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) January 28, 2017,  Reps. Ileana   ( .) and Albio Sires ( . J.) meanwhile, have vocally opposed parts of the executive order. “I object to the suspension of visas from the seven named countries and of the U. S. Refugee Admissions Program because we could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures,” the Congresswoman wrote in a statement on her website. Rep.   did add a statement similar to Rep. Curbelo’s, noting that the executive order is meant to be temporary. Rep. Sires has taken his objections further, supporting a bill to undo the executive order entirely. I signed onto @RepZoeLofgren SOLVE Act to rescind Pres. Trump’s executive order banning refugees  immigrants from certain Muslim countries,  —   Albio Sires (@RepSires) January 30, 2017,  The fifth   in the House of Representatives, West Virginia Republican Congressman Alex Mooney, has at press time not issued any statements regarding either the repeal of “Wet   Foot” or the Trump executive order.",0
3032,"The Many ""Truths"" on Syria: How Our Rivalry Has Destroyed a Country","In Syria, the only “truth” that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered.
“The United States has the power to decree the death of nations,” wrote Stephen Kinzer in the Boston Globe.
Kinzer’s article was entitled: “ The media are misleading the public on Syria .” In his piece, the scholar at a Brown University Institute contested that his country’s media misinformation on Syria is leading to the kind of ignorance which is enabling the American government to pursue any policy, however imprudent, in the war-torn Arab country.
The US government can ‘decree the death of nations’ with “popular support because many Americans — and many journalists — are content with the official story,” he wrote.
Kinzer, in principle makes a strong point. His article, however, was particularly popular among those who sees the Syrian government entirely innocent of any culpability in the ongoing war, and that Iran and Russia are at no fault whatsoever; better yet, their intervention in Syria is entirely morally-guided and altruistic.
That said, Kinzer’s assertion regarding the US government’s dangerous meddling in Syria’s affairs, renewed Cold War with Russia and ill-defined military mission in that country, is all true.
Neither is the US, nor its western and other allies, following rules of war nor adhering to a particularly noble set of principles aimed at ending that most devastating war, which has killed well over 300,000 people , rendered millions displaced and destroyed the country’s wealth and infrastructure.
So what is the truth on Syria?
In the last five and a half years, since a regional uprising turned into an armed rebellion—turned into civil, regional and international war—’the truth on Syria’, has been segmented into many self-tailored ‘truths,’ each promoted by one of the warring party to be the one and only, absolute and uncontested reality. But since there are many parties to the conflict, the versions of the ‘truth’ communicated to us via copious media, are numerous and, most often, unverifiable.
The only truth that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered. But, of course, each points to the other side for culpability of the ongoing genocide.
An oddly refreshing, although disturbing ‘truth’ was articulated by Alon Ben-David in the Israeli Jerusalem Post last year.
The title of his article speaks volumes: “ May it never end: The uncomfortable truth about the war in Syria .”
“If Israel’s interest in the war in Syria can be summarized in brief, it would be: That it should never end,” Ben-David wrote.
“No one will say this publicly, but the continuation of the fighting in Syria, as long as there is a recognized authority in Damascus, allows Israel to stay out of the swamp and distance itself from the swarms of mosquitoes that are buzzing in it.” Of course, Israel never truly ‘stayed out of the swamp’ , but that is for a separate discussion.",0
3033,President Trump to Appear on Golf Channel Tribute to Jack Nicklaus - Breitbart,"It’s well known President Trump loves gold.

3034,A Brother’s Crimes and a Sister’s Betrayal Make ‘Judas’ a Dutch Best Seller - The New York Times,"AMSTERDAM  —   When he read the   sample of Astrid Holleeder’s memoir, “Judas,” in the spring, the Dutch publisher Oscar van Gelderen said he knew he had sensational material in his hands. A gangster boss who has become a celebrity criminal. A sister who knows his secrets, and fears for her life. A criminal justice system unable to keep him behind bars without her help. And the back story of a childhood that was “dysfunctional to the max,” Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder is the sister of Willem Holleeder, convicted of the 1983 kidnapping of the Dutch beer millionaire Freddy Heineken. He has been in and out of prison for years, but never for murder, though Ms. Holleeder calls him a “serial killer” in her book. Because she got close enough to tape him and agreed to testify against him, he is on trial again, this time facing six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. Mr. van Gelderen’s instincts were right. The book, released in early November, has been the No. 1 best seller in the Netherlands for eight straight weeks, according to the Dutch   association CPNB. Rights have already been sold for publication in Danish, German and Swedish, and Little, Brown and Company in New York bought worldwide   rights this month. “Judas” is not a recounting of Mr. Holleeder’s famous misdeeds, but the story of a childhood that included regular beatings by an alcoholic father, and, later, of Mr. Holleeder’s   hold on his family. “In the writing, there’s this strangling feeling of a guy who is controlling everybody,” Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder, 51, a successful   lawyer, describes in chilling detail how, a year after their father’s death in 1991, Mr. Holleeder was released from prison and took his place as the family abuser. She recounts how painful it was to interact with him after the murder of her    Cor van Hout, Mr. Holleeder’s longtime friend and   in the Heineken kidnapping. She contends that Mr. Holleeder ordered that killing, and plans to testify to that effect in court. Ms. Holleeder has been observing the success of her book from the secret location where she has been living under protection since February, after an inmate in a   prison described being contracted by Mr. Holleeder  to arrange for the killing of Ms. Holleeder their sister, Sonja Holleeder, who was married to Mr. van Hout and a Dutch crime reporter who helped Astrid establish contact with the police. (Another brother, Gerard, has remained uninvolved in the case.) Astrid Holleeder agreed to speak with The New York Times only from a separate, secure location, and she said that she did not think she would ever be safe as long as her brother was alive. “He will not rest until we’re dead,” she said. “It’s about his pride. He cannot let his little sister take him down. ” Ms. Holleeder said that she wrote “Judas” as a kind of “last will and testament” for her daughter, who is 31 and has two children of her own. She said that testifying in court during the pretrial phase of the current case had so far felt ineffectual. (The trial is scheduled to begin in early 2017.) “I want to tell everything, but they haven’t given me the chance yet,” she said. “The book is just about how I feel, how we grew up, what in fact made me and my brother into the opponents that we are now. ” Even when the   manuscript was finished, Lebowski Publishers did not provide details of its contents to bookstores, for fear that Mr. Holleeder would try to prevent its release. But after the publisher disclosed information on a   television talk show the day before the book’s publication, the first print run of 80, 000 copies sold out immediately. About 400, 000 copies have been bought so far  —   a milestone in a country of about 17 million, where sales of 5, 000 copies are considered strong. “Judas” is a narrative in the present, with flashbacks to the Holleeders’ childhood. The account begins in January 2012, when Mr. Holleeder was released from prison after serving six years of a   sentence for extortion. Astrid Holleeder said she acted as a kind of consigliere for her brother  —   advising him on legal matters, arranging his safe house when he got out of prison and serving as a confidante  —   in an effort to get close enough to obtain material that she could share with the police. She started wearing a wire in 2013, and ultimately recorded hundreds of hours of conversations with her brother. Although the author describes the admiration she felt for her brother as a little girl, her adult attitude toward him is clear from an early passage in which she describes picking him up from a prison in Vught the last time he was released. “During his detention, my brother developed a serious heart condition,” she writes. “He barely survived, but he did because, as my mother used to say, a weed doesn’t perish. I was surprised he had a heart at all. ” Mr. Holleeder’s lawyers, Sander Janssen and Robert Malewicz, criticized the timing of the book’s publication. Mr. Holleeder has been back in the   prison in Vught since December 2014, but he has appeared regularly at pretrial hearings. “It’s not very favorable for any criminal case to have a book like this come out during the proceedings,” Mr. Janssen said by telephone. “You never know if a witness will tell you something because he or she knows about it, or because he or she read it in a book. ” Franklin Wattimena, a spokesman for the public prosecutor’s office, said that it learned about “Judas” only the day before it was released. The judges who will decide the case have said that they have not, and will not, read the book unless it is submitted as evidence. (There are no juries in the Netherlands trials are run, and decided, by three judges.) As for Mr. Holleeder, he reacted to the book with a brief statement for the panel of judges. “I have not terrorized my family,” he said. “If this book had not been about me, I would have been as shocked as everybody else is. What Astrid said is not the truth. ” Mr. van Hout, the   turned foe, once called Mr. Holleeder “Judas,” which inspired the title of the best seller. But today, Ms. Holleeder says she feels it is she who betrayed her brother. She said that she “hates” herself for turning against her brother, and that, in spite of everything, she still loves him. She said she knew, however, that it was necessary to speak out, “to end the problem for everyone else. ” “I betrayed him,” Ms. Holleeder said of testifying against him. “He trusted me with his life, he would tell me everything, and I was the only thing he had when he got out of prison. ” When the news broke that she would testify, she said she thought: “No, he cannot survive this. He’s fighting back, of course, but I don’t think he can win this time. ”",0
3035,Comment on Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside by Toby,"  Since 2011, VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network ; a group that operates over 50 plus media, information and service online sites for U.S. Military Veterans. Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside By VNN on October 31, 2016 The newly opened FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's private email server marks ""a potential Constitutional crisis"" for the country. 
Chicago Tribune 
Has America become so numb by the decades of lies and cynicism oozing from Clinton Inc. that it could elect Hillary Clinton as president, even after Friday’s FBI announcement that it had reopened an investigation of her emails while secretary of state? 
We’ll find out soon enough. 
It’s obvious the American political system is breaking down. It’s been crumbling for some time now, and the establishment elite know it and they’re properly frightened. Donald Trump , the vulgarian at their gates, is a symptom, not a cause. Hillary Clinton and husband Bill are both cause and effect. 
FBI director James Comey ‘s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious. 
This can’t be about pervert Anthony Weiner and his reported desire for a teenage girl. But it can be about the laptop of Weiner’s wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin , and emails between her and Hillary. It comes after the FBI investigation in which Comey concluded Clinton had lied and been “reckless” with national secrets, but said he could not recommend prosecution. 
So what should the Democrats do now? 

If ruling Democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern, they would follow a simple process: 
They would demand that Mrs. Clinton step down, immediately, and let her vice presidential nominee, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, stand in her place. 
Democrats should say, honestly, that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her home-brew email server from the time she was secretary of state, having Clinton anywhere near the White House is just not a good idea. 
Since Oct. 7, WikiLeaks has released 35,000 emails hacked from Clinton campaign boss John Podesta . Now WikiLeaks, no longer a neutral player but an active anti-Clinton agency, plans to release another 15,000 emails. 
What if she is elected? Think of a nation suffering a bad economy and continuing chaos in the Middle East, and now also facing a criminal investigation of a president. Add to that congressional investigations and a public vision of Clinton as a Nixonian figure wandering the halls, wringing her hands. 
The best thing would be for Democrats to ask her to step down now. It would be the most responsible thing to do, if the nation were more important to them than power. And the American news media — fairly or not firmly identified in the public mind as Mrs. Clinton’s political action committee — should begin demanding it. 
But what will Hillary do? 
She’ll stick and ride this out and turn her anger toward Comey. For Hillary and Bill Clinton, it has always been about power, about the Clinton Restoration and protecting fortunes already made by selling nothing but political influence. 
She’ll remind the nation that she’s a woman and that Donald Trump said terrible things about women. If there is another notorious Trump video to be leaked, the Clintons should probably leak it now. Then her allies in media can talk about misogyny and sexual politics and the headlines can be all about Trump as the boor he is and Hillary as champion of female victims, which she has never been. 
Remember that Bill Clinton leveraged the “Year of the Woman.” Then he preyed on women in the White House and Hillary protected him. But the political left — most particularly the women of the left — defended him because he promised to protect abortion rights and their other agendas. 
If you take a step back from tribal politics, you’ll see that Mrs. Clinton has clearly disqualified herself from ever coming near classified information again. If she were a young person straight out of grad school hoping to land a government job, Hillary Clinton would be laughed out of Washington with her record. She’d never be hired. 
As secretary of state she kept classified documents on the home-brew server in her basement, which is against the law. She lied about it to the American people. She couldn’t remember details dozens of times when questioned by the FBI. Her aides destroyed evidence by BleachBit and hammers. Her husband, Bill, met secretly on an airport tarmac with Attorney General Loretta Lynch for about a half-hour, and all they said they talked about was golf and the grandkids. 
And there was no prosecution of Hillary. 
That isn’t merely wrong and unethical. It is poisonous. 
And during this presidential campaign, Americans were confronted with a two-tiered system of federal justice: one for standards for the Clintons and one for the peasants. 
I’ve always figured that, as secretary of state, Clinton kept her home-brew email server — from which foreign intelligence agencies could hack top secret information — so she could shield the influence peddling that helped make the Clintons several fortunes. 
The Clintons weren’t skilled merchants. They weren’t traders or manufacturers. The Clintons never produced anything tangible. They had no science, patents or devices to make them millions upon millions of dollars. FBI’s Comey acted out of ‘obligation’ to lawmakers, fear of leak to media 
All they had to sell, really, was influence. And they used our federal government to leverage it. 
If a presidential election is as much about the people as it is about the candidates, then we’ll learn plenty about ourselves in the coming days, won’t we?

3036,‘Shadow Brokers’ Threaten to Release More Stolen NSA Cyber Weapons - Breitbart,"The “Shadow Brokers,” the group that pilfered and published the stolen National Security Agency hacking tools that turned the WannaCry ransomware virus into a global crisis, are threatening to sell more stolen cyber weapons in June. [AFP describes the latest communique from the Shadow Brokers as a “taunting online message in broken English,” which announced the group would “take payments beginning in June for monthly releases of computer hacks and vulnerability exploits. ”   The Shadow Brokers always take pains to sound like cartoon versions of Russian spies in their messages. This particular missive includes Moose and Squirrel verbiage such as, “Is being like wine of month club. Each month peoples can be paying membership fee, then getting members only data dump each month. What members doing with data after is up to members. ” The Shadow Brokers spend much of their latest message taunting a particular adversary, another hacking team linked to the NSA called The Equation Group. The Shadow Brokers insist their goal in stealing and selling these NSA hacking tools was to embarrass The Equation Group. As the hackers put it, quoting an infamous Internet meme based on an old videogame, “All your bases are belong to us. ” “TheShadowBrokers is not being interested in bug bounties, selling to cyber thugs, or giving to greedy corporate empires. TheShadowBrokers is taking pride in picking adversary equal to or better than selves, a worthy opponent. Is always being about theshadowbrokers vs theequationgroup,” the message declares. The Shadow Brokers jeer at various governments and “bullshit security companies” that did not bother to place bids when they attempted to sell the stolen hacking tools in an online auction. The auction was canceled when no one submitted a bid equal to the high price the thieves demanded. The Shadow Brokers portray themselves as insulted by the lack of bids, releasing the EternalBlue worm tools that were later incorporated into the WannaCry ransomware virus to prove their claims of holding “75% of U. S. cyber arsenal” are serious. Speaking of WannaCry, the Shadow Brokers say they were “eating popcorn” and watching the spread of the virus with great amusement. They also enjoyed the firing of FBI Director James Comey, toward whom they seem to harbor great animosity. The title of their message, in fact, is “OH LORDY! Comey Wanna Cry Edition. ” The hackers imply WannaCry might have been a   operation designed to provoke hostilities between the United States and North Korea, which has been linked to an early version of the ransomware code.  “Is being very strange behavior for crimeware? Killswitch? Crimeware is caring about target country?” they write, referring to the code discovered by a cybersecurity researcher that greatly impeded the spread of WannaCry over the weekend. The communique is seasoned with contempt for Microsoft, for allowing the vulnerabilities exploited by viruses like WannaCry to exist unpatched for so long, and for users who waited too long to install the patches that would have inoculated them against WannaCry. Conversely, the Shadow Brokers fault the NSA and its Equation Group for waiting so long to tell Microsoft the vulnerabilities existed. Among the new wares (or “warez” to use the preferred hacker spelling) the Shadow Brokers claim they might soon put on sale are exploits that target vulnerabilities in Windows 10 and tools to hack web browsers, routers, and mobile devices.  Also, they imply they are in possession of “compromised network data” from the Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean nuclear and missile programs. Since the Shadow Brokers are widely suspected of connections to the Russian government (that is why they mockingly use the broken Russian accent when they write) the threats to sell that nuclear and missile data might be disingenuous. A final extortion threat is leveled at the end of the message: if the rightful owners of the data and software stolen by the Shadow Brokers pay them an appropriate sum in Bitcoin, the group will “go dark permanently” because it will have “no more financial incentives” to continue its risky operations.   notes that they probably have a very large sum in mind, as the price they demanded at auction for the NSA software was about $580 million in Bitcoin. It is increasingly clear that the NSA informed Microsoft of the Windows software vulnerabilities it had long kept secret when it realized its powerful hacking tools had been stolen and exposed to the world. This will naturally lead to mounting criticism that neither Microsoft nor the NSA informed the general public about the danger that a virus like WannaCry could unleash.  Microsoft has been castigated for making a patch to the vulnerability in later versions of Windows available a month ago, without impressing upon users the urgency of downloading and installing that patch immediately. The older, officially obsolete Windows XP, which is still running on a large number of older computers around the world, was not patched until after the scale of the WannaCry infection became clear. The new threat from the Shadow Brokers could provoke a new crisis at the offices of Microsoft and the National Security Agency: should they credit the Shadow Brokers’ claims and come clean about vulnerabilities that might be exposed by the “dump of the month” program when it begins in June? If they don’t, and another global online pandemic is unleashed, the outrage directed their way will be deafening.  Likewise, Microsoft and other tech firms will be furious at the governments of the United States and other countries if intelligence agencies are still hoarding exploits for their own purposes and putting computer users at risk. The Shadow Brokers could be bluffing, but after the astounding damage inflicted by WannaCry last weekend, tech executives and government officials may be reluctant to call their bluff.",0
3037,"A Door to a Home Brimming With Love, and Open to All - The New York Times","Surrounded by her five grandchildren who live with her, Sandra Parker asserted her unconditional love for each one. The oldest, Akiea Brewer, 19, who identifies as transgender, interrupted to express her doubt. Ms. Parker’s reply was swift and unequivocal: “I was never mad at you for being who you are. What did I tell you? Be who you are. Don’t follow and try to be who someone else is. ” Ms. Parker has never been one to mince words. She believes her directness does not dilute her warmth and affection. “Sometimes I can be really harsh,” Ms. Parker acknowledged. “Sometimes you just have to say what you have to say. You can’t pussyfoot with kids. ” An unwavering dedication to family is what led Ms. Parker, 58, to take custody of many of her grandchildren over the years, stepping up when her children could not. For example, the mother of four of Ms. Parker’s grandchildren who live with her lives in Florida and is dealing with health issues. Ms. Parker credits her ceaseless devotion to the aunt who took her in at age 48, whom Ms. Parker calls her adoptive mother. “She was just a gem. She was precious,” Ms. Parker said. “I could never ask for a better mother. She loved me as if she birthed me into the world. ” Ms. Parker said she had showered her own four children with that same unrelenting affection. Her approach to motherhood was as tough as it was tender. If one of her sons was hanging out with the wrong crowd, she did not hesitate to yank him off street corners. One son’s friends were so worried that his mother was bringing attention to the group that they told him he could no longer associate with them. “I live what I live in front of the children,” Ms. Parker said. “They don’t see me robbing, stealing, doing all those things. They don’t see those things. ” Her parental role extended to several of her children’s friends, whom she welcomed into her home. Even now, her door is open to all. Friends regularly drop by her Bronx apartment to chat and laugh. Children in the neighborhood greet her on the sidewalk. Ms. Parker, a widow, moved to New York from Florida in 2012. She came for love  —   to be with a man she had met on vacation. They are now engaged. Because of the values she has instilled in them, Ms. Parker said, she does not worry for her grandchildren. “I was always told children emulate what they see,” she said. “If you raise them good and do the best that you can do, and they see this, then somewhere in their heart, it’s going to be stored. ” She has long demonstrated her willingness to care for them. That respect is returned to her, and she demands that her grandchildren offer it to their absent parents, too. “A lot of grandparents allow their grandchildren to call them ‘Mother,’ but that’s not who I am,” she said. “I’m their grandmother. I never allowed them to call me Mother. They have a mother. I’m just taking her place right now, but she’s still your mother. ” Health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, prevent Ms. Parker from working. Each month, she receives $630 from Social Security, $123 in survivor benefits and $376 in federal benefits for one of her grandchildren. She also receives $771 in food stamps and $310 in cash from public assistance. Ms. Parker is responsible for paying $246 toward her $1, 541 monthly rent the bulk of it is paid by a Family Eviction Prevention Subsidy provided by New York State. Through the Visiting Nurse Service, Ms. Parker contacted the Family Center, an affiliate of FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. FPWA is one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A Family Center caseworker noticed that much of the family’s furniture was badly worn. The caseworker applied for a grant from FPWA, and Ms. Parker was approved for a grant for $1, 000 in August to buy new furniture. “It feels more like home because I didn’t have anywhere for people to sit,” she said. That home is still very close quarters, which leads to the occasional fight. But her family makes the most of it, Ms. Parker said, and has learned to navigate the different personalities in a limited space. Ms. Parker wishes she had moments of calm and solitude. “There’s never a moment,” she said. “Not even when I take a shower, because somebody’s knocking on the door. Oh, my Lord. ” Ms. Parker said her home was brimming with love, giving her reason to anticipate an even brighter future. “I hope the children do well, finish school and my fiancé and I get married and sail away somewhere,” she said.",0
3038,Unthinkable Politics and the Dead Bodies of Children,"[Hands Up installation by Basil Kincaid in Ferguson. heartacheandpaint.com] Henry A. Giroux Cultural Critic and Public Intellectual Editor's Note The institutions that drive and reinforce capitalism at its most direct and base level are not even considered by politicians – Hillary Clinton included – as needing dismantling in order to save children. Those institutions are (domestically) the so called “criminal justice” and “juvenile justice” systems, and (internationally) the military, mercenaries, and paid international forces that are hired to carry out US international policy where children are often collateral damage, and sometimes direct targets. The U.S. also uses poor children of all races, but disproportionately children of color, as front line expendable military troops. A s the distinction between the truth and lies fades in public life, politics appears to be increasingly emptied of any substance. As Lucy Marcus has observed , “Nowadays, facts and truth are becoming [more] difficult to uphold in politics (and in business and even sports).” Certainly, in the age of Trump there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the appeal to reason, informed judgment and facts is at odds with the current political culture. That is, truth and evidence have gone the way of the electric typewriter, or so it seems.
Americans seem to have a growing fondness for ignorance, an attitude that reinforces the downsizing of the civic function of language. Falsehoods and deceptions no longer appear marginal to political debate but now seem to shape much of what is said by the presidential candidates. This is shockingly true for Trump, who has organized much of his campaign around endless fabrications, sending fact checkers into a frenzy of activity. When Trump is caught in a falsehood, he simply ignores the facts and just keeps on lying. His followers could care less about whether he deceives them or not. 
On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has earned a reputation as a chameleon, willing to say almost anything to promote her political career, regardless of whether she sacrifices the truth in order to do so. Her email scandal is largely read as symptomatic of a more pronounced and deeper level of dishonesty. Consequently, she is viewed mostly by the general public as untrustworthy. In response, she has managed her truth deficit by invoking her lifelong defense of families and children. For instance, during the second debate she claimed she wanted “America to be for our children” and attempted to bolster her concern for the welfare of children by pointing to her early work with the Children’s Defense Fund. In the third presidential debate, she argued against Trump’s call for exporting 11 million immigrants by stating that she was against his deportation policies because she “didn’t want to rip families apart [and was against] sending parents away from children.” In her political television ads, she points to supporting policies that “will invest in schools and colleges [and will work to] develop an economy where every young American can find a job and start a family of their own.” 
Unfortunately, Clinton only focuses on managing some of the problems that young people face, rather than doing anything to change the conditions that produce them. For instance, she says nothing about what education should accomplish in a democracy when educational policies are driven by a neoliberal economy that she supports. And while she talks about providing jobs for young people, she has little to say about transforming rather than adjusting an economy marked by wide gaps in inequality, wealth and power. 
Matters of power, state violence, extreme poverty, institutional racism, a broken criminal justice system, the school to prison pipeline and the existence of the mass incarceration state, among other important matters, rarely if ever enter her discourse and yet these are major issues negatively affecting the lives of millions of children in the United States. And her alleged regard for children falls apart in light of her hawkish policies on global regime change, drone attacks and cyber-warfare, and her unqualified support for the warfare state. Her alleged support for children abroad does not capture the larger reality they face from when their countries are invaded, attacked by drones and subject to contemporary forms of indiscriminate violence. Rather than critique the US as a powerful engine of violence, Clinton expands its imperialist role around the globe. This is a key point in light of her defense of the rights of children, because her warmongering ideology puts children in the path of lethal violence. 
At the same time, Clinton’s promise to address the problems many children face in the United States reeks of a disingenuousness made visible by her history of siding with and supporting policies that were injurious to children. Not only did she once disparagingly call young people super-predators, but as the First Lady she strongly backed her husband’s campaign to “end welfare as we know it.” President Clinton’s welfare policies did great harm to poor children. They eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children federal assistance program and infuriated Marian Wright Edelman, the president of the Children’s Defense Fund, to the degree that she ended her working relationship with Hillary Clinton. According to Edelman , the bill represented a frontal assault on the well-being of poor children and families. Yet as late as 2008, Hillary was still touting this pernicious welfare bill as a success. She also supported Bill Clinton’s “tough on crime” policies, which, according to Michelle Alexander , “resulted in the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history”— which has a devastating effect on the families and children of color. Finally, Clinton supported Bush’s invasion of Iraq, which led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children. 
Occupying the right wing of the Democratic Party, Clinton has aligned herself with a war culture that supports drone warfare and continues to support military policies that result in the needless deaths of millions of children in the Middle East, Yemen, Somalia, and other places that bear the brunt of America’s foreign policy. It is difficult to imagine, given Clinton’s coziness with the financial elite, big corporations, the military-industrial complex and the reigning war culture, that she will do anything that will lessen the violence to which children, both at home and around the globe, will face under her potential reign as President of the United States. Clinton has nothing to say about the need for a collective struggle for economic and political justice. Given her past history, Clinton’s disingenuousness becomes even starker next to the images of war and violence that mark the bodies of youth both in the United States and abroad. Her commitments to war and security have been built on the misery, mutilation and deaths of young people and her recent alleged support for the welfare of children does little to cover up the many ways capitalism, militarism, state violence and racism are killing poor Black and Brown youth. Rethinking the Horrors of War 
The horrors of war became painfully visible when the image circulated of the lifeless body of Aylan (Alan) Kurdi, a three-year-old who washed up on a beach face-downin the coastal town of Bodrum, Turkey, on September 2, 2015, while traveling with other refugees toward the Greek island of Kos. A second haunting image appeared on August 17, 2016, showing five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, bloodied and covered with dust, sitting silently in an ambulance after an airstrike on Aleppo, a city in northern Syria. 
Ordinarily, such images of children dead, injured and suffering motivate public outrage and also incite people to act. Omran’s image was widely circulated by mainstream news organizations and in the social media. The image provoked so much international outrage that the governments of Syria, China and Russia claimed it was pure propaganda and was staged. 
One of the most powerful images in history to provoke moral outrage and public anger was the image that circulated in 1955 of the grossly mutilated body of Emmett Till. That depiction of the effects of brutal racist violence helped to galvanize the civil rights movement. Nick Ut’s “Napalm Girl” via E-rea . 
Another image that changed the course of history was on display in 1972 when an anguished and terrified young girl was photographed running naked after a Napalm bomb burned and disfigured her body. The iconic picture played a significant role in mobilizing protests that helped stop the Vietnam War. 
Reactions to such horrible images still exist, but the brutal and unthinkable acts of violence they portray now seem to produce short-lived outrage and blend into the all-encompassing spectacle of violence and the fog of war. What is crucial to acknowledge is that the war has come home and has trapped many young people in its spiral of accelerated violence, which has become a new form of domestic terrorism and the primary force promoting a machinery of literal and social death for many youths. Domestic terrorism is now exemplified every day in media stories focusing on the killing of unarmed young people by the police and in the gun violence that is turning poor urban cities into war zones. Violence has become a habitual response by the state to every social problem. This has become more and more evident as the application of militarized police power produces on a daily basis a growing number of images of dead bodies which increasingly find their way onto the screen cultures of the social media. In the US, according to Marian Wright Edelman’s Children’s Defense Fund column , “Seventy-eight children under 5 died by guns in 2015 — 30 more than the 48 law enforcement officers killed by guns in the line of duty.” In other words, Edelman writes, “guns killed more preschoolers in one year than they did law-enforcement officers.” In Chicago alone, in the first eight months of 2016, 12 people were shot daily. According to a Carnegie-Knight News21 investigation : 
For every U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan during 11 years of war, at least 13 children were shot and killed in America. More than 450 kids didn’t make it to kindergarten. Another 2,700 or more were killed by a firearm before they could sit behind the wheel of a car. Every day, on average, seven children were shot dead. A News21 investigation of child and youth deaths in America between 2002 and 2012 found that at least 28,000 children and teens 19-years-old and younger were killed with guns. Teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 made up over two-thirds of all youth gun deaths in America. 
Gary Younge observes that every day in the United States “seven kids and teens are shot dead” which adds up to 2,500 dead children a year. What is clear is that neither mainstream political party nor their respective political leaders, including Hillary Clinton, “has a thoroughgoing plan for dealing with America’s gun culture, [one] that goes well beyond background checks,” he adds. This level of violence has deep roots in systemic structures of racism, inequality and poverty that make visible a broken democracy. Rather than being viewed as a social investment, poor youth of color are now seen as excess, threatening, suspect and undeserving of either a society in which they are protected or a future in which they are treated with respect. Instead of educating them, America spends large sums of money to imprison them; instead of building schools, we invest more and more in prisons; instead of providing quality health care, jobs and housing for them, we consign them to dilapidated schools, push them into the underground economy, and criminalize their behaviors. There are few safe spaces left for poor youth of color — rather our society offers them the promise of immiseration and a jail cell. This suggests not only a politics that has turned into a pathology, but also a dystopian logic that is as cruel as it is morally indifferent. 
Children and the Politics of Disappearance 
The killing of children in America and by US forces abroad has become part of a politics of willful disappearance in which a culture of cruelty, immediacy and forgetting works in tandem to eliminate any trace of the factors behind the production of violence in the service of the unthinkable — a society willing to sacrifice its own children to the industries that trade and profit in the massive production and distribution of guns. Such extreme violence no longer appears to have a threshold that would make it intolerable. In part, this is because the business of violence has become standardized as part of the culture of business. Or, as Phil Wolfson puts it , “the business of violence has become a far too accepted part of the fabric of contemporary life in the United States.” Tamir Rice remembrance / protest march. 
War culture becomes visible in the extreme violence captured in videos of the police killing of children, such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice and adults, such as Walter Scott, who was shot in the back as he was running away from his car by Michael Slager, a white North Charleston, South Carolina policeman. 
The scope and visibility of such actions often promote policies further wedded to military solutions, such as suspending civil liberties, accelerating the militarization of society and employing counter-terrorism tactics that rely heavily on military force. As violence becomes both normalized and spectacularized in the media, a war machine and culture becomes so deeply embedded in American society that, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri write in their book Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire , “war has become … a form of rule aimed not only at controlling the population but producing and reproducing all aspects of social life.” 
Yet, war machines do more than produce extreme forms of violence; they also fix whole categories of people as disposable enemies and force them into conditions of extreme precarity, if not danger. This is especially true of undocumented immigrants, poor Black youth, Muslims and those young people who now inhabit a neoliberal social order that has substituted precariousness for social and economic protections. Young people today are told they are on their own and not to expect much from a society that offers them poor health care, a terrain of uncertainty and insecurity, a crushing burden of debt, no hope for the future, and a market-based value system that tells them that their security and survival is no longer a social responsibility but personal responsibility. If the future looks bleak for many young people, it is not because of their own doing. Yet, the ruling elite and mainstream media journalists continually label them as losers, suggesting that their failure is a character flaw rather than the outcome of wider structural and systemic forces over which they have no control. In this instance, intolerable violence is masked by a state that has been taken over by the financial elite and that has abandoned its social functions while emptying out politics for an entire generation of youth. Indifferent to their own criminal acts, financial elites unapologetically “give precedence to private financial gain and market determinism over human lives and broad public values,” in the words of William Greider , and in doing so, inhabit the dark side of politics. Youth in a Suspect Society 
Young people, especially those considered the most suspect, provide a startling and eye-opening referent for analyzing not only how violence is represented and experienced, but also how it is distributed across a variety of interrelated sites. The daily violence experienced by youths, especially the most defenseless, does not often make news, because it exposes the harsh brutalizing reality that many youth face in a racist, homophobic, carceral and market-driven society. Such indifference is all the more tragic since one of the most unspoken acts of collective violence in the United States resides in its treatment of its children. 
What I call the war on youth is alarming given that the fate of a society’s democracy is tied to the condition of its children. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Protestant theologian, once argued that the ultimate test of morality, if not democracy, is how a society treats its children. If we take this principle seriously, the US has failed its children, particularly those who are already underserved. Many face a bleak future filled with low-paying jobs, the effects of the collapse of the welfare state, the threat of a lifetime of unemployment, the paralyzing burden of high levels of debt and a political landscape that prioritized exchange relations over relationships built on trust, dignity and compassion. All of these factors make the future look bleak for young people, but there are also other more brutalizing forces at work that now bear down on many young people — forces that suggest that a distinctive type of hardness and culture of cruelty is now shaping American society and its view of young people. 
In this instance, young people marginalized by class, race and ethnicity are treated as disposable in a society in which the American dream has been turned into an American nightmare. Young people now inhabit a landscape of permanent uncertainty and crisis: one in which they are spied on, incarcerated, criminalized and written out of the discourse of democracy. No longer seen as a social investment, the most vulnerable youth have become a liability, subject to the harsh dictates of the neoliberal state and a symbolic reminder of a social order that offers youth no promise of an alternative and democratic future. The dictates of precarity and austerity have become repackaged and weaponized under neoliberalism and the ongoing morphology of violence normalized as the only possible mode of life. Under the reign of a war culture, America has arrived at a historical moment in which the war on children suggests that, as Stuart Hall, Doreen Massey and Michael Rustin have argued , “the very notion of a future seems to have been cancelled.” But the war on youth does more: it also reveals the raw reality of power politics and its willingness to crush early on all forms of resistance among young people. The Challenge Ahead for Progressives 
The current presidential race and the debates it has provided make clear that the Republican Party wants to eliminate whatever social provisions and public goods are available for young people while the allegedly more progressive Democratic Party puts forward reforms that do little to address the underlying economic, social and ethical conditions that produce them. Trump goes further and wants to accelerate the war on young people through a law and order campaign that expands the punishing state. Clinton points to some of the problems youth face, but in doing so fails to address a number of important issues, such as the high incarceration rates of poor Black youth, the neoliberal logic of financialization, the rise of the warfare state, massive poverty, systemic racism, the surveillance state, segregation, the militarization of the police, the destruction of the planet and a culture of institutional and symbolic violence that surges through society like an electric current. 
If children matter, as Clinton has argued, then it is crucial to recognize that her concerns are highly disingenuous because she refuses to dismantle capitalism as it exists and fight for a social order that is no longer ruled by the commanding institutions that serve the financial elite and the dictates of global neoliberalism. If young people are to be viewed as a crucial measure of a substantive democracy, it is important to take seriously what it means to create a society that addresses their needs and opens up a better future than the one the established political and financial elites have created for them. This is not a matter of reform; it is a matter of radical economic and political justice. Such a challenge must address the current struggles faced by young people by going to the roots of the problem. This will not happen by adopting the language of reform, which has no way of addressing why the plight of young people has dissolved into a domestication of the unimaginable. 
The real challenge for progressives is to build a broad-based movement and create a set of alternate educational public spheres to take on the task of transforming (rather than reforming) the existing capitalist social order and its poisonous relations of power and injustice. Children matter because they remind us of the need not only to create a more democratic future, but also to take seriously the collective struggle and modes of resistance that can make it happen.

3041,How to Give a Better Speech: Talk to a Dog - The New York Times,"The two undergraduates were acing their presentation. Good cadence. Sharp slides. Sunny dispositions. But it was a tough crowd. As the first slides flashed by, one audience member got up and paced the room. The other, breathing with conspicuous heaviness, rested her head sleepily on the ground. The students inflected their voices and gestured with gusto to regain their attention. So it goes when your audience is canine  —   specifically Teddy, a Jack Russell terrier, and Ellie, a Bernese mountain dog. The session was part of a pilot program pairing   business school students at American University with amiable, if unpredictable, dogs. According to promotional material for the program: “Addressing a friendly and nonjudgmental canine can lower blood pressure, decrease stress and elevate mood  —   perfect for practicing your speech or team presentation. ” The audience dogs, as they are called, are a pet project of Bonnie Auslander, the director of the Kogod Center for Business Communications, which helps students hone their writing and speaking skills. Given “the whole fever pitch of dogs in therapy”  —   pettable pooches routinely show up before finals on some campuses  —   Ms. Auslander decided to use dogs to help students with speech anxiety. The center booked about a dozen sessions last semester and employed six “locally sourced” dogs, recruited for their calm personalities For now, evidence of the benefits is mostly anecdotal. “It makes you smile looking out at the dogs,” said Jessica Lewinson, a sophomore who practiced a presentation on corporate responsibility in front of Teddy and Ellie. “It kind of gives you a chance to step back from your presentation, to step out of that track you get stuck in. ” And, she added, a dog is no more distracted than your typical college student. You might even get a lick. Virtual reality has become a popular experimental treatment for a variety of anxiety disorders, including public speaking. Advocates say it is an efficient and safe form of exposure therapy, and a growing body of research backs them up. At treatment centers, participants are immersed in a     environment, where a therapist guides them through contact with feared stimuli. Thanks to a free app from VirtualSpeech, students can try this method at home. By plugging a smartphone into Google Cardboard or any VR headset, users will find themselves in a   virtual presentation room and have the option of uploading their own PowerPoint, which appears on the virtual screen as they address the virtual crowd.",0
3042,A New Victim Just Accused Clarence Thomas Of Sexual Assault,"  
In light of the tidal wave of sexual assault allegations leveled at Republican nominee Donald Trump and the firestorm of controversy it has provoked, we shouldn’t be surprised that more women are coming forth to tell their stories of abuse at the hands of powerful men. The latest to step forward is an Alaska lawyer who is accusing conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of groping her at a dinner party in 1999. 
“He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him. He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him” says Moira Smith, describing how Justice Thomas groped her buttocks at a public event. 
Smith was 23 at the time and is now a vice president at counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co. Justice Thomas was previously accused of sexually harassing his employee, Anita Hill, in a widely controversial case that ended with the confirmation of Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice and a vicious character assassination campaign against Hill. Hill’s shocking testimony described how : 
In lurid detail, she described Thomas as a boss who pestered her for dates and spoke graphically about pornography, bestiality, rape and his skills as a lover. “He talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts,” she testified. The “oddest episode,” Hill said, occurred when he was drinking a Coke in his EEOC office. “He got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, ‘Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?”‘ 
The National Law Journal spoke to three of Smith’s housemates , who all confirm that Smith told them about Thomas’ behavior at the time of the event. Thomas has denied the allegations. 
Sexual assault and the improper behavior of powerful men towards vulnerable employees has dominated this election cycle, beginning first with the wave of allegations against FOX News CEO Roger Ailes by multiple employees and then the accounts of some dozen women recounting the sexual abuse they suffered at the hands of Donald Trump. 
The prominence of the issue has created a space for women to come forward and tell their tales w ith some degree of confiden ce that they will be heard and taken seriously, bravely risking the backlash of misogynistic victim-blaming that has long defined the American response to a woman’s accusation. 
From the military to scientific acedemia to nursing homes , men abuse women and other men at a horrifying rate. It’s far past time we began giving women the benefit of the doubt and send a message to the predators of America that this appalling behavior will no longer be tolerated. For his part, Justice Clarence Thomas has been nothing but an obstacle to progress, mired in backwards conservatism and following the cues of now-deceased religious extremist Antonin Scalia to a tee. Perhaps Scalia shouldn’t be the only seat we replace once Hillary Clinton takes office.",0
3043,UN: All Sides in Aleppo May Be Committing War Crimes,"A new statement from the UN Human Rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani warned that there is growing evidence that all sides fighting around the northern Syrian city of Aleppo are engaged in war crimes by conducting indiscriminate strikes in civilian-populated areas. 
Shamdasani warned that while the UN lacked details to attribute individual attacks to different factions in the area, the indications are that everyone has basically ignored the “fundamental prohibition” on launching such attacks when civilians are present. 
This has been a recurring concern for months in Aleppo, with large civilian casualties reported on a disturbingly regular basis. And while most of the international forces with an interest in Syria are keen to exclusively blame one side or the other, civilians in both sides’ neighborhoods are being killed. 
Russia has paused their airstrikes against Aleppo over the past couple of weeks, though an escalation in fighting further west has meant civilian casualties have continued, with reports of chlorine gas attacks by Nusra forces against government-held areas. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
3044,WIKILEAKS: Hillary Clinton Needed Someone to 'Sober Her Up' at 4:30 in the Afternoon,"Well here's a good from the Podesta wiki files. This time it has Podesta himself and some others trying to decide who should sober Hillary up !! Oh Boy it's from Aug 2015. WIKILEAKS: Hillary Clinton Needed Someone to ‘Sober Her Up’ at 4:30 in the Afternoon Hillary Clinton campaign aides had a frantic email exchange in August 2015 over who should call the candidate to “sober her up some” at around 4:30 in the afternoon. According to documents published by WikiLeaks, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta emailed communications aide Jennifer Palmieri with a question at around 2:00 p.m. “Should I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you?” Podesta wrote. “I’m worried she’ll get on with Cheryl [Mills] and we’ll end up in a bad place.” Palmieri wrote back more than two hours later with a response: “I think you should call her and sober her up some.”",0
3045,Clinton-Trump Debate Expected to Be Rare Draw in a Polarized Age - The New York Times,"The uniquely uncivil presidential campaign is about to produce one of the biggest civic gatherings in decades: For 90 minutes on Monday night, a polarized nation will pause to watch the first    encounter between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. The total audience, network executives and political strategists say, could be as high as 100 million viewers  —   Super Bowl territory. That would surpass the 80 million who watched Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in 1980, the record for a presidential debate, and rank among television benchmarks like the finales of “MASH” and “Cheers. ” Not all viewers will watch from their living rooms. At the Dreamland Theater in tiny Nantucket, Mass. so many are expected for a   party that the town assigned a police officer to stand watch in case of rowdiness. In Paris, many of those abroad for Fashion Week are setting     alarms so they can watch the debate live  —   at 3 a. m. local time. “I need to feel like I’m part of this,” said Laura Brown, InStyle’s editor in chief. And in Richardson, Tex. the Alamo Drafthouse had to switch to a bigger room after overwhelming interest in a screening with refreshments like a “build a wall around it” taco salad. Mass experiences  —   built around news events like the moon landing, and pop culture moments for older generations like the “Who shot J. R. ?” episode of “Dallas”  —   are rare in an age of fragmented media and the drift toward partisan outlets, where viewers can effectively choose their own news. But tight polls and curiosity about the unconventional Mr. Trump are luring viewers. In a New York   News poll this month, 83 percent of registered voters said they were very or somewhat likely to watch on Monday. “It’s a throwback to a phenomenon that has essentially disappeared in the era of digital media,” said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. “This is Americans gathering around the electronic hearth. ” Advertisers, including Audi cars and Tecate beer, are taking advantage, introducing   commercials in the kind of   marketing usually reserved for events like the Super Bowl. Although the debate will air without commercials, cable and broadcast channels have sold millions of dollars’ worth of ads for programming before and afterward. Television networks and online streaming sites, including Facebook and Twitter, will carry the same feed on Monday, showing a spare debate stage at Hofstra University, on Long Island, a format that predates the blaring graphics and   sets that now dominate television news. Still, even if a large portion of the country is watching, what Americans see may be as much about their beliefs and preferred news outlets as what transpires onstage. About 8 percent of registered voters remain undecided, according to the New York   News poll, a thin if crucial sliver of the electorate. And after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump conclude on Monday, viewers are likely to return to their ideological silos, absorbing instant analysis from   anchors on MSNBC or commentators at   outlets like Breitbart News. The debate itself will be subject to instant,    interpretation on social media. “Regardless of where you’re watching, whether it’s Facebook Live or NBC or Fox News, there will be a moment where we all witness it,” said Charles L. Ponce de Leon, author of “That’s the Way It Is,” a history of television news. “But that moment will quickly crumble when all the instant analysis and opining comes into play. ” The event’s impact is unlikely to rival that of, say, 1960, when John F. Kennedy’s smooth performance in the first televised debate helped sway voters against his opponent, Richard Nixon. That debate aired without commentary  —   or graphics and captions on the screen. “Journalists were of the opinion they should wait and ruminate and think about what went down, and then, a day or a week later, talk about it,” Mr. de Leon said. Tom Sander, who runs a program on civic engagement at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said he was worried that voters might not have a chance to remove partisan blinders. “Many of us come to these events more to confirm what we already think we know, rather than to search for common ground,” Mr. Sander said. The candidates may hope otherwise. Mrs. Clinton has told donors privately that she expects 100 million people to watch the debate, and that 60 million of those viewers may be focusing on the campaign for the first time, a prime opportunity for her to make inroads. Many may tune in merely for the spectacle. “It’s like waiting for the   fight,” said Dick Cavett, the longtime   host, referring to the highly anticipated boxing bouts between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the 1970s. Mr. Cavett said he would cut short a dinner on Monday to ensure he would be in front of a TV by 9 p. m. “There’s possible drama and fireworks and insults and horror and disaster and potential enlightenment,” Mr. Cavett said. “It would attract anybody. ” Some in TV noted that the 2008 meeting between Joseph R. Biden and Sarah Palin attracted 70 million viewers, more than any of that year’s presidential debates, a sign that civic interest may be less of a draw than seeing a colorful candidate like Ms. Palin  —   or Mr. Trump. The 1980   debate scored a record audience in part because it was the only    matchup between the candidates in a precable era. But Neal Shapiro, a former president of NBC News, recalled that Mr. Reagan’s unusual background as a Hollywood actor spurred interest. “People wanted to see, would they really feel comfortable with Reagan as president?” Mr. Shapiro said. “People were wondering, ‘Can I live with this guy? ’” The first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney in 2012 drew 67 million viewers. Advertisers, anticipating even more this time, are using the opportunity to unveil new ads with themes that may resonate with Americans focused on the campaign. Audi’s commercial shows a man and woman, both hotel valets, battling for the right to drive an Audi RS7 luxury car, and features the slogan “Choose the next driver wisely. ” American flags, and ice sculptures of a donkey and an elephant, convey the message that the car, as an Audi vice president for marketing put it, is “a metaphor for the importance of America. ” In a spot set for Monday night, Tecate, a Mexican beer label owned by Heineken, features a view of the Mexican border and a     that declares, “The time has come for a wall  —   a tremendous wall. ” The wall is revealed as a   resting place for Tecate beers, “a wall that brings us together. ” The ad, airing on networks including Fox News and Univision, is “absolutely not” about a political point of view or affiliation, said Felix Palau, a vice president at Tecate. “Tecate, being a Mexican beer, is a perfect protagonist of a story where a wall brings people together in a very fun way,” Mr. Palau said. The debate’s biggest televised competition on Monday is likely to be another program featuring intricate strategies and crushing blows: “Monday Night Football” on ESPN. And one famous political junkie says he may flip the channel  —   for a few minutes, at least  —   to the action on the gridiron. “The president’s fired up about ‘Monday Night Football,’” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, playfully told reporters who asked if President Obama planned to watch the debate. “There will be millions of people across the country who are quite interested to see the two candidates onstage together for the first time,” Mr. Earnest added. “I imagine the president will be one of them. ”",0
3046,"Shanghai Dwellings Vanish, and With Them, a Way of Life - The New York Times","China’s Communist Party celebrated its 95th birthday this summer with a lavish First of July gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In Shanghai, where the First National Congress took place in 1921, the occasion was noted in a more subdued way, with the promotion of a digital map of the important sites of the party’s heroic early years in   Shanghai. The map is a simple affair. Clicking on a man wearing scholar’s robes, for example, sends a cartoon icon toddling off to the brick building on Lane 163 of Zizhong Road, where Chen Wangdao, one of the party’s founding members, translated “The Communist Manifesto” into Chinese. (A   and   app version will soon be available for smartphones.) A problem for anyone contemplating a   pilgrimage to the urban shrines of the Communist Party: Much of the historic city depicted on the virtual map has been wiped off the real map of Shanghai by two decades of breakneck development. The few remaining buildings, among them Dr. Sun  ’s modest   mansion in the former French Concession, stand in the shadows of   or   towers. On a recent visit, my quest to find Mao Zedong’s first address in Shanghai, on a street once known as the Alley of Benevolence and Kindness, ended in the Jing An Kerry Center, a 3.    residential and office complex. The   rowhouse, where the future Great Helmsman once folded laundry and ate rice in an attic room, now sits between a   luxury mall and the     Hotel’s steakhouse. Fortunately, enough examples of Shanghai’s historic architecture have survived to give visitors a sense of what life was like when the city gave birth to the Communist Party. To walk through Shanghai’s last remaining shikumen (alleyway complexes entered through a   kumen, or gateway) is to return to the wicked, glamorous “Paris of the Orient”  —   and to get a glimpse of what has happened to Shanghai in the century since then. My first introduction to shikumen came 10 years ago, when Peter Hibbard, the former president of the Shanghai chapter of the Royal Asiatic Society China, took me on a tour of an alleyway complex near the riverfront Bund. “Up until the ’90s, 80 percent of the population lived in two or   shikumen,” Mr. Hibbard told me then, as we wandered through an atmospheric maze of mostly vacant homes. “They were basically city blocks that functioned as gated communities, with guards manning the front entrance. The whole essence of old Shanghai was that life was lived horizontally  —   all the activity happened at street level. ” Though the complex Mr. Hibbard showed me has since been razed, you can get an idea of what shikumen were like by visiting Xintiandi, a reconditioned alleyway complex located in the Huangpu and Xuhui districts, which were until 1943 the city’s French Concession. The houses at 76 and 78 Xingye Road were saved from the wrecker’s ball only because they played host to the clandestine First National Congress of the Communist Party. Turned into a memorial 30 years later, by which time the private residences had become a noodle factory, they are now a museum and the cornerstone of Xintiandi (the name means “New Heaven and Earth”) a   shopping and entertainment district. On the second floor of a thoroughly modern exhibition space, the Congress is commemorated in the orthodox Communist way  —   with starkly lit wax figures displayed behind glass. The skinny rowhouses that brought together two European members of the Comintern, 12 future party bigwigs and a    Mao have been preserved intact. Visitors walk through a lacquered partition into a   room with whitewashed walls. On a polished red floor, a dozen stools surround a long table, set with teacups and an open box of wooden matches  —   a staging meant to suggest the participants have just left. (The meeting was, in fact, cut short by the sudden appearance of a police informer. Mao and his colleagues fled before the police could raid, reconvening on rented sightseeing boats in the tourist town of Hangzhou.) Wandering the lanes of Xintiandi gives a hint of the magic of the typical shikumen. Faced with   bricks and adorned with elaborately carved,   lintels, the rowhouses call to mind a radically compacted version of the terraced workers’ housing found in northern English cities. The tributary lanes, some only eight feet wide, were built to accommodate rickshaws and bicycles, rather than cars, making shikumen tranquil oases in the heart of a   city. Commissioned mostly by Western developers, the first shikumen appeared in the 1870s, designed to offer wealthy families refuge from the flooding, famine and unrest of the countryside. The local contractors who built them drew upon the interior floor plans of traditional Chinese courtyard homes and local decorative motifs. The Shikumen Open House Museum, a refurnished private residence in the north block of Xintiandi, demonstrates the beguiling collision of East and West that resulted. Leaving an exiguous forecourt  —   the equivalent of a front yard, generally used to wash and dry clothes  —   you take a big step over a wooden sill into a rectangular living room decorated with blackwood furniture and period photographs and paintings. As you walk over creaking floorboards, soft jazz emanates from the horn of a gramophone. A woman’s sleeveless silk qipao hangs from a hook a jade hair clip, a tube of lipstick and a jar of powder are neatly arranged on a dressing table. In the kitchen, bamboo baskets,   colanders and a huge iron kettle are arranged around a potbellied coal stove. Halfway up a precipitous, dogleg staircase is the tingzijian, an unheated room often rented to bachelors. (Among them were the modernist writers Lu Xun and Yu Dafu, who eavesdropped on shikumen life from their    pavilion rooms). The upper floor is occupied by bedrooms, some with impressive   beds. The overall impression is of a luxurious, and surprisingly spacious, upper   home. It’s all beautifully staged, and terribly misleading. By the late 1930s, when the Second   War caused a wave of immigration to Shanghai’s   zones, most shikumen homes became occupied by four families and sheltered an average of 20 people. As an idealized vision of rowhouse life, the Open House Museum is like Xintiandi itself. Until the 1990s, the area was home to 2, 000 families. Their homes were gutted, and often completely rebuilt, to make way for a shopping district where you can buy a latte at Starbucks, a mug of pilsner at the Paulaner Bräuhaus or an   expensive silk scarf at the upscale clothing chain Shanghai Tang. “Xintiandi is fake vintage,” said Ruan Yisan, the director of the National Research Center of Historic Cities at Tongji University and an architectural preservationist. “There aren’t many shikumen houses left in the city. Those that remain are the living fossil of life in Shanghai. ” Professor Ruan remembers his teenage years in a Shanghai shikumen fondly. The day typically began with the “Cantata of the Alley,” the sound of night stools (  latrines) as they were cleaned with bamboo sticks after being emptied by night soil men. Then the first vendors would arrive, selling   won tons, fried bean curd and fresh green olives, often delivered in baskets lowered from   windows. The alleys echoed with the cries of children running off to school, often within the same complex. During unexpected cloudbursts, the   grandma would rush to bring in clothes that absent neighbors had hung out to dry. In the summer, residents would gather after dinner to cheng fengliang (“enjoy the coolness”) trading gossip, playing   and sharing slices of melon chilled in a water well. “Nowadays, our apartments in condominium towers have no public spaces,” he said. “We don’t even know our neighbors. ” The shikumen, Professor Ruan believes, forged the character of the Shanghainese. Contact with foreigners and people from all parts of China made them cosmopolitan, and living cheek by jowl with neighbors made them into subtle   planners, capable of sidestepping    disputes while quietly plotting to further their own interests. He tells me that when shikumen construction ended in 1949, Shanghai counted 9, 000 alleyway complexes, housing up to four million people. The entire spectrum of Shanghai’s life took place in them: Shikumen housed nurseries and coffin makers, universities and Buddhist temples, hotels and   zones (the infamous Alley of Joint Pleasure was home to 171 brothels). Demolitions began in the 1990s, and intensified in the   to Expo 2010. Most expropriated residents were offered  —   and accepted  —   relocation, usually to new residential towers up to an hour’s metro ride from their old homes. (Holdouts found themselves harassed, and in a few notorious cases even killed, by construction crews.) Professor Ruan believes that only 200, 000 Shanghai residents continue to live in alleyway complexes. “If you want to see what a typical shikumen is like,” he said, “you’d better hurry. ” I rode the metro to the Xinzha Road station and walked a few blocks to eastern Siwen Li (Gentle Lane). Built over a former cemetery by a Sephardic Jewish entrepreneur in 1914, it was once home to 11, 000 people now it’s down to 12 households. After I stepped through its threshold, the smell of exhaust was replaced by air redolent with frying garlic and stewing meat. Brownish   exteriors were plastered with peeling posters for “anticorpulence tablets” or scrawled with cellphone numbers of plumbers or fake ID peddlers. Many of the doors were daubed in red paint with the Chinese character “Kōng” (“Vacant”). Between concrete sinks used for washing clothes, bicycles leaned against walls. Somewhere a rooster crowed. At the intersection of two alleys, a   residents had gathered on stools to pass the time. When I told one of them, Ni Wei Ming, 57, a taxi driver, that I had never seen the inside of a real shikumen home, he invited me into his. Though its    —   forecourt for washing clothes, rectangular living room, steep rear staircase leading to   bedrooms  —   mirrors the shikumen home in the Xintiandi museum, it lacked its idealized glamour. Room partitions were made of plastic sheets joined by duct tape cooking amenities were limited to a wok on a   hot plate the bathtub was a   wooden barrel. Though the government had offered to buy it for 7 million yuan (just over $1 million) Mr. Ni told me he was holding out for more. “That would be enough money to be comfortable,” he said. “But I’ll still have regrets. My primary school was here. I met my wife here  —   she lived on the same block. My children did their homework with the neighbors’ kids. There used to be a real feeling of community. Now there are only seven families left on my alley. ” Mr. Ni told me there was a rumor that a Hong Kong property developer planned to replace the complex with skyscrapers. Seeing me back to the laneway  —   beneath the asphalt lie the original cobblestones  —   Mr. Ni lit a cigarette and let his gaze run down the row of carved lintels that marked the entrance to each home. “You know, if they chose to save and restore this place, it would be better than Xintiandi,” he said. (Since my visit, the municipal government has earmarked 260 historic neighborhoods for conservation. The Shanghai office of Chipperfield Architects will oversee the preservation of eastern Siwen Li’s buildings  —   minus, unfortunately, the neighbors who made it into a neighborhood. The life stories of the shikumen’s residents have been collected in a beautifully illustrated book by the French architect Jérémy Cheval.) Other shikumen are scattered among Shanghai’s office and residential towers. Fude Li, where the Communist Party’s Second National Congress took place, is intact (Mao, who got lost in Shanghai’s back streets, failed to attend). The extraordinary Zhang’s Garden off West Nanjing Road, built by a Chinese merchant in 1882, has been saved from demolition because of its role as a community center for seniors. Less picturesque complexes, though, tend to be occupied by migrant workers, many of whom lack of residency permits, which makes the future of these homes tenuous. Perhaps the quickest way to get an idea of the vitality of a traditional alleyway complex is to visit Tianzifang, a   walk from the Dapuqiao station. In the late ’90s, the small factories and shikumen homes along Lane 210 on Taikang Road were occupied by painters, sculptors and ceramists. Their tiny workshops eventually became a complex of 200   cultural and art sites, with older residents continuing to occupy   apartments. Though local residents lament that cafes, restaurants and small businesses have begun to replace artists’ studios, the district retains its original architecture and charm. The narrow cobbled lanes, shaded by trees and potted plants, are filled with window shoppers and diners who have stopped at a terrace to enjoy exquisite   Japanese coffee (Café Dan) or a chocolate milkshake or a smoked salmon bagel (Kommune). Unlike Xintiandi’s international chains, Tianzifang is home to such quirky local businesses as Pureland, which specializes in   ceramic tile images of koi ponds, pagodas and other traditional Chinese landscapes, and Teddy Bear Family, a Thai restaurant where every surface is covered with plush toys. Wandering around   Tianzifang is an antidote to the soaring Shanghai of magnetic levitation trains and  . Like other shikumen, it’s free of cars, making it one of the rare places in Shanghai where you can stroll without having to watch out for a darting electric bike or a barreling Volkswagen taxi. It’s a gentle reminder, too, of an irony of Shanghai’s recent history. In tearing down shikumen, which fostered the canny interdependence of the Shanghainese, government officials are erasing the architectural form that saw the birth of the uniquely Chinese version of Communism. The condominium towers that are replacing them, where   neighbors remain strangers, are breeding nothing but isolation.",0
3047,Comment on Bob Woodward ‘offed by Clinton death machine’? by DCG,"Posted on November 2, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 1 Comment 
Bob Woodward, 73, is the Washington Post reporter who, with his colleague Carl Bernstein, broke the story of Nixon’s Watergate — a puny scandal compared to Hillary’s unsecured email and the Clinton Foundation. Woodward is now the associate editor of WaPo . 
Speaking to Fox News Sunday ‘s Chris Wallace on Oct. 23, 2016, Woodward called Hillary Clinton’s Clinton Foundation “corrupt”. 
Here’s the transcript: 
WALLACE: Then there are the allegations about the Clinton Foundation and pay to play, which I asked Secretary Clinton about in the debate, and she turned into an attack on the Trump Foundation. But, Bob, I want to go back to the conversation I was having with Robby Mook before. When — when you see what seems to be clear evidence that Clinton Foundation donors were being treated differently than non-donors in terms of access, when you see this new — new revelation about the $12 million deal between Hillary Clinton, the foundation, and the king of Morocco, are voters right to be troubled by this? 
BOB WOODWARD: I — yes, it’s a — it’s corrupt . It’s — it’s a scandal . And she didn’t answer your question at all. And she turned to embrace the good work that the Clinton Foundation has done. And she has a case there. But the mixing of speech fees, the Clinton Foundation, and actions by the State Department, which she ran, are all intertwined and it’s corrupt. You know, I mean, you can’t just say it’s unsavory. But there’s no formal investigation going on now, and there are outs that they have. But the election isn’t going to be decided on that. 
However, Woodward said he expects Hillary will win the election, but asked: 
“I think the issue is what’s going to be the aftermath of this campaign: Can somebody govern?” 
Writing on Nov. 1, 2016, Alt Media freelance journalist Jim Stone claims that Woodward had “suddenly vanished from the Washington Post , the phone operator says he’s no longer there and no one is giving details or even reporting in the MSM that he is gone.” 
Stone asks if Woodward “has been offed by the Clinton death machine”. 
Indeed, Woodward’s last article for WaPo was published on April 5, 2016, eons ago in journalism time. Woodward’s personal website is also down. I tried it just a minute ago and got this message: Service Temporarily Unavailable 
The server is temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity problems. Please try again later. 
Woodward’s Watergate co-investigator, Carl Bernstein, has also recently spoken out about Hillary’s corruption in the context of the FBI reopening its criminal investigation of Hillary’s emails. Bernstein said : 
“Well, there’s no question that the e-mails have always been the greatest threat to her candidacy for president, that her conduct in regard to the e-mails is really indefensible and . . . the one thing . . . actually that could really perhaps affect this election. 
We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly . . . unless it was something requiring serious investigation . . . . I want to add here that in the last, oh, 36, 48 hours, there has been an undercurrent of kind of speculative discussion among some national security people that something might surface in the next few days about e-mails. . . . [I]t’s very possible that some members of Congress very quickly are going to get an idea of what these e-mails are, and what this is all about, and for whatever purpose put some information out there.” 
So if the Clintons “offed” Bob Woodward for calling the Clinton Foundation “corrupt,” then Carl Bernstein would have to be offed as well.

3048,DeBlasio: OK to Shield Illegal Alien DUIs from Deportation,"New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio told CNN that he approves of the idea of shielding from deportation any illegal alien arrested for drunk driving. [During an interview on CNN’s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper pointed out to Mayor DeBlasio that the City of New York refuses to cooperate with the federal government to deport illegal aliens who have been convicted of drunk driving and grand larceny. Tapper went on to ask why the city is so quick to shield such dangerous criminals from deportation.  Tapper also asked DeBlasio for a response to the recent order President Donald Trump signed stating that federal grant money will be stripped “from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants. ” DeBlasio decried the move and insisted he opposes “tearing families apart” over a “small offense” such as drunk driving. DeBlasio claimed these “small” crimes don’t merit deportation, but for “any serious and violent crime, we’re going to work with” the federal government. Still, DeBlasio claimed that drunk driving could easily be seen as a lesser offense. “Drunk driving that does not lead to any other negative outcome, I could define as that,” DeBlasio said before going on to say, “Someone commits a minor offense  …     let’s say someone went through a stop sign, they could be deported for that and their family could be torn apart and you could have children left behind where the breadwinner in the family is sent back to a home country, that is not good for anyone. ” Of course, if someone is picked up and scheduled for deportation after being detained during a traffic stop, it isn’t the running of a stop sign that gets him deported it’s being in the country illegally. Drunk driving is not generally seen as a “small offense. ” Nearly 10, 000 Americans are killed by drunk drivers every year, according to The Hill newspaper. Indeed, for years many activists have criticized what they feel are chronically lax drunk driving laws in many states in the U. S.

3049,How to Nap - The New York Times,"“Duration is very important,” says Damien Léger, a doctor who runs the   center at the   hospital in Paris. Aim to sleep for 20 minutes. Anything longer, and you risk drifting into what scientists call   sleep, a state of languid   activity considered important for consolidating memories. Set an alarm clock. A   encounter is likely to leave you with what Léger calls “sleep drunkenness” instead of a feeling of rejuvenation. Think of napping as a basic right, not a petty luxury. For a French think tank, Léger wrote a recent report arguing that all workers should be permitted naptime, an especially important respite for those working night shifts or anyone who routinely sleeps six or fewer hours daily. Such chronic sleep deprivation is associated with hypertension, diabetes, depression, obesity, cancer and even an increased risk of death. Research shows that short periods of sleep increase cognitive performance, reaction time and mood. In one study, subjects who took an afternoon nap were nearly twice as likely to solve a   problem as those who didn’t. Establish a few basic preconditions. Find a safe space, like an unoccupied office or a dedicated rest area, where you’re unlikely to be bothered. Block out light with an eye mask. Absolute quiet is not a requirement for sleep, but if you are in a particularly noisy place, like a factory, use earplugs. You don’t need to lie down. Napping can be achieved sitting upright, cheek on the desk. “Bring along a small pillow for your head,” Léger says. The ideal snooze time will depend on your sleep schedule, but most daytime workers experience peak drowsiness in the afternoon. Léger hopes that someday, a quick slumber will re place the   coffee. “Napping is much more powerful than caffeine,” he says, “and there are no negative side effects. ” Patients often tell Léger how they sneak into the bathroom or into their parked cars to nod off during the workday. Their fatigue embarrasses them. Do your part to destigmatize naps by talking openly about how pooped you feel. Tell your   you intend to sleep for 20 minutes. “There is nothing shameful about a nap,” Léger says.",0

3051,"The Hubris of Democratic Elites, Clinton Campaign Gave Us President Trump","Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, her network of super political action committees, and the liberal establishment relished a matchup against Donald Trump. However, her campaign failed to put forward an alternative for voters that would combat a candidate that tapped into the vast amount of disillusionment among citizens. Tsunamis of voters unaccounted for in state polls, who do not identify with either the Democratic or Republican Parties, made President Trump a reality.
Clinton’s concession speech indicated the campaign and many of its supporters are unwilling to confront the hubris of her presidential run. Yet, citizens, especially those on the left, must in order to find the clarity to move onward with fights for social, economic, racial, and environmental justice.
The Democratic Party rigged parts of the party’s primary for Clinton, and it helped stave off a decisive challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders. The senator addressed the material conditions of the working class, including people of color. He warned the Democrats of wealth inequality, destructive free trade agreements, and some of the negative effects of global capitalism on the common man or woman. He connected with disaffected people who the Clinton campaign effectively wrote-off and performed well in states that Clinton lost in the general election.
However, the Democratic Party elites survived and coerced Sanders and his supporters into falling in line at their national convention. The party leadership enforced unity in Philadelphia to make it appear as if all was well when that was not the case.
Most progressive groups, like all presidential elections, demobilized or essentially became mechanisms for the Clinton campaign to mobilize voters from August to Election Day. This allowed the message of “Never Trump” to dominate as the only challenge to Trump, and without a real vision for lifting up the many Americans enticed by Trump’s campaign, the nation ended up with an end result similar to Senator John Kerry’s campaign, which ran primarily on the fact that he was not President George W. Bush.
It did not help the Clinton campaign that she had a reputation for supporting regime change wars, which have greatly destabilized parts of the world. Her fingerprints were all over the Libya disaster. She voted for the Iraq War, which created the conditions for the rise of the Islamic State. And, although it is questionable whether Trump really ever opposed the Iraq invasion, he insisted he was against the Iraq War during debates to undermine Clinton and fueled the perception that Clinton was somehow responsible for ISIS. Trump held himself out as someone who would not plunge the country into reckless military engagements.
Clinton’s closing argument included the following, “Is America dark and divisive or helpful and inclusive? Our core values are being tested in this election, but everywhere I go, people are refusing to be defined by fear and division. Look, we all know we’ve come through some hard economic times, and we’ve seen some pretty big changes. But I believe in our people. I love this country, and I’m convinced our best days are ahead of us if we reach for them together.”
That may have sounded good in the office of a campaign’s headquarters, but there was nothing specific in this buzzword-laden pablum. Multiculturalism does not help anyone pay their mortgage or find a job. As wrong as it is for millions of white Americans to take out their frustrations on people of color, the system failed them and keeps failing them. Additionally, establishment politicians like Clinton wrote off many of these people, believing if they focused on emphasizing diversity they would overcome the painful intertwined realities of class and race in the U.S. They were wrong.
Let us go back to the belief that a candidate like Trump would be perfect for Hillary Clinton. In April 2015, a strategy memo for the DNC was drafted by the campaign two months before Trump announced his candidacy. The goal was to “make whomever the Republicans nominate unpalatable to a majority of the electorate.”
“Force all Republican candidates to lock themselves into extreme conservative positions that will hurt them in a general election,” the campaign recommended. “Undermine any credibility/trust Republican presidential candidates have to make inroads to our coalition or independents.”
It advocated against marginalizing “more extreme candidates.” The campaign wanted to make “Pied Piper candidates,” like Trump, Senator Ted Cruz, and Ben Carson, into representatives of the Republican Party. “We need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously.” (The memo was attached to an email published by WikiLeaks.)
In the same month, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook pushed for a primary schedule, where the red states held their primaries early. It would increase “the likelihood the Rs nominate someone extreme.”
Essentially, the Clinton campaign engaged in steps that would help ensure Trump was the Republican presidential nominee. Their acts enabled the rise of Trump, and they lost to the opponent they wanted to face because they made the same mistakes Democrats make time and time again. They clung to failed corporate Democratic policies that have devastated this country for the past two decades, and in some ways, this election can be viewed as a referendum on those policies. And they treated the candidate who had answers for Americans as “unrealistic,” a “hapless legislator,” an “Obama betrayer,” and a socialist independent who was not a real Democrat. As in, he was not one of them, and they did not want him in their club.
* 
On June 26, Sanders warned Democrats what happened with Brexit in Britain could happen. He shared what he saw on the campaign trail. He noted the tens of thousands factories closed over the past 15 years. “More than 4.8 million well-paid manufacturing jobs have disappeared” as a result of trade agreements. Forty-seven million Americans live in poverty. Millions have no health insurance or are underinsured. Just as many struggle with student debt. “Frighteningly, millions of poorly educated Americans will have a shorter life span than the previous generation as they succumb to despair, drugs and alcohol.”
“Meanwhile, in our country the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Fifty-eight percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. Wall Street and billionaires, through their “ super PACs ,” are able to buy elections,” Sanders added.
“On my campaign, I’ve talked to workers unable to make it on $8 or $9 an hour; retirees struggling to purchase the medicine they need on $9,000 a year of Social Security; young people unable to afford college,” Sanders shared. “ I also visited the American citizens of Puerto Rico, where some 58 percent of the children live in poverty and only a little more than 40 percent of the adult population has a job or is seeking one.” 
It is important to note the Clinton campaign engaged in a calculated act of deception by supporting the Service Employees International Union’s “Fight for 15” while refusing to support a $15 minimum wage. All the states with minimum wage ballot initiatives passed wage increases yesterday. The campaign could have mobilized so more states had this sort of thing on the ballot. The possibility of more economic security may have increased enthusiasm. But the Clinton campaign did no such thing.
“The notion that Donald Trump could benefit from the same forces that gave the Leave proponents a majority in Britain should sound an alarm for the Democratic Party in the United States,” Sanders concluded. “Millions of American voters, like the Leave supporters, are understandably angry and frustrated by the economic forces that are destroying the middle class.”
“In this pivotal moment, the Democratic Party and a new Democratic president need to make clear that we stand with those who are struggling and who have been left behind. We must create national and global economies that work for all, not just a handful of billionaires.”
Efforts to process what unfolded on Election Day must recognize the warning of Sanders and millions of his supporters went unheeded. Clinton practically ran as an avatar of the billionaire class, albeit a potentially benevolent caretaker of the masses if they just stood with her. Had more in the establishment media and institutions of power taken the time to reflect on what transpired in the Democratic primary, they would have feared the worst and taken more steps to prevent a Trump primary by trying to shift the dynamic of her campaign.
Lest one forget, the Clintons are New Democrats. They aligned with business forces in the early 1990s. They stood with conservative Democrats, who broke with labor, civil rights, and other liberal causes. They pushed the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). They backed welfare repeal, bills which fueled the rise of mass incarceration, and signed a 1997 budget that slashed millions for social programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They put corporate interests over environmental protections. They encouraged the deregulation of industry, which greatly boosted Wall Street. Altogether, the Clintons enabled the right as it decimated the liberal class and expanded unfettered capitalism. (For more, read Lance Selfa’s book, “The Democrats: A Critical History.”)
Finally, the outcome confirms what many expressed months ago. The Democratic Party was willing to do whatever it took to nominate Hillary Clinton, even if it meant working against the very forces behind Bernie Sanders, which could help them succeed against Donald Trump, because the last thing they wanted was a major shift toward more socially democratic policies. Also, Clinton was next in line. Whether voters viewed her as a weak candidate or a dishonest and untrustworthy politician did not matter. They would go to battle for her and gladly lose this war.

3052,"Our Woman in New York: Primary Day, at Last - The New York Times","Maggie Haberman, a New York Times political correspondent, has devoted her journalistic career to two irresistible subjects: politics and New York City. At age 7, she had her first byline in The Daily News it has now appeared in all three New York dailies. A native of the Upper West Side who lives in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, she has covered 10 election cycles, from mayoral contests to presidential campaigns, including the 2016 race, which turns to New York on Tuesday for its primary. Join us for live primary updates. Hello from Crown Heights, where the trees are finally green enough to canopy over Eastern Parkway and where the New York primary has officially arrived. Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton are the heavy favorites to win in their home state, where both have been known presences for many years. But there are some tantalizing subplots that could help direct the remaining acts of this political theater. Voting began at 6 a. m. in parts of the state, and lasts until 9 p. m. everywhere. Some things to watch for: It’s a recurring question in New York, though the answer has been mostly “yes” since 2009 when the state switched to “optimum scan” machines. Still, on a day with two competitive primaries, a recent rarity in the state, there will be a particular focus on whether people are able to cast ballots without disruption. In 2008, the turnout in the state Democratic primary was at a high, with more than 1. 89 million people voting for either Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, or her rival, Barack Obama, then a senator from Illinois. And more than 670, 000 Republicans voted in a primary that, by then, was clearly leaning toward Senator John McCain of Arizona. The New Yorker in the race, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had dropped out long before then. The likelihood of the Democratic turnout reaching the 2008 level is slim. But the Republicans could certainly exceed their 2008 numbers given the enthusiasm that Mr. Trump has set off in pockets of the state, including Staten Island. Large sections of heavily   areas in the city, particularly in Brooklyn, propelled Mr. Obama to victory in 2008. The votes were a shift, not just away from Mrs. Clinton, but also within the black power structure of a city where Harlem had long been the epicenter. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from central Brooklyn, was a key Obama backer in 2008. He now supports Mrs. Clinton with gusto. And black voters have bolstered Mrs. Clinton’s campaign in a series of Midwestern contests with large urban centers, as well as in the South. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. Clinton’s rival, spoke derisively during their debate in Brooklyn last week of her previous wins in the South, comments in which voters could hear a thinly veiled jab at primaries with lots of black voters. But Mrs. Clinton has struggled to energize her supporters in the state, as younger voters, college students and disaffected   white voters have turned toward Mr. Sanders. She will need a large black vote to buoy her here once again. However, most of the Democratic primary vote comes from the city and southern portions of the state. Mr. Trump heads into Tuesday’s vote with a   lead in the polls. The chances of his not winning New York are remote to say the least. But Mr. Trump’s rivals, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, are trying as hard as possible to keep his share of the vote below 50 percent in the state to limit the number of delegates he can accrue. The geography of victory for Mr. Trump, who barely campaigned in New York City, is also significant. Can he capture congressional districts in Manhattan, where Republicans are far from plentiful and are aligned more with, say, George Pataki, the former governor, than with Mr. Trump? If he can, it suggests that he may still be able to increase his support in the coming months if he tightens his message and becomes more disciplined. Other questions: Can Mr. Kasich capture the suburbs north of New York City, where his message should play best? And did Mr. Cruz repair any of the damage from his criticisms this year of “New York values,” or are northern parts of the state, with heavier evangelical bases, less troubled by that particular salvo? Mr. Sanders’s message is very close to that of Zephyr Teachout, who ran an insurgent campaign against the sitting governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, in the Democratic primary in 2014. Ms. Teachout did not come close to winning. But she exceeded expectations, performing particularly well in the Hudson Valley region north of New York City. Mr. Sanders, in theory, should be able to do similarly well. If he does not, it will raise questions, once again, about the durability of his campaign. “No, no, no, no!” said Omarosa Manigault, perhaps the most famous former “Apprentice” hopeful, who is now an almost   advocate and Friend of Donald on cable television shows. She was standing near him in the lower lobby of Trump Tower on Monday afternoon, talking to members of the Trump “diversity coalition,” a group formed by Mr. Trump’s longtime counselor Michael Cohen to, in part, rebut claims that the candidate is racially insensitive. Two of the members were trying to wedge between the tables separating Mr. Trump from the group. Ms. Manigault put a stop to it. Mr. Trump was grateful for the support. “You look at the other folks running, they couldn’t care less about New York. We care about New York, a lot,” Mr. Trump said. It was part of a busy day for the candidates as they held their final campaign events before the primary. Several hours later, Mr. Sanders held a rally at the open field at Hunter’s Point South Park in Long Island City, Queens. “You all look beautiful!” Mr. Sanders, his voice hoarse at times, called out to the hundreds of people who attended. (He drew 28, 000 people in Prospect Park in Brooklyn on Sunday.) The montage was indeed beautiful, with state and American flags adorning the stage. Attendees lounged as the gauzy strains of the Simon and Garfunkel hit “America” played on the sound system before Mr. Sanders arrived. Children played tag with an adult. A little girl turned cartwheels. But the park was not close to full by 8 p. m. No matter. Mr. Sanders spoke to the crowd with his trademark conviction. “People are standing up and saying, ‘Sorry, the big money interests will not continue to dominate American politics.’ ” Only the New York residents, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, will hang around the state on Tuesday. Both will vote, most likely with reporters in tow, and then will hold election night parties. Mr. Trump’s will be at Trump Tower, while Mrs. Clinton’s will be at the Sheraton New York.",0
3053,Dutch Pol Geert Wilders Refuses to Attend His Trial; Says It’s “Political”,"Email 
Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician best known for his criticism of Islam, won’t attend his own trial that begins Monday. He asserted, Monday, the trial against freedom of speech begins … against a politician who says what the politically correct elite does not want to hear. This trial is a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate. 
The trial concerns two public utterances that he made back in 2014, including one where he spoke to political supporters at The Hague. He asked them if they wanted fewer Moroccans in the country, and they responded “Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!” Wilders responded, “Well, we’ll take care of it, then.” 
Some 6,400 complaints were filed with local police, mostly from Moroccans living in the country. The court sorted through them and found 35 that were valid to bring charges of discrimination against Wilders. 
Wilders was also charged in 2011 with criminally insulting Islam and inciting hatred as a result. Those charges stemmed from articles that he had penned and statements that he made calling for a ban on the Koran, warning against an “Islamic invasion” of his country and the coming “tsunami of Islamization.” He described Islam as fascist, Moroccan youths as instigators of violence, and compared the Koran to Hitler’s Mein Kampf . 
He authored the script for a 2004 film entitled Fitna , a 17-minute-long argument that Islam encourages acts of terrorism, anti-semitism, violence against women, subjugation of infidels, and sanctions against homosexuals. Wilders explained his intentions, saying that the film (which is free on the Internet) was “a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of Islamisation.” 
When he was acquitted of all charges in that trial, Wilders called it victory not only for himself but for freedom of speech. 
The present trial is a variation on the same theme: Wilders is being charged with discrimination against a group, not a religion, which in the Netherlands is considered a hate crime. Frans Zonneveld, a spokesman for the prosecution, explained the difference: Islam is an idea, a religion, [and] according to the public prosecution service, you have a lot of room to criticize ideas. But when it comes to population groups [Moroccans make up about two percent of the 17 million citizens in the Netherlands], it’s a whole different matter. His remarks touched the very being of this population group. You cannot choose to be a part of a population group or not; it’s a group that’s decided by birth, so it’s a whole different matter. 
Wilders responded: “It is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans [in the Netherlands]. It is my right and duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country.” 
In the Netherlands, Wilders does not have the guarantees provided Americans under the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, specifically those spelled out by the First Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” Instead he is faced with a greater likelihood this time around of going to jail, or at least paying a fine or doing some community service, for his “crime.” However, his Freedom Party will face the Netherlands’ ruling party in elections in March. At present the race is too close to call. A conviction of Wilders in this case could work to his party’s advantage, as an increasing number of Dutch citizens are becoming aware of his warnings and potential threats to their culture.

3054,Trump Budget Includes ’Significant Funding of . . . Refugee Program’ - Breitbart,"The blueprint for the Trump administration’s FY 2018 budget released on Thursday “allows for significant funding of humanitarian assistance, including food aid, disaster, and refugee program funding” in the State Department. [“This would focus funding on the highest priority areas while asking the rest of the world to pay their fair share,” the blueprint states.  “Taken together with the executive order, it looks like the president will keep the refugee program with a lower annual number, like the 50, 000 limit specified in Executive Order 13780, and when the annual determination is released, identify countries of concern in a way that excludes Somalia, and other countries of concern that are known to harbor terrorists,” a source familiar with the federal refugee resettlement program tells Breitbart News. “As long as he keeps the refugee program going, we are going to get more people from countries related to real security issues and regardless, the program needs to be legislatively reformed and regulations that have caused Constitutional violations repealed before restarting in FY 2018,” the source adds. The language of the blueprint, however, could be interpreted to suggest that the Trump administration’s “significant funding of . . . [the] refugee program” defines the program broadly to include safe zones in other parts of the world in addition to the federal refugee resettlement program. As such, a further reduction of refugees resettled in the United States in FY 2018 could be entirely possible. President Trump supported the establishment of safe zones for refugees during the campaign. Typically, the president releases an annual determination of the number of refugees to be allowed into the country in the month preceding the start of a new fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, that number is determined at the sole discretion of the president. Subsequent to the president’s determination of that number, Congress has traditionally funded the refugee resettlement program at the level set by the president for the coming fiscal year. FY 2017 has proceeded differently. In September, President Obama announced a determination that he wanted Congress to fund the arrival of 110, 000 refugees in the United States in FY 2017, an increase from 84, 995 that arrived in FY 2016. Congress, caught up in an election year in which the number of refugees to be resettled, as well as their vetting and countries of origin, were key issues in the Presidential campaign, did not pass a budget for the full fiscal year prior to the beginning of FY 2017. Instead, Congress passed a temporary continuing resolution that extended the FY 2016 budget through the first ten weeks of FY 2017, then renewed an additional continuing resolution in December that runs out at the end of April. That budget funds refugee resettlement at the FY 2016 level of 84, 995 annually for a little more than a month more. Come April 28, there will be no budget authority for any discretionary budget activities —  including refugee resettlement —  unless Congress passes funding authority for the balance of FY 2017. Given the contentious current political environment of Washington, it is uncertain whether Congress will have such funding authority in place prior to that date. During the three months and 20 days of FY 2017, the final days of the Obama administration, 30, 122 refugees were resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 83, 292. In the subsequent 55 days since the start of the Trump administration, 7, 989 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which corresponds to an annualized rate of 53, 018. To date, 38, 111 refugees have been resettled in the United States, which would leave room for a maximum of 11, 899 over the remaining six months and fourteen days of FY 2017, under President Trump’s 50, 000 level set in Executive Order 13769 signed on January 27, then set again in Executive Order 13780 signed on March 6. On Wednesday, 9th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Derrick Watson, an Obama appointee and 1991 Harvard Law School classmate of the former president, struck down Executive Order 13780 hours before it was scheduled for implementation. He based his   decision, issued just two hours after the hearing was concluded, on campaign statements made by President Trump prior to his election and a leaked “draft document” from the office of a Department of Homeland Security Obama holdover whom Breitbart News had identified as one of eight top Department of Homeland Security Obama holdovers President Trump could “fire or remove. ” In striking down Section 6, the portion of Executive Order 13780 in which President Trump limited the number of refugees to 50, 000 annually, Judge Watson —  for one of the first times in American history —  asserted the supremacy of the judicial branch over the legislative and executive branches. Not even Judge James Robart, who stopped the first executive order of the same title (Executive Order 13769) went that far in his usurpations. Robart notably excluded Section 5 d of Executive Order 13769, in which President Trump limited the number of refugees in FY 2017 to 50, 000, from his temporary restraining order. Also on Wednesday, 4th Circuit Court Federal District Judge Theodore Chuang, another Harvard Law School graduate Obama appointee and former bureaucrat in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, issued a similar ruling. Though Chuang did not strike down President Trump’s statutory and Constitutional authority to limit the number of refugees on Wednesday, he did schedule a March 29 hearing  on plaintiffs motion to enjoin the “specific provision of the First Executive Order [Section 5 d of Executive Order 13679]” in which the president set the annual refugee limit for FY 2017 at 50, 000. “The Court will resolve that Motion, which the parties have agreed should be construed to apply to the successor provision of the Second Executive Order [13780]  in accordance with the previously established schedule,” Chuang wrote in his decision. HIAS, one of the nine major voluntary agencies (VOLAGs) paid more than $1 billion annually by the federal government to resettle refugees, is one of the plaintiffs in the Maryland case. HIAS hopes to persuade Judge Chuang to double the number of refugees to 100, 000 in FY 2017. Should he rule in favor of HIAS on March 28, Chuang will accelerate the pending Constitutional crisis that may be set off by Judge Watson’s decision, as respected attorney Paul Mirengoff wrote at Powerline Blog and Rush Limbaugh suggested in his nationally syndicated radio program. As to the number refugees who will be resettled in the United States during the balance of FY 2017, President Trump may take a page from President Andrew Jackson, whose tomb he honored during his visit to Nashville on Wednesday. “John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it,” President Jackson said of an 1832 Supreme Court decision unfavorable to his policies issued by the Marshall Court. President Trump’s attitude to the unfavorable decision issued by Judge Watson regarding a president’s Constitutional and statutory authority to limit the number of refugees arriving in the United States, a decision Judge Chuang may agree with on March 28,  may well be something like this: “Judge Watson has made his decision now let him pay for it. ”",0
3055,Reince Priebus Slams Chuck Todd: ’You Don’t Stop Talking’ - Breitbart,"Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” while discussing the details of President Donald Trump executive order halting access to the United States for immigrants from seven   countries, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus expressed his frustration over host Chuck Todd’s interruptions.  Partial transcript as follows: TODD: One of the in in the order is to include green card holders and that is something that there has been a report that the Department of Homeland Security recommended it not include green card holders. Why did the White House choose to overrule the Department of Homeland Security on that one. PRIEBUS: We didn’t overrule the Department of Homeland Security. As far as green card holders moving forward, it didn’t affect them. If you’re coming in and out identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous in the world in regard to harboring terror firsts and affirmed by congress multiple times then you’re going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months. this is something that 75% 80% of Americans out there agree with. We don’t want people that are traveling back and forth to one of these seven countries that harbor terrorists to be traveling freely back and forth between the United States and those countries. TODD:  You did say something at the beginning of your answer and it seemed like an aside. This order does not impact any green card holders from these seven countries. PRIEBUS: Of course, it does. if you’re traveling back and forth you’ll be subjected to further screening. Of course. TODD: Are you going to do that to American citizens as well that travel in and out of these seven countries? PRIEBUS: I would suspect it if you’re an American citizen traveling back and forth to Libya you’re likely to be subjected to further questioning when you come to an airport. TODD: Why are you confident that’s constitutional and I’ll ask it this way because green card holders they go through extreme vetting to get the green card, and number two, when they get the green card they’re entitled to all of the protections that citizens do. PRIEBUS: I’m not suggesting that. TODD: I understand that. are you, by having to put an extra hurdle for a green card holder to get into the country how are you confident that doesn’t violate their rights and doesn’t end up making the order unconstitutional. PRIEBUS: First of all, it’s not affecting green card holders. TODD: you keep saying  —   you said it does  —   PRIEBUS: If you would just slow down for a second and listen I could answer your question. &gt, TODD I understand that, but you’ve twice confused me so I’m trying to understand the clarity. PRIEBUS:  It’s because you don’t stop talking, Chuck. I love you, but let me answer the question. If you’re a person  —   this isn’t in regard to the executive order, the executive order doesn’t affect green card holders moving forward. I said that. What I’m suggesting is customs and border patrol, I would suspect within their discretion hey have a person traveling back and forth to Libya or Somalia or Yemen I would suspect within their discretion they might ask a few more questions at JFK or some other airport when someone is coming back and forth within their discretionary authority as a customs and border patrol agent and what I’m saying is that I would suspect that most would agree that that would be a good thing to do. What I’m not suggesting to you that that is in the order moving forward. I’m suggesting that within the discretion of the CBP that those questions would likely be asked.

3056,Why Is It So Hard to Reduce the Pentagon Budget?,"Why Is It So Hard to Reduce the Pentagon Budget?   
By William D. Hartung / TomDispatch David B. Gleason / CC BY-SA 2.0 
Through good times and bad, regardless of what’s actually happening in the world, one thing is certain: in the long run, the Pentagon budget won’t go down. 
It’s not that that budget has never been reduced. At pivotal moments, like the end of World War II as well as war’s end in Korea and Vietnam, there were indeed temporary downturns, as there was after the Cold War ended. More recently, the Budget Control Act of 2011 threw a monkey wrench into the Pentagon’s plans for funding that would go ever onward and upward by putting a cap on the money Congress could pony up for it. The remarkable thing, though, is not that such moments have occurred, but how modest and short-lived they’ve proved to be. 
Take the current budget. It’s down slightly from its peak in 2011, when it reached the highest level since World War II, but this year’s budget for the Pentagon and related agencies is nothing to sneeze at. It comes in at roughly $600 billion — more than the peak year of the massive arms build-up initiated by President Ronald Reagan back in the 1980s. To put this figure in perspective: despite troop levels in Iraq and Afghanistan dropping sharply over the past eight years, the Obama administration has still managed to spend more on the Pentagon than the Bush administration did during its two terms in office. 
What accounts for the Department of Defense’s ability to keep a stranglehold on your tax dollars year after endless year? 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
Pillar one supporting that edifice: ideology. As long as most Americans accept the notion that it is the God-given mission and right of the United States to go anywhere on the planet and do more or less anything it cares to do with its military, you won’t see Pentagon spending brought under real control. Think of this as the military corollary to American exceptionalism—or just call it the doctrine of armed exceptionalism, if you will. 
The second pillar supporting lavish military budgets (and this will hardly surprise you): the entrenched power of the arms lobby and its allies in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. The strategic placement of arms production facilities and military bases in key states and Congressional districts has created an economic dependency that has saved many a flawed weapons system from being unceremoniously dumped in the trash bin of history. 
Lockheed Martin, for instance, has put together a handy map of how its troubled F-35 fighter jet has created 125,000 jobs in 46 states. The actual figures are, in fact, considerably lower, but the principle holds: having subcontractors in dozens of states makes it harder for members of Congress to consider cutting or slowing down even a failed or failing program. Take as an example the M-1 tank, which the Army actually wanted to stop buying. Its plans were thwarted by the Ohio congressional delegation, which led a fight to add more M-1s to the budget in order to keep the General Dynamics production line in Lima, Ohio, up and running. In a similar fashion, prodded by the Missouri delegation, Congress added two different versions of Boeing’s F-18 aircraft to the budget to keep funds flowing to that company’s St. Louis area plant. 
The one-two punch of an environment in which the military can do no wrong, while being outfitted for every global task imaginable, and what former Pentagon analyst Franklin “Chuck” Spinney has called “ political engineering ,” has been a tough combination to beat. 
“Scare the Hell Out of the American People” 
The overwhelming consensus in favor of a “cover the globe” military strategy has been broken from time to time by popular resistance to the idea of using war as a central tool of foreign policy. In such periods, getting Americans behind a program of feeding the military machine massive sums of money has generally required a heavy dose of fear. 
For example, the last thing most Americans wanted after the devastation and hardship unleashed by World War II was to immediately put the country back on a war footing. The demobilization of millions of soldiers and a sharp cutback in weapons spending in the immediate postwar years rocked what President Dwight Eisenhower would later dub the “military-industrial complex.” 
As Wayne Biddle has noted in his seminal book Barons of the Sky ,the U.S. aerospace industry produced an astonishing 300,000-plus military aircraft during World War II. Not surprisingly, major weapons producers struggled to survive in a peacetime environment in which government demand for their products threatened to be a tiny fraction of wartime levels. 
Lockheed President Robert Gross was terrified by the potential impact of war’s end on his company’s business, as were many of his industry cohorts. “As long as I live,” he said , “I will never forget those short, appalling weeks” of the immediate postwar period. To be clear, Gross was appalled not by the war itself, but by the drop off in orders occasioned by its end. He elaborated in a 1947 letter to a friend: “We had one underlying element of comfort and reassurance during the war. We knew we’d get paid for anything we built. Now we are almost entirely on our own.” 
The postwar doldrums in military spending that worried him so were reversed only after the American public had been fed a steady, fear-filled diet of anti-communism. NSC-68 , a secret memorandum the National Security Council prepared for President Harry Truman in April 1950, created the template for a policy based on the global “containment” of communism and grounded in a plan to encircle the Soviet Union with U.S. military forces, bases, and alliances. This would, of course, prove to be a strikingly expensive proposition. The concluding paragraphs of that memorandum underscored exactly that point, calling for a “sustained buildup of U.S. political, economic, and military strength… [to] frustrate the Kremlin design of a world dominated by its will.”",0

3058,Tyra Banks’s Mansion in the Sky Is on the Market - The New York Times,"The supermodel and TV personality Tyra Banks has decided to sell her Battery Park City home, a   duplex facing the Hudson River, complete with dressing room and hair salon, a personal gym and separate staff and guest quarters. Ms. Banks bought her Riverhouse apartment, at 2 River Terrace, in 2009 and used it as a primary residence for about four years. But she has been spending most of her time lately on the West Coast, where she has homes in Los Angeles and Northern California, and so she has been renting out the unit since May 2015, for $50, 000 a month furnished. Tyra Beauty, her new cosmetics company, is also based in Los Angeles, as are various entertainment projects. (Ms. Banks is the new   of “America’s Got Talent” and will be returning to the show she helped create, “America’s Next Top Model. ”) The Lower Manhattan apartment, which overlooks Rockefeller Park, is being offered for both rent (at $50, 000 a month) and for sale, with an asking price of $17. 5 million and monthly carrying costs of $16, 644, according to the listing broker, Adam D. Modlin of the Modlin Group. Ms. Banks, 43, who last year became a parent for the first time with her photographer boyfriend, Erik Asla, said she would prefer to sell the place rather than continue leasing it out, although she admits that she “will miss the feeling of having a home in the sky. ” When she bought it, she said in an email, she intended to create a space that felt less like an apartment and more “like a   home with finishes and an experience like one would have in the Hamptons or even in an estate in Los Angeles. ” She seemed to have succeeded, at least when it comes to its sprawl and flourishes. The    duplex, No. 22D, is actually a combination of four units at the   Riverhouse  —   three on the 22nd floor and one on the 23rd  —   that were acquired for $10. 13 million. Ms. Banks said she spent almost as much on the extensive renovations and décor, which incorporate rich fabrics, textured wall coverings, exotic wood details and ornate light fixtures. The apartment also has surround sound,   oak floors and ample storage throughout. “New amazing ideas just kept coming and coming to me,” Ms. Banks said of the renovations, which dragged on for several months. The layout of the apartment was configured to provide maximum privacy  —   for staff, business associates, family and guests  —   with various wings that can be closed off from the rest of the unit. There are five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and three powder rooms, along with several kitchens and kitchenettes. The home is entered through a hallway on the main level that leads to a spacious living room with a connecting   room. Several feet away are the family room and open chef’s kitchen. The kitchen has two Miele dishwashers and other   appliances, along with a butler’s pantry, a copper sink and an island of zebrawood, to name a few features. Nearby is a dining alcove with banquette seating that, Ms. Banks said, was meant to resemble “a booth at a   restaurant. ” These main entertaining rooms face    windows that offer expansive views of the river and beyond. “There’s the Statue of Liberty, all the ferryboats from the New York Waterway and the Midtown skyline,” Mr. Modlin said. The lower level contains the gym, mirrored dressing room, salon and laundry area. Also there are offices and a staff suite with another full kitchen, two bedrooms and a bathroom. The staff suite has an additional entrance. And if all that were not enough, there is another   suite with a kitchenette, for guests. “She created different spaces,” Mr. Modlin said, “so you can have different things going on in the home. ” On the second level are another   bedroom and an enormous master suite, which features a sitting area, kitchenette and   shag carpeting. There are dual master bathrooms and dressing rooms, and a large marble soaking tub encased in white oak. The   Riverhouse development, which received a gold certification in the LEED environmental building rating system, offers amenities like a   concierge, valet parking, a yoga studio and fitness center, and a saltwater lap pool. It also has as a resident the actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who, like Ms. Banks, has created his own compound there. Ms. Banks said the two never ran into each other in the building. “He was always that elusive spirit that so many people talked about,” she said. “Farewell, Leo. I’ll miss my houseguests trying to spot you in our building. ”",0
3059,U.S. Will Deploy 560 More Troops to Iraq to Help Retake Mosul From ISIS - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   President Obama will send 560 more troops to Iraq to help retake Mosul, the largest city still controlled by the Islamic State, a deployment intended to capitalize on recent battlefield gains that also illustrates the obstacles that Mr. Obama has faced in trying to wind down America’s wars. The additional troops, announced here on Monday by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, are the latest escalation of the American military role in Iraq by Mr. Obama, who withdrew the last American soldiers from Iraq at the end of 2011. He began sending them back three years later after Islamic State fighters swept into the country from Syria. Many of the newly deployed troops will be based at an airfield 40 miles south of Mosul that was reclaimed by Iraqi soldiers on Saturday. Administration officials said the airfield would be critical to a successful military operation because the United States could use it as a staging area to provide logistical support to Iraqi forces as they try to retake Mosul. The Iraqis have struggled with the logistics of moving troops and equipment and these tasks will become more difficult as their forces move closer to Mosul, 250 miles from major supply hubs in Baghdad. The deployment will bring the official number of American service members in Iraq to 4, 647. The United States had about 130, 000 service members in the country about a decade ago. “We need to move to this place to be as close to the fighting as we have been,” said Lt. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, the head of American forces in Iraq, speaking to reporters with Mr. Carter at the Baghdad airport. For Mr. Obama, sending more troops raises the chances that he could fulfill his hope of handing over a liberated Mosul to his successor. But it also means that he will leave the next president with a significant military presence in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Last week, Mr. Obama announced the United States would keep 8, 400 troops in Afghanistan indefinitely. At a NATO meeting in Poland over the weekend, the president spoke of his frustrations with these   military engagements. In Iraq, he noted, American troops vanquished Al Qaeda in Iraq, a Sunni militant group. But the extremists reconstituted themselves in Syria as the Islamic State, before seizing the cities of Falluja and Mosul. Still, the president said Iraqi forces had made important gains in the last several weeks. Most important, they retook Falluja, a victory that he said, “got a little bit lost in the news, but that’s a big town. ” “They’re now positioning themselves so that they can start going after Mosul,” the president said. The Islamic State fighters, he said, were “on their heels, and we’re going to stay on it. ” White House officials resisted suggestions that more American troops might be needed to uproot the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, from Mosul. “The president has been very clear about what our mission is and what our mission isn’t,” the press secretary, Josh Earnest, said on Monday. “This is an effort to reinforce our support for Iraqi forces that are enjoying some success in driving ISIL out of strategic, important areas in Iraq, that can put them in a position to succeed on a much bigger goal: driving ISIL out of Iraq’s second largest city. ” Some of the American troops who will be stationed at the airfield, known as Qaiyara Airfield West, specialize in infrastructure projects, like building bridges, which is a technical skill the Iraqis will need for the assault on Mosul because the Islamic State has destroyed many around the city. The new deployment comes two years after Mr. Obama said that while the United States would help Iraq reclaim territory from the Islamic State, its efforts would “not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. ” Since then, he has steadily increased the number of troops and given them more authority. Three service members have been killed. In April, Mr. Carter came to Baghdad to announce that Mr. Obama had given American military advisers the approval to work closer to the front lines of the conflict with smaller units of Iraqi forces. As part of that announcement, Mr. Obama deployed an additional 217 troops. Mosul is now the only major city in the country that the Iraqis do not control, and the Islamic State has not seized any substantial new territory since May 2015. Still, the Iraqis do not seem to be able to stop the Islamic State from launching devastating suicide attacks in Baghdad, including one this month that killed 300 people. “As ISIL loses territory and the fraud of the caliphate becomes more obvious, they are going to start resorting to more traditional terrorist tactics,” Mr. Obama said in his news conference. “They can’t govern. They can’t deliver anything meaningful to the people whose territory they can control. The one thing they know how to do is kill. ” To help the Iraqis stop the bombings, Mr. Carter said a   general in charge of the American military’s task force on improvised explosive devices would be sent to Baghdad to work with the Iraqis. The general and his staff would bring “that substantial experience and tradecraft that we learned by hard experience in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Mr. Carter said. American commanders have begun referring to the Qaiyara Airfield West as “Key West” or “Q West” because its Iraqi name is difficult for them to pronounce. As the Iraqi military closed in on the base last week, Islamic State fighters quickly fled and the Iraqis, who lost control of it in 2014, faced little resistance. Iraqi military officials said in interviews on Monday that there was substantial damage to the air base that would require repairs. “We were surprised by how destroyed the base was and how they had done it in an organized way,” said Abdul Ghani   the commander of Iraqi counterterrorism forces, who planned the operation. Mr. Assadi said one of two runways at the airfield had been badly damaged, along with some buildings. A small group of American forces surveyed the airfield shortly after the Iraqis seized it, but American military officials said it was still unclear how much time it would take before cargo planes and other aircraft could begin landing there. The official estimate of 4, 647 troops in Iraq understates the actual number of American military personnel in the country. The Pentagon uses a system for counting troops that excludes commandos and those who are supposed to be stationed in the country for less than four months. All told, Defense Department officials have said there are probably more than 5, 000 Americans in Iraq.",0
3060,Trump Insists Mexico Will Pay for Wall After U.S. Begins the Work - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   As congressional Republicans on Friday discussed quickly moving ahead with plans for a southern border wall using money included in this year’s spending bills,   Donald J. Trump insisted that Mexico would ultimately pay for its construction. “We’re going to get reimbursed,” Mr. Trump said during a brief telephone interview. “But I don’t want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed. ” The congressional Republicans’ talk led to speculation that Mr. Trump was retreating on his campaign promise to make Mexico pay for the wall. Mr. Trump insisted he is not. Republicans have balked at increases in domestic spending during the Obama administration and are unlikely to enthusiastically rally behind a proposal that could require billions of taxpayer dollars. Building a wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants could also face intense opposition from a bipartisan coalition in Congress that argues that a vast barrier along the border would be ineffective in stopping people who are determined to enter the country illegally and would represent a symbolic affront to the idea that the United States is a welcoming country that embraces immigration. In the interview, Mr. Trump vowed that Mexico would ultimately reimburse the United States. He said that payment would most likely emerge from his efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Mexican government. “It’s going to be part of everything,” Mr. Trump said of the cost of building the wall. “We are going to be making a much better deal. It’s a deal that never should have been signed. ” But he said that the trade negotiations would take time and that he supported the idea of using taxpayer money to begin construction of the border wall “in order to speed up the process. ” The full cost of a wall as described by Mr. Trump could be enormous. Attaching such a charged issue to annual, mandatory government funding measures could instigate a risky political fight. Those who want to block money for the wall by holding up the bills could find themselves accused of shutting down the government. The Government Accountability Office has estimated it could cost $6. 5 million per mile to build a   fence, with an additional $4. 2 million per mile for roads and more fencing, according to congressional officials. Those estimates do not include maintenance of the fence along the nearly   border with Mexico. “The chairman and the committee have no interest in threatening a shutdown,” said Jennifer Hing, a spokeswoman for the House Appropriations Committee, referring to Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the committee’s new chairman. If funding for the border wall is included in spending bills this spring, it would provide money to begin construction on a barrier that was authorized by legislation passed in 2006, but was never completed. Ms. Hing said neither Mr. Trump’s transition team nor Republican leaders had asked for funding to build a wall on the Mexican border. “If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,” she said in an email on Friday. At a rally in August in Phoenix, hours after meeting with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, Mr. Trump vowed that America’s southern neighbor would bear the financial burden of securing the border. “Mexico will pay for the wall, believe me  —   100 percent  —   they don’t know it yet, but they will pay for the wall,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re great people, and great leaders, but they will pay for the wall. ” In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump mocked news reports about the possible taxpayer funding of the border barrier, suggesting that Mexico would be forced to reimburse the American government for any costs incurred in building the wall. “The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed) will be paid back by Mexico later!” he wrote early Friday. Vicente Fox, who was Mexico’s president from 2000 until 2006, responded to Mr. Trump’s Twitter message with a barrage of outraged posts that became an internet talking point on their own. In one of them, he made reference to the intelligence agency reports about Russian meddling in the 2016 election. “Sr Trump, the intelligence report is devastating,” Mr. Fox said. “Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this. Are you a legitimate president?” Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York and one of Mr. Trump’s liaisons on Capitol Hill, said on Friday morning that members of his party in Congress were eager to get moving on construction of a border wall, even if that meant using taxpayer money to finance it. In an appearance on the CNN program “New Day,” Mr. Collins said it should come as no surprise to anyone that the United States government would have to pay for building the wall. “Of course, we have to pay the bills,” he said. “We’re building the wall. ” As a candidate, Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico was one of his most powerful speaking points. He often used it at rallies to whip up his supporters and bolster his argument that illegal immigration was damaging the United States. His repeated pledge to make Mexico pay was in part a way to rebut one of the central criticisms of a border wall  —   that its cost could run into the many billions of dollars. Democrats slammed the reports that Mr. Trump would ask Congress to fund the project. “If President Trump asks Congress to approve taxpayer dollars to build a wall, which he has always said would not be paid for by U. S. taxpayers, we will carefully review the request to determine if these taxpayer dollars would be better spent on building hospitals to care for our veterans, roads and bridges to help taxpayers get to work, and for N. I. H. to find cures for cancer,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said she thought even Republicans might balk at spending what she said could be $14 billion on a wall. “I think that’s a heavy sell,” she said. “I think that’s a tough sell for them. ”",0
3061,"House Intel Leaders Ask FBI, CIA, NSA How Many Americans They ’Unmasked’ - Breitbart","The leaders of the House intelligence committee are giving the NSA, FBI, and the CIA until Friday to reveal how many Americans’ private conversations were improperly ‘unmasked’ amid legal surveillance activities in the last six months, which they believe happened to President Donald Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. [The demand comes as the committee is trying to figure out who revealed Flynn’s identity during his phone calls with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in December and who illegally leaked the classified contents of those calls to the news media.  “Masking” refers to the protection of identities of Americans who are inadvertently caught up in surveillance  —   for example, of foreign individuals in the U. S.  —   and is referred to as a “minimization” procedure. Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff ( ) made the request in a letter dated Mar. 15 addressed to Director of the National Security Agency Adm. Michael Rogers, FBI Director James Comey, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. “As you know, the Committee has been very concerned regarding the purported unauthorized disclosures of classified information, particularly when they pertain to intelligence collection on, or related to, U. S. persons (USP). To take a prominent example, a January 12, 2017 article in a major newspaper was the first to claim that ‘Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, [then  ] Trump’s choice for national security adviser   …    . phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29. ” “Such stories would appear to contain the unauthorized disclosure of USP identities. This potential misuse is a key reason why the Intelligence Community (IC) has developed robust ‘minimization procedures’ for the protection of USP information, including requiring the ‘masking’ of USP identities in most circumstances,” they wrote. “However, as recent news stories seem to illustrate, individuals talking to the media would appear to have wantonly disregarded these procedures,” they added. Thus, the leaders have requested all policies   procedures each agency uses to determine when to unmask and disseminate the identity of an American and the number of individuals who can approve an unmasking. They are also asking for the total number of times any unmasked American identity was disseminated between June 2016 and January 2017. They are also asking for the names of those unmasked Americans who had their identities disseminated in response to requests from intelligence community agencies, law enforcement, or any senior Executive Branch officials during that timeframe, in relation to either Trump or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They also want to know who requested any unmasking and dissemination of individuals related to Trump or Clinton and why.

London, UK, England - You can buy anything and connect it to the internet these days; TV's and microwaves, toilets and toasters. Even the latest artificial leg comes with online capabilities and is part of our new world's Internet Of Things . Now, Mr. Evan Youngbone, is wondering if all this I.O.T. nonsense, keeping track of his every step via satellite, is all worth it, after facing a London court on 787 counts of assault on over 360 people in London's West End. 
""Like I told the Police Constables piled on top of me that night, it was all the robot-leg's fault. It wasn't me!"" pleaded the very sorry defendant from the witness box. ""The high-tech leg I received after my car accident was hacked, probably by the Russians , causing it to go completely bonkers; kicking people all over the place! For almost an hour, I couldn't control the damn thing. It dragged me through the streets. It's like it suddenly had a mind of it's own. And it wanted to kick people really, really badly!"" 
""I was kicked three times in the shin, very, very hard,"" cried the first badly-bruised witness, Iris Lillyham (87) of Bumholeshire, near where Mr. Youngbone's kicking rampage first started. ""I'll have to start using my cane again because of that man... and I hate my cane, it's very slippery when it's raining.. and I don't like the rain... because that's slippery too,"" added the lonely victim, who claimed that she didn't believe a word about this strange, futuristic leg being at fault; but, who also had absolutely no idea how to turn on the iphone her son had bought her for emergencies. ""He had a big grind on his face!"" claimed Mrs. Lillyham, regarding the attacker. ""I believe he was loving every second of it!"" 
Mr. Youngbone's appointed lawyer is arguing that it's clearly Corninghamshire Hospital's fault, and the doctor's who first attached his client's fake leg, claiming that they never bothered to change the default password of: 1111, which comes standard with each artificial leg, (which are also suspiciously made near the Crimea River in the former Ukraine.) ""This poor man was a sitting pigeon for the Russians,"" charged the lawyer to the courtroom, ""He never even stood a chance!"" 
Mr. Youngbone then got up and hopped back to his lawyer's side, not wanting anything to do with his new high-tech appendage. ""I'm getting fitted for a nice old-fashion wooden one, thank you very much,"" The defendant told reporters during a recess. He also plans on going thrift-store shopping for a new toaster and vacuum cleaner this weekend, too. That is, if he's not getting ass-raped in prison. 
""I'm afraid I wouldn't get on very well in there-"" said the worried kicker on the subject of jail, not thrift-stores. ""Look at me, I'm very easy to catch and pin down. If I drop the soap, I'm bloody knackered, aren't I, mate. But thrift-shopping I'm very handy at, if I don't say so myself. Quite a bargainer, I am. I bet they'll knock a few quid off an old hoover, for a man with a used wooden leg!"" Make Paul Blake's  ",0

A large part of Hillary’s campaign has been pandering … er … reaching out to the LGBT community insisting she is with them, and supports their love and most of all she supports their “right” to get married. 
Of course not quite 20 years ago, she felt very differently and is quoted as saying, “I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been. Between a man and a woman.” 
Oops. 
— Jordan (@JordanChariton) October 28, 2016 
Shockingly the New York Times did a piece on her epic flip-flop on gay marriage, which clearly freaked her team out. Best piece, “Can we point those who are writing this to the 2013 video,” basically trying to control what the writer would include. Of course they missed the part that the story is really the change in her policy, not that she’s had an epiphany about gay people. Trending   won't   
Democrats just figured out they needed this demographic, so they all magically change their minds. See Obama and his “evolution” on gay marriage – same deal. Obamas was categorically against gay marriage during his campaign then changed his mind. when Hillary changed her mind lol she's pandering. 
Actually that just means they are both pandering. You’re welcome. 
Makes you wonder, is Hillary privately against gay marriage? Dear LGBTQ, Did you know that Hillary is still 'privately' against Gay Marriage? #Wikileaks #PodestaEmails21 https://t.co/1XGlvpSJSO",0
3064,Preliminary Approval Given to $208.7 Million NCAA Settlement - Breitbart,"About 40, 000 college football and basketball players will not need to submit a claim to receive a portion of the $208. 7 million the NCAA will pay to settle a federal   lawsuit that claimed the value of their athletic scholarships was illegally capped. [U. S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in California gave preliminary approval Tuesday to the settlement that was agreed upon by the NCAA and plaintiffs in February. Hagens Berman, the law firm representing plaintiffs, says each eligible person will receive approximately $6, 500 and it can begin mailing notice to class members by July.  “We’re grateful to the court for preliminarily approving this monumental settlement that will bring real change to the way the NCAA treats Division I players, and grateful to the players themselves for stepping up to the plate,” lead attorney Steve Berman said in a statement. Final approval of the settlement from Wilken is scheduled for November. The original antitrust lawsuit was filed in 2014 by former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston. The case was later combined with other lawsuits and covers Division I men’s and women’s basketball players and FBS football players who competed from   and did not receive a    stipend. “We are pleased the court has provided preliminary approval in a portion of the    lawsuit,” Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer, said in a statement. “The judge’s decision allows us to begin steps toward providing class members funds up to, but not exceeding, their full cost of attendance. ” In January 2015, the five wealthiest college conferences  —   the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12,   and Southeastern Conference  —   passed NCAA legislation that allowed schools to increase the value of an athletic scholarship by several thousand dollars to the federally determined actual cost of attending a college or university. Cost of attendance includes expenses beyond tuition, room and board, books and fees. The settlement will be fully funded by NCAA reserves, the association has said. No school or conference will be required to contribute.",0
3065,"5 Secrets to Wu Wei, the Taoist Principle of Effortless Effort","5 Secrets to Wu Wei, the Taoist Principle of Effortless Effort Nov 18, 2016 6 0 
As we progress through the process of ascension, several stages occur. Among them is a shake-up which inspires an initial awakening, then the full realization of truth, followed by the development of discernment to ascertain a correct course of action. We wouldn’t try to ride a bicycle before building one, nor would we attempt to sail an ocean without a boat. When things get challenging in life, we can check to see if we are practicing Wu Wei in order to refine our actions. This is the art of effortless action as described in Taoist teachings. 1. No Action Doesn’t Mean ‘Nothing’ Happens 
“ The Tao does nothing and yet nothing is left undone .” – Lao Tzu 
Wu Wei or 無為, translates from Chinese pinyin to mean “no-action” or “actionless action.” This is considered the ‘natural’ way to do things, as opposed to striving, opposing, and forcing, as well as lollygagging, or succumbing to complete inertia. When we are in alignment with the Source, or as Taoists call it, simply, the Tao, then we don’t have to ‘work’ at anything. This is not to be confused with doing nothing. The state of Wu Wei doesn’t give us an excuse to sit on the sidelines, observing life and critiquing others’ actions. Instead, it describes the inspired action of a person who is brimming with life energy, and that has dedicated their actions to a purpose which supports Oneness. This person does not waste energy, though, and moves only when the time is right, and then, with magnificent acumen, and seemingly magical support behind them. 
The ancient ideograms and symbols used in the Chinese language and culture offer the most simplistic way to describe wu wei. We can observe this is the simple yin yang symbol. One side is active, or masculine, representing the energy of extending oneself into the world, and the other side of the symbol is passive, or more accurately, receiving, or feminine energy that causes an inward journey. 
All Chinese medicine, martial, and internal arts from Tai Chi to acupuncture to meditation aim to help balance the masculine and feminine energies, the doing and ‘not-doing’ you might say, as a way to achieve wu wei. 2. The Cosmos is Not Working Against You 
We aren’t sandwiched between heaven and earth, we ARE heaven and earth. To practice wu wei, we must first realize that we are connected to the Oneness of all things. Though we should have clear boundaries, like children given free rein to run and play within the confines of a beautiful park, we also should remain open to vulnerability and the lessons this may teach. Once we are open and protected we can begin to observe nature and embrace universal energy as it ebbs and flows. From there, we learn when to move with that energy – ebbing and flowing with our own actions in accordance with the Oneness of all things. An immense sense of freedom comes from knowing we don’t have to fight against the Cosmos, and understanding that it is never working against us – only we can choose to work against it’s flow. 3. Physical Action Isn’t the Only Action 
Another principle of wu wei involves quieting the ever-busy mind. Even if we aren’t ‘doing’ anything physically, often our minds are busier than ever. Wu wei means that we not only quiet the body and its actions, but that we aim to quiet the mind. Otherwise, we will have no idea if we are in Universal flow, or simply acting ‘busy’ out of the needs of the ‘ego,’ we so obsessively align ourselves with. 
Even with our meditation practice, we are encouraged not to ‘try too hard.’ Perhaps you’ve seen a mind game that has been installed at several museums around the U.S.. Two people sit across from one another, and attach headbands equipped with electrodes to themselves. Between the players are a group of balls that can only be moved with the brain’s waves, measured as electromagnetic currents through the headband. If a player maintains a state of relaxed calm, essentially a combination of alpha and theta waves produced by the brain when it’s relaxed, then a ball moves up a tube and is placed in a bin. The player with the most ‘balls,’ wins after a certain period of time commences. Those who try too hard, fail, as do those who don’t try hard enough. The combination of alpha and theta waves created by a wu wei mind is what wins the game every time. 
Lao Tzu advises that we must be quiet and watchful, learning to listen to both our own inner voices and to the voices of our environment in a non-interfering, receptive manner. This requires a calm, but astute mind. 4. Being at One with the Tao Means Accepting Change 
A key principal in Taoism, and the practice of wu wei involves the realization that there is an unceasing flow of change in nature. This change is governed by laws which are unalterable, and rarely perceived except by the most consciously evolved individuals. Fighting these laws of change would be a sisyphean task. Would you try to to stop the changing of the season or the rise and fall of the sun to the horizon? Once you observe this flow of change in nature, you can apply principles of wu wei to your own transformation. Since you are a part and parcel of nature, you will change accordingly. Why not move with that change instead of fight against it – perhaps you can even welcome change the next time it arrives at your doorstep. 5. True Wu Wei Involves Purposeless Wandering 
Zhuangzi refers to a type of being in the world that many of us have never considered. He calls it flowing, or more poetically “ purposeless wandering .” Most of our cultural values frown upon this type of being. If we have ‘no purpose’ we are often deemed pathological in the context of modern day living. Yet, it would be difficult to maintain that our current values have promoted harmony and balance, either environmentally or for each individual. 
In Zhuangzi’s Basic Writings , he states , “you can use the analogy of an artist or craftsman. The skilled woodcarver, the skilled swimmer. . . does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously, without knowing why, and achieves success.” He further describes an enlightened person as being one who wanders through creation enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it.

3066,Media: IAAF demanded bribes from Russian athletes for doping cover-up - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
MOSCOW, November 25. /TASS/. At least six Russian athletes are suspected of bribing officials of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for concealing positive doping samples, the German TV Channel ARD reported on Friday, citing investigation materials of the Paris Prosecutor’s Office. 
The Paris Prosecutor’s Office has opened a probe into the suspicions of financial fraud at the world’s athletics governing body in 2014. According to the data received by ARD from the probe’s materials, IAAF representatives demanded from 300,000 euros to 700,000 euros from six Russian athletes for not disclosing the data on their positive doping samples. 
The ARD footage also notes that former head of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (ARAF) Valentin Balakhnichev was an intermediary in the corruption schemes of former IAAF President Lamine Diack: about 1.5 million euros passed hands through the ARAF ex-chief. 
Diack has denied his complicity in the doping cover-up scandal, saying he would have never demanded any money from athletes. Nonetheless, as the TV channel says, the six Russians are not the sole athletes who are forced to give bribes. About 23 athletes are mentioned in the probe, ARD said. 
According to the TV Channel, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) may also be involved in the doping cover-up scandal. WADA Chief Craig Reedie earlier asserted he had never heard about any cases of extortion inside the IAAF. However, in the autumn of 2014, the WADA sent a letter to the IAAF Ethics Commission with information on suspected doping samples of Russian athletes, and also about its suspicions of the athletes’ possible blackmailing by the IAAF. Despite this, the world’s anti-doping body took no efforts to open a probe into this information.

3067,Obama's UN Ambassador: Cuba is Right About Our Human Rights,"Obama's UN Ambassador: Cuba is Right About Our Human Rights October 29, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
You may remember Ambassador Samantha Power from the time she proposed invading Israel. Since then she's gone on to a glorious career of representing the Castro regime at the UN. Or is it the Obama regime. It naturally gets confusing when the US Ambassador to the UN sides with the enemy against her own country. 
""For more than 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at isolating the government of Cuba. For roughly half of those years, UN Member States have voted overwhelmingly for a General Assembly resolution that condemns the U.S. embargo and calls for it to be ended. The United States has always voted against this resolution. Today the United States will abstain. [Applause.] Thank you."" 
Under Obama, Power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the United States. And they say Obama is some sort of anti-American traitor. I don't see it. If he were, we would be seeing signs of it by now. 
Anyway, Power then went on to audition for the job of the UN ambassador from Cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal Communist dictatorship about our human rights are well-founded... 
""Let me be among the first to acknowledge – as our Cuban counterparts often point out – that the United States has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens. And we know that at times in our history, U.S. leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust."" 
Somehow though siding with Communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust. Only opposing the left does.",0
3069,Italy Prepares for Possible Mediterranean Refugee Crisis This Summer,"This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,  Migrants packed into an overcrowded dinghy by human traffickers (EPA) The European Union is working on an emergency plan in case a “serious crisis” develops this summer, which would be the situation is 200, 000 or more refugees cross the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy. In 2016, a record 181, 000 migrants crossed from North Africa to Italy via the Mediterranean Sea. From January 1 to April 23 of this year, 36, 851 migrants were recorded as crossing  —   a   increase over the same period last year. Even more concerning is the fact that summer has not even arrived, and when it does, a huge surge of migrants is expected. The concerns are that total for the year may be close to 300, 000. According to the Dublin Agreement that defines the principles of the European Union, member states are expected to show “solidarity” in managing the refugee problem, so that the entire burden does not fall on Italy. However, there is little agreement on what the term “solidarity” means. The current requirements are that refugees should be distributed to all 28 member states. The target last year for relocation was 160, 000 asylum seekers, but because several member states object to having any asylum seekers at all relocated to their countries, only about 15, 000 people have been distributed so far in the last two years. One proposed solution is that cash will be used to encourage countries to meet their quotas. The proposal is that each country will be paid €60, 000 for every asylum seeker they take in above their assigned quota, and those not meeting their quotas would be charged the same amount. On Thursday, the European Commission issued a press release proposing “a sustainable and fair Common European Asylum System. ” According to Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs: If the current refugee crisis has shown one thing, it is that the status quo of our Common European Asylum System is not an option. The time has come for a reformed and more equitable system, based on common rules and a fairer sharing of responsibility. With the proposed reform of the Dublin system, [and the creation of a] true European Agency for Asylum, today we are taking a major step in the right direction and putting in place the   structures and tools necessary for a   comprehensive system. We will now put all our efforts into working    with the European Parliament and Member States. We must turn these proposals into reality as swiftly as possible. If the history of the past two years shows anything, it’s that no current proposal has any chance of working. If move than 200, 000 migrants from Libya reach the shores of Italy this year, it truly will be a crisis. Der Spiegel and EU Observer ( ) and European Commission and Malta Today, Decades ago, when America was first building a national highway system, people talked about “the freeway effect. ” If some particular auto route was always jammed with heavy traffic, then a limited access superhighway (also called a “freeway”) would be built to replace it. However, with the availability of the new freeway, a lot more people would start driving, and so pretty soon the traffic would be just as bad as ever. That was “the freeway effect. ” The same kind of thing is happening in the Mediterranean. After some   drowning of hundreds of migrants in capsized boats, the European Union has made enormous efforts rescue migrants who might otherwise drown. Furthermore, the EU’s Frontex organization has been joined by dozens of NGOs (  organizations) that are also rescuing migrants crossing the Mediterranean. As greater efforts have been made, more migrants have been encouraged to risk making the trip, contributing to the worsening of the migrant crisis, and creating a “taxi service to Europe. ” A scandal is brewing over the NGOs. Carmelo Zuccaro, an Italian prosecutor is claiming to have evidence that some of the NGOs are colluding with the human traffickers who send the migrants out on flimsy boats to be rescued, with the suggestion that some of the NGOs are encouraging the increase in migrant traffic in order to receive more funding. The human traffickers have become increasingly unscrupulous in taking advantage of the massive rescue efforts. For example, they have been packing up to 170 people onto inflatable rubber dinghies that can only safely transport 15 people. The engines have only enough fuel to make it out of Libyan waters, and the smugglers have been relying on the rescue efforts by Frontex and the NGOs to save the migrants from drowning. However, over 1, 000 migrants have already lost their lives this year alone in the Mediterranean. Some EU officials are blaming China for the problem. In a  story about migrants early last year, I reported that human traffickers were importing massive numbers of rubber dinghies manufactured in China, transshipped through Malta. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, whom we quoted earlier, is visiting China this week, and made this statement: The rubber boats used by the smuggler networks in the Mediterranean are fabricated somewhere in China, they are exported to the countries in Asia and they are used by them. So I requested the support and cooperation from the Chinese authorities in order to track down this business and dismantle it, because what they produce is not serving the common good of the country. It is a very dangerous tool in the hands of ruthless smugglers. There is no word on whether the Chinese government is going to help out Europe by shutting down its rubber dinghy business.

3070,America’s Likely Response to North Korean Test: Missile Defense Systems,"This morning’s key headlines from GenerationalDynamics. com,  South Korean TV coverage on Sunday of North Korean missile test (AFP) The United Nations Security Council met in emergency session on Monday, and issued a statement strongly condemning North Korea’s ballistic missile launches. The missile was launched on Sunday from North Korea’s Banghyon air base in the western North Pyongang Province. It reached an apogee of 344 miles and traveled out to about 313 miles before splashing into the Sea of Japan. Analysts say that the missile test is significant because the new missiles use solid fuel, and because it can be launched from vehicles traveling over rough terrain, both of which make them harder to detect than    missiles. The missile test shows that it could reach targets in South Korea, China, and Japan, and that North Korea is getting close to developing a nuclear missile that could reach the United States. The UN Security Council statement said: The members of the Security Council deplore all the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea ballistic missile activities, including these launches  …     [We call] upon all member states to redouble their efforts to implement fully the measures imposed on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea by the Security Council. Some Security Council members have called for imposing additional economic sanctions on North Korea, but are few choices left beyond those that have already been imposed. Furthermore, it’s pretty clear that North Korea will continue developing nuclear and missile technology irrespective of any imposed sanctions. Reuters and Defense News and Deutsche Welle, Related Articles, On Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had to answer questions about North Korea’s ballistic missile test. The exchanges became fairly testy, illustrating how anxious China is about the situation, and about how complicated it is making China’s foreign policy. Here are some excerpts showing the testy exchanges (the DPRK is North Korea, and the ROK is South Korea): Q: The DPRK allegedly tested a new type of   missile yesterday  …     A: We have noted relevant reports and are closely following the developments. The Security Council resolutions contain clear provisions on launches using ballistic missile technology by the DPRK. China is opposed to the DPRK’s launch which violates the Security Council resolutions. Given the current circumstances, relevant parties should not engage in mutually provocative moves which could heighten regional tensions. All parties need to exercise restraint in a joint effort to maintain regional peace and stability.   …     Q: There is sort of a saying that China has leverage over the DPRK. Has the US communicated with China over the missile test and asked China to do more? Analysts speculate that the missile test is an opportunity for China to tie up its greater cooperation on the Korean nuclear issue with US cooperation in keeping peace and stability of the South China Sea. Is that a valid speculation? A: The root of the DPRK nuclear and missile issue lies in the differences between the DPRK and the US and between the DPRK and the ROK. As a permanent member of the Security Council and a responsible member of the international community, China has always enforced the Council’s resolutions in their entirety, promoted peace talks, and made unremitting efforts to facilitate the settlement of the issue of Korean Peninsula. China’s efforts have been widely acknowledged and acclaimed by the international community  …     Q: You just mentioned that the root of the DPRK nuclear and missile issue lies in the differences between the DPRK and the US and between the DPRK and the ROK. Could you be more specific as to how the differences between the DPRK and the ROK lead to the nuclear and missile issue? A: What I said just now was that the root of the DPRK nuclear and missile issue lies in the differences between the DPRK and the US and between the DPRK and the ROK. This is not the first time for us to say so. This is a viewpoint that has been repeatedly emphasized. Q: Does China believe that Washington should take the initiative on tackling the issue of missile test by the DPRK? A: The root of the DPRK nuclear and missile issue lies in the differences between the DPRK and the US and between the DPRK and the ROK  …     Q: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that China, who has complete control of what sustains the government of the DPRK, should play a bigger role. Do you agree with him? A: I have actually given the answer when addressing other journalists’ questions. The root of the DPRK nuclear and missile issue is the differences between the DPRK and the US and between the DPRK and the ROK. Given that, we hope that relevant parties make more efforts to resolve the DPRK nuclear and missile issue. As you can see, an exasperated Geng Shuang answered several questions the same way, essentially blaming the United States and South Korea. I’ll bet he was happy when that press conference was over. AP and China Foreign Ministry, Last year, the U. S. and South Korea announced the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea. It is considered to be the most advanced   system available anywhere today because it can blast incoming missiles out of the sky with 100% success rate. The stated purpose of the deployment would be to protect South Korea from a North Korean ballistic missile attack. China has expressed enormous fury over the installation of THAAD in South Korea. When the announcement was made last year, Chinese media have attacked South Korea with inflammatory rhetoric and recommended harsh economic sanctions against South Korea. China has even been calling for   demonstrations in South Korea. The reason that China has been freaking out over THAAD is that it also protects South Korea from a ballistic missile attack launched by China. Furthermore, THAAD’s advanced detection systems would provide early warning of a Chinese missile attack on the United States. Sunday’s ballistic missile test by North Korea severely complicates China’s foreign policy with regard to this issue, because it makes a THAAD system in South Korea even more necessary. According to Chinese media: Establishing THAAD on the Korean Peninsula has always been part of Washington’s plan to expand and enhance its   network in the region. Aside from   cooperation with allies such as Japan and Australia, the US has also deployed the THAAD system in Hawaii and Guam, destroyers with missile interceptors in the Sea of Japan, and Patriot Advanced   interceptors on the Japanese soil  …     However, inviting the ROK to join the game being played by the US and Japan does not just respond to the DPRK’s nuclear threats but also places more countries including China under US military surveillance. Keeping Japan and the ROK committed to its Asian policy would be another boon to the US.   …     However, the two allies are yet to offer any solid evidence to reassure Beijing that the   battery does not target any third party. Nor have they taken any action such as removing radars that might be used to spy on China to prove their point. China will not sit idle while Washington and Seoul press ahead with THAAD in the name of handling the “DPRK threat”. Another system is the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system. It is a centralized, automated,    (C2) and weapons control system that was designed as a total weapon system, from detection to kill. The   radar is able to perform search, track, and missile guidance functions simultaneously, with a track capacity of more than 100 targets. There are currently 84 U. S. Navy ships in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed: 22 Cruisers and 62 Destroyers. There are an additional three new construction Destroyers with the AEGIS Weapon System installed that will enter service in FY 2018. The North Korean missile test is going to substantially increase demand for additional THAAD and Aegis system, and pose additional problems for China’s planned missile attack on the US and its allies.

3071,"The EU’s Nemtsov Forum Is a Phoney, Politicially Correct Waste of Time - Peter S. Rieth","Politics The EU’s Nemtsov Forum Is a Phoney, Politicially Correct Waste of Time 
If the European Union desires to be a truly relevent center of international order, it should not waste the resources and time of diplomats and officials on dialogues with Russian émigrés who have nothing to do with the Russian government Originally appeared at East West Accord 
The European Union parliament often prides itself on being a model for international intergration on a global scale. Yet, the upcomong Boris Nemstov forum, billed as exemplifying EU-Russian dialogue, does not live up to the European parliament’s lofty reputation. Rather than EU-Russia dialogue, the forum is an example of Europeans talking to themselves and failing to engage in real politics. 
The forum, which will be held late November of this year, appears to be less of a dialogue between the EU and Russia and more of a dialogue between the EU, itself and a who’s who of Russians who have no political power in Moscow and no popular electoral mandate from the Russian people. A true EU-Russia dialogue would involve symetry. The Boris Nemstov forum is akin to an academic debate on quantum physics between the faculty of MIT and the 5th grade science class at Peabody school in Cambridge Massachusetts. If this is what passes for EU-Russia dialogue these days, then the European Union is in deep crisis. 
Over the course of the inception of the European Union, when the governments representing the various nations and peoples of Europe engaged in often difficult negotiations to achieve real compromise over economic, historical and political differences in pursuit of peace and progress, the EU was a serious political forum for international dialogue. Those times, and the serious statesmen who populated them, are long past. Public relations has taken the place of diplomacy and the easiest road is often labeled with the most hyperbolic, arrogant slogans. Thus the upcoming forum is billed as: 
“A platform for an improved EU-Russia dialogue to repair the important strategic relationship between Russia and the European Union by involving a pro-European generation of future Russian leaders whose commitment and vision will make this possible.” 
The European Union is a political-legal entity, as are the EU ambassadors lent their support to the forum. The platform is billed as EU-Russia dialogue. Yet where are the representatives of the Russian Federation, the political-legal entity which represents the Russian people and even has a seat in the UN security council? Will the Russian ambassador take part in the EU-Russia dialogue? Will Russian deputies to the Duma who actually represent the Russian people take part in the EU-Russia dialogue during the forum? 
At present, initiating a serious dialogue between the EU and Russia is abysmaly difficult because the European Union has committed itself to economic sanctions against Russia which include a ban on travel to the EU for large portions of the Russian government and business elite. Of course, the European Union parliament apparently thinks it can get around this problem by meeting with a “pro-European generation of future Russian leaders.” 
One wonders just how the EU knows these particular individuals (whose website boldly proclaims that the interests of the elected President of Russia are not those of the Russian people) themselves represent Russia’s true interest and will – in future – be swept to power? Precedent for such thinking on the part of Western Europeans exists: in 1918 one of the “pro-European generation of future Russian leaders,” Lenin, was swiftly sent to Moscow by the faltering German Empire to replace the Tsar, who’s interest- Lenin and his Western European allies felt- were not the interests of the Russian people. The result was a bloody Russian civil war which made the XXth century into the most deadly in all human history. 
History, like real politics, are not currently popular amongst Brussels elites. Events like the Borys Nemstov forum are exercises in political naivety. They are not serious dialogue. Serious European-Russian dialogue can be found in Berlin, Paris and Minsk. It is there that the German Chancellor and the French President routinely hold talks with the President of Russia. These talks are not easy. These talks are not self-flattering festivals of wishful thinking. These talks are real politics: hard negotiations about life and death issues at the heart of the future of Europe. 
If the European Union desires to be a truly relevent center of international order, it should not waste the resources and time of diplomats and officials on dialogues with Russian émigrés who have nothing to do with the Russian government. The EU should organize real international conferences where ambasadors meet ambasadors and members of parliament meet members of the Duma. A civic forum bringing together common people of different political persuasions is likewise commendable. A forum of government officials meeting with the enemies of another country’s government officials is hardly a model of good diplomacy. 
In principle there is of course nothing inappropriate about hosting different groups of different political persuasions from Russia, but in this time of declining international order and the looming prospect of a new Cold War it is highly ill advized to pretend that a meeting between officials from a supposedly serious international body such as the EU and a group of ragtag émigré Russian revolutionaries is representative of “EU-Russian dialogue.” If anything, the upcoming Boris Nemstov forum in Brussels is symbolic of the political impotence of European institutions and the terrible crisis of EU-Russia relations.

3072,Hedge Fund Calls New York Times Article a ‘Distortion’ - The New York Times,"Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, released a statement on Thursday taking issue with what it called “significant mischaracterizations” and a “distortion” of some of its business practices and culture that were described in an article in The New York Times. Ray Dalio, the founder and chairman of Bridgewater, said in a statement that the article “intentionally strung together a series of misleading ‘facts’” in order to “create the most sensationalistic story. ” The Times article reported on the culture at Bridgewater as detailed in a sexual harassment complaint and a National Labor Relations Board filing, as well as in interviews with seven former employees or people who have done work for the firm. The article described how the firm’s policy of recording meetings and surveillance had a chilling effect on employees bringing grievances or complaints, according to those people. In the complaint, filed in January with a Connecticut state agency, the employee, Christopher Tarui, outlined the impact that the policy of recording all meetings had on his coming forward. Mr. Tarui said he delayed reporting a series of instances of sexual harassment by his male supervisor out of fear the matter would not be handled privately within the firm, which is based in Westport, Conn. In his complaint, Mr. Tarui said he had no option to air his grievances privately and that his meetings with senior executives over the matter were “widely shared” with other managerial employees. He called Bridgewater a “cauldron of fear and intimidation. ” In Bridgewater’s statement, Mr. Dalio countered that claim, saying that it was “exactly the opposite” and that employees were “encouraged to bring problems to the surface in whatever ways they deem to be most appropriate. ” Mr. Dalio said in the statement that the firm recorded meetings with employees to allow them to “hear virtually all discussions” and to foster a “real idea of meritocracy. ” He added: “We also believe that bad things happen behind closed doors so that such transparency is healthy. ” Bridgewater, which has nearly 1, 500 employees, said that it had “clearly defined channels for reporting private matters that have been utilized by many employees over the years. ” Specifically, Mr. Dalio said, the firm had an “anonymous ‘complaint line. ’” On Tuesday, Bridgewater was asked by Times reporters to respond to questions about the complaint, the National Labor Relations Board filing and details about the firm’s culture and practices, including questions about the use of cellphones. In response, Bridgewater sent an emailed statement to The Times for publication, saying: “While it is difficult for our management team to independently judge the merits of this claim, we are confident our handling of this claim is consistent with our stated principles and the law. We look forward to operating through a legal process that brings the truth to light. ” The complaint filed with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities was withdrawn in March at the request of both Mr. Tarui and Bridgewater. The firm has a policy that requires employees to go through a binding arbitration process. The National Labor Relations Board has filed a separate complaint against Bridgewater, saying that the company “has been interfering with, restraining and coercing” Mr. Tarui and other employees from exercising their rights through confidentiality agreements that all employees are required to sign. The Times article noted that in some Bridgewater units, “employees are required to lock up their personal cellphones each morning when they arrive at work. ” Mr. Dalio said that was “wrong,” while also acknowledging that employees cannot carry phones on the firm’s trading floor, “where cellphones are prohibited. ” The statement also took issue with the article’s description of the hedge fund’s mixed performance that lost billions of dollars for investors in the last two years. Of Bridgewater’s two main portfolios, the Pure Alpha fund has lost 8. 8 percent, while its All Weather fund has gained 10. 4 percent through June. But last year, those performances were reversed: The All Weather fund lost investors 6. 9 percent, while Pure Alpha gained 4. 7 percent. In the statement on Thursday, Bridgewater cited 2015 performance figures from the Pure Alpha fund as evidence that investors had not lost billions of dollars. “This year,    we have made $1. 3 billion for our clients across our strategies,” Mr. Dalio’s statement said. Bridgewater manages $154 billion for pension funds and other institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds. The statement said Bridgewater could not comment on Mr. Tarui’s claims or the complaint, adding that it was going through a legal process. But it said, “like many organizations, we encounter frivolous claims made in an effort to extract financial gain. ” Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for Mr. Tarui, said, “Consistent with our firm’s reputation, we thoroughly investigate and carefully vet each of our clients before taking on a new matter and aggressively prosecute those cases so as to vindicate the rights of our clients. ” Mr. Dalio concluded by saying that Bridgewater looked forward to “being judged by our employees, our clients, and the legal and regulatory parties who are responsible for overseeing our behaviors, rather than by the media. ”",0
3073,Buffalo Meat Industry Facing Government Shutdowns in India - The New York Times,"NARAHARA, India  —   In recent years, as demand for cheap protein raged in China and the Persian Gulf countries, India quietly became the world’s largest exporter of meat  —   chiefly   water buffalo, which approached $5 billion in exports in 2015. Slaughterhouses proliferated in the west of Uttar Pradesh, and the surrounding villages underwent an economic transformation. Children raised on plain roti began to eat lentils twice a day. But that spurt of prosperity came under threat this week, when a new   government in the state, led by the fiery cleric Yogi Adityanath, began shutting down parts of the   buffalo meat industry. Hindu activists say the industry conceals the illegal slaughter of cows, which are sacred to Hindus. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governing party has long balanced its commitment to   development against its embrace of   Hindu causes, it has rarely made such a stark choice between them. The state’s new leaders promise more meat factories will be shut in the coming days, and they say the blow to the economy is less important than the principle of protecting the cow. “The government should do it on moral grounds,” said Karunesh Nandan Garg, 57, president of the Meerut division of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party. He cited the example of prostitution in Thailand, which is largely tolerated by the authorities and “a major revenue producer” there. “But is that right? Money isn’t everything. ” Uttar Pradesh is India’s largest   state, with 41 of the country’s 75 licensed slaughterhouses and meat processing plants, according to the Commerce Ministry. Scores more operate without licenses, and an exhaustive list of laws govern the slaughter, transport and sale of meat, so the government can easily find a pretext to shut even licensed businesses. On Hapur Road, which is lined with slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants, economic activity had ground to a halt within days of Mr. Adityanath’s  . District officials sealed seven factories in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, citing irregularities in paperwork. The police were ordered to patrol the plants and search vehicles for cows, so frightening suppliers that they stopped delivering buffaloes. Workers, told to go home for the day, had instead gathered in tea stalls, nervously trading reports. “We are waiting to see what the government decides,” said Muhammad Akhtar, a migrant from Bihar who has worked in the meat factories for 20 years, earning around 10, 000 rupees, about $150, in a good month. “Modi has said he wants economic development for everyone,” Mr. Akhtar said. “This job has allowed my children to eat and go to school. All we want is peace, to be allowed to work in peace. ” Life in this strip of villages had changed drastically with the advent of the meat factories a decade ago, people here said. Mud huts, which routinely collapsed during the monsoon, had been replaced by solid brick buildings. Men working in the factories had begun to invest in motor scooters. Women had been pulled into the work force, abruptly doubling family incomes. Mr. Akhtar said he could afford to remain in Uttar Pradesh for two weeks without pay, and then he would have no choice but to return to his native village, along with thousands of other migrant workers who gravitated here for jobs. Other men clustered around him  —   peddlers, truck dispatchers, factory supervisors, cleaners, butchers. Some of them warned that further pressure on the industry would lead to violence. “Suppose that there are five people in a single family working here, and they are all jobless,” said Muhammad Majid, 21, who has been working at a slaughterhouse since he was 15. “If there are riots, they will be difficult to contain. ” Most Indians were not aware that buffalo meat overtook rice as the country’s largest food export in 2015. The industry’s growth has gone unnoticed mainly because of religious sensitivities: Meatpacking, like leather, is a sector dominated by Muslims, who make up around 19 percent of this state’s population. Though it is legal to slaughter buffalo when they are old and can no longer give milk,   Hindu groups have long suggested that cows were being spirited into the facilities, and they have routinely intercepted supply vehicles for aggressive searches. In January, in its manifesto ahead of Uttar Pradesh’s state elections, the B. J. P. promised to take a step further: to shut down “all illegal slaughterhouses” and restrict mechanized ones. It was not clear this week whether that campaign would extend to the largest meatpacking businesses, which are licensed by the government and bring in vast amounts of revenue. Some people in the Muslim neighborhoods dependent on meat processing said they doubted that it would. “Look at the numbers,” said Nadeem Chauhan, a politician with the    Bahujan Samaj Party. “Why do you think the central government and the prime minister have not already shut down this business? It’s the biggest cash generator for the government. It brings in foreign currency. ” That optimism was not apparent on Hapur Road, where the face of the   campaign was Sanjay Chaturvedi, a district veterinary officer. Mr. Chaturvedi was making rounds of the area’s factories wearing a red tilak, the smudge of vermilion applied after Hindu prayers, and a Los Angeles Lakers cap. He said he had often tried to take action against slaughterhouses on environmental grounds but had never been free to do so because they had protectors in the previous,   government. “As soon as I would approach a factory, I would get a call from some politician,” he said. “People in government had their hands in the business. ” That had changed almost as soon as the new chief minister was sworn in. His new orders were to be on “high alert,” and Mr. Chaturvedi happily complied, cruising around surrounding factories with his new police escort. At midday, Mr. Chaturvedi passed a chicken feed factory called Universal India and caught a whiff from its   vats that he described as “very, very foul. ” “The smell seemed to indicate that there were cow parts there, inside the factory,” he said. “You know it from the smell. ” He proceeded to the gate and informed the factory’s owner, Aas Muhammad, that his vehicles would be searched for illicit cow parts. Mr. Muhammad protested that his plant, which employs 150 people, does not slaughter animals at all, but instead uses byproducts discarded by   slaughterhouses. When that proved unpersuasive, he charged out onto the roadway after Mr. Chaturvedi, his hands shaking with rage and anxiety. He shouted to a waiting camera crew that the inspector had for years solicited bribes, most recently of 200, 000 rupees. Mr. Chaturvedi brushed the accusation aside, saying, “Oh, that is nothing, that is nothing. ” “You go and prove that this smell is coming from our factory,” said the owner’s brother, Wasim Qureshi. “You will see, you will see!” Mr. Chaturvedi shouted as he drove away. His day was close to its end, and he was in a good mood. Of the 10 working meat factories on this road, he said, four would be shuttered by the summer. A detachment of police officers and state officials pulled up to Universal India on Wednesday morning and sealed the premises, by orders of the state government. Mr. Muhammad sent his workers home, asking them to be patient before seeking other jobs. “They will wait for the next week, maybe 10 days,” he said. “Then, some of them will end up pulling rickshaws. ”",0
3074,Melania Trump Praises U.S. Troops and Their Families: ’Your Sacrifices Do Not Go Unnoticed’ - Breitbart,"Melania Trump ended her first trip abroad as First Lady with a bang speaking to troops at a Naval base in Italy before heading back to the United States on Saturday. [‘It has been a great trip and many strides have been made,’ Trump said in the speech.  ‘My husband worked very hard on behalf of our country and I’m very proud of him,” Trump said. “This trip has also been incredible for me as First Lady,” Trump said, adding that she would never forget the women and children she met during visits to children’s hospitals in Italy and Belgium. “Melania Trump has proudly signed off from her first foreign trip as First Lady before walking to Air Force One    with the president,” the Daily Mail reported on Saturday. “The first lady, dressed in a black   Dolce  Gabbana dress with   said she would never forget the women and children she met during her nine days on the road in Europe and the Middle East. ” Despite the media’s efforts to paint a strained or even   relationship between President Donald Trump and his wife, the couple’s affection for one another was noted in the Mail article. “The first lady held her husband’s hand as they made their way to Air Force One in Italy on Saturday after addressing US military personnel at a naval base,” the Mail reported. During her speech, the First Lady thanked the service members for sacrificing on behalf of the U. S. ‘I also want to take a moment to thank you all for the sacrifices you make on behalf of our country,’ she said. Trump said because of their “selfless commitment” and the sacrifices their families make that Americans are able to enjoy freedom. ‘To the families who endure time apart or constant time apart, your sacrifices do not go unnoticed,” Trump said. The Mail noted that when Trump took the microphone he called his first trip abroad a “home run. ” Trump vowed to defeat terrorism and said recent terrorist attacks in Manchester, England and Egypt underscored the need for the U. S. to “defeat terrorism and protect civilization. ” “Terrorism is a threat, bad threat to all of humanity,” Trump said. “And together we will overcome this threat. “We will win,” Trump said. It appears Melania is already winning. “It signed off on a nine day trip abroad, during which Melania won the hearts of many across the Middle East and Europe,” the Mail reported.",0
3075,Proposed Football League Envisions a No-College Path to the Pros - The New York Times,"The sports landscape is littered with failed professional football leagues, such is the dominance of the N. F. L. Yet the sports agent Don Yee, who represents New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, thinks he may have found a model that will work: a league for   to    players who skip college to play professionally right away. Most fledgling leagues, like the defunct U. F. L. or the X. F. L. had rosters filled with castoffs who had gone undrafted out of college or who had bounced around pro teams. The quality of play was uneven, while games often overlapped with the N. F. L. and N. C. A. A. calendars, making it hard to gain attention. Yee and his investment group see their new Pacific Pro Football league, which is expected to start in summer 2018, as more of a development league filled with players who want to immediately start playing a   game while getting a paycheck, rather than risking injury on a college team and receiving no compensation. “Most other leagues usually took players who were deemed not good enough for the N. F. L. ,” Yee said. “We’re now trying to go to the head of the line at the buffet instead of getting the   ones. ” Despite the long odds of success, Yee is not the only person trying to get a football league off the ground. In April, a new spring league will roll out in West Virginia, where players “who may have been overlooked by the N. F. L. C. F. L. and other professional leagues” can pay $350 to showcase their talents in a   season, the league’s website says. The N. F. L. also has toyed with starting a developmental league. In October, Commissioner Roger Goodell said the team owners had discussed the idea of working with 300 to 400 players to make them “ready to play as quickly as possible,” though nothing concrete emerged from the discussions. Other leagues already employ teenagers who skip college. Major League Baseball clubs draft young players and send them to their academies or minor league affiliates. Many N. H. L. teams have players as young as 18 on their rosters. Players can join N. B. A. teams if they are 19 and a year removed from high school. (In 2001, the N. B. A. started its own development league, where the players can be 18.) N. F. L. teams can draft only players who are three years removed from their high school class’s graduation, a rule the league said is intended to protect younger, less physically developed players. “The physical, mental and emotional demands of our sport would make it almost impossible for someone to have success in the N. F. L. at an earlier age,” said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman. Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, or Tides, said that the N. F. L. had an incentive not to undercut college football, which he said was a “great feeder system. ” Even with an alternate league, college football, where players get scholarships but are not paid, would remain a strong draw for high school players because of the potential exposure, he said. He added that requiring athletes to spend more time in college makes it more likely that they will be prepared for life in the N. F. L. and after they retire from the game. “I don’t know how broad the interest in academic development is by the pro leagues, but someone who has a broader range of interests has a more balanced life and has the potential to be a better athlete,” he said. Yee acknowledged that his venture was risky, something his advisers have echoed. Fans already have a lot of options for watching college and professional football, and just paying for the necessary training facilities and transportation could be enough to bankrupt a new league. “I’ve danced with at least three of these groups before, but money was always what killed them,” said Jim Steeg, who is an unpaid adviser to Yee and ran the Super Bowl for the N. F. L. for decades. Steeg estimated that between $5 million and $7 million would be needed to cover the costs of each team for one season, along with a comparable sum to run the league office. Still, Steeg was encouraged that Yee was starting small and aiming for a unique pool of players, and that he had already received funding from an “angel” investor. Yee said he hoped to attract enough money in the next phase of   to cover the cost of a first season. The league would have four teams based in Southern California, both to reduce expenses and because the region has so many young players. The league would have a   schedule plus playoffs, and finish before the college season begins. Players would be paid an average of $50, 000 in salary and benefits, including workers’ compensation, a 401( k) plan and free community college tuition. Yee wants to partner with companies in the area to create internships for the players to prepare them for when their football days are over. In addition to Steeg, Yee said he was being advised by, among others, the former N. F. L. coach Mike Shanahan Mike Pereira, who was in charge of officiating for the N. F. L. and the ESPN analyst Adam Schefter. Ed McCaffrey, a former Denver Broncos wide receiver, is a  . Having enough money to get a league off the ground is one challenge. Finding a way to publicize it is another. With television already cluttered with dozens of games each week, the chances of a new league finding space on a widely distributed cable network are remote. Yee said that internet giants like Amazon and Netflix were looking for sports content to distribute. It is far from clear, however, whether one of those companies will pay Yee’s league to show games.",0

On August 24, the Turkish army launched Operation Euphrates Shield against the ""Islamic State terrorist group (banned in Russia). With the participation of the Syrian opposition, the military took control of the border town of Jarabulus in northern Syria and continued the offensive to the south-west. According to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, the goal of the offensive is to exterminate terrorists on the territory of up to 5,000 square kilometres and create a safety zone to accommodate refugees. In northern Syria, Turkish troops regularly come into clashes with the forces of the Kurdish militia, which they consider to be related to the Kurdistan Workers' Party. However, the official Damascus shares a different opinion on the subject. The Syrian authorities estimate the presence of the Turkish army on the territory of Syria as a violation of the sovereignty of the country, which could escalate the conflict.

3078,Hunt Continues for 2 Men Who Found Suitcase Containing Bomb in Chelsea - The New York Times,"Still no sign of them. Two days after the release of an image that investigators said showed two men who had come upon a suitcase containing an unexploded bomb on a Manhattan street, the authorities said on Friday that their identities and whereabouts remained unknown. Investigators said they considered the men to be witnesses, and wanted to talk to them as part of their effort to piece together the events of last Saturday, when bombs exploded in Seaside Park, N. J. and on West 23rd Street in Manhattan. Several unexploded bombs were found elsewhere, including the one in the suitcase, which was found on West 27th Street a few hours after the bomb went off four blocks away, and five others, which turned up late on Sunday near a train station in Elizabeth, N. J. After coming upon the abandoned suitcase on 27th Street, the men discovered a plastic bag inside containing a pressure cooker that had been fashioned into a bomb. They set the bag on the sidewalk and left with the suitcase. The suspect in the bombings, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was arrested just hours after authorities released a photograph of him on Monday morning. By Tuesday night, federal prosecutors had charged him with several crimes connected to the bombings. The New York Police Department has thus far been unable to identify or find the two men. “We know nothing about them at this point,” a spokesman for the department said. The two have not been charged with any crimes, and the authorities said this week that their handling of the device might actually have disabled it. One possibility among many that investigators have discussed is that the men were tourists and may have already left the country. What remains are the images of the two, crystallized in time. In the photo distributed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, they can be seen walking along 27th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue between 8 and 9 p. m. on Saturday, around the time of the 23rd Street explosion. One of the men is wearing a   polo shirt the other appears to be holding an object in one hand. Their postures suggest a shared sense of calm.",0

3080,Rand Paul: ’Lots of Crocodile Tears in DC’ for Comey,"Sen. Rand Paul ( ) mocked the “crocodile tears” in Washington after Democrats expressed outrage over President Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey. [“I was not a huge Comey fan, he politicized investigations, both sides of the aisle lost confidence. Lots of crocodile tears in dc,” he tweeted Wednesday morning.  I was not a huge Comey fan, he politicized investigations, both sides of the aisle lost confidence in him. Lots of crocodile tears in dc,  —   Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 10, 2017,  After the bombshell news of Comey’s firing broke Tuesday evening, Democrats took to Twitter and the airwaves to express shock and concern over Comey’s firing, despite some of them having previously clamored for his dismissal. Paul also tweeted: “Hypocrisy and fake outrage? Dems had been calling for months for the firing of Comey!” he added a few minutes later. Hypocrisy and fake outrage? Dems had been calling for months for the firing of Comey!  —   Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 10, 2017,  Comey had been unpopular on both ends of the political spectrum prior to Trump’s decision. Last July, he roiled Republicans after he announced that although Hillary Clinton was “careless” with her emails, there was no evidence of criminal intent and the FBI would not pursue charges. Democrats celebrated Comey then. But when Comey announced in October the FBI was reopening the investigation into Clinton, less than two weeks before the elections, Democrats were furious and later blamed him for her loss. Earlier this year, he made headlines again when he confirmed the FBI was investigating Russian interference in the elections, as well as any coordination between Moscow and the Trump campaign. This last week may have been the last straw, after he appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and gave an impassioned defense of his decision to announce the reopening of the investigation, again angering Democrats. At the same time, he revealed that Clinton aide Huma Abedin had forwarded classified emails to husband Anthony Weiner, but that the FBI did not recommend charges against either, arguing there was no evidence of criminal intent. Later, anonymous officials told some news outlets that Comey had misspoken and that Abedin had only forwarded a “handful” of emails, including classified ones, but not “hundreds and thousands” of emails as “regular practice,” as Comey had said. And his refusal to clarify whether there was any evidence underlying Democrats’ accusation of collusion had long angered Trump supporters, making him deeply unpopular with them too. “There’s a lot of hypocrisy going around,” Paul said in an interview Wednesday morning on Fox News. “Chuck Schumer in November said he lost confidence. Hillary Clinton saying that he completely destroyed the whole election  …     Eric Holder says Comey violated   Department of Justice procedures. ” “So I think you have a lot of people looking at it from the Democrat side who have said they have lost confidence in him, I think you have Republicans saying they should have prosecuted Clinton, nobody’s happy with his tenure at the FBI, so I think it was long past time for him to go,” he added. Trump in his statement announcing Comey’s firing said it will “mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement. ”",0

3082,US Hypocrisy: Bombing of Aleppo is No Worse Than What Happened in Gaza and Iraq,"Written by Gareth Porter   The Russian-Syrian bombing campaign in eastern Aleppo, which has ended at least for the time being, has been described in press reports and op-eds as though it were unique in modern military history in its indiscriminateness. In an usual move for a senior US official, Secretary of State John Kerry called for an investigation of war crimes in Aleppo. The discussion has been lacking in historical context, however. Certainly the civilian death toll from the bombing and shelling in Aleppo has been high, but many of the strikes may not be all that dissimilar from the major US bombing campaign in Iraq in 2003, nor as indiscriminate as Israel’s recent campaigns in densely populated cities. The impression that the bombing in Aleppo was uniquely indiscriminate was a result of news reporting and commentary suggesting, by implication, that there are no real military targets in east Aleppo. But in fact, al-Nusra Front turned Aleppo into the central hub of a massive system of conventional warfare in Aleppo province in late January 2016 when it sent an enormous convoy of at least 200 vehicles with troops and weaponry into eastern Aleppo. A dramatic three-minute al-Nusra video shows what appears to be hundreds of vehicles full of troops and trucks with weapons mounted on them. The Russian command in Syria has drones observing the routes in and out of Aleppo, so it certainly knew where many of those military sites were located. Syrian opposition sources also revealed that Nusra began immediately to put the military assets at its disposal underground, digging deep bunkers to protect troops, military equipment and tunnels through which troops and weapons could be moved unseen. The move underground explains the Russian use of bunker-buster bombs for the first time in the war. As the Guardian reported , Justin Bronk of the British defence think tank Royal United Service Institute concluded that the Russians “have high-grade intelligence of the whereabouts of Syrian opposition positions,” mainly because bunker buster bombs are too expensive to use simply to destroy buildings at random. But like Hamas fighters in Gaza in 2014, the Nusra Front-led command in Aleppo has moved its troops, weapons and command centres around in the tunnels that they have built. So many of the Russian and Syrian air strikes are almost certainly hitting targets that have already been abandoned. And in other cases, the wrong target has undoubtedly been hit. The Aleppo Health Directorate, a local monitoring group, estimated that 400 civilians had been killed in the first three weeks of bombing in east Aleppo. The United Nations put the death toll at 360 . Drop the superiority act As terrible as that toll of civilian lives is, the United States should drop the stance of moral superiority. When the US military invaded Iraq in 2003, it made no effort to keep track of how many civilians were killed in its bombing and artillery fire, claiming it had no way to tell who was civilian and who was not. And the best estimates of civilians killed in US and Israeli urban wars don’t provide any basis for moral superiority. A survey of Baghdad’s hospitals by the Los Angeles Times in May 2003 produced an estimate of at least 1,700 civilians killed in the first five weeks of American war. The estimate included those who had died in ground fighting and from unexploded ordnance, but even with those contributing factors subtracted from the total, it would still be far greater than those killed in the assault on east Aleppo on a weekly basis. The three-week Israeli war on Gaza City in 2009 and the seven-week war on Gaza in 2014 were also far deadlier than Aleppo. The former killed 773 civilians, according to an investigation by the Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem. The latter killed 1,473 Palestinian civilians, according to the UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs . Attacks on hospitals The one feature of the Russian-Syrian air offensive on east Aleppo that seems most clearly to violate the laws of war is the targeting of hospitals. Media accounts have referred to air strikes with barrel bombs that have hit two major hospitals in the rebel-held part of the city. The Syrian government has been acting as though it regards the hospitals in eastern Aleppo as serving the Nusra Front command, and the hospitals, which are under intense pressure from the militants who run that part of Aleppo, have fed the government’s suspicions. As a detailed report by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on the air strikes that hit the Al Quds hospital on 27 April explains, the local organisation that created a new system of hospitals in 2011 decided not to declare the hospitals openly but to keep them “underground” – meaning secret from the government. In fact, of course, the government knows perfectly well where all 10 hospitals in east Aleppo are located. The 27 April air strike that damaged the Al Quds hospital shows how the government has responded. It began with an air strike that destroyed a building across the street from the hospital. The building was a school, but former residents of east Aleppo who have gotten out have confirmed that organisations associated with the al-Qaeda-dominated command have located their offices in schools to try to hide their staff. Within a few minutes of the initial strike, according to the MSF account, Al Quds hospital staff were pulling survivors out of the rubble and taking them across the street to the emergency room, whereupon the Syrian air force dropped a barrel bomb at the entrance to the emergency room, killing several of the hospital staff, including one doctor. Then it dropped one close enough to the side of the hospital to hit the emergency room and, minutes later, hit a building down the block where hospital staff were staying. Such attacks on those who try to save the lives of survivors of bombing attacks – sometimes called “double tap” attacks” - are rightly condemned as violations of humanitarian law. And the belief that the staff at the hospital are operating in effect as medics for the adversary’s military does not justify attacking it and the wounded sheltered there. But such violations of the laws of war are hardly unique to Aleppo or Syria. Hardly unique US drone strikes in Pakistan have hit rescuers or mourners after hitting their initial targets in numerous documented cases . In the 2009 Gaza attacks, the Israeli military argued that Hamas fighters were using hospitals to hide from Israeli bombing, but offered no valid evidence to support it, as the Goldstone Report showed . In 2014, the Israelis completely destroyed the Al-Wafa hospital in an air strike recorded for public release after claiming falsely that it had been fired on by Palestinian gunmen. In its wars in Gaza and in Lebanon, the IDF has gone well beyond the Russian and Syrian Aleppo campaign in refusing to recognise any distinction between civilian targets. It not only targeted civilian offices in both Gaza wars, but treated entire areas of the city as a legitimate target, on the premise that all civilians had been ordered to leave. And in both Gaza and in Beirut suburb of Dahiya , it levelled several high-rise buildings where they believed Hezbollah had offices. The IDF called it the “Dahiya doctrine”, and threatened “great damage and destruction” on any adversary in any future war in the region. Heavy bombing in a city is inherently fraught with moral risk, and attacks on genuine civilian targets can never be excused. But such practices have been carried out and legitimised in the past by the very government that is now claiming the role of moral and legal arbiter. That hypocrisy needs to be recognised and curbed as well. - Gareth Porter is an independent investigative journalist and winner of the 2012 Gellhorn Prize for journalism.

3084,Duterte Pulls a 180: China to Build Fake Islands Right Off Philippine Coast,"Duterte Pulls a 180: China to Build Fake Islands Right Off Philippine Coast   Underground Reporter 
( UR ) Beijing — In a move signaling a point of no return in Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s recent pivot to China, it was reported Tuesday the Philippines have granted a state-owned Chinese infrastructure group the right to build artificial islands in the South China Sea — they very practice Duterte’s predecessor had sought to restrict via U.N. intervention. 
“China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), a State-owned infrastructure group, recently signed a contract with the Philippines’ Mega Harbour Port and Development Inc. to conduct a 208-hectare land reclamation project in Davao’s harbour,” wrote China’s state-run People’s Daily . 
To be built just off the Philippines’ southern coast by “moving sediment from the seafloor to a reef,” the four islands “will be used for government offices, businesses, residences, ports and industrial land.” 
The CCCC Dredging chairman stated “the project will elevate cooperation between China and the Philippines’ port construction companies to a new height” and that he “expects the project to become a model for future cooperation between the two nations.” 
It was barely three months ago that a United Nations arbitration court ruled China’s nearly all-encompassing claim of territorial rights to the South China Sea was invalid. That case had been brought by the administration of Duterte’s predecessor, President Benigno Aquino, because China had begun to construct artificial islands in those waters. 
Such a drastic shift in policy — and the, admittedly, somewhat puzzling nature of it — was remarked on by Steve Mollman who, writing for Quartz , reported on the new China-Philippines deal on Thursday: 
“You’d think that rewarding China’s dredging sector would be the last thing the Philippines wants to do. After all, in recent years Chinese dredging ships have been an unwelcome presence in parts of the South China Sea near the Philippines, helping to build islands atop reefs that then became Chinese military bases, complete with runways and ports.”

Indeed, for awhile it appeared the navies of China and the United States — who physically intervened on the side of the Philippines — would succumb to all-out war in the South China Sea. 
Tensions have since deescalated considerably, however, due in large part to the fact that Duterte, who’s officially announced he intends for his country’s future to unfold within the Chinese sphere of influence, has taken away the one thing the U.S. needed to stick its nose in the affairs of the region — an excuse. 
“In this venue, your honors, in this venue, I announce my separation from the United States,” Duterte said while speaking at the Great Hall of the People during a historic trip to Beijing last week. 
In that speech, the Filipino president made his reasoning for the pivot quite clear. “America has lost,” he said flatly. He made equally clear he wants to be a part of what he feels is the winning side: “I’ve realigned myself in your ideological flow and maybe I will also go to talk to (Russian President) Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world — China, Philippines and Russia. It’s the only way.” 
So Duterte is now allowing China to build fake islands in the South China Sea. 
That statement, in itself, is enough to raise the eyebrows of people following the developments in that region. And with regard to the South China Sea dispute — on the Philippines front, at least — Duterte, in a very real sense, is right. American has lost. Because, after all, it’s awfully hard to convince folks of Chinese aggression when China and the country in question are cooperating voluntarily.",0
3085,"Re: At This Current Pace, A Record-Shattering 2.4 Trillion Dollars Will Be Added To The National Debt This Year","10 Signs That An All-Out Attempt Is Being Made To Sabotage The Trump Campaign Michael’s Latest Video At This Current Pace, A Record-Shattering 2.4 Trillion Dollars Will Be Added To The National Debt This Year   17th, 2016 
Barack Obama is about to become the 20 trillion dollar man. With less than two months to go in his second term, the U.S. national debt stands less than 150 billion dollars away from the 20 trillion dollar mark. And at the pace that the debt is increasing, it seems almost certain that we will cross 20 trillion dollars before Inauguration Day. After promising us that “deficits are under control”, the federal debt jumped by more than 1.3 trillion dollars last fiscal year, and so far this year it is on pace to rise by a record-shattering 2.4 trillion dollars . This is a recipe for national suicide, and yet it wasn’t even a major issue during the recently concluded presidential campaign. 
It is really, really hard to spend a trillion dollars. For example, if you were alive when Jesus was born and you had spent a million dollars every single day since that time, you still would not have spent a trillion dollars by now. 
And even though the Republicans have had control of the House of Representatives since 2010, the wild spending has not slowed down one bit. In fact, it is actually accelerating as we near the end of Obama’s second term. Last year’s rise in the debt of more than 1.3 trillion dollars was shocking enough, but this year we are on pace to top that number by more than a trillion dollars. The following comes from Simon Black … 
According to data released by the Treasury Department yesterday, the US national debt has soared by a whopping $294 billion since the start of the 2017 fiscal year, just 45 days ago. 
That’s an annualized increase of 13%. 
So if they keep up this pace, the national debt will increase by $2.4 trillion this fiscal year, surpassing $21 trillion by next September . 
The only reason we have been able to go on this debt binge for as long as we have is because the rest of the world has been willing to loan us trillions upon trillions of dollars at ridiculously low interest rates that are well below the real rate of inflation. 
This is a highly irrational state of affairs, and once this changes we are going to be in a massive amount of trouble. 
And since Donald Trump’s election victory, we have already seen the rate on 10 year U.S. Treasury notes shoot up dramatically . 
Over the long-term, the average rate of interest paid on U.S. government debt has been about 6 percent. Right now we are way below that, but that cannot last forever. 
At some point rates will rise, and if we were to just get back to the 5 percent mark we would be paying more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt once the debt hits $21 trillion. 
The bottom line is that we are racing toward national bankruptcy. 
But instead of focusing on getting the debt under control, Donald Trump is already promising a whole bunch of new spending in addition to what is already taking place. 
This week, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen warned Congress about what Trump’s $1 trillion infrastructure spending program may mean for our financial situation… 
President-elect Donald Trump has pledged a $1 trillion infrastructure spending program to help jump-start an economy that he said during the campaign was in terrible shape. 
Speaking on Capitol Hill Thursday, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen warned lawmakers that as they consider such spending, they should keep an eye on the national debt. Yellen also said that while the economy needed a big boost with fiscal stimulus after the financial crisis, that’s not the case now. 
“The economy is operating relatively close to full employment at this point,” she said, “so in contrast to where the economy was after the financial crisis when a large demand boost was needed to lower unemployment, we’re no longer in that state.” 
The truth is that we simply can’t afford to keep going into so much debt. 
Debt literally destroys the future, and since Barack Obama has been in the White House our government has been stealing more than 100 million dollars an hour from our children and our grandchildren every single hour of every single day . It is a crime of such a magnitude that I don’t know if there are words to describe it, and yet only a very small fraction of the population is upset about this right now. 
We have just come to accept that ripping off our children and our grandchildren is normal. But someday if they get the chance they will curse us for what we have done to them. 
In our extreme arrogance, we actually think that it is okay to saddle them with a giant mountain of debt that they will be servicing for their entire lives. In a just society, those that have done this to future generations of Americans would be going to prison. 
When you go into debt, you take consumption from the future and bring it into the present. In essence, we are taking money that they should have been able to spend, and instead we are spending it right now. 
Without a doubt, government spending helps the economy in the short-term. When the government spends money, it gets into the pockets of ordinary Americans who in turn spend that money on goods and services that they need. So that is why politicians like to borrow and spend – it makes the economy perform better than it otherwise would, and voters tend to vote for incumbents when “things are going well”. 
If the federal government had only spent the money that it took in through taxes over the past eight years, we would be in a rip-roaring depression right now. Barack Obama and those that work under him understand this, and that is why they were perfectly fine with running the national debt up to 20 trillion dollars. They will take credit for “fixing the economy”, but the truth is that all they did was steal trillions of dollars from our kids and our grandkids. 
And anyone that has ever gotten into trouble with debt knows that a day of reckoning comes eventually. 
Could our day of reckoning be just around the corner during the Trump years? 
Donald Trump will be blamed if everything crashes while he is in office, but the real blame should be placed at the feet of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and a deeply corrupt Congress that always went along with the wild spending.",0
3086,"Frank Ocean Finally Delivers His Album, and a Pop-Up Surprise - The New York Times","After a yearslong wait, compounded by additional delays and   feints, the   often inscrutable RB singer Frank Ocean managed to deliver more than one new album. The first, a streaming   “visual album” titled “Endless,” was released late on Thursday via Apple Music. It was followed on Saturday by two other ambitious projects:   shops in four cities  —   Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and London  —   that handed out free copies of Boys Don’t Cry, an elaborate art magazine created by Mr. Ocean and “Blonde,” a   LP by the singer released on Apple Music, as a stream and paid download. At its center, the magazine also contained a CD version of the new album. In a note on his personal Tumblr blog, Mr. Ocean’s preferred mode of communication with his fans, he wrote: “I had the time of my life making all of this. Thank you all. Especially those of you who never let me forget I had to finish. Which is basically every one of y’all. ” “Blonde,” the   to Mr. Ocean’s   2012 debut, “Channel Orange,” had been one of the most anticipated albums of the year  —   and various delays only added to the expectations. He teased that “Boys Don’t Cry” (initially thought to be the name of both his second album and the magazine) would be released in July 2015. Then, the album had a tentative release date of Aug. 5. Mr. Ocean poked fun at his own lateness with an image on his website of a library   slip with multiple dates crossed out. The subsequent delivery of “Endless,” which featured    footage of Mr. Ocean working in a warehouse, set to a continuous flow of 18 perplexing new songs, raised more questions than it answered, and it was not available for download Apple promised “more from Frank” over the weekend. (On Saturday, in the early morning hours, an additional video for the song “Nikes” also appeared on Apple Music.) “Blonde,” which is spelled “Blond” on the album cover and “Blonde” on Apple and elsewhere, hews more closely to what was expected from a sophomore release by one of the most lauded and enigmatic young singers in pop music. Songs titles include “Pink + White,” “Be Yourself,” “Facebook Story” and “White Ferrari. ” Mr. Ocean’s accompanying glossy magazine lists   album contributors including André 3000, James Blake, Jamie xx, Kanye West, Beyoncé, Kendrick Lamar, Pharrell Williams, Rick Rubin and more. In Manhattan on Saturday, the line to get into Mulberry Iconic Magazines, on the corner of Mulberry Street and Kenmare Street, stretched more than a block just after 7 p. m. Inside the store, the essence of a standard New York bodega remained  —   chips, soda, detergent and so on were still for sale  —   but the shelves also had been stocked with copies of the magazine Boys Don’t Cry in a sealed reflective wrapping. With only a few patrons allowed entry at a time, fans browsed leisurely, helping themselves to one of three editions of the oversized publication (only the covers varied). Among the features inside: an interview with Mr. Ocean’s mother a conversation between Mr. Ocean and the outré rapper Lil B lyrics to the songs on “Blonde” and plentiful photos of sports cars, long an obsession of Mr. Ocean’s. The newest of his new albums played over Sonos speakers that had been installed in the shop. Decals bearing the name of the album and the magazine emphasized the takeover of the ordinary space  —   there was “Blonde” and “Boys Don’t Cry” on the beer refrigerators, the cigar cases, even the deli counter. The everyday essentials, while providing an authentic backdrop, could only be overshadowed.",0
3087,Justice Dept. Says Judge in Immigration Case Is Out of Bounds - The New York Times,"The Obama administration on Tuesday escalated a feud with the federal judge hearing a challenge to the president’s executive actions on immigration, accusing the judge of overstepping his authority by imposing sanctions on government lawyers for what he said were ethics violations. In court papers, the Justice Department responded to an order on May 19 by Judge Andrew S. Hanen of Federal District Court in Brownsville, Tex. in which he ordered government lawyers practicing in the 26 states involved in the case to take ethics courses. He also barred some from appearing in his court. In the scathing ruling, Judge Hanen ordered the department to provide the names of tens of thousands of immigrants who were granted protection from deportation for three years under the president’s programs, before the judge imposed an injunction in February 2015. The Justice Department disputed the judge’s claim that its lawyers had intentionally lied to him and called his punishments grossly disproportionate, even if they had committed the missteps. The department said the measures ordered by the judge would cost the government as much as $8 million over five years and force the administration to reveal the identities of innocent immigrants who played no role in the dispute. “The department emphatically disagrees with the sanctions orders,” said a spokesman for the agency, Patrick Rodenbush. The department has asked Judge Hanen for an emergency stay of his order  —   which he is unlikely to grant  —   and said it would appeal his order. The dispute is a side issue in the lawsuit brought by Texas and 25 other states against the programs President Obama announced in November 2014 that would give deportation protection and work permits to more than four million immigrants in the country illegally. Judge Hanen’s injunction was upheld by an appeals court, and the case is before the Supreme Court. In the latest episode, the administration is making the same argument against the judge that he made against Mr. Obama, saying that Judge Hanen overreached the bounds of his authority and is arbitrarily imposing big costs on government budgets. At issue is when government lawyers told Judge Hanen that more than 100, 000 deportation deferrals with a newly expanded term of three years had been granted under a separate program for young undocumented immigrants who came here as children. Government lawyers have acknowledged that they at first overlooked the fact that those   deferrals were covered by the lawsuit. Administration officials said they complied with an earlier order by Judge Hanen to recall about 2, 500   deferrals issued after his injunction, replacing them with deferrals with the original   terms. But the fiery language from both sides shows the intense differences in the case. In his original order, punctuated with quotations from famous movies about lawyers, Judge Hanen accused the Justice Department’s lawyers of “unseemly and unprofessional conduct. ” In a statement filed in court, Leon Rodríguez, the director of the immigration agency in charge of the president’s programs, said the judge’s demand for a list of about 50, 000 immigrants with   deferrals living in the 26 states would be an “unprecedented breach” of the confidentiality of immigration applications. “There is so much bad blood” between the judge and the lawyers, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who is an expert on judicial ethics and is not involved in the immigration case. He said the judge’s order, coming before the Supreme Court’s decision, was “both precipitous and excessive,” because Judge Hanen did not explain why he extended his ethics schooling to lawyers who had no part in the case.",0
3088,"Where to, Hillary? How Clinton Is Relying on President Obama’s Help - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   After George W. Bush twice carried the New Hampshire county that includes   Manchester and Nashua, President Obama turned the tables and won it in both his elections by similar margins. Mr. Bush handily captured the Ohio county that includes Cincinnati and its mostly white suburbs in 2004, while Mr. Obama won there running away in 2012. Colorado and Virginia went for Mr. Bush, then flipped to Mr. Obama. Now that Mr. Obama has endorsed Hillary Clinton, her advisers are eager to use his political touch in those and other battleground states and extend the Democratic streak there this fall. They see Mr. Obama as a     resource  —   a popular sitting president  —   in the looming campaign to defeat Donald J. Trump. Political strategists at the White House and in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign are just beginning to determine a specific   schedule for the president after his endorsement on Thursday of his former secretary of state. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton will appear together on Wednesday for the first time since she secured the Democratic nomination, and they have chosen Green Bay, Wis. another city where Mr. Obama lifted Democratic fortunes. But that is likely to be one of the few times they appear together. Instead, Mr. Obama will be on his own, cutting a path across white suburbs in the Midwest and Rust Belt and spending time in   communities in states like North Carolina and Virginia. The president will reach out to independents and others in New Hampshire and Iowa, and rally young people, Hispanics and   in competitive states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada. “He’ll definitely spend time rallying his supporters,” said Jen Psaki, the president’s communications director. “But he will also be engaging communities where people are making up their minds, where they are looking to have a discussion about the choice they are facing. ” Clinton advisers described Mr. Obama as the rare sitting president who could help his party’s nominee in all of the swing states in the general election. Other recent   presidents, like Mr. Bush and Bill Clinton, were unwelcome on the campaign trail because their party’s nominees, John McCain and Al Gore, regarded them as controversial. Mr. Clinton had high approval ratings, yet his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment proceedings in 1998 made him persona non grata with the Gore campaign. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, citing Mr. Obama’s solid approval ratings and popularity with Democrats and some independents, said they thought he would be a net asset in Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and other battleground states that he carried in 2008 and 2012 and where he is arguably more popular now. All those states are critical to Mrs. Clinton’s electoral strategy. “There is not a battleground state on the map where President Obama is not an asset,” said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. Mr. Obama’s advocacy for   agreements and his administration’s rules allowing hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, are unpopular with liberals, among others. And it is unclear how effective the president can be in transferring his popularity to Mrs. Clinton. During the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, Mr. Obama campaigned on behalf of Democratic lawmakers but his party was routed by Republicans both times. Still, Clinton advisers said he would be a powerful voice attacking Mr. Trump’s fitness and temperament for the presidency and championing Mrs. Clinton’s determination to build on his record of economic growth, expansion of health care and civil rights progress. He also can testify to her character, portraying her as putting patriotic duty ahead of their personal rivalry when she accepted his offer to be secretary of state in 2008 after their bruising primary battle. In doing so, Mr. Obama may be able to help Mrs. Clinton dent her high unfavorable ratings and persuade some voters to put aside their doubts about her honesty and trustworthiness  —   weaknesses that regularly show up in polls. Mrs. Clinton’s advisers said they were not sure yet how often she and Mr. Obama would campaign together, but said they were eager to deploy him. Mr. Obama is bound to campaign mostly in Democratic strongholds this fall to help energize voters and ensure strong turnout, but the advisers emphasized that they did not feel boxed in about where they could send him. As one adviser put it, Mr. Obama was broadly popular enough that he could campaign in   Cleveland without the Clinton campaign worrying too much that voters in Parma, a suburb, would be turned off by regional news coverage of him. During the initial weeks of the general election campaign, Mr. Obama is likely to focus on suburban communities in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Pennsylvania where the strategists believe that the president will be well received, especially among voters who are not strongly aligned with a party, or who may be turned off by Mr. Trump’s more bellicose rhetoric. Some Democratic officials also think Mr. Obama can help Mrs. Clinton by directly appealing to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders in states like Wisconsin that he carried this spring. While Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton share some policy goals and positions that are not liberal enough to satisfy some Sanders supporters, Mr. Obama still enjoys a measure of good will with many of them as a   president. “I think the president will be able to talk to Sanders supporters, and be heard by them, in a way that Mrs. Clinton can’t right now, because so many Sanders voters haven’t accepted her as the nominee yet,” said former Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat. “Bernie is tremendously popular here. I think people like Hillary and she’ll win here in November, but Obama’s popularity will rub off on her at just the right time  —   the end of a   primary. ” Still, some Sanders supporters said they were devoted to their candidate and ambivalent about hearing Mr. Obama extol Mrs. Clinton. “I certainly am proud of the things that President Obama has done, and admire him, but we also need some time to grieve the end of the nomination race,” said Pat Cotham, a Democratic superdelegate who recently endorsed Mr. Sanders, and a county official in Charlotte, N. C.  —   another area the Clinton campaign would like to dispatch the president. Mr. Obama won North Carolina in 2008, but lost there in 2012. Clinton advisers think he could help Mrs. Clinton put it back in the Democratic column. “I hope that the president acknowledges the unbelievable accomplishments that Bernie has made by raising hundreds of millions of dollars without a ‘super PAC,’ and the issues Bernie and his supporters care about,” Ms. Cotham said. “That sort of message would be welcomed. ” Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic allies also hope that Mr. Obama’s efforts on her behalf will impress suburban women, providing her with an effective, levelheaded counter to the appeal that Mr. Trump demonstrated among white,   men during the Republican primaries. “Having Obama make the case to independents, women, even Republicans around Cincinnati and other   suburbs is smart politics, because a lot of these voters will want someone other than Donald Trump,” said Paul A. Sracic, professor and chairman of the department of politics at Youngstown State University in Ohio. “And Hillary Clinton needs their votes to offset her losses among white men in other places. ” An analysis of voting patterns by The Upshot shows that Mr. Obama did even better in 2012 than previously thought in the mostly white counties around Cincinnati. In Butler, Warren and Clermont Counties, the analysis showed, Mr. Obama improved upon the performance of John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate. The focus on independents and suburban women, and the message from the president on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, are likely to shift as Election Day draws closer. In October, Mr. Obama could be expected to fly Air Force One into places where he can energize turnout among core Democratic supporters. Aides said the president’s October calendar has been largely cleared of other activities, leaving him time to campaign wherever Mrs. Clinton needs him. Mrs. Clinton’s strategists said they were likely to send the president to the Orlando area in Florida Montgomery County, Pa. north of Philadelphia Denver and Charlotte. Mr. Obama has proved particularly good at winning support from black voters. In 2004, 13. 2 million   voted in the presidential campaign in 2012, more than 17. 6 million did. And Mr. Obama raised the proportion of black voters who supported him, something that Mrs. Clinton’s campaign hopes he can also do for her. In 2004, Mr. Kerry got 86 percent of the black vote in 2012, Mr. Obama got 96 percent.",0
3089,VIDEO And WikiLeaks Evidence Mounts: Watch Hillary’s Two-Fisted Alcoholism For Yourself,"0 comments Video after video does not lie. This footage, along with leaked emails, explains so much. SHE EVEN DRINKS TWO-FISTED! Stories of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for alcohol have been around for years, and some of them, even in her own words, are legendary. Consider her vodka drinking contest with Senator John McCain. Here it is, told by none other than Democrat Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, in her own words and posted on her Facebook page: 
Then of course, there is the “trip” Yemen. Watch her walk, her mannerisms, and her fall. Pay close attention: 
Our video study is just getting started, though now is a good time to mention the latest from WikiLeaks on the topic of Hillary’s “sobriety.” 
On August 8, 2015, Hillary’s Campaign Chairman John Podesta wrote to Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, “Should I call her and talk this through or better to leave with you? I’m worried she’ll get on with Cheryl and we’ll end up in a bad place. I’m in a session that lasts till 3:30 your time. Is that timely or should I walk out?” 
Two hours later, Palmieria responded, “I think you should call her and sober her up some.” 
It was 4:30pm, in the afternoon, and her staff is interested in sobering her up. 
Hillary’s campaign staff are not the only one’s to have noticed her drinking. 
Amy Chozick, a reporter for the New York Times, explained, “She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no.” 
In October of 2016, Chozick sent the following tweet: 
Makes sense, especially in light of campaign videos like this one: 
— Elizabeth Harrington (@LizWFB) October 10, 2016 
Evidently, drinking is one of Hillary’s political strategies. 
In a July 3 article, the New York Times reported that Hillary plans to “seek common ground with the G.O.P. over drinks” in her first 100 days. 
It continued, “Mrs. Clinton’s ability to use alcohol as a political lubricant came up repeatedly when allies and advisers were asked how she might work with Republicans. Her tale about a drinking contest with Senator John McCain of Arizona is now a Washington legend. (She said they called it quits before things got out of hand.) She believes that a relaxed, frank discussion is more authentic than trying to bond awkwardly with adversaries over sports — and more productive than keeping them at arm’s length, as Mr. Obama has often done. 
“‘She likes to cajole, she likes to make deals, and she likes to make friends,’ said Richard Socarides, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton and a longtime supporter of Mrs. Clinton. ‘And she knows it’s much harder to go after someone who you basically like, who you’ve had a drink with.’” 
One of Hillary’s confidantes, Patti Solis Doyle, once remarked, “She likes to hang out and drink and gossip.” Her drink of choice? Wine and vodka. 
On that note, have a look at this these gems: 
And another, this time, TWO-FISTED! 

People have asked: Did Hillary Clinton’s alcohol usage lead to her current neurological condition?

3090,Iraq Votes to Ban Americans in Response to Trump’s Immigration Order - Breitbart,"Iraq’s lawmakers have voted in favor of a reciprocal travel ban on U. S. citizens if President Donald Trump’s administration does not rescind its decision to prohibit the entry of Iraqis. [When Barack Obama blocked Iraqi refugees from entering the United States for six months in 2011, the   parliament took no action.  On Monday, Iraqi lawmakers voted to call on the   Baghdad government to “respond in kind to the American decision in the event that the American side does not to withdraw its decision,” reports Agence   (AFP) citing Iraqi member of parliament (MP) Hakim   who quoted the text of the decision that was read during the parliamentary session. “Parliament voted by majority on calling on the Iraqi government and the foreign ministry to respond in kind,” declared MP Zamili. Iraqi MP Sadiq   reportedly confirmed that “the vote was for a call on the government” to enact a reciprocal ban. Al Jazeera points out, “The [Iraqi parliament] vote on Monday is not thought to be binding on the government of Prime Minister Haider   whose government has made no official comment on the order. ” Haider’s foreign ministry has urged the Trump administration to review the ban. The recent vote by Iraqi lawmakers came in response to President Trump’s executive order to ban citizens traveling on passports from seven   nations  —   Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen  —   from entering the United States for at least 90 days in an effort to strengthen America’s refugee vetting process. “Importantly, however, Lawful Permanent Residents of the United States [green card holders]  …     will be allowed to board U. S. bound aircraft and will be assessed for exceptions at arrival ports of entry, as appropriate. The entry of these individuals, subject to national security checks, is in the national interest,” notes the U. S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in explaining the executive order, which President Trump signed on Friday. The executive order also allows the U. S. government to “prioritize refugee claims” from members of persecuted religious minorities in the predominantly Muslim countries covered under the ban, such as Christians and Yazidis. In 2011,   Obama instituted a similar ban, although it is unclear if it included the religious minority exception. There were neither protests nor backlash from the mainstream media in response to Obama’s measure. A 2013 article by ABC News, titled “Exclusive: US May Have Let ‘Dozens’ of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees,” revealed: As a result of the Kentucky case, the [Obama] State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News  —   even for many who had heroically helped U. S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U. S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10, 000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U. S. half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show. The Kentucky case refers to the discovery in 2009 of two   Iraqi terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green who ultimately admitted in court that they had attacked U. S. soldiers in Iraq. One of those terrorists, Waad Ramadan Alwan, entered the United States through Syria. Moreover, the seven nations covered by the order, including Iraq, had been previously identified as “countries of concern” under the Obama administration. “These seven countries were designated by Congress and the Obama Administration as posing a significant enough security risk to warrant additional scrutiny in the visa waiver context,” notes DHS. Unlike President Trump, Obama failed to announce his temporary ban on Iraqi refugees, which the leftist mainstream media has interpreted as meaning that it was not the former president’s policy to temporarily halt the entry of Iraqi refugees because he never took ownership of the measure. The recent Iraqi parliament vote echoes calls from Iran for a reciprocal travel ban on American citizens. According to the Independent, the   Shiite militia coalition dubbed the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and Hashd   has also been critical of Trump’s national security policy, “calling for a ban on issuing visas to Americans visiting the country and for those already in Iraq to be expelled. ” Shiite powerhouse Iran has also vowed to implement legal, political, and reciprocal measures in response to the U. S. policy, announced the Islamic Republic’s Foreign Affairs Ministry on Saturday. The   Baghdad government is close to Iran. “We are against this stance from the new administration,” said Iraqi MP Laban, referring to Trump’s national security order, adding, “We hope that the American administration will rethink  …     this decision. ”",0
3091,LEAKED: Hillary Would Completely BAN The Most Popular Guns In America,"Share This 
There are so many reasons Americans should not vote for Hillary Clinton, but one of those reasons is this woman’s tyrannical plans to strip us of our Second Amendment rights. What many people do not realize is that if she becomes president, Hillary would ban many of our favorite guns, as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked. 
In a recent WikiLeaks dump, we got an inside glimpse into Hillary’s diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president. If you thought Obama’s tyranny with bypassing Congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious, it won’t hold a candle to this woman’s plans. She blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner “more aggressive than Obama,” while chipping away at our Second Amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws. 
While Hillary likes to pump us full of crap, claiming that “law-abiding Americans wouldn’t be targeted” with her tyranny, her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect Americans with no criminal records, while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals. 
One example is Hillary calling for the “reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines.” However, the result of her “assault weapons” ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms, including the popular AR-15, while making “high capacity” magazines illegal to even possess. 
We all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because Hillary decides to pass a law. 
Her other Constitution-subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for “victims of gun violence” to sue gun manufacturers, which would quickly bankrupt these companies. However, Hillary’s ultimate goal is to ban all guns in America completely by utilizing the Supreme Court. With her hand-picked justice filling Antonin Scalia’s vacancy, she would have the SCOTUS revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling. If successful, the court would eliminate it’s previous affirmation that it is an individual’s Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. 
When you put all the pieces together, Hillary’s plans for America is nothing short of chilling. History taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed — images of corpses from Nazi concentration camps come to mind. Add Hillary’s gun-grabbing plan to her dream of turning America into a borderless society and flooding our country with Muslim refugees, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. 
God help us if this woman is elected. Continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day. Once she’s in office, the America that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third-world country crap hole, and Hillary’s life-long plans will be complete.",0
3092,"Gatestone Institute: 423 New Mosques, 500 Closed Churches in London","The Gatestone Institute reports Sunday on the striking rate of closures of churches in the United Kingdom’s capital city, a trend mirrored elsewhere in Europe, and the blooming number of mosques that have been established in their stead. [Reporting on the change in religious observation in London, the Gatestone Institute writes:  “London is more Islamic than many Muslim countries put together” according to Maulana Syed Raza Rizvi, one of the Islamic preachers who now lead “Londonistan” as the journalist Melanie Phillips has called the English capital. No, Rizvi is not a   extremist. Wole Soyinka, a Nobel Laureate for Literature, was less generous he called the UK “a cesspit for Islamists”. “Terrorists can not stand London multiculturalism” London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said after the recent deadly terror attack at Westminster. The opposite is true: British multiculturalists are feeding Islamic fundamentalism. Above all, Londonistan, with its new 423 mosques, is built on the sad ruins of English Christianity. The Hyatt United Church was bought by the Egyptian community to be converted to a mosque. St Peter’s Church has been converted into the Madina Mosque. The Brick Lane Mosque was built on a former Methodist church. Not only buildings are converted, but also people. The number of converts to Islam has doubled often they embrace radical Islam, as with Khalid Masood, the terrorist who struck Westminster. The Daily Mail published photographs of a church and a mosque a few meters from each other in the heart of London. At the Church of San Giorgio, designed to accommodate 1, 230 worshipers, only 12 people gathered to celebrate Mass. At the Church of Santa Maria, there were 20. The nearby Brune Street Estate mosque has a different problem: overcrowding. Its small room and can contain only 100. On Friday, the faithful must pour into the street to pray. Given the current trends, Christianity in England is becoming a relic, while Islam will be the religion of the future. Read more at The Gatestone Institute",0
3093,Iceland’s Pirate Party Makes Strong Showing in New Election,"Iceland’s Pirate Party Makes Strong Showing in New Election Posted on Oct 30, 2016 
By Common Dreams staff PiratesforIceland.party 
Iceland’s Pirate Party has tripled its seats in the 63-seat parliament, Saturday night’s election results show. 
Birgitta Jonsdottir, the leader of the Pirate Party, said she was satisfied with the result. “Whatever happens, we have created a wave of change in the Icelandic society,” she told a cheering crowd early Sunday morning. 
The Pirates won 10 seats, more than tripling its three seats in the last election. The Left-Green Party also won 10 seats Saturday. 
The left-leaning parties — the Left-Greens, the Pirates and two allies — won a total of 27 seats, just short of the 32 required to command a majority in Iceland’s Parliament, the world’s oldest.

The governing center-right Progressive party lost more than half of its seats in the election which was triggered by Prime Minister Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson ‘s resignation in April in the wake of the leaked Panama Papers which revealed the offshore assets of high-profile figures. 
Current Prime Minister Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson said he would resign on Sunday. 
The anti-establishment Pirate Party, which was founded in 2012, had said it could be looking to form a coalition with three left-wing and centrist parties. 
The Pirates’ core issues are: direct democracy, freedom of expression, civil rights, net neutrality, and transparency, all set out in a popular, crowdsourced draft of a new national Constitution that the current government has failed to act on. They also seek to re-nationalize the country’s natural resource industries, create new rules for civic governance, and issue a passport to Edward Snowden.

Pirate Party founder and MP Birgitta Jonsdottir said she was “very satisfied” with the result. 
“Our internal predictions showed 10 to 15%, so this is at the top of the range. We knew that we would never get 30%,” Ms Jonsdottir told Reuters. “We want to see trickle-down ethics rather than make-believe trickle-down economics,” Ms. Jonsdottir, 49, who is also a former WikiLeaks activist, said 
“We are a platform for young people, for progressive people who shape and reshape our society,” Ms. Jonsdottir told Agence France-Presse. “Like Robin Hood, because Robin Hood was a pirate, we want to take the power from the powerful to give it to the people.” Turnout in Iceland was 79.2%! If the US got anywhere near that, this would be a dramatically more progressive country. pic.twitter.com/9uCBBewNz2 — John Nichols (@NicholsUprising) October 30, 2016 TAGS:",0
3094,Ann Coulter: We Have Now Hit Full-On Crazy,"Liberals are ecstatic that a judge in Hawaii is writing immigration policy for the entire country, and that policy is: We have no right to tell anyone that he can’t live in America. (Unless they’re Christians  —   those guys we can keep out. )[As subtly alluded to in the subtitle of Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, the goal of liberals is for the poor of the world to have a constitutional right to come here whenever they want.  I can’t help but notice that the Third Worlders aren’t moving to liberals’ neighborhoods. After nearly 1 million Rwandans were murdered by other Rwandans in 1994, our government asked itself: Why not bring more of this fascinating Rwandan culture to America? Ten thousand of them poured in. So far, nearly 400 have been convicted in the United States of lying on visa applications about their role in the genocide. And that’s why we have to tighten our belt, America! Massive international investigations don’t come cheap. Almost every immigration case is a con, something we find out every time there’s a San Bernardino shooting and half the familyturns out to have scammed our immigration officials. One hundred percent of the “humanitarian” cases are frauds. Earlier this month, Rwanda’s Gervais Ngombwa was convicted for lying on his immigration application by claiming to have been a victim of the 1994 genocide. In fact, he was a   perpetrator  —   even featured in Rwandan newspaper articles as a leader of the genocide. For most of the last two decades, Ngombwa has been living in Iowa with his wife and eight children in a house built by Habitat for Humanity  —   because no Americans need houses. He came to the authorities’ attention a couple years ago by setting that house on fire after a domestic dispute, then filing a fraudulent $75, 000 insurance claim. Another Rwandan genocidalist living in America was featured in Adios, America: Beatrice Munyenyezi, granted refugee status as an alleged victim of the genocide, even though she, too, had helped orchestrate it. Munyenyezi was living safely living in Kenya when she applied for a refugee visa to America. The welfare is way better here. And, luckily for us, she had a “chronic medical condition” that required constant attention from a New Hampshire hospital. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet arrived in the U. S. on a tourist visa, then immediately applied for “asylum” on the grounds that he was persecuted in Egypt  —   for being a member of an Islamic terrorist group. Being a member of a noted terrorist group cannot be used to block you from coming to America, thanks to Barney Frank’s 1989 amendment to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, because liberals love this country so very, very much. Being a talented neurosurgeon from Switzerland, however, is disqualifying. Hadayet’s refugee application wasn’t denied until he’d already been living here for three years. When he was called in for a visa overstay hearing, he didn’t show up, and the INS didn’t bother looking for him. After allowing Hadayet to mill about America for another year, our government granted him permanent residency and a work permit. On the Fourth of July following the   attack, Hadayet shot up the El Al ticket counter at the Los Angeles International Airport. I guess the Egyptians were right! As bodies were being cleared away from the ticket counter, including Hadayet’s, his wife blamed America for the attack, denying her husband had anything to do with it. “He is a victim of injustice,” she explained. “In America, they hate Islam and Arabs after Sept. 11. ” At least immigrants are grateful. Immigration bureaucrats are so determined to transform America without anyone seeing what they’re doing that the INS initially refused to release Hadayet’s file to congressional investigators, in order to protect his “privacy. ” Of course, anybody could miss Egypt’s designating someone a terrorist. And maybe the INS’s test for Rwandan “refugees” is: Would this person be able to convince Rolling Stone magazine that “Haven Monahan” raped her? How about Rasmea Yousef Odeh? She waltzed into America after having been convicted and imprisoned in Israel for a supermarket bombing that left two Hebrew University students dead, and also for the attempted bombing of the British consulate in Israel. She was released in a prisoner exchange  —   whereupon Odeh made a beeline for the U. S. True, Odeh wasn’t subjected to the   vetting accorded the humanitarian cases, like the Boston Marathon bombers (we were warned by Russia) Hadayet (we were warned by Egypt) or the Blind Sheik (same). But how did our immigration authorities miss a CONVICTION FOR BOMBING IN ISRAEL? Apart from the terrorism, welfare, and fraud, what great things did any of them do for our country? Ngombwa was a custodian at the Cedar Rapids Community School District in Iowa, a job that, evidently, no American would do. Munyenyezi had a job as an advocate for refugees  —   just one of the many jobs being created by immigrants. Hadayet ran a failing limousine company and was $10, 000 in debt. Odeh was an unemployed waitress and a Palestinian grievance activist. Recently, she’s been heavily involved in     male protests, because who doesn’t like incessant Third World unrest? In 1960, 75 percent of the   in America were from Europe. Today only about 10 percent are. More than a third of all post —  Teddy Kennedy act immigrants  —   not just the wretched humanitarian cases  —   don’t even have a high school diploma. What is the affirmative case for this? How is it making America better? Improving the schools? The job market? Crime? The likelihood of terrorism? Can the liberals doing cartwheels over a district judge’s announcement that everyone in the world has a right to come here (except Europeans and Christians) give us the   analysis they’re using? Twenty million Third World immigrants give us ( __ ) terrorists, ( __ ) welfare recipients, ( __ ) uncompensated medical costs, ( __ ) discrimination lawsuits, but it’s all worth it because ( _________________ )?",0
3095,State to Block Removal of Migrant Victims of ‘Right Wing’ Crime,"A German federal state is considering forbidding the deportation of all migrants who happen to witness, or are victims of, “right wing” crimes when in Germany. [Brandenburg’s state parliament became the first in Germany to offer migrant victims of crime extra rights last year, after a rise in recorded “right wing” attacks. The new   measure is being pushed by the Ministry of the Interior.  “In addition to consistently preventing and prosecuting criminal offences, special protection of the victims and special care are necessary if the victims are people of foreign origin” proclaimed a decree of the Ministry of the Interior, issued in December 2016. It is argued that new arrivals are uniquely vulnerable, without support networks in Germany, and deportation could make their lives harder. The regional parliament also “decided, among other things, to ask the regional government to make sure that victims of right [wing] violent crimes are offered the possibility of being issued with residence permits and tolerances  …    ” It is believed this measure could help deter xenophobia and “far right” attacks on migrants, as such activity will only result in more migrants being allowed to stay in Germany. Migrants who commit a crime, or share responsibility for a violent incident when in Germany, will be exempt from the new rule. A resolution issued by the parliament in April 2016, in response to rising numbers of reported “right wing” crime, said “the victims of racist violent acts are migrant women as well as refugees” and argued that “such offences would be particularly difficult if their stay in the Federal Republic is unsecured”. According to the decree, crimes linked to the “right wing” in Brandenburg increased by 23 per cent in 2015  —   the year the Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany’s borders to more than 1 million irregular migrants. According to Die Welt, the populist,   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been critical of the new proposed policy.",0
3096,US Inches Closer To War With Russia,"The U.S. military announced that they had begun a “major” offensive in Raqqa, Syria, the de facto ISIS capital. 
Via YourNewsWire 
The announcement on Sunday would pave the way for Hillary Clinton to declare a no-fly zone in northeast Syria should she be elected president.. and a no fly zone will require going to war with Syria and Russia.
Approximately 30,000 fighters will participate in the U.S.-led operation. The group expected to carry out the bulk of the fighting is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or the YPG. The YPG is the military extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group that is on the U.S. terrorism list.
(It is not known if U.S. officials were asked about the duplicity of declaring the PKK a terrorist group while at the same time working with them in the region.)
The U.S. will first attempt to seal off Raqqa before venturing into the city itself – actions that government officials say will not be completed prior to Barack Obama leaving office. “We always advertised that the isolation phase (of Raqqa) is going to take months,” Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford was quoted as saying on Sunday.
The announcement paves the way for Hillary Clinton to declare a no-fly zone in northeastern Syria upon entering the Oval Office. A no-fly zone would “require us to go to war against Syria and Russia,” Danford told the Senate in September.
In discussing no-fly zones on Friday, Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein said, “for us to declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia.” In a separate interview, Stein said, “this is a mushroom cloud waiting to happen.”

3097,Only Demented Imbeciles Want A Killary Reign Of Terror,"in: Government Corruption , Special Interests , US News The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati’s masters of the universe require to purge the “Little People” from the planet. Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the “Politically Correct” secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante’s Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for “The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment” or Level 8- the Malebolge where “The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves”. Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the ‘CLINTON DEATH LIST’: 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse, who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche”. Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, “Let them eat cake” but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the “Little People”. The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. “Her problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn’t know where to draw the line. As far as she’s concerned, “justice” for the fate of her family isn’t just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the “extermination” of all of the Marquis’s family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!” (3.12.36). “It was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.” (3.14.33) So it comes as no surprise that when “The meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn’t even stop knitting.” This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist’s warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option. Citizens will not be the only people voting. Non eligible people are being ushered into a ballot booth with predisposed programming to put Killary into the oval office. The establishment is revealing their real tyranny for any person, who is still alive and has the ability to assess the actual nature of this election. The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton’s attempt to hide her family’s pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold. Thanks to the Wikileaks release of the illicit emails from the Clinton cabal, only a fool can vote for her. Come to grips with the prospects of knowingly elevating this lifelong criminal to become the commander-and-chief. Genuine national security cannot be scarified to allow a distrustful and compromised agent of foreign interests to become President. Killary is dead meat. She could never gain the confidence of the nation and her continued nihilistic conduct and her kleptocrat criminal violations cannot be tolerated or ignored any longer. If you really want to save the planet, you cannot cast your ballot for this known traitor.",0
3098,"Secret talks between Mozambique opposition, EU mediators canceled","More The file photo shows former rebel Renamo fighters in Gorongosa, Mozambique. (Photo by AFP) 
Secret peace negotiations between Mozambique's opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama and EU mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the country's army and former rebel fighters, local media say. 
The meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in May to find a solution to the conflict between the government and Dhlakama’s rebel group turned political party Renamo. 
""We had agreed (with President Filipe Nyusi) that two mediators would come ... to meet me,"" the independent weekly Canal de Mocambique quoted Dhlakama as saying. 
Dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting. 
""There was a violent shootout. I even heard explosions from here,"" said Dhlakama, who has been in hiding in the central Gorongosa mountains since October 2015. 
""So I called (chief mediator Mario) Raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me,"" he added. 
Dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was ""convinced"" that the ruling Frelimo party ""wanted to capture me during the meeting."" 
""It is obvious they have a plan to kill me,"" he added. 
Raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that two mediators had gone to Gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader. 
The diplomat said Dhlakama had told the mediators to ""turn back at the very last moment."" 
The political situation in Mozambique has been tense for months with Dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the 2014 elections, where the Frelimo party was declared the winner. The party has been in power since the southern African country’s independence from Portugal in 1975. Dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country. 
Renamo and the Frelimo-led government had been engaged in a civil war for 16 years that was brought to an end in 1992. 
Renamo's armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central Mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power. 
On October 19, the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on October 9. 
The mediators continued separate talks on Tuesday with representatives of each side. Loading ...",0

3100,China ‘Marco Polo’ Xi Jinping starts jockeying in post-Obama world,"by Pepe Escobar for RT 
In yet one more spectacular chapter of his running Marco Polo in reverse saga, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a strategic stop in Sardinia, Italy, on his way to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Lima, Peru. 
Why beautiful Sardinia? Certainly not for a yacht cruise in the Costa Esmeralda. This is all about, once again, the Chinese-driven New Silk Roads. 
Huawei is building its largest European HQ in Sardinia. The Chinese want to buy the port of Cagliari. And fabulous pecorino sardo – serious contender for best sheep cheese on the planet – in powdered form, is already feeding millions of Chinese babies. 
As a casual extra bonus “Marco Polo” Xi, on Chinese national TV, exhorted his compatriots to invest in a massive tourist invasion of Sardinia. Now this is what a stimulus package in Europe is all about. 
Meanwhile, lame duck President Obama, also on his way to APEC, is in Germany passing the caretaker “leader of the free world” baton to a dear-caught-in-the-headlights Angela Merkel. The headlights go by the name Donald Trump. 
TPP six feet under 
The sight of an ebullient Xi side by side with a dejected Obama against the background of South America’s Pacific coast will be priceless. Those were the days, in the go-go 1990s, when Bill Clinton ruled APEC, imprinting the American agenda. Now Asia-Pacific has to come to grips not only with protectionist Trumponomics, but also the fact that Obama’s cherished TPP – the mercantile arm of the “pivot to Asia” – is, for all practical purposes, dead. 
Trump’s transition team, led by Mike Pence, has advised him to bury TPP (grouping the US plus 11 Pacific Rim nations) for good within his first 100 days in office. And the road map goes still further, advising him to drop out of NAFTA as well if a long list of “concessions” is not met. 
Dejected US allies – mostly Japan, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand – who had all been counting on the ascension of Hillary and the enthronization of TPP, are bound to conduct “secret” meetings in Peru aiming at a revised deal. That would have to assume that Republicans in Capitol Hill might agree with Trump having a go at some sort of renegotiation. 
Then there’s the – far-flung – possibility of a cut rate TPP excluding the US. The US and Japan account for roughly 60% of the combined TPP group’s GDP. A TPP without the US is another beast entirely. 
And that leads us to Beijing’s subtle counter-offensive; promoting the anti-TPP along the lines of the still-under-discussion Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which groups East Asia. Japan and Malaysia, as well as non-Asian Australia – three key players – all support RCEP. 
As much as the Trump-China relationship may eventually land on the proverbial stormy seas, Beijing can now be confident that the China-excluding trade arm of the pivot to Asia is history. 
Here’s the official spin, via Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Li Baodong; “China believes we should set a new and very practical working plan, to positively respond to the expectations of industry and sustain momentum and establish a free-trade area in Asia-Pacific at an early date.” No TPP; more like RCEP. 
All those resets 
A new Asia-Pacific trade deal will definitely represent a reset in US-China relations. 
Then there’s that other crucial reset; with Russia. 
Lame duck Pentagon head Ashton “Empire of Whining” Carter “advised” Trump and his team not to cooperate with Russia over Syria. 
He was solemnly ignored. 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Moscow does want cooperation. But he also said Moscow does not intend to “persuade the Pentagon leadership to change something in this regard.” 
Diplomatic translation: You – the Obama administration – as far as we’re concerned, are dead. 
So there will be a reset. It will be extremely complicated, and on a Trumpian deal-to-deal basis: NATO expansion to Russia’s borders; Crimea; US missile defense; color revolution attempts. It will concern all of Eurasia. And it will start with cooperation in Syria. 
Beijing and Moscow have concluded that Trump is not an ideologue (in the neocon mould); he’s a pragmatist. Resets are inevitable. Even surprises. 
Trump may be inclined for the US to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), heavily demonized by the moribund Obama administration. His $1 trillion infrastructure plan is something that China has already pulled off – starting already in the late 1990s. Ellen Brown has a top suggestion; print money, and build all the infrastructure you need. 
An eventual US-Russia deal in Syria would ultimately benefit – who else – China. Mirroring the original Silk Road, China sees Syria as a crucial node of the New Silk Roads, currently cut off. Picture the day in a not too distant future when Xi will be stopping in Damascus to do trade deals. And to call for a stimulus package of Chinese tourists to visit a restored Palmyra.

3101,How Technology Has Failed to Improve Your Airline Experience - The New York Times,"There are many reasons for the sorry state of commercial aviation in America. When it comes to your routinely terrible flight  —   not to mention the sort of exceptional horror that took place aboard United Airlines Flight 3411 last weekend  —   regulatory failures as well as consolidation, which the authorities have allowed to occur unabated for decades, can be blamed. But I come to you as a technology columnist to tell you that technology, too, has failed you. People in Silicon Valley pride themselves on their capacity to upend entrenched industries. Uber defeated taxi cartels. Airbnb made getting a room cheaper and more accessible. Streaming services are undoing the cable business. Yet the airline industry has not just stubbornly resisted innovation to improve customer service  —   in many ways, technology has only fueled the industry’s race to the bottom. Everything about United Flight 3411  —   overselling, underpaying for seats when they are oversold, a cultish refusal to offer immediate contrition, an overall attitude that brutish capitalism is the best that nonelite customers can expect from this fallen world  —   is baked into the airline industry’s business model. And that business model has been accelerated by tech. Travel search engines rank airlines based on price rather than friendliness or quality of service. Online   airport kiosks and apps allow airlines to serve customers with fewer and fewer workers. What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of     capitalism  —   one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, for friendliness, or even for the dignity of customers. “The airline industry has been on a steady downward trajectory when it comes to customer service for nearly 40 years,” said Henry H. Harteveldt, the president of the Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. He noted that American carriers were improving on some metrics  —     service is up, baggage loss is down and prices keep getting better. What keeps deteriorating are comfort and quality of service for   passengers (i. e. most people). Legroom keeps shrinking. Airlines keep tacking on separate fees for amenities we used to consider part of the flight. And customers keep going along with it. “Consumers have shown that they’re willing to put up with an awful lot, including lack of legroom, lack of amenities, mediocre or worse customer service, dirty airplanes and more to save money,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “And the airline industry has evolved to meet that desire” for cheap fares. Part of the problem is how we buy tickets today. The whole system is mercilessly transactional. When you search online, you look for price and travel times, and perhaps you consider some airline loyalty program. Customer service  —   that is, how the airline treats you  —   isn’t often part of the transaction. As a result, airlines have little incentive to reform themselves. “Airline executives will tell you they don’t view themselves as being service companies,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “They want Wall Street to view them as industrial companies, and they want consumers to view them as transportation providers. Customer service is just not what the airlines are about. ” You can see this in United’s initial response to what happened on Flight 3411. “I apologize for having to reaccommodate these customers,” Oscar Munoz, United’s chief executive, said in a statement dripping with all the warmth of a ransom note. In a letter to employees, he repeatedly suggested that the customer, not the airline, was at fault. After all, the passenger was offered a bountiful $1, 000 in United vouchers for his trouble. It was an offer he couldn’t refuse. As a United spokesman told The Times, the passenger was “asked several times, politely,” for his seat before anyone beat him up. It took two days  —   and a plunge in United’s stock price  —   for the airline to offer a real apology. “I want you to know that we take full responsibility and we will work to make it right,” Mr. Munoz said in a statement on Tuesday. Can technology improve how airlines work? Some people have ideas for how that may happen. One of them is obvious and sensible: customer reviews. Last year TripAdvisor, the travel reviews site that has become indispensable for hotel bookings, began rating airlines. Its new rankings, released this week, show that over all, airlines get an average rating of 3. 7 out of 5 from customers. Emirates and Singapore Airlines are rated the best in the world two American airlines, JetBlue and Alaska, made TripAdvisor’s Top 10 list. But Delta was the only major American airline to receive TripAdvisor’s seal of approval. United and American Airlines did not meet the site’s minimum threshold, though Bryan Saltzburg, senior vice president for TripAdvisor’s global flight business, said that the two had been improving. One can imagine how such reviews could prompt improvements in airlines. If instead of just price, travel search engines included prominent warnings from reviewers  —   “This airline might give you a bloody lip while kicking you from your seat,  !”  —   that could alter travelers’ calculations in booking. “That would be a good idea  —   a filter on travel search that says, ‘Click this filter and it might cost you a few dollars more, but we’ll bias you towards airlines that treat their customers well,’ ” said Paul English, the   of the travel search company Kayak who now runs another travel   Lola. That is small potatoes, though. A bigger disruption would come from altering how we pay for airfares. In the same way that Netflix changed the DVD business by charging a monthly fee, some consultants argue that a membership fee could radically improve flying. “We’ve prototyped a subscription airline in the past, and it basically gets the airline out of the business of reducing service for offering the lowest fares,” said Devin Liddell, the principal brand strategist for Teague, a design firm that works with Boeing and other transportation companies. Some   have tried a monthly subscription model, and none have taken off. But airline   face high capital costs a new business model might work, Mr. Liddell said, if an established airline tries it as a way to break free from the accepted way of doing things. You might wonder why an airline would dare try such a thing. After all, airlines are doing well profits are up across the globe, despite your annoyance about flying. But Mr. Liddell warned of   competition from other kinds of transportation. If   cars make driving easier and more comfortable, midrange flights would face competition. Counting the time it takes to clear airport security and get to and from the airport, it takes just as long to drive between some places  —   Los Angeles to San Francisco, say  —   as to fly. If   technology makes driving much more comfortable, too, lots of people might abandon planes for cars, Mr. Liddell said. An even   idea is the Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vision for superfast tunnel travel. It’s a pretty speculative idea, but if it works, airlines would need to radically alter how they work. For now, though, none of that hurts the commercial air business. Airlines are safe from   cars and the Hyperloop. They are content to feed you   service for lower prices, because that is what the web wants. Your only technological hope for better service is your smartphone camera and the viral push of social networks. If you are violently kicked off your flight, at least your fellow passengers will post a video to Facebook.",0
3102,"Iran Warns Trump Over Missile Dispute, and American U.N. Envoy Hits Back - The New York Times","UNITED NATIONS  —   Already furious over President Trump’s visa ban, Iran warned the United States on Tuesday not to escalate tensions over tests of Iranian missiles  —   tests that his administration’s new United Nations ambassador called “absolutely unacceptable. ” The Iranian warning, made in Tehran by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, came a day after American and Israeli officials accused Iran of having conducted a missile test that they said had violated a United Nations Security Council resolution. The United States called an urgent meeting of the Council on Tuesday to discuss the grievance, making Iran the subject of the first diplomatic skirmish at the United Nations by Nikki R. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina who is Mr. Trump’s new ambassador. “The United States is not naïve,” she told reporters after the closed meeting. “We’re not going to stand by. You’re going to see us call them out as we said we would, and you are also going to see us act accordingly. ” Ms. Haley took no questions after her Security Council debut and proposed nothing concrete. The council agreed to refer the issue to its own sanctions committee for further inquiry, which is what it did last year after the last missile test by Iran. Iran has not confirmed that it conducted a test. But Mr. Zarif, at a joint news conference in Tehran with his visiting counterpart from France,   Ayrault, said he hoped that the new American administration would not use Iran’s military defenses “as a pretext to create new tensions. ” When the nuclear deal with Iran was reached in 2015 with major powers including the United States, they agreed sanctions on Iran would be relaxed in exchange for its verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work. A Security Council resolution “called upon” Iran not to undertake any tests of missiles designed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Iran contends that it has not violated the resolution and that its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear warheads  —   which it already has promised not to make as part of the nuclear accord. Nonetheless, the American and Israeli accusations have created what amounts to an early test of the Trump administration’s toughness on Iran. During the presidential election campaign, Mr. Trump denounced the nuclear agreement and sometimes conflated it with the Iranian missile program. Arms control experts have cautioned that Iran’s missile tests are not prohibited under the nuclear accord. Ms. Haley used tough words about such tests but did not say whether her administration regarded them as a violation of the accord. “We have said with this administration that we are not going to show a blind eye to these things that happen,” she said. “We’re going to act. We’re going to be strong. We’re going to be loud and we’re going to do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world. ” Iran’s United Nations mission added to Mr. Zarif’s warning, issuing a Foreign Ministry statement asserting that Iranian ballistic missiles are “exclusively for legitimate defense. ” The statement said missile tests “are an integral component” of Iran’s   and that “we reject politically motivated comments regarding Iran’s missile program. ” Mr. Zarif also used the news conference on Tuesday to emphasize Iran’s anger over the Trump administration’s executive order on Friday suspending refugee admissions and prohibiting the issuance of visas to Iran and six other   countries. Mr. Zarif called the order “a shameful act. ” The order has upended the lives of thousands of Iranians, who are by far the largest population affected among the seven countries, which also include Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Iran’s government has pledged a reciprocal response to the order. Mr. Ayrault told reporters at the news conference that France had “expressed its concern” over Iran’s missile tests, according to an account by Agence  . Earlier, upon Mr. Ayrault’s arrival in Tehran, Iranian news media quoted him as saying the Trump administration’s order on refugees and visas amounted to “discrimination” and should be revoked.",0
3103,"Hillary Clinton Returns to the Campaign Trail, Vowing New Approach - The New York Times","GREENSBORO, N. C.  —   A rested Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail here on Thursday after three days of recovering at home from pneumonia, and vowed a different approach on the final stretch of the campaign, one more focused on her own positive vision for the country, rather than eviscerating her rival. “I want to close my campaign focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families,” Mrs. Clinton said after her first rally of her renewed campaign. “I want to give Americans something to vote for, not just against. ” The shift in tone felt striking after Mrs. Clinton had spent months tearing down her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump. But with less than eight weeks until Election Day and tightening polls showing a majority of voters dislike and distrust her, aides said it was imperative that Mrs. Clinton deliver a more uplifting message. “From now until Nov. 8, everywhere I go I’m going to talk about my ideas for our country,” Mrs. Clinton said. Next week, Mrs. Clinton plans speeches to discuss how she would help young people and improve the economy, weaving in her own background as an advocate for children and as a first lady focused on women and families. That focus was central in her address here at the University of North Carolina, where she took the stage to James Brown’s “I Got You (I Feel Good),” seeming rested and revived, eager to tell the audience that her rare couple of days of downtime allowed her to “reconnect with what this whole campaign is about. ” “I’m running for all mothers and fathers trying to stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, but perhaps most of all, I’m running for those kids,” she said. “Standing up for children has been the work of my life, as a lawyer for the Children’s Defense Fund, as first lady of Arkansas, in the White House. ” With just 54 days until the election, “sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,” she said. But she called the time off “a gift. ” Her return to the campaign trail comes as a series of polls suggest a closer race. Mrs. Clinton has faced a more disciplined Mr. Trump and scrutiny over her failure to initially disclose her pneumonia to all but a few close aides. A New York   News poll released on Thursday found her virtually tied with Mr. Trump among likely voters. Asked about the narrowing gap with Mr. Trump on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said, “I’ve always said this is going to be a tight race. ” On her campaign plane earlier Thursday, a   Mrs. Clinton said she felt fully recovered. “I am doing great,” she said before takeoff in White Plains, N. Y. as she made her way down the aisle. Mrs. Clinton flashed a wide smile at journalists studying her for signs of fatigue or illness and said she was looking forward to getting back into action. And at her rally later, she reflected on her time recuperating. “I talked with some old friends,” she said. “I spent time with our very sweet dogs. The campaign trail doesn’t really encourage reflection, and it’s important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. ” “People like me, we’re lucky,” she added. “When I’m under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can’t. ” Mrs. Clinton offered a rare public glimpse at her   humor, poking fun at herself for her plans that span “38 different policy areas. ” She said, “Like a lot of women, I have a tendency to overprepare. ” Mrs. Clinton did not entirely avoid criticizing Mr. Trump, telling reporters after the event, “We don’t need someone who rushes out a   plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms. ” It was a reference to the child care proposals that Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka unveiled this week. The Clinton campaign’s efforts to put forth a kinder, gentler candidate began last week with a speech that Mrs. Clinton delivered in Kansas City, Mo. on her Methodist faith. But the change in tactics hit an unexpected snag on Sunday when Mrs. Clinton abruptly left a ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Amid intense scrutiny over Mrs. Clinton’s lack of transparency over her initial diagnosis, her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, later disclosed that Mrs. Clinton had been told she had pneumonia last Friday and that she had been overheated and dehydrated on Sunday. Rather than making her case to the American people, Mrs. Clinton found herself recovering at home as her campaign confronted a series of distractions and dueling doctors’ notes from her and Mr. Trump. And she had to apologize on Saturday after a backlash over remarks she made at a Friday night   in Manhattan in which she said that half of Mr. Trump’s supporters fell into a “basket of deplorables”  —   bigots, essentially, of one sort or the other. On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton, when pressed about her handling of her diagnosis, appeared eager to put the rough patch behind her. “I didn’t want to stop,” she told reporters. “I didn’t want to quit campaigning. I certainly didn’t want to miss the   memorial. ” “It didn’t work out,” she continued. “So I got the antibiotics up and going, got the rest I needed and we’re going on from there. ”",0

3105,Comment on US Congressperson Says It’s Time For America To Disclose The Existence of Extraterrestrials by Anonymous: World War 3 Is On The Horizon (In 2016) – Collective Evolution,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Congresswoman Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick was a member of Congress for 14 years, serving Michigan’s 13th Congressional District. Early in her career, she was selected to serve on the Defense Sub-Committee of Appropriations, and became the first African American to do so. This committee (on paper) has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of Defense, it’s the largest appropriations bill in the United States Federal Government. She was also a board member of the United States Air Force Academy from 2003-2007.   She has a long list of very significant accomplishments and achievements while serving as a member of Congress, and you can read about them HERE . Currently, she is the founder of and managing partner of J & A Global Partners, LLC. She had this to say about the UFO/extraterrestrial topic at the citizens hearing for disclosure last year (more information on the hearing later in the article). “We’ve all been in congress long enough to know something about this world and our country and how it operates. Everything that you’ve said here, this congressperson knows it to be true, from people we know and things we’ve done in our own lives. The President and the military, there’s always a friction there, governments or military, who has the power? I think it’s important that we work with the foreign governments, there’s been 10 or 15 already identified who have acknowledged this existence. I want to be a part of that, I want to go and I want to see, so I’m presenting myself for that, I want to do that.” Please start the video at 1:04.21 to see the statement.   Below is a statement regarding UFO technology, the propulsion systems they use and how it’s quite clear that they don’t burn any fossil fuels. At the event where these words were given, there was plenty of information presented regarding the involvement of private contractors and industry, and how some of this technology threatens those industries. Related CE Articles: FREE ENERGY “The public private partnerships that I mentioned the other day have to do it. Once upon a time this country had horse and buggies, we moved to cars and now it’s moving to something else. When you talk about oil, gas and coal, yeah that’s the money, and it’s about money and power, but who’s to say that we can’t transition so we faze out of oil, gas and coal. I don’t think the UFO issue is separate from this.” Related CE Article: The Black Budget As far as foreign governments already acknowledging this existence, it’s true. Mexico, for example, has released a number of files documenting various UFO incursions. They’ve even released video footage of military jets scrambled to take a closer look. Below are just a few examples, amongst many: “The nations of the world are currently working together in the investigation of the UFO phenomenon. There is an international exchange of data. Maybe when this group of nations acquires more precise and definite information, it will be possible to release the news to the world” – General Carlos Castro Cavero, Spanish Air Force General (1976) One case in particular I’d like to start out with is the incident over Tehran, Iran. This incident occurred on the night of September 18th, 1976. A four page U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and NSA report describes the encounter in detail. (source) (source) Furthermore, both of the pilots involved discussed the event years later. Both of the F-4 interceptor pilots reported seeing the object visually, it was also tracked on their airborne radar. Both planes experienced critical instrumentation and electronics go offline at a distance of twenty-five miles from the object. Here is an excerpt from the report: “As the F-4 approached a range of 25 nautical miles it lost all instrumentation and communications. When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. Another brightly lighted object came out of the original object. The second object headed straight toward the F4. ” (source) (source) Perhaps the most dramatic of all were two encounters that year on December 16th by the Chilean Air Force: “Two pilots on a training mission, each flying an F5 fighter aircraft, tracked the object on their airborne radar. It gave a return equal to ten or more aircraft carriers-except this object was in the air, not floating on the water. Each pilot assumed his radar equipment was faulty, until he learned that the other pilot was also getting the same return. Not only this, but ground radar from a nearby airport also picked up the object and confirmed its huge size. The pilots also saw the object with their own eyes. One pilot later said that at a distance of twenty miles, it looked “like a plantain banana swathed in smoke.” The pilots were frightened, having no missiles or weapons. As they approached the massive object, which had been motionless all this while, it took off at an unimaginable speed. All at once, it vanished from the three radar screens.”(1) Related CE Article: This Is What Happens When A UFO Is Tracked On Military Radar About The Hearing From April 29 to May 3, 2013 researchers, activists and military/agency/political witnesses representing ten countries gave testimony in Washington, DC to six former members of the United States Congress about events and evidence indicating an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race and the planet. The Citizen Hearing on Disclosure was a very large event in terms of size, scope and the involvement of former members of the US Congress. With over 30 hours of testimony from 40 witnesses over five days the event was the most concentrated body of evidence regarding the extraterrestrial subject ever presented to the press and the general public at one time.

We Are Not Alone There is an overwhelming amount of evidence suggesting that we are not alone, and this idea continues to gain more and more popularity as we move towards 2015.

3106,Donald Trump Jr.’s Skittles Tweet Fits a Pattern - The New York Times,"Donald Trump Jr.  —   a close political adviser to his father, Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president  —   posted on Twitter on Monday night an image of a white bowl full of   Skittles. The image came with this text: “If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That’s our Syrian refugee problem. ” Mr. Trump, 38, the candidate’s oldest child, then got an earful. Hillary Clinton’s campaign called the post “disgusting. ” A stream of social media users denounced it as both flippant and fearmongering, noting the infinitesimal odds of being killed in a terrorist attack by a refugee. Even the parent company of Skittles weighed in. But Mr. Trump’s comparison of men, women and children displaced by a horrific civil war to a chewy candy was hardly the first time he had been accused of poor taste. If his sister Ivanka Trump has become known for her polish and message discipline, he has distinguished himself by wading frequently into the shadowy waters of white supremacy,   incendiary language and conspiracy theories. Other political candidates and officeholders, including Hillary and Bill Clinton, have also had relatives attract unflattering attention. But rarely are those family members so central to a campaign. Donald Jr. Ivanka and Eric Trump  —   the children from the elder Mr. Trump’s first marriage, to Ivana Trump  —   all spoke at the Republican National Convention and have been key players in their father’s White House run. This month, Donald Trump Jr. invoked the Holocaust when he argued to a Philadelphia radio station that the news media gave Mrs. Clinton a pass on “every indiscrepancy. ” If Republicans had done what she had, he said, “they’d be warming up the gas chamber right now. ” (He later claimed this was a reference to capital punishment.) He recently shared a Twitter post by Kevin MacDonald, a psychologist who has written about “Jewish influence” for a website devoted to “white identity, interests and culture” and who has testified on behalf of a Holocaust denier. A few days before that, Mr. Trump shared on his Instagram account a picture showing the faces of his father, himself and several Trump supporters with Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that has been   as a mascot by the “” an informal assembly of white nationalists,   conservatives and   internet provocateurs. “A friend sent me this,” Mr. Trump wrote of the image, adding that he was “honored” to have been included in it. The Trump campaign declined to make Donald Jr. available for comment, instead releasing a statement that echoed his derision of political correctness and applauded him for speaking “the truth. ” His allies and friends came to his defense. “It’s remarkable to me to see the level of outrage about a metaphor used by Don Jr. ,” the Republican   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, said in an interview with NBC News. Todd Silverman, a friend from the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump “is not  . ” Told about the Twitter accounts Mr. Trump had echoed and his “gas chamber” remark, Mr. Silverman, who is Jewish, said only, “That is not consistent with the person I know. ” Mr. Trump and his siblings have appeared at rallies and advised their father, who has generally eschewed traditional political consultants, on strategy. The elder Mr. Trump, a   supporter, often mentions that his sons are avid hunters. Donald Jr. and Eric invited journalists to watch them hunt pheasants in Iowa before the caucuses there, and Donald Jr. once posed holding the tail of a dead elephant and other animals killed during an African safari. The siblings have also taken out big game within their father’s campaign: They pushed successfully to oust his onetime campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Donald Jr. also has a big role in the family business, as an executive vice president whose portfolio includes expanding the company’s real estate, retail, hotel and golf interests. He has also had a taste of reality stardom, appearing as an adviser on “The Celebrity Apprentice,” an iteration of his father’s hit show “The Apprentice. ” He lives with his wife and five children in New York, where he has flirted with the notion of running for mayor. “I like to keep optionality,” he said when asked on CNN if he would consider a run. The Trump campaign has called the scrutiny of his Twitter posts unfair. “We’re truly living in remarkable times,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the campaign. “The media’s run out of things to attack Mr. Trump on, and so now they scour the social media accounts of his family looking for things to blow out of proportion. ” Appearing this month on “Good Morning America,” Donald Jr. was asked by George Stephanopoulos about his use of the frog picture, which Mr. Stephanopoulos called a “  symbol of the white supremacist movement. ” “I’ve never even heard of Pepe the Frog,” Mr. Trump said. “I mean, bet you 90 percent of your viewers have never heard of Pepe the Frog. ” He added: “I thought it was a frog in a wig. I thought it was funny. ” Mr. Trump’s father has also employed his Twitter feed in ways many have found offensive. He has reposted messages from white supremacists’ accounts, and in July he posted an image of Mrs. Clinton, a pile of cash and a   star in the shape of the Star of David. He quickly deleted the post and said it was not intended to be   but he later said it should not have been deleted. Around that time, his son was retweeting   social media users. In March, Donald Jr. appeared on a radio show where one of the interviewers had had David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader now running for the Senate in Louisiana, as a guest on his affiliated show. The interviewer, James Edwards, is the host of “The Political Cesspool,” which has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “racist and  . ” Mr. Trump’s Skittles post on Monday, which drew almost 24, 000 “likes” by Tuesday afternoon, seemed almost tame by comparison. Its argument is one that many have made, sometimes using MMs, against accepting Syrian refugees, and it is consistent with the Trump campaign’s talking point that Mrs. Clinton’s more inclusive stance toward refugees threatens Americans. In a year marked by anxiety over terrorist attacks, 53 percent of respondents in an Associated Press poll in July thought the United States should allow fewer refugees to enter the country, as opposed to 11 percent who believed more should be allowed in. The Wrigley company, which makes Skittles, was careful not to take a position on the matter, though it was clearly not on board with being seen as a symbol of it. “Skittles are candy,” a company official said in a statement. “Refugees are people. We don’t feel it is an appropriate analogy. ”",0
3107,John Bolton: Left ‘Engaging in Collective Hysteria’ Because They Cannot Make ‘Substantive Arguments’ Against Trump Policies,"On Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily, former U. N. Ambassador John Bolton discussed the significance of President Trump’s apparent openness to a “ ” rather than “ ” solution for the   conflict. [“For basically the past 70 years, everybody on the Left, around the world, has insisted the only possible solution to the   conflict, and specifically with the Palestinians, is the creation of a Palestinian state,” Bolton explained. “We’ve got Israel, and then you have a state called Palestine. Now, I won’t get into the extraordinarily complicated history of this. Some would say that when the British split their mandate and created Jordan, that was a Palestinian state. ”   “But leaving all that aside, the fact is there’s nobody on the Palestinian side for the Israelis to negotiate with, other than terrorists like Hamas,” he continued. “There’s no guarantee that a Palestinian authority could keep up a state that wasn’t a home for terrorists. And there’s, frankly, no prospect in the near term that a Palestinian state would do anything for its own people, that it could simply not be economically viable. ”  “The idea of a   solution comes in a variety of forms, but it absolutely violates the   theological doctrine that there must be a Palestinian state. So for Trump to say, ‘I could live with a   solution, I could live with a   solution’ blows up about 70 years of orthodoxy,” he said.  “Of all the disruptive things he’s done in Washington in just one month, that could be the most disruptive of all,” Bolton proclaimed. “It just sends a signal all around the world that really the persecution of Israel that we’ve seen, unfortunately, in many European countries, in the U. N. for sure, is going to meet some fierce resistance from this president. ” SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan wondered if Trump signaled a willingness to accept a   solution as a negotiating tactic  —   a means of prodding the Palestinian leadership into pursuing more realistic goals. “It’s possible,” Bolton replied. “And he did say, ‘Look, I could live with a   solution if the parties agree to it.’ That part  —   that ultimately peace in the Middle East has to come from an agreement between the parties to the conflict it cannot be imposed from the outside  —   is critical. It happens to be accurate. That’s how Camp David occurred in 1979, the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. It’s how peace was reached between Israel and Jordan. ”  “The   solution really is an outside imposition on Israel, based in the view of many. So he’s really saying, ‘I’m going to leave it to the parties.’ If they were to come up with a   solution  —   in other words, as you suggest, if the Palestinians got politically accountable, democratically elected leadership, foreswore terrorism, accepted the existence of Israel as a state, and were prepared to negotiate boundaries that would give Israel security  —   yeah, it’s possible. I think it’s unlikely,” he said. “There’s an old saying: putting the cat among the pigeons. Boy, I’m telling you, the cat’s among the pigeons today,” Bolton remarked. Stranahan asked for Bolton’s grade on the Trump administration’s handling of   from Iran and North Korea. “I think when Prime Minister Abe of Japan was with the president, the North Koreans, as you say their act of provocation was firing a   ballistic missile into the Sea of Japan. Abe said that’s unacceptable. Trump said we’re 100 percent behind our ally Japan. I think he could have gone beyond that. He could have talked about South Korea. He could have talked about the threat to us, frankly,” Bolton said. “But I think it was a pretty clear signal. Secretary of Defense Mattis was just in the region, visited Japan and South Korea, very clear about our opposition to the North Koreans. So the rhetoric, all very good, but we’ve got to get the specifics. We’ve got to pressure China in ways that we haven’t under Obama, even under the prior Bush administration. I think this is a huge threat because it’s not only North Korea’s capacity to deliver a ballistic missile to the West Coast of the United States with a nuclear warhead, possibly in the next few years, according to our own military commanders in South Korea  —   but they’re cooperation with Iran on missiles and likely on nuclear programs, as well,” he warned. “The first thing that has to be dealt with, with Iran, is this wretched nuclear deal that Obama cut with them,” Bolton argued. “Before he was fired, Mike Flynn went out  —   I think the president’s instruction  —   and said he was putting Iran on notice that their ballistic missile testing was unacceptable. We’re going to have to come to a decision very soon, I wish we had done it already, to junk the Obama nuclear deal with Iran, which I don’t think the ayatollahs are complying with to begin with. I’m sure in the conversations between Trump and Netanyahu yesterday, how to deal with Iran was right at the top of the agenda, as it should be. ” Bolton judged that President Trump is “doing fine on national security matters. ” “He’s doing even better than that, frankly, on domestic matters,” he added. “But the Left is engaged in collective hysteria. I had an article in the Daily Telegraph in London on Tuesday  —   I should have published it in the United States!  —   to say there’s no basis for this hysteria, let alone the drive by the New York Times and the Washington Post and others to convict half of the administration for cooperating with Russia in hacking the 2016 election, which I think is their objective. ”  “There’s no evidence of any of that activity. I think the New York Times admitted as much yesterday,” he pointed out. “But you’ve got people absolutely going over the moon about how dangerous this is. What is the purpose of all this hysteria about the   cooperation with Russia, the hysteria about foreign policy, the hysteria about the cabinet nominees. The purpose of the hysteria is just to make people hysterical. It’s like shaking a tree to see what else will fall out of it. ”  “They don’t have anything else. They’re not making substantive arguments. They’re looking for embarrassments and mistakes that they can then use to pillory the administration. We’re in a period of maximum turbulence, only one month into the administration. It’s really pretty unprecedented,” he argued. “I think it requires everybody in the White House  —   just the slogan the British had in World War II: ‘Keep Calm and Carry On.’ That’s what they need to do. Don’t get distracted by all of this. Just keep your eye on the prize and keep moving,” Bolton advised. Stranahan asked Bolton for his assessment of the threat Russia poses to the United States today. “I think you have to look at this not as to whether today the Russians are going to attack us, or even tomorrow, but what the   geopolitical risks are from a Russia under an authoritarian state  —   rebuilding its military, enhancing its ballistic missiles, adding to its arsenal of nuclear weapons, crossing international boundaries in Europe with military force, annexing part of the Ukraine, threatening other Eastern and Central European countries, increasing its influence in the Middle East, and cooperating with China” was Bolton’s highly detailed reply. He gave an example of the latter concern: Russia’s conducting naval maneuvers with China in the Eastern Mediterranean. “Is that behavior threatening to the United States over the long term? Yes,” he said. “The essence of statesmanship is not waiting around for a threat to be existential. It’s preventing the threat from developing to that point early on. So I do think Russia’s a problem, and I think it needs to be dealt with very strongly. ” Bolton said such a strong response would cover “the Ukraine sanctions and what to do about NATO and how to handle Russia in the Middle East because they are very extensively involved in a variety of theaters. ” “The notion that somehow the Russians have become benign is just wrong,” he declared. “They went through a period of democracy in the 1990s. They struggled with it. They’ve moved out of democracy, back into authoritarianism. This is an object lesson that history doesn’t always move in a   direction. We’ve got to deal with that. It’s not an ideological threat, but it is a classic nineteenth century power whose interests are widely different from those of the United States. ” Stranahan followed up by asking if the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton State Department had ‘created opportunities for Russia to become even more of a threat.’ “Absolutely,” said Bolton. “They wanted to press the famous ‘reset button.’ They thought the problems with Russia had been caused by the Bush administration. The Russians took advantage of them repeatedly by getting us to dismantle our national missile defense capabilities on Poland and the Czech Republic, agreeing to the   New START arms control treaty  —   a really terrible agreement from the U. S. point of view  —   and on and on and on. ”  “They took advantage of Obama’s weakness. They did it for eight straight years,” he charged. “And the big advantage of the Trump presidency is, I think, he’s demonstrated, just in the first four weeks, is that he projects a strong America. That will get Putin’s attention. We actually have a better opportunity to form a cooperative relationship with Russia, at least on a few issues, because they perceive America now has a strong leader, rather than a weak one like Obama. ” John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and presides over his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

3109,ICE Officers Surrounded by New Yorkers Trying to Protect Alleged Criminal Alien,"Immigration officers called the New York City Police Department for backup after a group of local residents surrounded them in an apparent attempt to interfere with the arrest of a criminal alien. [Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) officers working in Queens arrested    Hardat Sampat. The Guyanese national is accused of burglary and illegal   after removal, according to a report by the New York Daily News. As officers took the foreign national into custody, his wife began to plead for his arrest, attracting the attention of others nearby.  More than 30 local residents surrounded the officers and began shouting at them, attempting to stop the arrest. Officers called New York police officers to assist them controlling the crowd. The sanctuary New York City Department of Correction (NYCDOC) released Sampat from custody despite an immigration detainer being put in place by U. S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) officials, according to an official ICE statement reported by PIX11 News. ICE stated Sampat has multiple pending charges with the Queens County Criminal Court. Sampat had been a passenger in a vehicle when officers began to make the arrest. In an attempt to interfere with the arrest the ICE officers, his wife reportedly moved the car to block traffic, NBC4 New York reported. Responding NYPD officers instructed the driver to move the vehicle and clear the roadway. The driver complied with the police order. ICE officers quickly left the scene with Sampat in custody. Officers transported the Guyanese national to the Manhattan Federal Court for processing, the New York Daily News reported. He is expected to be held at an immigration detention facility in New Jersey, relatives told reporters. Reports indicate Sampat allegedly burglarized the home of a    woman he knew on April 9. He allegedly broke into her home a second time and vandalized the home with white spray paint. ICE officers arrested him as he attempted to go to a court hearing on the cases. Since a February announcement by New York City Police Commissioner James O’Neill that his officers would no longer cooperate with ICE officials attempt to arrest criminal aliens, the agency has ignored more than 130 immigration detainers and released the criminals onto the streets of New York. This number is as of the April 7 ICE Declined Detainer Outcome Report. The report has since been paused pending adjustments to the data gathering methodology. Late last week, ICE officers arrested a registered sex offender the NYCDOC released, despite an immigration detainer issued by ERO officers, Breitbart Texas reported. “It is unfortunate that we continue to arrest convicted criminals off the street simply because the city refuses to honor detainers and releases them back into our communities,” New York ERO Field Officer Director Thomas R. Decker said. “Each time an officer is forced to pick up someone who could have safely been turned over it puts the officers’ safety, as well as the safety of the neighborhoods we serve, at risk. ICE strives to strengthen its relationships with local law enforcement entities in the interest of public safety. ” Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Every ethnic group except whites bloc-votes for the Democrats. Coincidentally, the Democrats have brought in another 30 to 40 million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades. 
It doesn’t help that white voters can’t agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate. In 2012, working-class whites sat out the election, rather than vote for the out-of-touch rich guy they saw in Mitt Romney. This year, the out-of-touch rich guys say they’ll vote for Hillary because Trump is tacky and gross. 
The sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats – the top .01 percent. The rest of us will be their servants. 
The people who will be worse off are everybody else – the working class, the middle class (who will soon be working class) and, most of all, women, minorities, children, the elderly, the weakest and most vulnerable members of society. 
Look to Mexico for your future – or any Third World country. Or to Univision’s Jorge Ramos. The ruling class in Mexico is composed of European-looking, white descendants of Spanish conquistadors who raped the native population, giving them only their Spanish names in return. (British settlers in America brought women with them.) 
Explaining Latino culture’s acceptance of incest and child rape, criminal justice researcher Shana Maier writes in a book about rape that “the male is the head of the household, and women are subordinate to men. … Hispanics and Latinos are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to blame the victim. The victim, not the perpetrator, is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family.” 
One American detective said that, today, police are being taught to keep an “open mind” about child rape because “it’s a cultural thing.” 
When it comes to multiculturalism, you can’t say, We love the empanadas – but we don’t want 40-year-old men raping their nieces . This isn’t an a la carte menu. We get ALL the attributes of the cultures we’re importing. 
As described in excruciating detail in “Adios, America: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole,” our media already have a totally “open mind” about incest and child rape – and murder! – when it’s committed by immigrants. 
Thus, for example, where I would have chosen the headline: “Illegal Alien Convicted of Incest, Child Rape,” the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times Free Press went with the less catchy: “Man guilty in case of human smuggling.” 
And where I would have used the headline, “Illegal Alien Repeatedly Raped 14-year-old Girl at Job Site,” the Commercial Dispatch in Columbus, Mississippi, went with the more subtle, “Columbus resident charged with molestation.” 
Immigrant women arrive in America, thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape, incest and spousal murder are acceptable, only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country, too – provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled. 
In 1989, Brooklyn Judge Edward Pincus sentenced a Chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife, on the grounds that the murder flowed from “traditional Chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood.” The female head of the Asian-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Margaret Fung, applauded the ruling. 
Somewhat amazingly, newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime. (Anything to keep the Third World immigration flowing!) 
In 2013, a 13-year-old girl was gang-raped by about a dozen illegal aliens, who cheered and videoed the attack. 
When the news first broke, Shaneequa Jupiter, who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred, complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger. (That could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants!) 
Even if Shaneequa had scoured the headlines, she would have been on the lookout for “Austin men.” Or “Two.” 
Compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack: 
– “Two held in attack on child” – Austin American-Statesman (Texas), July 19, 2013 
– “Two Mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over five-day gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack” – Daily Mail Online, July 24, 2013 
Needless to say, the New York Times did not cover the Mexican illegal-alien gang rape at all. 
The ultimate primer on the “blue-collar billionaire”— order Ann Coulter’s book “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” 
By contrast, the Times, and every major American news outlet, extensively covered another gang rape – of a girl about the same age, at about the same time, in about the same place. 
The second case only was “rape” because of the girl’s young age – she was 11. But she was an enthusiastic participant, sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex. 
Those rapes, just a few years earlier, got a full-court press. The defendants were African-American. The victim was Mexican. 
That time, there were articles in the Huffington Post, GQ, Slate, Salon and Mother Jones. It even made the New York Times, despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team. 
Similarly, within a few months of one another in 2013, two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in Decatur, Alabama, for assaults on 9-year-old girls. One suspect was African-American, the other was a Hispanic immigrant. Only one made the newspaper. Guess which one? 
When excitable Muslims raped American reporter Lara Logan in Tahrir Square (another one of Hillary’s foreign policy successes!), journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the Muslim rapists to white American men. 
Conclusion: The real problem was the female reporters’ American bosses and colleagues. (Definitely not Islam!) 
Sampling of New York Times commentary on Logan’s rape: 
– “Why We Need Women in War Zones” (“I would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened. … This attack also had nothing to do with Islam.”) 
– “Reporting While Female” (“Women reporters face another set of challenges. We are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not. … In my experience, Muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment.”) 
Perhaps American men could do better, but, as American women may soon discover: They never had it so good. 
Manifestly, the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help Americans – or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like America. They are designed to funnel welfare-dependent voters to the Democrats and cheap labor to the rich. (The Chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife, for example, came to America based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher.) 
Our country will be Zimbabwe, but – if all goes according to the Democrats’ plan – they’ll get to be Mugabe! 
That’s Hillary’s dream. If she wins, Joe Sobran’s parody of the typical New York Times headline (about anything) will come true: “Women and Minorities Hit Hardest.” Receive Ann Coulter's weekly commentaries in your email BONUS: By signing up for Ann Coulter’s alerts, you will also be signed up for news and special offers from WND via email.

3111,A George Carlin Special Too Raw After Sept. 11 Resurfaces Now - The New York Times,"On Sept. 10, 2001, George Carlin, the greatest political comic in history if measured only by   specials, recorded a bracing hour of social commentary for his new HBO special. The next day, he shelved it. It wasn’t only the title, “I Kinda Like It When a Lotta People Die,” that seemed in bad taste after nearly 3, 000 people were killed a day later in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Carlin also told a joke about a fart so potent it blew up an airplane. “You know who gets blamed? Osama bin Laden,” Mr. Carlin joked. “The F. B. I. is looking for explosives. They should be looking for minute traces of rice and bok choy. ” If timing is everything, Mr. Carlin had nothing. Fifteen years later, his lost special is finally being released. (It is on Sirius XM, though it will be for sale as a download or on CD or vinyl on Sept. 16, at Amazon and iTunes, among other outlets.) It will be a revelation for comedy fans nostalgic for the days when you could expect a series of articulate salvos from Mr. Carlin about every two years. This special is not bonus track material. It’s a polished hour of new jokes with a virtuosic centerpiece, an intricate and elusive nearly   story that inspired its title, firmly in the tradition of Mr. Carlin’s comedy but also a fascinating departure. Mr. Carlin, who died in 2008, had always been a   comic whose skepticism of government would be right at home with the Tea Party. In a 1999 special, he even ridiculed airport security as a pointless charade, saying Americans are “always willing to trade away a little of their freedom” in exchange for “the illusion of security. ” But like so many other people, he was transformed by Sept. 11. He released an entirely new special only two months after the attack  —   “Complaints and Grievances”  —   in which he talks more about survival than freedom, setting up one premise by saying that dire events call for us to cooperate with “unsavory people” like George W. Bush. Mr. Carlin’s more tentative attitude toward the government is a reminder of the anxiety about even doing comedy after Sept. 11. All the     hosts went off the air for days. Multiple journalists wrote eulogies for irony and there was a sense among some that it was almost unseemly to respond to the attack in cultural terms. Today, we have a more accelerated news coverage and politicized comedy scene. No one canceled a   show after the June attack on a nightclub in Orlando, Fla. and the sober way   hosts speak after national tragedies has hardened into something like ritual, a part of the job. In “I Kinda Like It,” Mr. Carlin addressed mass killings in a way that seemed on the surface out of touch with the tragedy that followed. In a cavalier tone, he says that he enjoys news of disasters the way a sports fan raves about seeing breaking records. An earthquake, he says in an   accent, “put up some really big numbers,” adding that he’s “always rooting for a really high death toll. ” While this can seem like cheap provocation compared with his more famous bits, like the one inveighing against the seven words you can’t say on television, gleefully imagining mass destruction had been a regular part of his   for years. “I watch television news for one thing only  —   entertainment,” he said in “Jammin’ in New York,” his 1992 special. “My favorite thing is accidents and fires. I’m not interested in the budget. You show me a hospital on fire and I’m a happy guy. ” What Mr. Carlin is doing here is satirizing American blood lust, bringing to the surface the impulse that makes professional wrestling and crime stories so popular. As he put it more bluntly in 1992, “At least I admit it. ” “I Kinda Like It” adds a more baroque voice to this satire of our dark, repressed thrills. After saying that he enjoys the excitement of people dying, then comparing massacres and natural disasters in the voice of a demented sociopath, Mr. Carlin imagines the apex of calamity, putting every disaster movie to shame. His dizzyingly dense story includes flood, power failure, traffic jams, global warming, cholera, typhoid fever and a conflagration that wipes out North America. And then things go really bad. Shifting into a cosmically fantastical mode, Mr. Carlin imagines this disaster leading to the breakdown of the molecular structure of the atmosphere and changing the laws of nature. Burning clouds of flaming rain fly upward, the moon explodes and the dead return to life. There’s a literary quality to the grotesque and often surreal imagery of this story (Mr. Carlin developed material in performance but began on the page) leaving behind punch lines and aiming for an almost metaphysical sense of the absurd in which people are inconsequential specks in a vast Lovecraftian universe. What really distinguishes this from Mr. Carlin’s previous work is that it becomes totally unhinged from logic. He was nothing if not a rigorous thinker, who made you laugh by finding his way through arguments that led to outrageous conclusions like his brief against the sanctity of life, zeroing in on exceptions (“Doesn’t apply to cancer cells, does it? You rarely see a bumper sticker that says ‘Save the Tumors’”) while arguing that it’s really driven by the   of the living. But in “I Kinda Like It,” his arguments gradually unravel, deconstruct and are interrupted by supernatural details and then pure nonsense. What begins as satire devolves into madness, culminating in a nightmarish dinner party attended by bitter, resentful zombies, all named Uncle Dave. At the end of this parade of catastrophes, these bitter men gather around a table and spew resentments about their children, parents, the government and minorities. Their disgust spins out of them into what Mr. Carlin describes as a swirling “pool of hate” that expands beyond the universe and explodes in a kind of second big bang. The new world that emerges is utopian, and every Uncle Dave wins the lottery every week. Out of disaster comes nirvana. This operatic yarn is less argumentative than most of Mr. Carlin’s bits, more open to interpretation. One way to see it, though, is as a sendup of the terrorist   that led to the attack on the World Trade Center and other sites that day, a biting take on an extremist view that imagines that a twisted form of deliverance will come from violence and hate. Seen from a certain angle, a story once too provocative to release might be the perfect example of comedy in the  . 11 world.",0
3112,Shapiro Eviscerates Raucous Protesters At University Of Wisconsin | Daily Wire,"Shapiro Eviscerates Raucous Protesters At University Of Wisconsin By: Hank Berrien November 16, 2016 
Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro spoke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on Wednesday night, and amid raucous leftist protesters who consistently tried to interrupt him and even blocked him from being seen by the audience by creating a human wall in front of him, found a way to respond with hilarious repartee that left the audience howling and the protesters eventually filing meekly out of the auditorium. 
After the ovation he received on entering, Shapiro quipped, “Hey look at this. A campus that doesn’t actually try to arrest me when I come.” He continued, “Before I begin, I did come bearing gifts for the social justice warriors in this room. I hear you’ve started wearing these safety pins around because you want to show your fellow college students how you’re not one of these awful, terrible Trump people, that you’re sensitive, and that you want to signal your virtue, so I’ve brought along these safety pins, (holding up safety pins) and I also brought you something to wear them with – this diaper."" 
Shapiro then held up a diaper, prompting huge laughs from the audience. 
When a protester yelled at Shapiro that he should be “wearing a swastika,” Shapiro held out his yarmulke, then fired back, “In case you hadn’t noticed, the folks with the swastikas aren’t too nice to my type.” 
Shapiro continued, “Stop being self-indulgent children; stop pretending that everybody who voted for Trump is a vicious racist; it’s your right to protest, of course, but you just make yourself look like an idiot when you cry over a duly-held election … Donald Trump doesn’t care about your protest. Donald Trump is sitting somewhere in Trump Tower eating a steak and bathing in your salty, salty tears.” 
Referring to the attempt by leftists to prevent people who weren’t university students from attending Shapiro’s lecture, Shapiro opined: “I hear that a lot of folks at this publicly-funded university want this campus to become a sanctuary campus for illegal immigrants. I do have a quick question: if this campus can be a sanctuary for people in the country illegally, why are so many people trying to ban American citizens from this community from coming to this lecture? And by the way, I’m aware of this private Facebook page titled ‘F(***) White Supremacy: Interrupting Ben Shapiro.' With all due respect, ‘F’ you right back, gang.” 
After the applause subsided and Shapiro joked about how both Black Lives Mater and the KKK target him, the real fun began. Protesters stood up, chanting, “Shame” over and over again. 
Shapiro quipped, “Wow, it’s like Game of Thrones . Should I get undressed and walk down the aisle?” 
The bulk of the crowd started booing the protesters. Shapiro addressed the protesters, saying, “I’m happy to talk with you,” but they responded by screaming “safety” over and over. Shapiro joked, “Did somebody fart?” The crowd responded to the protesters by chanting, “USA.” 
Shapiro replied, “I tell you try not to be children; the first thing you do is start screaming like my two-year-old.” He added, “You see, this is how conservatives actually treat people; you stand up and you interrupt and you shout ‘Safety,” and you’re perfectly safe. Look at that. It’s amazing.” That provoked sustained applause. 
When the protesters started screaming “Shame” again, Shapiro eviscerated them, pointing out, “If you’re going to pick a chant like ‘Shame,’ watch Game of Thrones first. The bad guys shout ‘Shame.’” The audience loved that line. On a roll, Shapiro continued, “You’re not changing anybody’s mind, All you’re showing everybody is that your collective IQ, if it were channeled into electricity, night be able to toast a piece of bread lightly.” 
He continued, “Okay, can we talk now, or are you going to keep shouting? Now’s your chance to get it out. Let’s hear your feelings. C’mon. Just go for it. Or is it going to be like every thirty seconds; like an annoying microwave timer?” 
When the protesters resumed chanting, Shapiro responded, “If you guys want to talk, we can talk, If you want to shout, get the hell out.” More applause. 
Shapiro fired, “For God's sake, at least wait until I say something that offends you before getting offended."" 
Shapiro returned to deconstructing the term “social justice.” When the protesters started again, a woman who runs a soup kitchen stood up, and admonished the protesters that she had driven for ten hours that day, and that they should “shut freaking up and listen to the man speak.” That prompted a standing ovation from the crowd and Shapiro. too. He added, “See, that’s what a decent, hard-working person sounds like as opposed to a loser student here on the public dime, presumably.” 
Shapiro returned to his speech: “Racial diversity doesn’t mean anything; decency means everything … Diversity isn’t our strength; decency is our strength.” He turned to the protesters: Remember that? Decency.” 
The protesters screamed back, “Shame!” Shapiro fired back, “Decency!” The protesters chanted “Shame” but the crowd soon joined Shapiro in chanting “Decency,” shutting the protesters up. 
As Shapiro spoke of the falsity of “white privilege,” the protesters formed a line in front of Shapiro, prompting him to quip, “If you guys are all going to come up here, can we all just have circle time or something?” 
The protesters chanted “Safety” for a minute and a half, but then the crowd started yelling back, “Free speech matters.” Shapiro turned to the blackboard behind him and wrote in capital letters, “MORONS” That again prompted cheering. 
One member of the audience yelled to the protesters, “At least tell us what you want, or otherwise, just get out!” That brought a sustained ovation. 
After one protester tried to deliver a whiny monologue, the protesters started shouting “Safety” again, then filed out, yelling “F*** white supremacy” while flipping off Shapiro and the entire audience. That prompted the crowd to sing, “Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, good-bye.” It also promoted this from Shapiro: 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door. 
After Shapiro explained why the protesters had not been arrested, as the university stated that it gave the protesters time to protest at the front of the stage, or otherwise it would have to shut down the entire event, he continued, “All I can wonder is if the administration would allow the same sort of privilege for any sort of conservative who decided to do this at a leftist event.” 
Even after leaving the lecture hall, protestors continued to pound on the door, prompting Shapiro to quip, “Doesn’t this school give homework? Does anybody have a job around here? I guess when you’re majoring in gender and diversity studies you have a lot of time on your hands.” 
Shapiro noted that he had engaged in a back-and-forth with one of the protesters, who accused him of being a white supremacist. When he asked her why she thought so, she replied that she got that impression from his image. He fired back, “Really? Was it the yarmulke that did it for you?” 
He took another shot at the protesters during the speech, noting that people were born unequal, and adding, “Some people us are born rich; some of us are born poor; some of us are born smart; some of us are born protesters.” 
The rest of the speech was vintage Shapiro, as was the Q&A afterward. Even the chalk was impressive: 
Went back to the lecture hall and grabbed the EXACT piece of chalk @benshapiro used to write MORONS! #FactsNotFeelings #onlyatYAF pic.twitter.com/W0Ch06SaGR — Japheth Patterson (@japhood) November 17, 2016

3113,"Hillary, Trump and Sartre: How Existentialism Disrobes the Major Presidential Candidates","Email 
In the US, the political system has now disgorged two candidates the citizenry cannot be less enthusiastic about. Driven by ambition more than a love of the people or a sincere desire to serve, one can be forgiven for wondering if they are just as trapped by their motivations as the public in its two-party myopia. No authentic leader among the two … 
These thoughts lead to the rage of my youth, existentialism, and to Jean-Paul Sartre, who died 36 years ago last April. More than 50,000 mourners lined the streets and packed Montparnasse cemetery at his funeral, many quite young — improbable they would exhibit a similar interest in the successor philosophies, notably the current preoccupation with deconstruction, a focus on whether the written or spoken word is successful (or not) in clarity of meaning. 
Difficult as existentialism may be to pin down, there are a few necessary elements: the individual, free will as crucial to human existence, the subsequent responsibility for action that accompanies it, leading to an unavoidable anxiety as a consequence. The authentic life then is one chosen freely rather than imposed by society. No wonder it appealed to the young. 
What triggered this meandering into Sartre and his philosophy was Hillary Clinton’s two-minute summing up at the end of the last debate. She attested to her lifelong concern (her latest claim) for improving the lives of children — a phrase bringing to mind a balancing scale. One one side the improved lives of children in Arkansas and the benefits of subsidies to children in general, and on the other the deaths of hundreds of thousands in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere — the most vulnerable that is the old, the sick and the children bearing the brunt. Politicians are a breed apart, unconcerned with ‘responsibility’ and undisturbed by Sartre’s ‘anxiety’. 
Not so long ago there was another US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who, when asked about the 576,000 children who had died (according to a UN report) as a result of the Iraq embargo, simply dismissed the question as a price to be paid to be rid of Saddam Hussein. The embargo failed in that regard, and when Saddam was removed by the successor US government’s military intervention, it resulted in chaos and the birth of ISIS. 
The Republican candidate, Donald Trump, is unique, in that responsibility washes over him and into the shower drain like a layer of dirt; he is devoid of it even in personal interaction. The only rational explanation of his behavior is the term ‘prolonged adolescence’ used by professionals. 
His basic issue over several decades has been bad deals — bad deals in defending allies who he feels do not pay enough for their defense and bad trade deals. Trying to peel off some voters, Hillary Clinton in the last debate pointed out that he took out an ad in The New York Times opposing the right’s iconic Ronald Reagan over it. Like any business owner or high level executive, he intends to issue orders expecting them to be carried out. Good luck! It might explain the absence of concrete policy. 
The American public has been short changed into picking either the lesser of two evils, casting a protest vote with the minor left or right party, or just sitting this election out. 
Sartre offered personal bliss in the few post-war years of hope and promise before America’s fear of ideologies and overweening sense of power plunged us into successive wars punctuated with interludes of peace. The wars continue, bleeding the country of an estimated $5 trillion in the present cycle … the death and destruction the worst since the Second World War.",0
3114,Chernobyl’s Silent Exclusion Zone (Except for the Logging) - The New York Times,"PRIPYAT, Ukraine  —   The road through the forest, abandoned, is at times barely discernible, covered with the debris of fallen tree limbs, vines, leaves and moss pushing up through cracks in the crumbling asphalt. The moss is best avoided, says our guide, Artur N. Kalmykov, a young Ukrainian who has made a hobby of coming here to the exclusion zone surrounding the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, set aside in perpetuity after the catastrophe in 1986. It can be radioactive, having carried buried radiation to the surface as it grew. Above all, he says, watch out for windblown dust, which could well be laced with deadly plutonium. Despite the dangers  —   which are actually minimal these days, except when the wind is howling  —   and the risk of arrest, Mr. Kalmykov is at home here. “In Kiev my head is full,” he said. “Here I can relax. I could hang out in Kiev. But this is more interesting. ” What Mr. Kalmykov and fellow unofficial explorers of the Chernobyl zone, members of a peculiar subculture who are in their 20s and call themselves “the stalkers,” have found is more interesting still: vast tracts of   in the ostensibly protected forest. Mr. Kalmykov, a computer programmer who discovered the   areas while exploring the zone on his weekends, took his findings to Stop Corruption, one of the civil society groups that popped up in Ukraine after the Maidan revolution two years ago, events supposed to usher in a new era of clean government in Ukraine. And yet on Ukraine’s dirtiest patch of land, Stop Corruption says, based on the stalkers’ evidence, the    dealings of the bureaucrats who manage the area are flourishing as always. Distracted by the 30th anniversary of the catastrophe on April 26 and the general turmoil in Ukraine, the group says, the Exclusion Zone Management Agency has turned a blind eye to the Chernobyl logging. The Zone of Alienation, as it is also known, is a rough circle with an   radius, fenced off with barbed wire. Access is strictly controlled, so that delegations and guided tours typically travel a few fixed routes. Outside those areas frequented by tourists, Stop Corruption said, under the guise of salvage logging of trees killed in wildfires, healthy pines are being felled in great numbers for sale in Ukraine and Romania, from where the timber may be resold throughout Europe. “We thought these incidents were isolated and unimportant, but when we started to investigate, it turned out the problem was gigantic and systemic,” said Vadim V. Vnukov, the group’s head lawyer. Lumber from Chernobyl, while not exactly glowing in the dark, would pose risks to anybody living in a house made from it, Mr. Vnukov said. “There is a clear health risk here,” he said. “We ran into a system worked out over the decades, and under any government, this system of corruption was preserved. ” Today, scientists say, the average radiation level in the zone is about a quarter as harmful to human health as it was in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and fire. A typical reading in the zone is about 100 microsieverts per hour, or comparable to the exposure that an airplane passenger might receive on a   flight. But harmful risks lurk. Placed near the moss, for example, a Geiger counter hummed like an electric shaver. “It’s not as dangerous as it seems,” Mr. Kalmykov said with a shrug. “Some people are just radiophobic. ” In an interview in his offices in Kiev, Vitalii V. Petruk, the head of the Exclusion Zone Management Agency, denied that any illegal logging had taken place since he assumed the job in September. But since the revolution, he is the fifth director of the zone, which like the rest of Ukraine has been in a state of flux. Loggers fell burned trees after forest fires, to avoid pest outbreaks, and cut firebreaks and routes for electrical wires, he said. Since 2004, it has been legal in Ukraine to sell timber from the zone if it passes radiological controls. Mr. Petruk is an unabashed advocate of increased commercial activity in the zone, including logging. “How do we turn our shame into our advantage?” he said. His answer is “Zone of Change,” a proposal by his agency for increased logging to feed a   steam power plant at the site that he noted would reduce dependence on Russian natural gas. Into this landscape recently, one careful step after another, Mr. Kalmykov pushed deeper into a thicket of vines and fallen branches. (To show reporters sites where he suspected illegal logging activity, Mr. Kalmykov and all in his party obtained permits to visit the zone, in contrast to his usual practice of slipping in to explore surreptitiously.) At an abandoned house on the roadside, with the rhythmic chirp of a Geiger counter in the background and moldy children’s clothes lying about, an eerie sense arose of a sneak preview of the end of the world. The concept of the exclusion zone, an important experiment for the nuclear industry, was to limit, through isolation, the lethality of an accident at the nuclear plant. (Fewer than 200 people stayed here after the evacuation of more than 100, 000.) Radioactive elements degrade at predictable intervals, called   that can vary enormously. Particles left in the soil while their   tick past harm nobody the average particle   at Chernobyl is about 30 years. But logging in a postapocalyptic forest would pose a number of health concerns. Trees, like moss, absorb radiation from the subsoil. Also,   churns up soil, stirring radioactive dust and accelerating erosion. At one point along the road, the forest opens to a   area of several acres, sliced into healthy pine groves, though near a burned patch. “Look, they didn’t touch the dead trees,” Mr. Kalmykov said, pointing to the still standing, blackened pines. “During the change in government, nobody was paying attention, and people didn’t miss this moment” to make some money, he said of the loggers. “Everybody knows. The necessary people get the necessary money. ” A logger, his sweaty face flecked with dust and sawdust, said he simply cut the trees marked by his bosses at the exclusion zone administration. “I don’t decide,” said the man, who declined to give his name. “They say we don’t need the burned logs. ” Asked if he worried about radiation, he said he did not, as by now the radiation had settled deep into the soil. “We stamp it down so it does not come out,” he said, patting the ground with his boot. “Want to buy some wood?”",0
3115,Obama Commutes Life Sentences of Four Mexican Cartel Leaders,"ROMA, Texas  —   Four family members who ran one of the largest cartel smuggling operations in south Texas had their life in prison sentences commuted and will likely be returning to this border city from where they ran their criminal empire. One of the main destinations that the criminal organizations delivered drugs to was Chicago, Illinois. [This week, outgoing President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of 209 convicted criminals and pardoned 64 others. The majority of the convictions were from drug trafficking or production offenses.   Four of those convicted criminals who had been sentenced to life in prison will be released by May 17. They ran a criminal organization made up of close to 80 men and women who worked with Mexico’s Gulf Cartel to move between 100, 000 to almost 750, 000 pounds of marijuana into the U. S. during a   period. The drugs were moved into Houston and then distributed to Atlanta, Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas. According to court records obtained by Breitbart Texas, brothers Cesar Moreno Sr. Eduardo Moreno, Lazaro Moreno, and Luis Moreno along with other relatives and friends had been at the helm of a   drug distribution operation based out of the border city of Roma, Texas.  The area has long been one of he main distribution lines used by Mexico’s Gulf Cartel to get large quantities of marijuana into the U. S. due to the remoteness of the area, lacking physical barriers, and police resources —  not to mention the complicity of various law enforcement officials.  In the case of the Moreno brothers, the groups invested heavily in real state and the used car business to launder millions in drug proceeds.

The fierce offensive on western Aleppo city launched by armed opposition groups on 28 October has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas that cannot be justified as a way to break the relentless siege that has sparked a humanitarian crisis in eastern Aleppo, Amnesty International said. 
Up to 48 people including 17 children have been killed in civilian areas of government-controlled western Aleppo since the offensive began, according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights. The goal of breaking the siege on eastern Aleppo does not give armed opposition groups a license to flout the rules of international humanitarian law by bombarding civilian neighbourhoods in government-held areas without distinction Samah Hadid, Deputy Director of Campaigns at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office 
“Armed opposition groups have displayed a shocking disregard for civilian lives. Video footage shows they have used imprecise explosive weapons including mortars and Katyusha rockets, whose use in the vicinity of densely populated civilian areas flagrantly violates international humanitarian law. Armed opposition groups must end all attacks that fail to distinguish between military targets and civilians.” 
On 30 October an alleged “toxic gas” attack took place in al-Hamdaniyeh and al-Assad areas of western Aleppo causing dozens of injuries according to the Syrian state news agency SANA. 
“Chemical weapons are internationally banned and their use is a war crime. Such weapons cause immense suffering and health damage.

3117,Re: Dem Group Files Complaint Against FBI For Interfering With Election,"Email 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint Friday against FBI Director James Comey with the Department of Justice, alleging interference with the 2016 presidential election. 
The coalition, an arm of the Keep America Great PAC, filed the complaint with the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, after Comey announced to Congress that because of new emails discovered on Huma Abedin’s electronic devices relevant to the Hillary Clinton email investigation, the agency would review those emails and assess their relevancy to the investigation. 
For Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, the announcement is evidence that Comey, a registered Republican, is attempting to undermine Clinton’s chances of taking the White House. 
“It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” Dworkin said in a statement. “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump has filed numerous complaints with federal agencies about figures connected to the 2016 election. 
On Monday, the group filed a complaint with the FBI against Donald Trump himself for allegedly violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In other words, the group thinks Trump has called for voter intimidation and suppression on a national level. 
Earlier in October, the group also filed a complaint against the Trump campaign and political strategist Roger Stone, saying both were involved with WikiLeaks and also a “foreign government” behind the hacks that lead to the release of emails from John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair. 
Podesta referred to the FBI’s Friday announcement as “extraordinary.” 
“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,” Podesta said . “The Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining.” 
In July, after the FBI came to a conclusion on Clinton’s private email server and said that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with criminal charges, the Clinton campaign praised Comey as a “well-respected Republican who served as George W. Bush’s Deputy Attorney General.” 
Brian Fallon, press secretary for the Clinton campaign, shamed Republicans in September , particularly GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, for “trying to bully the FBI into serving partisan interests.”

Should social scientists seek the truth regardless of whose toes may be stepped on and cite, up front, possible conflicts of interest regarding matters they study? 
All academic disciplines claim independence of thought and transparency are principles that guide good research. So, what to make of a Canadian foreign policy discussion dominated by individuals with ties to the decision-making structures they study? 
The highly regarded Norman Paterson School of International Affairs (NPSIA) is a prime example. The oldest global affairs school in Canada, Carleton University’s graduate program was established in 1965 with $400,000 ($5 million today) from long-time Senator Norman Paterson, a grain-shipping magnate. During World War II his company provided vessels for Atlantic convoys and Paterson was a major player within the Liberal Party. 
Twice under-secretary of External Affairs and leading architect of post-World War II Canadian foreign policy, Norman Robertson was the school’s first director. Unhappy in a diplomatic post in Geneva, External Affairs colleagues secured Robertson the NPSIA position. During his time at Carleton, Robertson continued to be paid as a “Senior Advisor” to External Affairs, overseeing a major review of a department concerned about growing criticism that it was acting as a U.S. “errand boy” in Vietnam.

3119,Turkish Referendum Has Country Trading Barbs With Germany Over Free Speech - The New York Times,"BERLIN  —   Germany and Turkey have been locked in an intensifying war of words over the past week, as campaigning heats up before an April referendum in Turkey on a new Constitution that would expand the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan, whose critics cast him as ever more authoritarian, badly wants a victory in the vote. With the referendum on a   he and members of his Justice and Development Party, known as A. K. P. are desperate to campaign in Germany among the 1. 5 million Turks who are eligible to vote. “There is a need for the A. K. P. to secure as many votes as possible from the Turks living in Germany  —   that’s the basic ingredient,” said Marc Pierini, a former European Union ambassador to Turkey and a scholar at Carnegie Europe, a   think tank. “The yes vote is now in jeopardy, therefore votes in Germany are of course very important,” he added. But the campaign has put Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government in a deeply awkward position. Mr. Erdogan’s opponents in Germany, both Turkish and German, say the president wants to use the freedoms of Western democracy to further consolidate his   powers at home, and they accuse him and his men of using their right to free speech in Germany while denying it in Turkey. Of particular concern to Germany is a   journalist, Deniz Yucel, who turned himself in last month, was held for 13 days and last week was ordered held indefinitely, with the Turkish authorities  —   including Mr. Erdogan himself  —   labeling him a terrorist. Mr. Erdogan and his supporters have jailed tens of thousands of people they claim supported a failed military coup against him last July. Turkey jailed more journalists than any other country in 2016, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. But both sides are now accusing each other of stifling free speech, with Turkish officials charging that they are being blocked from campaigning in Germany. Two Turkish ministers campaigning in Germany on Mr. Erdogan’s behalf scrapped rallies last week after local German authorities said they could not guarantee security. Germany’s federal government has denied intervening in any way. On Sunday, Mr. Erdogan accused Berlin of using Nazi tactics and threatened to stir a revolt if he decided to go to Germany himself and was somehow prevented from entering. (He previously campaigned in Germany in 2008, 2011 and 2014.) “Some friends talked about fascism,” Mr. Erdogan said at a dinner event in Istanbul. “I was thinking that fascism is over in Germany, but it is still ongoing. It is ongoing, obviously. ” Then he added: “My brothers, now they think Erdogan is supposed to come to Germany. I would come if I want to. I could come and set the world on fire if you don’t let me come in, or you don’t allow me to talk. ” On Monday, Ms. Merkel told reporters, “One can’t even really seriously comment on such misplaced statements. ” Ms. Merkel’s chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, said Mr. Erdogan’s language was “absolutely unacceptable” and that the government would relay that message to Turkey. “Concerning the rule of law, tolerance and liberalism, Germany is not to be bested,” Mr. Altmaier said. Analysts and commentators urged calm and noted that the sparring would benefit no one. Germany and Turkey are bound by the NATO alliance, aid from the European Union and an additional European Union agreement, negotiated by Ms. Merkel and worth up to six billion euros, or $6. 3 billion, if Turkey keeps refugees from fleeing across the Aegean Sea to Greece and into Central Europe. “The most important thing is that we have no interest in a rising spiral of insults  —   an insult arms race, or however you want to put it,” said Volker Perthes, the director of the German Institute for Security and International Affairs, a   think tank in Berlin. “That will not help us. ” He predicted relations could get back on track after April 16. In the meantime, Mr. Erdogan  —   labeled the “dictator on the Bosporus” by Andreas Scheuer, a leading politician in Bavaria  —   has come under fierce attack, and not only in Germany. In Austria, which has a sizable Turkish minority and a strong   opposition, Chancellor Christian Kern said Turkish politicians should not campaign abroad. In the Netherlands, the nationalist Geert Wilders, who leads polls for elections this month but is unlikely to become prime minister, said he would declare all of Turkey’s ministers persona non grata. In Turkey, opposition politicians criticized the decision to block Mr. Erdogan’s allies from speaking to German Turks. The leader of Turkey’s main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, accused Germany of hypocrisy. “You teach democracy to the world, but you forbid two ministers from speaking with this or that excuse,” Mr. Kilicdaroglu said on Friday, in comments reported by Hurriyet Daily News. But some of Mr. Erdogan’s opponents noted the irony of the president defending his right to free speech in Europe, while eroding that of citizens at home. Aysun Gezen, one of an estimated 4, 000 academics purged from Turkish universities since the failed coup last year, said her case highlighted the Turkish government’s intolerance of dissident voices within its own borders. “It is impossible to say that there is freedom of speech in Turkey,” argued Ms. Gezen, who was a political scientist at Ankara University before being fired last year for signing a petition that criticized the government’s actions toward Kurds. She and her fellow petitioners were accused of creating terrorist propaganda. In addition to academics like Ms. Gezen, more than 120, 000 government employees are estimated to have been fired or suspended in recent months for perceived opposition to the government. On the day that Mr. Kilicdaroglu, the opposition leader, defended his opponents’ right to campaign in Germany, he also lamented his side’s inability to campaign freely in Turkey. In an interview last week with The New York Times, he said that the whole Turkish state apparatus was being mobilized behind the yes campaign, while voices in the private news media are stifled. State officials had made it hard for his colleagues to rent spaces for campaign events, Mr. Kilicdaroglu argued, while the police in Istanbul had failed to properly investigate claims that a group of   had been shot at. “We repeat the same thing 100 times, but with the problem in the media, we can’t deliver our message to the masses,” Mr. Kilicdaroglu said.",0
3120,US Inspector General: Afghan Govt Rapidly Lost Territory Over Summer,"Pentagon Downplays Situation as Losses Mount   
The Pentagon’s narrative on the Afghan War tries to present the territory changes as brief, minor, and limited, repeatedly touting the fact that the Afghan government still controls the majority of the country. It’s a shrinking majority, however, as a new report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) notes. 
SIGAR noted that the data from the Pentagon showed that the Afghan government actually controlled only about 63.4 percent of the country as of the end of August, the result of steady losses throughout the summer. All indications are that the losses have continued over the past two months as well. 
If these numbers sound worse than those coming from the Pentagon, it’s because they are. Officially, the Pentagon’s percentages are based on “control or influence” of population, not physical territory held. These numbers tend to be higher, because most of the major cities are still controlled by the government, even if many are surrounded. 
Pentagon officials have done this not only to have bigger percentages, but to downplay the losses, arguing that they are mostly in rural areas. While this is true, the reality is that Afghanistan is a heavily rural country, and strongly dependent on farming. The Taliban has aimed in many cases specifically at the farmlands, particularly in opium-producing regions, because those are so much more economically valuable for them. 
The SIGAR report also cited major casualties among Afghan security forces as a matter of concern. Again, this was in stark contrast to Pentagon statements, which have insisted that morale among the still surviving troops remains strong  ",0
3121,Lindsay Lohan’s Strange Accent: Another Telling Sign of a Mind Control Slave,"Support Us Lindsay Lohan’s Strange Accent: Another Telling Sign of a Mind Control Slave 0 
A video of Lindsay Lohan giving an interview with a strange accent has lead to wild speculation from fans and media. However, to those in the know, this is yet another telling symptom of MK programming, from someone who has already displayed many other symptoms. 
There’s a difference between speaking with a funny accent as a joke and speaking with a completely different speech pattern in all seriousness. One is the result of goofing around and the other is the result an alter-persona. 
– Advertisement – 
Lohan’s new accent was noticed while giving an interview to a reporter in Greece. Here’s the video. 
Lindsay, who is mainly based in England and Greece and was recently in a relationship with a Russian billionaire (MK handler?), was explaining to the journalist about why she has opened up a Nightclub in Athens called Lohan. After a Daily Mail article on the subject, Lohan “joked” and gave her accent (and alter-persona) a name: Lilohan. 
As stated in previous articles, victims of Mind Control are programmed with alter personas that have their own history, identity and accent (read my full article on Monarch Programming here). The programming is so pervasive that the same person can speak different languages with different accents effortlessly – while the core persona cannot. For this reason, the spontaneous yet constant usage of a different accent is one of the main tell-tale signs of MK programming. And Lindsay Lohan has been identified her, on Vigilant Citizen, to be a Beta Kitten slave a long time ago. The entertainment industry has been very keen on proving this fact through symbolic pictures. Lindsay posed countless times as Marilyn Monroe who is the prototype of Beta Kitten Programming. In this photo by Tyler Shields, Lindsay lays on a bed while men get undressed. One cannot come up with a more graphic way of portraying the life of Beta Kitten slaves. Industry slaves must work with creepy photographers such as Terry Richardson. Bonus industry slave sign: One Eye sign. In another shoot with Terry Richardson, Lohan appears genuinely traumatized. 
In past years, Lohan has floated in and out of rehab (aka re-programming) while increasingly appearing to be “out of it”. 
Another famous person who has been displaying the same Beta Kitten symptoms is Britney Spears. Here’s an article about her speaking with a different accent in 2008 – around the time of her infamous head-shaving meltdown. Britney Spears Lapses Into a British Accent 
Britney Spears has a new accessory to go with her pink wig: a British accent. 
In the last several weeks, Spears, 26, has been videotaped numerous times trading her Louisiana twang for U.K. inflections. 
“She had the English accent thing going the whole time” while shopping at Kitson last Thursday, according to a source. “It didn’t stop.” 
Even when angry, the accent appears. On an L.A. shopping trip to Macy’s on Jan. 13, she screamed at the paparazzi, “Get out of my G—— face!” – in a British accent. 
So is it all in fun or has she flipped her pink wig? 
“When someone has dissociative identity disorder” – formerly known as multiple personality disorder – “each identity is split off from the other,” says L.A. psychologist Renee A. Cohen, who is not treating Spears. “Each identity would have its own name, memories, behavioral traits and emotional characteristics.” 
Cohen says the critical question is: “When Britney uses the British accent, or appears to take on another identity, does she know she’s Britney Spears?” 
“Otherwise, she could simply be behaving this way for attention, for sympathy, or any other reason,” adds Cohen. “It’s foolish to attempt to diagnose her without a formal evaluation.” 
One possible influence could be Spears’s maternal grandmother, Lilian Bridges, who was originally from England. 
Also, Spears’s new beau, photographer Adnan Ghalib, grew up in Birmingham, England. 
According to paparazzi who trail the singer around the clock, one thing is for sure: the pink wig means something’s changing. 
“When she puts on the pink wig, you just know something crazy is about to happen,” said one paparazzo.

While media is wondering what kind of accent Lindsay was speaking with (sounds Greek to me), we should rather wonder: Why would a 30 year old woman speak, in all seriousness, with a strange accent and a completely different speech pattern? Most of the time it is the result of a multiple-personality disorder (MPD) – which is a symptom of Monarch mind control. It is there, right in our face, but very few are actually seeing it.",0

Many go on what’s known as the “water bottle tour,” meetings with development executives and agents in Los Angeles (where you’re more likely to leave with a bottle of Evian than a production deal). Most don’t have new scripts ready, a huge impediment, said the producer Anne Carey. Then they struggle against the industry’s narrow expectations. “Any person coming out of Sundance is in a box, particularly if you only have one film under your name,” said the filmmaker Justin Simien. “And if you happen to be in the black box or the gay box or the woman box, I think you’re in a smaller box. ” Meanwhile, the clock is ticking: “You have a whole year, and then there’s a whole new batch of kids at Sundance, and then it’s their year,” said the director Kat Candler. “Your spotlight has shifted. ” For three filmmakers  —   Mr. Simien, 33, from Los Angeles Ms. Candler, 42, who lives in Austin, Tex. and Sara Colangelo, 37, based in New York  —   who made their feature debuts in 2014, alongside Mr. Chazelle, what happened next felt like one step forward, two back. Their paths hold lessons for other artists and offer a glimpse into how Hollywood careers are really made. 2014 Two years before, Justin Simien quit his day job to make his debut feature, “Dear White People. ” He had worked in movie marketing, so he had some insider savvy. What he didn’t know was how his film, a satire of race relations set on a college campus, would be received by the mostly white audiences at Sundance. “I was kind of terrified, to be honest,” he said. “Dear White People” struck a chord, earning a festival award for breakthrough talent. A distribution deal soon followed. “I went into it just hoping that when I came out, I could at least pay my rent,” Mr. Simien said. “That didn’t happen. ” But in Los Angeles afterward, he was in demand, attending dozens of development meetings for months. He understood the process: “Part of being a development person is checking off the list” that you’ve met with Sundance alumni, he said. Nonetheless, it seemed like he had arrived. Even if the offers were not as big as those some of his white counterparts were getting  —   “Nobody was talking about ‘Jurassic World,’” he said, the film Colin Trevorrow landed after his Sundance debut  —   he didn’t feel pigeonholed. Several projects floated up, like a dark comedy with Anthony Mackie attached. Yet Mr. Simien was still strapped for cash. Driving to those Beverly Hills meetings, “I was afraid to pull up to the valet, because my hubcaps were falling off,” he said. In the spring, he sold a book version of “Dear White People” that kept him afloat financially. The film opened in the fall, to critical acclaim. 2015 As Mr. Simien toured with his film, he found a second career as a speaker, especially at colleges. “Any school that was dealing with a race issue would book the film and then book me,” he said. He made the movie to spark discussion, so these encounters were gratifying and meaningful. He jotted down stories he heard from the students, too. When a studio approached him about making a TV version of “Dear White People,” his notes  —   fresh ideas  —   were immediately useful. 2016 In May, Netflix announced the series. In June, Mr. Simien sat in a production space and marveled at his fortune. “I’m in an office! There’s a lamp from HomeGoods! It’s ” he said. He presided over a diverse writers’ room of seven people, discussing civil rights, “blacktivism” and cultural identity. With the veteran showrunner Yvette Lee Bowser, he learned to make a TV series. 2017 “That was probably the hardest thing I ever did,” Mr. Simien said in January after finishing the show’s first season. Production had wrapped on Election Day the series’ themes were landing in a much more charged cultural landscape than where they were conceived. “This show is 100 percent part of the resistance,” he said. Mr. Simien is pleased with it but itching to get to other projects. “Creatively, I just need to prove to myself and to others in the industry, I’m not a   pony,” he said. Hiring for his series, he had noted that white male colleagues had been given more career chances. “The opportunities that I have tend to be ” he said, adding, “You just gotta keep grinding  —   which has worked out so far. ”  2014 The   Sara Colangelo arrived at Sundance that January with an ambitious debut, “Little Accidents. ” Set and shot in a West Virginia   town, with a sprawling story line, it was created after Ms. Colangelo won a coveted spot in the Sundance screenwriting and directing labs three years earlier, and secured a budget of $1. 2 million, all major for a   indie filmmaker. The cast  —   including Elizabeth Banks, Josh Lucas and Chloë Sevigny  —   was enviable, too. But even as she set out to unveil it, Ms. Colangelo said, she knew that her film was not exactly what she wanted it to be. “There were moments in the editing room where I was like, I’m enormously proud, but these things might not be working,” she said. Was the film too sad? How would the marketplace react? “I was aware of what the challenges were. ” The film came with    expectations. Critics at the festival praised the acting, though, and the  . Ms. Colangelo made the Los Angeles rounds that fall, and was sent a few scripts, but no jobs materialized. She made ends meet doing corporate videos. Financially, she said, “there were nine months or so where it was like, it’s going to be tough. ” 2015 “Little Accidents” made it to theaters a full year after Sundance. Reviews were largely welcoming, but it barely eked out $10, 000  —   total  —   at the box office. Still, Ms. Colangelo earned a nomination for best first screenplay at that year’s Indie Spirit Awards, and that led to a few    jobs, polishing other people’s work. In the meantime, she watched friends and Sundance alumni  —   mostly men  —   advance. Doubts crept in: Could she have done more on “Little Accidents”? Her male counterparts were often allowed reshoots. Somehow, for them, “the money was found. ” She asked herself, “What kind of leader do you have to be to get those things? Is it charisma? Is it truly gender?” She was buoyed when Israeli producers asked her to adapt an acclaimed,   foreign drama. (They declined to reveal it.) Ms. Colangelo worked on the script for months and finally signed a deal at the end of the year. 2016 As the Israeli film’s location and financiers bounced from Canada to New York, and casting decisions loomed, Ms. Colangelo hung on to direct. She vowed to be more flexible on production details and bolder in her focus on story. 2017 Her   was erased, replaced with excitement, and pride: She plans to begin shooting the new film this summer, shortly after the birth of her first child. “There’s this feeling that the industry sometimes gives you, that you have this window of opportunity after Sundance and if you don’t perform perfectly in that moment or have a perfect script, then the window shuts,” she said. “And I think that’s a dangerous way to think about it. ” Momentum, she discovered, can rebound. “And it’s O. K. to retrieve it and find it later. ” 2014 A   filmmaker with several shorts to her credit, Kat Candler landed at Sundance with the family drama “Hellion. ” “I was definitely hoping to get representation,” she said, a distribution deal and attention for other projects. She knew that breakout success was rare and that her route would be tough, especially without superlative reviews. A month later, she did her water bottle week in Los Angeles. “It felt like ‘The Amazing Race,’” she said, eight meetings a day. Little came of them. “Hellion,” starring Aaron Paul of “Breaking Bad,” opened in theaters five months later, and Ms. Candler hit the road to promote it. Live Q. and A. s, Skype sessions  —   “Anytime anybody asked, it was a yes,” she said. “It was exhausting, after a while. I wish someone had warned me. ” Her promotion helped, but not much “Hellion” just did not have the marketing dollars. In retrospect, she said, her efforts distracted her from “putting all the pieces for another project together. ” 2015 A year after Sundance, Ms. Candler was growing anxious. “I felt like, oh, what am I doing?” she said. But she was halfway into a   mentorship program, sponsored by the Sundance women’s filmmaking initiative. “The life coach was pretty transformative,” she said. She shelved her jealousy about others’ deals. “I can go write for four hours and feel a sense of accomplishment,” she said. A push to break into TV directing was fruitless, though. No one wanted to an untested TV director, even if she had already conquered the big screen. (Male directors, research shows, face a lower bar for hiring.) “Sometimes you just wonder, how much harder do I have to work to prove myself?” Ms. Candler said. Her life coach offered a mantra: You belong in the room. So at every meeting, she said, “I tell myself, ‘You’ve earned your space. ’” In the summer, she shot a campaign for Canon. Besides money from teaching a college class, it was her first real paycheck in years. Still, she worried about car insurance payments and other bills. 2016 Back in Los Angeles, Ms. Candler had meetings about a   feature she was writing. It could go indie or mainstream, depending on the stars and how much control Ms. Candler ceded. “Do I really want to go out for a project that doesn’t have great humanity? No,” she said. A turning point came in the spring, when she shot two episodes of “Queen Sugar,” the series created by Ava DuVernay that employs only female directors. No pitch meetings were necessary they knew each other through the festival circuit. The paucity of female directors has been a hot topic in Hollywood, but Ms. Candler was over it. “Just hire,” she said. “It really isn’t that hard. ” 2017 “Queen Sugar” was renewed, and Ms. DuVernay asked Ms. Candler to return, now as the producing director. Ms. Candler went on to shoot episodes of other series. She has work lined up through 2018. She felt confident before “Queen Sugar,” she said. “I just don’t think that people had confidence in us. Ava legitimized all of us. ” After 17 years in the field, she said, she was at last making a living as a filmmaker.",0

3124,"U.S. Could Exceed Goal of Accepting 10,000 Syrian Refugees - The New York Times","BALTIMORE  —   When Madiha Algothany and her family, Syrian refugees who had fled to Jordan, arrived in the United States in June, they braced for rejection from a new culture and country they feared did not want them. They knew that, like Donald J. Trump, many Americans wanted to stop Muslims from coming into the country. But Ms. Algothany and her husband and their four sons found a furnished town home in Baltimore waiting for them, along with a case worker to help them navigate their new life  —   part of an effort President Obama announced last fall to resettle 10, 000 people displaced by the war in Syria by the end of September. After a slow start and amid fierce political controversy, the Obama administration is on track to meet that target and probably exceed it, according to figures it released on Friday. “We were told it will be very difficult for us in the U. S. because the people don’t like us and they don’t want to deal with us, but what I found is that people received us very well,” Ms. Algothany, 32, said in an interview this week, speaking through an interpreter at a resettlement center run by the International Rescue Committee. “They are really spending a lot of time and effort helping us, to answer our questions and help us in our life. ” Ms. Algothany’s family is one in a rapidly growing influx of Syrian refugees  —   99 percent of them Muslim  —   arriving in communities around the United States. Administration officials said on Friday that 8, 000 Syrian refugees had been allowed into the United States since October, putting them on pace to surpass the goal of 10, 000. Through partnerships with the State Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, all of them receive assistance from nonprofit organizations that connect them to a local support network to help them find housing, register for health care and food assistance and enroll their children in school. The International Rescue Committee is one of nine nonprofit organizations helping refugees relocate and integrate into their new communities. The increase reflects a quiet but intense push by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security, with substantial prodding from the White House, to radically speed up the pace at which Syrian refugees are placed in the United States. It appears likely to further inflame the political debate about refugees that has become a central theme of the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump has claimed that “thousands upon thousands” of Muslim refugees with a terrorist   have been “pouring into our country” without proper security screening. The administration was spurred to action by a refugee crisis whose dimensions were driven home to the public in September, when newspapers published a photograph of the drowned corpse of Alan Kurdi, a Syrian toddler whose body washed ashore in Turkey after he and his family were tossed from a raft while attempting to flee to Greece. “We had so much pressure to bring Syrians, that we hadn’t done enough for that crisis,” said Anne C. Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, migration and refugees, who said she had initially questioned whether the target of accepting 10, 000 Syrians  —   part of an overall goal of resettling 85, 000 refugees in the United States this year  —   was feasible. The task involves a rigorous set of security screenings and other checks, and an increased effort by the nonprofit groups involved to find new homes for those who are accepted in the United States. “We have people and groups in the United States who want us to bring many, many more refugees from around the world, and then we have people who say, ‘Don’t you dare bring a terrorist in,’” Ms. Richard said in an interview. She added: “It takes people and resources. The biggest challenge is to move faster without cutting corners on security. ” The Paris attacks in November intensified the scrutiny one of the bombers was found to have had a Syrian passport. Governors in 31 states said they would not accept Syrian refugees, although in many cases they have not been able to bar them, and   legislation was introduced in 19 states this year, according to the International Rescue Committee. “I’m dismayed that refugees have become a political issue this campaign season  —   I’m really shocked by it,” Ms. Richard said. “It is a departure from the past, and could potentially harm the program. ” For now, it has not hindered the administration’s efforts quickly integrate a large new stream of Syrians into American communities. In February, around the time that Ms. Algothany’s family got word they could apply to resettle in the United States, the administration began a   push to interview and process Syrian refugees in Jordan. Employees of the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security interviewed 12, 000 applicants, flooding the pipeline with refugee applications. Operations also expanded in Istanbul, Beirut, Lebanon, and Erbil, Iraq to handle many more Syrian cases. “We’ve actually added security checks to the process,” Jeh Johnson, the homeland security secretary, said this week. “What we have also added are a lot of resources to the process to meet the commitments that we have given the world refugee crisis. ” Leon Rodriguez, the director of the United States Customs and Immigration Service, said the vetting included what officials call a “Syrian enhanced review” involving fraud detection and national security units, as well as intelligence checks that include examination of social media. Seven percent of Syrian refugee applicants have failed the screenings and been denied entry, Mr. Rodriguez said on Friday, and an additional 13 percent were paused because of concerns about their credibility. The nonprofit groups that help resettle refugees began to feel the impact. At their weekly Wednesday “allocation” meeting, where a representative from each group spends hours in a nondescript office conference room in Arlington, Va. across the Potomac River from the State Department, there was a spike in the number of Syrian cases they were being asked to accept. The bulk of the Syrian refugees have resettled in Michigan, California, Arizona and Texas, according to figures released by the State Department, but some have ended up in all but a dozen states, from the Pacific Northwest to New England. “We have seen a surge,” said Mamadou Sy, refugee program director at Lutheran Social Services of the National Capital Area, which has offices in Falls Church, Va. and Hyattsville, Md. “But what we have also noticed is a surge of phone calls from volunteers who want to help that is really very overwhelming because the discourse out there has been very negative. ” At the International Rescue Committee’s resettlement office in Baltimore this week, the small waiting room was filled with Syrian families preparing to register for health care with the Maryland Department of Social Services and English classes at Baltimore City Community College. They also attended cultural or   training in small classrooms equipped with white boards,   fliers and task lists. “This is where the realities begin to set in for the clients: that while they have certain rights and benefits, they also have a lot of responsibilities,” said Ruben Chandrasekar, the executive director of the rescue committee’s Maryland programs, gesturing to an orientation classroom. While Syrians had arrived in “a trickle” for most of the year, Mr. Chandrasekar said, that has changed dramatically in the last couple of months. “Now, they’re essentially taking over our caseload,” he said. Mohammad   34, who arrived in Baltimore in June with his wife and four young children, is part of the trend. It has been four years since he hid the children in a livestock van and fled with his wife from Dara’a, Syria, to Jordan. “It was my dream always to come to the United States,” Mr. Smadi said through an interpreter. So he did not hesitate when he learned in February that his family could apply. American officials grilled him extensively during several interviews about “the tiniest details,” Mr. Al Smadi said, once calling him back for a second hourslong round of questioning because of a   discrepancy in the dates he had provided for his service in Syria’s military. “We are hardworking people  —   we like to work and make our own living, and we don’t like to ask for aid,” Mr. Smadi said as his    daughter squirmed on her belly on a table in front of him and his two other daughters and son played quietly nearby. “But there was no future for my children. ”",0
3125,3 Ways to Find Focus in Trump's Age of Distractions · Guardian Liberty Voice,"President-elect Donald Trump is like a one-man meteor shower of this age. He sprays white-knuckle antipathy upon all manner of people of varied religions, ethnicities, race, and any other target of choice. He avoids the “politically correct” avenue and simply does things his own way. Trump’s age of distractions has thrown the country into a frenzy leaving people careening and disoriented. The real issue is the lack of focus is not limited to the realm of politics; it has shifted into other areas that have affected many on a personal level. This is not really about the distraction of politics, it is more centered on the politics of distraction.
One of the things that continues to rise over the past 15 years or so is the increase in diagnosis involving focus. Whether it is ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) or OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), the list of diagnosis that indicates a challenge in our ability to focus has America in the lead above any other country. The blame has shifted from the school system to the household, to the programmers of major television stations and now, Trump’s age of distractions. Famed novelist Arthur Golden said, “A mind troubled by doubts cannot focus on the course of victory.” With this in mind, it is evident that no matter who is to blame for the lack of focus, victims need to discover a remedy fast.
Focus, by definition, is the adjustment for distinct vision; a center of activity, attraction, and attention. It is the last part of the definition that really stands out, “the center of a person’s activity, attraction, and attention . ” Here is the real deal, people do not possess focus if it has not arrested those three areas of life. That is the difference between hobbies and passions. The latter captivates all you are and all you do. Many have failed simply because they have refused to bring their lives into a definite focus.
Focus allows us to harness our skills, intelligence, and resources and put them to work on our life goals. Most, at one time or another, have fallen into the trap of being a “Jack of All Trades.” The part that is often missed is that we become masters of none. We spread ourselves thin in an effort to appear busy, but life’s successes come from a laser beam approach toward tasks. This may be the reason America ranks nearly last amidst other countries with regards to productivity. We have more stuff than ever, but we seem to be doing less. The issue lies in our inability to focus.

Where do we begin? In a society that is screaming at us from sun up to sun down, how will we find the time to focus? Even on our jobs, we get assigned to one project only to be told the other five are really the priority. Everything was due two days ago. People consume fast food at alarming rates because it is supposed to be fast and no one has time to cook a balanced meal. This, however, leads to fears of illnesses like cancer and diabetes. People of all nationalities seem to be in a losing battle with the clock and now experts are telling saying the biggest problem is really the lack of focus. Listed below are solutions that can ease the pressure and help people to find focus in Trump’s age of distractions:
Admit other things are important too: One of the first mistakes we make is trying to go “cold turkey” when it comes to our distractions. You have had them long enough for them to become a new normal. Therefore, cutting them out will not be easy. First, devise a plan to lower a number of distractions by setting guidelines. By checking emails less frequently and turning the ringer off on your phone, you increase your ability to focus instantly. Solicit the help of colleagues: People tend to interrupt you because that is what you have trained them to do. Setting boundaries around yourself sends an instant message to people indicating you are in work mode. Let them know your times of “on purpose” focus and that you are not to be disturbed. Usually, people will honor it. Utilize technology, sticky notes, and lists to your advantage: In your lap right now is the power to retake your focus. You probably have a smartphone, Tablet, Kindle or some other device capable of helping you organize your time. I find if we do not have a plan, we are planning to fail. Set reminders to study in your phone, read your morning paper on your iPad while commuting, or set a to-do list the night before. All these small tasks add up to big time savers in the future. In Trump’s age of distraction, it has become easy to blame the lack of focus on external events. In reality, the only thing we really do control is our behavior in any given situation. Take back your life and readjust your focal point. You will be amazed at how closely life imitates a camera. Until it is turned on and focused, no memories are ever clearly captured. Remember, this is really not about the distraction of politics, but the responsibility of managing the politics of distraction.

3126,Gay Journalist who Came Out as Conservative Shouted Down at Portland State University - Breitbart,"Journalist Chadwick Moore, who recently came out as conservative in a column for the New York Post, was shouted down by students during a recent event at Portland State University.[  Conservative journalist Chadwick Moore was shouted down by students at a recent event at Portland State University. Students, refusing to wait until the event’s QA, shouted at Moore during the lecture portion of the event. “I am black, I am disabled, I’m a woman,” one attendee shouted, before storming out of the room and pounding her fists on the windows. After mocking”Girl, there’s still time, we can punch you too,” another student shouted after Moore mocked the disrupters’ low energy. “Sorry, not a threat,” the student added after several attendees gasped at the suggestion that Moore would be punched. “Can you not wait until the QA and be polite?” Moore responded. “Why don’t you shut up and have respect for your fellow students?” Despite the interruptions, the event featured some positive moments. One female student told Moore that his story had helped her feel more comfortable in being herself. “I was one of those people who wrote you a message when you came out,” said a young woman in the audience. “I want to personally thank you for being as loud as you are because you’re speaking up for people like me. ” During the lecture, Moore cited a Gallup survey, which revealed that one in five gay Americans is conservative. “If you decide to shun a huge percentage of your community simply because they might not agree with your political views   …     you’re denying people a chance to true happiness of living authentically,” Moore said. Other members of the Portland State University community praised Moore’s lecture. “I was impressed by Chadwick standing up to these bullies and speaking his mind,” recent graduate Mykle Curton said. “Just because I disagree with him on politics doesn’t mean I can’t like and support him. I agree with him about his rejection of identity politics. They argue that you can lump people into groups and generalize their experiences and beliefs. ” Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

3129,Reflections on US Political Tragedies,"Reflections on US Political Tragedies November 14, 2016 
Two very unpopular candidates made the 2016 presidential campaign an embarrassment for American democracy. Now, the outcome could become one more tragedy for U.S. politics, observes David Marks. 
By David Marks 
Mourning seems a strange response to election results; as I consider my feelings after the presidential election, I’ve realized it’s another chapter in a sequence of tragedies throughout my life. 
I was eleven when the news of President Kennedy’s assassination came over the loudspeaker in our sixth-grade classroom. Our tough, yet inspirational teacher wept at her desk in front of us. Her tears taught me more than any explanation of those events could ever reveal. 
Not many years later, I suffered the shock of the killings of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and wondered at how these horrific events would shape the future. 
I had wanted to be an astronaut, but soon realized that going to the moon as a U.S. Air Force pilot might have the prerequisite of bombing Vietnam. I began understanding the damage the U.S. was doing with its military interventions, and made a conscious decision to stay away from space and politics. It seemed you could only improve yourself to make a better world. Politics was not for the peaceful. 
By 1973, the stench of Watergate drifted across the country. I was fascinated; a “smoking gun” is not needed in a murder prosecution, but somehow had become a necessity in political crime. But Nixon’s defenders could not counter undeniable evidence of illegal activity by both the President and his aides that was found in White House audiotapes. Most of the political “nobility” escaped the consequences while Nixon and a few accomplices took the fall. 
We knew Nixon was a war criminal years before, but Watergate set a precedent that our leaders must be caught in the act of some far narrower and less consequential crime to prove they are scoundrels. We do know that Nixon feared and obsessed on the revelations of worse crimes in his past. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate. ”] 
Retreating from Politics 
Ever more convinced of the darkness in U.S. politics, I retreated further, convinced that only personal actions and relationships could shape the world. Ronald Reagan and his 1980 vice-presidential running mate George H.W. Bush. 
There was a glimmer of hope during Jimmy Carter’s presidency; he was a seemingly honest leader, supporting alternative energy and a cleaner environment, and allowing investigations into foreign and domestic assassinations of the previous decade. But few were moved or surprised by the contradiction of the Warren Commission’s findings and the Congressional pronouncement that JFK had been killed by a conspiracy. 
In 1980, my first daughter was born during the northern California Indian summer. Even the election of Ronald Reagan two months later couldn’t eclipse my elation. I recall thinking about how the world might be different when she became a woman. I could only attempt to be a good enough father so that she would be kind and strong, and brave and bright enough to gain her equanimity. 
It was only a month after the 1980 election that John Lennon died. It was then I mourned his murder and Reagan’s rise as a converged event. Lennon had been hounded by the junta that had taken over the country. He had once observed, “Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we’re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I’m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that.” 
I recovered with the knowledge that the power of John’s music would stay with us, and knew his spirit would give perspective and strength to my daughter and the many children whose lives were just beginning. Despite his passing, John Lennon’s open-eyed idealism had been magnified. 
The combination of Reagan’s rise and Lennon’s death in 1980, with the background of earlier assassinations of political leaders, continued to shape my world. Disgusted and repulsed by the “Reagan era,” it was a time for further retreat and the nurturing of ideas for a better future. 
My second daughter’s joyful arrival in February of 1984, coincided with the U.S. “stabilizing” the Middle East, firing shells into Lebanon. Our “ally” Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi people were fighting a horrific ground war with Iran. The conflict was far away, though I knew U.S. interests in oil resources in the region would eventually turn around to impact our lives directly. 
Despite the violence perpetrated by our country, I was still resolved to make a better world for both daughters in my own small way. Although very young, I knew they were part of a generation of gifted, empowered women who might be able to change the course of the planet. 
Hypocrisy of Reagan 
In 1986-87, revelations of the hypocrisy of Reagan and his gang emerged during the Iran Contra investigation and hearings. I was fascinated that Reagan had sent a bible and cake (along with weapons, of course) to Iranian leaders when he had publicly invoked Iran as America’s greatest enemy. By helping Iran with sophisticated U.S. weapons for cash, Reagan and his team could secretly fund the Nicaraguan Contras in a dirty war outside the scope of Congress. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library) 
The issue of foiling Congress seemed to distract from what was an important question: why was Reagan helping the strongest voices for Islamic Jihad in the region? I recall thinking how any Democratic president would have been impeached, drawn and quartered for such a betrayal to the country. Reagan came away from the “affair” largely unscathed; he wasn’t protected by Teflon, as the press claimed, he was surrounded by organized criminals of the highest order. 
I could no longer bear just watching events unfold. The crimes of Washington pushed me to where I had to get involved. I offered my support and assisted with the work of a handful of dedicated journalists investigating the 1980 “October Surprise,” i.e., tracing back Reagan’s secret arms sales to Iran in the mid-1980s to an earlier arrangement in which Reagan secretly approved arms sales via Israel to Iran immediately after taking office in 1981. 
The evidence pointed to Reagan’s presidential campaign having secretly made a deal with Iranian leaders to delay the release of the hostages until after the U.S. presidential election. Polls had shown that if the hostages were released before Election Day, Jimmy Carter would have won reelection. And, indeed, the Iranians held the hostages until Reagan had taken the oath of office on Jan. 20, 1981. 
But the statements and testimony of a couple of dozen witnesses including officials in Iran, Israel, Europe and the United States – along with important documentary evidence – failed to shake off Reagan’s Teflon. 
In 1991-1992, I watched as a modern version of The Emperor’s New Clothes played before us. When faced with the possibility that an election would be revealed as a complete sham, Republicans and Democrats stood shoulder to shoulder to deny the possibility and limit the damage. No matter how much evidence emerged (smoking cannons), the truth did not matter when Washington’s status quo was threatened. I mourned for our loss of truth. 
(To this day,   mainstream media outlets refuse to question the October Surprise conventional wisdom that Reagan must be innocent, although even the chairman of the congressional whitewashing investigation has now admitted to having second thoughts. ) 
However, as the special prosecutor’s Iran-Contra investigation and the congressional October Surprise inquiry extended into 1992, they did cast enough doubt on the Reagan administration’s relationship with Iran (and the role of Reagan’s Vice President – and then President – George H.W. Bush, a former CIA director) that they affected the presidential election results of 1992. 
Along with his approval ratings falling steadily due to the economy, incumbent George H.W. Bush lost the false gloss of being an honest politician. The end of 12 years of Republican presidents came to an end as Bush lost to moderate “New Democrat” Bill Clinton. 
The Parties Blur 
Fast forward through the Clinton years when the blur between Republican and Democrats became a thick haze. The Republicans, although vaguely different from President Clinton in some social policies and economic preferences, found they could only demonize him for his handling of sexual indiscretions. His real crime was winning a second term in office, which no Democrat had done since Franklin Roosevelt. Meanwhile, U.S. foreign policy only became more firmly aligned with international corporate priorities. President Bill Clinton 
And then quickly (please) through the eight years of George W. Bush. Although the list is long, the penultimate disgrace of his presidency was the mis-applied vengeance over the destruction of the World Trade Center on 9/11 by using the tragedy to justify the unjustifiable invasion of Iraq. 
Bush’s horrific administration, staffed heavily with arrogant and incompetent cronies, conducted a war that gave foundation to a generation of angry young people in the Middle East who will always see the United States as a terrorist state. I realized at the beginning of the Iraq invasion that violence is not about politics; I thought, there’s a child in Iraq who in 20 years will say: “The U.S. killed my father, I’ll gladly walk into Washington with a nuclear backpack.” 
There was a reprieve of sorts and certainly some refreshing changes with the Obama presidency. But the recognition that Barack Obama would continue the U.S. military enterprises in the Middle East overshadowed any of his more enlightened policies. Yes, his adversaries tried to foil him at every turn, but the priorities of the wealthiest Americans were rarely in question. Washington politics and its ugly international footprint are a continuing tragedy. 
And then there is Trump. It took a few days to realize that I was in mourning again, as much as I mourned when leaders were killed or when Reagan came to power; I mourn particularly for my daughters and the younger generations of women and men who deserve better. My mother, born in 1925, president of her college class, a beloved teacher and still a strong bright woman, feels that the event horizon with Trump gives her more anxiety and fear than she experienced in all of her life, including World War II. She may not see a woman as president of the United States. I mourn for her loss. 
Hope for Hillary 
I recognize that in many ways Hillary Clinton represented a status quo that has worn on me, but I had some hope that her ascendance to the presidency might change her, and as the first woman in that office, she might take on a leadership role that embraced pacifism; or at least might be influenced by those who feel peace is the priority. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 
There is much concern for what Trump will do, but the greater pain and loss is about what he won’t do. Mourning is always about loss; in this instance, the possibilities of progress that have been taken away for the near future, assuming that Trump continues to align himself with reactionary pols – the likes of Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani, Mike Pence – who stuck with him   Many Republicans see Trump as little more than a signature-writing machine who will sign whatever right-wing bills they send him. 
So, we will mourn for a while, but a better world can still be realized. My mom and my daughters are no less powerful; and we all can be empowered by the blatant hypocrisy of this election – as we also recognize the hidden history that gave this travesty its foundation. 
Political events may influence how we feel; but more importantly, who we are, and what we are willing to do for each other, determines our personal and political future.

Новый авианосец станет вторым в составе ВМС КНР после «Ляонина». Как передает RT со ссылкой на South China Morning Post, новый авианосец построен по аналогичному принципу. 
Этот авианосец является ""частью планов Пекина по расширению возможностей своего флота на фоне растущих вызовов в спорных водах Восточно-Китайского и Южно-Китайского морей, а также для защиты национальных интересов за пределами собственных границ"". 
Напомним, в июле журнал Jane's Defence Weekly опубликовал спутниковый снимок первого китайского авианосца национальной постройки, строящегося на китайском судостроительном предприятии Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Company (Group) в Даляне. 
Сообщается, что первый китайский авианосец национальной постройки практически полностью повторяет приобретенный и достроенный Китаем бывший советский тяжелый авианесущий крейсер «Варяг» советского проекта 11436, который теперь называется «Ляонин».

Правда.ру ранее писала, что военные Китая заявили, что КНР не будет оставаться в стороне, когда некоторые страны пытаются создать хаос в регионе Южно-Китайского моря. 
Заместитель главы генштаба народно-освободительной армии КНР Сунь Цзяньго в ответ на призыв США отказаться от провокаций в Южно-Китайском море заявил, что ""мы не создаем проблем, но мы и не боимся их"". 
Как пишет ИА Интерфакс, Сунь Цзяньго в ходе выступления на конференции по безопасности Азии в Сингапуре подчеркнул, что ""другие страны должны играть конструктивную роль в этом отношении, а не наоборот"". 
По его словам, вопрос о Южно-Китайском море приобрел остроту из-за провокаций со стороны некоторых стран, ""преследующих собственные интересы"". 
В Пекине отметили, что ряд стран региона намеренно используют поддержку США для эскалации напряженности в регионе. ""Я подтверждаю, что наша политика в Южно-Китайском море остается неизменной, - сказал Сунь Цзяньго. - У Китая достаточно мудрости и терпения для того, чтобы преодолеть разногласия мирным путем переговоров. Я верю, что и у других государств есть мудрость и терпение для того, чтобы идти с Китаем путем мира. Страны, не имеющие непосредственного отношения к проблемам, не должны саботировать мирный путь, исходя из эгоистичных целей"".

3132,Not guilty: The power of nullification to counteract government tyranny,"Not guilty: The power of nullification to counteract government tyranny By John W. Whitehead Posted on November 2, 2016 by John W. Whitehead 
“The people have the power, all we have to do is awaken that power in the people. The people are unaware. They’re not educated to realize that they have power. The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. We are the government .”—John Lennon 
How do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being Tasered, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons, detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the government’s excesses, abuses and power-grabs? 
Politics won’t fix a system that is broken beyond repair. 
No matter who sits in the White House, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes. 
Relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile. 
Indeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. This is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the U.S. Supreme Court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution. 
Even s 
It doesn’t matter who the activists are (environmentalists, peaceniks, Native Americans, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, or the Bundys and their followers) or what the source of the discontent is (endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs), the government’s modus operandi

The Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility (their lawyers argued the guns were “as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans”). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles (although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties (as the Washington Post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and Earth First protesters 
As law professor Ilya Somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the “law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive .” According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is “premised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say 
In a world of “ rampant overcriminalization ,” where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as “ a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization 
Indeed, Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises 
If you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, I recommend that you vote “not guilty”—even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. As a juror, you have this power under the Bill of Rights

WASHINGTON—Explaining that they have finally started to feel a connection with the Democratic Party nominee, millions of defeated and utterly exhausted voters admitted to reporters Wednesday they are now starting to relate to Hillary Clinton. “I never thought I had much in common with her before, but after waking up today feeling so drained and beaten, I think I’m beginning to see that she and I really are a lot alike,” said 34-year-old Chicago resident Anthony Pallister, echoing the sentiments of Americans across the country who claimed that over the course of the last 24 hours, the feeling that they had suffered through a long, wearying ordeal only to be summarily rejected had caused them to notice many similarities between themselves and the 69-year-old presidential candidate. “The more I think about how dejected and overcome I feel, the more I begin to see myself and my viewpoints in Hillary Clinton. In fact, I don’t know the last time I’ve related to a candidate this much.” Many Americans went on to confirm that their perception of Hillary Clinton being completely out of touch with the majority of the country has now made the former secretary of state far more likable.

3134,"Jared Kushner Will Sell Many of His Assets, but Ethics Lawyers Worry - The New York Times","After   Donald J. Trump announced Monday that he would appoint his    the real estate investor Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser, lawyers for Mr. Kushner said he would sell many of his assets to avoid myriad potential conflicts of interest. But because he plans to sell to his brother or to a family trust controlled by his mother, some ethics lawyers interviewed questioned how meaningful the divestiture would be. Jamie S. Gorelick, a lawyer who is advising Mr. Kushner on how to deal with the ethical issues he will have to navigate while advising Mr. Trump on topics that could affect his bottom line, said Mr. Kushner would sell his interest in about 35 investments, including his family’s flagship office tower on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. He also plans to restructure his role in his remaining holdings so he will not be involved in managing them, Ms. Gorelick said. In addition, she said, he will sell his common stocks resign as chief executive of Kushner Companies, his family business and sell The New York Observer. He will also recuse himself from decisions that could affect his remaining holdings, as well as those of his wife, Ivanka Trump. “He will be treated as any other person entering public service,” said Ms. Gorelick, a partner at WilmerHale and a deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton. Matthew T. Sanderson, a lawyer at Caplin  Drysdale and former general counsel to Senator Rand Paul’s presidential campaign, said that, ideally, the transactions would be independent of the person selling the asset. But as outlined by Ms. Gorelick, Mr. Sanderson said, the plan falls short of that standard. Not only does Mr. Kushner intend to sell the assets to his brother, Joshua, a venture capitalist, and to a trust controlled by his mother, Seryl, but his mother and siblings are the beneficiaries of the trust. “It sounds like a shell game to me,” Mr. Sanderson said. Even with these measures, Mr. Kushner will still have links to his family’s empire, which owns property across the country and relies on   foreign money. Recent maneuvers over the tower at 666 Fifth Avenue underscore the complications. On Saturday, The New York Times reported that Mr. Kushner had been negotiating to redevelop the building with Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese financial firm with a murky ownership structure and state connections. The negotiations began about six months ago, around the time Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination. While the family trust will take over Mr. Kushner’s stake in the building, the value of his interest and other details of the transaction are not known. And as a White House adviser on issues including trade, he is likely to counsel the president on America’s relationship with China. People close to Mr. Kushner and his wife have repeatedly highlighted the income they will be sacrificing Ms. Gorelick said Ms. Trump would remove herself from management roles at the Trump Organization and at her apparel and licensing companies. She will draw income in fixed payments from the Trump Organization, so her salary will not fluctuate based on deals that could relate directly to new federal laws or decisions by her father’s administration. Ms. Gorelick said Mr. Kushner’s legal team had consulted with the Office of Government Ethics, and agreed to certain requests, to craft a plan that would satisfy the legal requirements for him to serve. The lawyers concluded that at least one obstacle, a federal   law, was not applicable because, while the law prohibits federal officials from hiring relatives for agencies they lead, the White House is not an agency. “I’m not saying that there isn’t an argument on the other side,” Ms. Gorelick said. “I just think we have the better argument. ” Richard W. Painter, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota and a chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump and his team deserved credit for bringing Mr. Kushner on as an employee, rather than as an informal adviser not subject to criminal    rules. Mr. Painter noted that the trust was irrevocable, meaning it cannot be modified without the permission of the beneficiaries. He also said it was a positive sign that Mr. Kushner’s wife and young children were not beneficiaries. However, other relatives are. “There will be appearance issues, and you need to make sure this is not a     issue,” he said.",0
3135,Hong Kong’s Beijing-Backed Leader Says He Will Not Seek Re-election - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   Leung   the unpopular   leader of Hong Kong whose government has controversially tried to block or remove elected opposition politicians from office, said on Friday that he would not seek a second term. “I must make a responsible choice between fulfilling my responsibilities to society and to my family,” he said at a news conference on Friday afternoon, adding that a campaign would impose “unbearable stress” on his family. Mr. Leung has occupied the post of chief executive, the city’s highest, since 2012. He is the first chief executive to refrain from seeking   since Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Critics of Mr. Leung have viewed whether he would run as a sign of the Chinese government’s endorsement of his   policies in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory. In the past few years, under Mr. Leung’s leadership, concerns have grown in the city over an erosion in civil liberties and, more recently, a crackdown on political opposition. “Everyone in Hong Kong can see that the central authorities, including the top leaders in the country, have been very supportive of my work over all these years,” he said, a denial that he was dropping out because of Beijing’s disapproval. In a statement, the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said it was “regretful” of Mr. Leung’s decision not to run and praised his contribution in upholding national sovereignty and stability in Hong Kong. Mr. Leung was accused last week of waging a “coup” as he tried to unseat four elected   legislators with a legal challenge over the way they took their oaths of office. An earlier judicial review he initiated disqualified two separatists from taking places in the legislature, but his move to challenge the four seated lawmakers, who do not advocate Hong Kong’s independence from China, was seen as a broader crackdown on opposition. The six politicians targeted by Mr. Leung were among more than 10 who inserted political statements into their oaths of office in October. Two of them, the   Sixtus Leung and Yau   added an alternative name for China that many see as derogatory and pledged allegiance to the Hong Kong “nation,” prompting a rare legal intervention from the Chinese government. “The timing of this is an attempt to relieve pressure in society against the government’s suppression of legislators,” said Nathan Law, who is among the four legislators whose qualification for office is being challenged. “There may be a stick following the carrot. We must not let our guards down. ” In the four years since Mr. Leung took office, Hong Kong has had large street protests demanding greater democracy amid   economic grievances, including housing in a property market regularly ranked as one of the world’s least affordable. In the Friday news conference, Mr. Leung did not provide details about his family issues, though the local news media reported this week that he had visited a hospital where his daughter was said to be receiving treatment. “My daughter has only one father, and my wife has only one husband,” he said on Friday. In a widely reported episode in 2015, Mr. Leung said that his older daughter had health issues after she accused him and her mother of abuse. Mr. Leung has two daughters and a son. His move to open up the office to other candidates is unlikely to lead to drastic changes in terms of Hong Kong’s relationship with China. The chief executive is selected by an elite committee dominated by Beijing loyalists. On Sunday, members of professional and special interest groups from dozens of sectors such as agriculture, banking and education will vote fewer than 1, 200 people onto the committee. The chief executive may at most serve two consecutive   terms. “We want not only a change in the person, we want to change the system,” said Lau   another   legislator, who rose to fame during the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests that sought freer elections of the chief executive. Mr. Leung will stay in office for six months until the inauguration of his successor, who will be elected in March.",0
3136,"Review: In Stephen King’s ‘End of Watch,’ a Murderer’s Victims Kill Themselves - The New York Times","There is perfect symmetry to the way Stephen King aligns the opening of “End of Watch,” the smashing finale of his “Mr. Mercedes” trilogy, with that of its first installment. Mr. King isn’t flashy about it. Maybe he just can’t help writing like a   pro. The first book, “Mr. Mercedes,” began in 2009 with a rabid killer stealing the car of the title and plowing into a line of helpless people attending a job fair. The third book also starts on that day, but navigates its suspenseful way toward the present to a terrifyingly resonant end. When he staged his introductory attack, the   Mr. Mercedes was not satisfied with violence and notoriety alone. He went for the full trifecta and picked a cop to torment. He singled out the retired detective (or “Det. . ”) Bill Hodges, an inveterate good guy, of course. And Hodges’s very first   from the killer  —   “they didn’t die but probably WISH they did! How about that, Detective Hodges?”  —   set forth everything on which the trilogy’s suspense would pivot, from the creep’s delight in maiming rather than killing to the seductive allure of driving others to suicide. The rules of engagement were set. “Finders Keepers,” the middle book, had a tangential plotline about a reclusive,   writer and the havoc wrought by a dangerously obsessed fan. But it was most memorable for the detective agency of the title, led by Hodges and featuring an indispensable young backup man, Jerome Robinson, and a quirky brainiac, Holly Gibney. Holly had trouble making eye contact, but she had quite a way with a sock full of ball bearings (“the Happy Slapper”) as she demonstrated at the end of “Mr. Mercedes. ” It was Holly who stepped in, when Hodges had a disabling health crisis, and put the monster Mr. Mercedes, also known as Brady Hartsfield, into an irreversible coma. A word about that coma for readers of “End of Watch”: Ha. Mr. King does a   version here of what he did fleetingly at the end of “Carrie”: He turns a quick shock into a major horror. There is a prelude set in 2009 on the day of Brady’s Mercedes attack, with two E. M. T.s hoping for a stop at McDonald’s. (One wants to order “one of those hash brown thingies that looked like a baked buffalo tongue. ” Never let it be said that Mr. King lacks uncanny powers of description.) When they get the call to pick up a horrendously injured woman who will be one of the first murder victims in “End of Watch,” it’s goodbye buffalo tongue, hello nightmare. Why would this woman, who has lived, apparently contentedly, in a wheelchair for many years suddenly make a suicide pact with her mother and give up on life? One of Hodges’s favorite pastimes has become visiting Brady’s hospital room, where the immobilized, vegetative patient cannot react to the abuse Hodges heaps on him. Brady brings out his mean streak because the trio at Finders Keepers already know Brady to be “an architect of suicide” with a history of goading others into it. And he would be a person of interest in this case  —   but how can he be? Get serious. You’re reading Stephen King. Whenever the very weird can happen here, of course it does. An immobilized Brady becomes even more malevolent than the one who could drive cars and nearly (in “Mr. Mercedes”) blow up a stadium full of teenage fans of a boy band. Being immobilized just makes him that much more resourceful. He was always good with telepathy and computers and those skills get him up and running again, so to speak. But while Brady cooks up ways to threaten a certain horribly vulnerable part of the populace, Hodges deals with a very different kind of peril. It seems wrong to conflate elements of Mr. King’s real life with his fiction. But there are times when it’s hard not to, especially when he has spoken so frankly about his own ordeals. He has written repeatedly about characters who have struggled with addiction, just as he did, and whose sobriety is fundamental to who they are. Mr. King has also, after a road accident that nearly killed him, written about the frailty of the human body and the fear and suffering he endured. And when he writes here about pain, he does it with astounding honesty. Hodges begins this book as a guy who’s afraid to go to his doctor to find out why his abdomen hurts so much. He goes through most of the story with a bad diagnosis and a viscerally described, mounting agony that becomes one of the book’s biggest elements of suspense. The clock is ticking for him in a fight that Brady insisted on making personal, and Hodges desperately wants the strength to see it through. Because “End of Watch” is a breathless detective story, it’s built around a very specific mystery. (The title refers to Hodges it’s a police term for finishing a shift.) How exactly is Brady operating from his hospital bed? And why do so many suicide victims own the same outdated computer game console, something like a dismal Game Boy, that contains one especially   game involving colored fish? The thing looks harmless, and so does the cover of “End of Watch. ” But when you realize what this otherwise handsome cover depicts, you may not want to look at it for long. A word about Mr. King’s staying power: This is his best book since the vastly ambitious “Under the Dome” (2009) and it’s part of a newly incisive,   part of his career. At some point, the phantasmagorical became less central to him than the frightening prospects to be found in the real world. And he uses his   intimacy with readers to convey the damage life can wreak. An author’s note at the end here gives the number of a real suicide hotline, and the novel is full of cautionary tales about vulnerable teenagers pushed past the brink. The book’s descriptions of the victims of Brady’s   also need no extra spookiness to hit home. Mr. King’s recent novels appeal to older readers more than his early ones did, but they’ve gotten tougher, not tamer. And even though a couple of this book’s principals wind up smiling by the time they get to the last page, you won’t be. That’s a promise.",0
3137,"“MODERATE” INDONESIA: Protest against a Christian governor turns violent as more than 100,000 Muslims demand death for Christian governor who “blasphemed” Islam","BNI Store Nov 4 2016 “MODERATE” INDONESIA: Protest against a Christian governor turns violent as more than 100,000 Muslims demand death for Christian governor who “blasphemed” Islam JARKARTA: The biggest street protest in years shook this sprawling capital today in a stark display of the more conservative, militant strain of Islam taking hold in the world’s largest Muslim country. ( Which Hillary Clinton has called a “shining example of a ‘moderate’ Islamic country” ) WSJ Police said an estimated 100,000 people turned out for a rally called by hard-line Muslim groups against the capital’s Christian governor, whom they accuse of having committed blasphemy. Blasphemy is a criminal offense in Indonesia and prosecutions have increased in the past decade. President Joko Widodo had met with other political leaders amid calls for calm, but critics say he has been too slow since taking office in 2014 to respond to worsening tension for fear of being labeled anti-Muslim. “Religiosity is rising, especially among the middle class,” said Yon Machmudi, an Islamic politics expert at the University of Indonesia. “A sense of identification is increasing.’’ Protesters were taking aim at Basuki Tjahaha Purnama, known as Ahok, who is the most prominent politician among the country’s often-persecuted, ethnic Chinese minority. He was elected deputy governor in 2012 and elevated to the top job in 2014 after his boss, Mr. Widodo, was elected president. Some hard-liners had tried to block his ascent then, saying Muslims shouldn’t be ruled by a “kafir,” or nonbeliever. Mr. Purnama, now running for re-election, angered the groups again by citing a verse of the Quran in a public address in late September. He has apologized and said he would cooperate with a police investigation, but has since been the target of protests. Vice President Jusuf Kalla met a group of protest leaders and said afterward that police would pursue a blasphemy case against Mr. Purnama. Nearly 90% of Indonesia’s 250 million people are Muslim and are becoming more radical every year as seen by head scarves for women, once rare, are now widely worn and Islamic schools are expanding. A movement to ban alcohol is gaining steam and sales have been banned from convenience stores. Travel to Mecca for the minor pilgrimage of umrah, once a relatively uncommon undertaking for middle-class Indonesians, is newly popular. Security experts say the rising conservatism paves the way for potential violence , pointing to some religious hard-liners who have rebranded themselves as cells of Islamic State. “What we’ve seen in the last 18 months to two years is increasing crossover from organizations that started out ‘nonviolent but hard-line’ to organizations which are now committed to using violence,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Gang of Indonesian Muslim men (below) beat to death members of Ahmadiyah sect, which Muslims reject as part of Islam because of it’s call for non-violence.",0
3138,"House Freedom Caucus Member DeSantis: ’We Can Pass Something, Relatively Soon’ on Obamacare - Breitbart","On Friday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” House Freedom Caucus Member Representative Ron DeSantis ( ) stated that there’s “definitely a path” to an Obamacare bill, and that if they can deliver lower premiums and more choice, “I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon. ”  DeSantis said, “I think there’s definitely a path, Bill. I mean, if you remember this March 23rd date, where this kind of blew up, that was not any deadline. That was a   deadline. And what happened was, the bill really wasn’t ready for primetime. You hadn’t developed a consensus. You set a date to vote on it without having the consensus. And so, what’s happened since then, is members are talking to each other, and really the administration, I think has done a good job. Vice President Pence has been exercising a lot of leadership to try to figure out how do we actually fulfill the promises we made to the American people, and for me the core thing that we have to do is deliver lower premiums and more choice on private insurance, because that is the reason why people dislike Obamacare because their premiums have gone up and their deductibles have gone up. So, that’s really what we have to do, and I think if we can get there, I absolutely think we can pass something, relatively soon. ” DeSantis added that he thinks the House is getting closer to an Obamacare bill.

3139,"Kurds Fear the U.S. Will Again Betray Them, in Syria - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —   For almost two years, Syrian Kurds, with American weapons, air cover and training, have fought and died in battle against the Islamic State. They have taken pride in their status as the United States’ most faithful proxy in the fight against the militant group, and they have hoped their effectiveness as warriors would lead to American support for Kurdish political gains inside Syria. So, many Kurds shuddered when Turkish tanks and soldiers recently rolled into northern Syria, with American support, to push back against Kurdish gains. They saw it, perhaps prematurely, as a replay of a century of betrayal by world powers, going back to the end of World War I, when they were promised, then denied, their own state in the postwar settlement. “The Kurds are going to scream betrayal at every turn when they think things are not going to go their way, because they’ve had a century of it,” said Joost Hiltermann, the program director for the Middle East and North Africa at the International Crisis Group, and a longtime expert on the Kurds. The Syrian Kurds say their aim is to establish an autonomous region, not their own state, where their rights are protected, in whatever settlement comes from the long Syrian civil war. And they say they hope that the United States will support them in that desire. To accomplish that, though, they need to connect two of their territories: Afrin, in the west, and Kobani, in the east, an effort that Turkey sees as a national security threat to be thwarted at virtually any cost. So, while the first aim of Turkey’s incursion last month into northern Syria was to push the Islamic State from the border town of Jarabulus, many believe Turkey’s primary goal was to thwart Kurdish territorial ambitions. That the United States supported the move by Turkey, a NATO ally, reverberated among ethnic Kurds across the region, where they are spread across four countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey  —   and have long dreamed of their own state, while being oppressed by autocratic governments that have denied them basic political rights. “These operations by Turkey are obviously more against the Kurds than Daesh,” said Mahmoud Othman, a prominent Iraqi Kurdish politician, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. He added: “People are afraid now. People are really afraid of what could happen in the end. ” Drawing on history, Kurds see themselves as the playthings of world powers, used in proxy fights when it serves someone’s interest and then discarded. The United States, on balance, has arguably been a great friend to the Kurds, coming to their aid after the Persian Gulf war in the early 1990s and helping to establish an autonomous region for them in Iraq, safe from Saddam Hussein’s brutality. However, the United States also figures prominently in that historical memory of betrayal. In 1975, after the C. I. A. worked with Iran to supply weapons to the Kurds to fight Mr. Hussein’s regime, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger abruptly pulled the plug after a reconciliation between Tehran and Baghdad. “In 1975, the same betrayal of the Kurds happened,” said Hasos Hard, a Kurdish journalist in northern Iraq, when asked about his reaction to the American support for Turkey’s Syria incursion. Many analysts, though, as well as Syrian Kurdish fighters on the ground, say the accusations of betrayal are not quite right  —   at least not yet. There is little sign that the United States has abandoned the Syrian Kurds. American officials have worked to negotiate a truce on the ground between the rebels backed by Turkey and the Kurdish militia, known as the People’s Protection Units, and fighting has calmed in recent days. But many Kurds say they now see the writing on the wall and worry that once the Islamic State is driven from its capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the United States will sell them out. Mr. Hiltermann said that when he traveled to northern Syria this year, he was asked this question, over and over, by the Kurds: “What do you think the Americans will do when Raqqa is taken?” The question highlights the conundrum that the increasingly complicated Syrian battlefield presents the United States, which has tried to balance its relations with Turkey and the Syrian Kurds  —   a primary Turkish enemy because of their ties to militants inside the country. Even though the United States has funneled weapons to the Syrian Kurds and provided them with military training, it has not established ties to the militia’s political wing, the Democratic Union Party, because of Turkish concerns. Nor has it promised them anything beyond military support in the fight against the Islamic State, other than expressions of support for a Kurdish role at the negotiating table when, or if, serious peace talks get underway. Aliza Marcus, an author and expert on the Kurds, said, “It seems crass by the U. S. ” to provide military support without any steps to establish political ties. This seems especially true now, she said, after the Kurds took heavy casualties in pushing the Islamic State out of Manbij, a city in northern Syria they recently liberated, and are now being asked to leave because Turkey does not want them there. Lacking United States support, the Democratic Union Party has been shut out of Syrian peace talks that have been held in Geneva, and now there are increasing worries that Washington will eventually distance itself from the Syrian Kurds in a bid to improve relations with Turkey. “The U. S. themselves, they say, these are the best fighters against Daesh,” said Mr. Othman, referring to the People’s Protection Units. “These are the best allies. Hopefully they will stick to that, and help them, and not leave them in the end. ” The recent events stand in marked contrast to a year ago, when it seemed that the Kurds were capitalizing on the turmoil in the Middle East to make historic gains. In Syria, they had secured land and found a powerful benefactor in the United States. In Turkey, for the first time, a Kurdish political party entered Parliament after elections. In Iraq, amid the fight against the Islamic State, they took control of Kirkuk, a city historically divided between Arabs and Kurds. A year later, though, those prospects have dimmed. Iraq’s Kurds, somewhat insulated from the Syrian crisis, are pushing forward with their ambitions for independence, undaunted by an economic crisis. But in Turkey a   war has resumed between the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and the Turkish state, and the main Kurdish political party has been isolated from national politics. In Syria, the Turkish military has quashed the Kurds’ efforts to link their two territories. Further complicating matters, the Syrian conflict has become intertwined with Turkey’s domestic turmoil. Turkey now sees itself as fighting the Kurdistan Workers’ Party on three fronts: in Turkey, in northern Syria and in northern Iraq, where its members hide out in the mountains. As a result, analysts now say that there can be no final settlement of the Syrian civil war without the resumption of peace talks between Turkey and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, of which the Democratic Union Party is its Syrian affiliate. For now, the Kurds are still counting on the Americans to preserve them a place in a future Syrian state. “They should help them politically, to have rights in Syria,” Mr. Othman said. The Kurds, he said, “want a new Syria to be established, with them having a say in it. ” If nothing else, the American military support, even without any promises on the political front, has legitimized the Syrian Kurds’ ambitions. It has helped them to secure a large section of territory they say they will never give up, no matter what their patrons do. “Throughout history, the Kurds were abandoned,” said Ahmad Haj Mansour, a Democratic Union Party official who lives in Britain. “But now, the time and place is different. We don’t need world powers to survive. We are in charge of our land, and we have fighters. ”",0
3140,"Billy Ray Cyrus, Like Miley, Knows About Reinvention - The New York Times","Surrounded by images of music icons, Billy Ray Cyrus, the actor and country singer, saw a bit of himself in David Bowie. “Dude, that’s almost my frickin’ hairdo!” an elated Mr. Cyrus said on a recent afternoon after he caught a glimpse of the late rock god’s ’70s mullet on a   at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in SoHo. “I’m sending this to Miley,” Mr. Cyrus said, referring to his pop star daughter, while reaching for the garment. Even beyond appearances, it’s possible to see why both of them admire Mr. Bowie, that relentless pop chameleon. Mr. Cyrus, though never quite respected for his music or hairstyle, has managed to stretch his   charisma, distinctive look and willingness to engage with the kitschy and the lowbrow into a constantly regenerating career of nearly 25 years. By embracing his cowboy camp factor, and now his aging   essence, Mr. Cyrus, 54, has ambled down a surreal path from his first, biggest hit, “Achy Breaky Heart,” in 1992, to a varied acting résumé, including roles in David Lynch’s “Mulholland Drive” and Disney’s “Hannah Montana,” which made Miley a star. Along the way, there were detours to tabloid purgatory, borderline irrelevance and “Sharknado 2. ” And yet even after going Hollywood, Mr. Cyrus has enough juice in the   universe to carry an acerbic,   original series, “Still the King,” which premieres Sunday, June 12, on CMT. “I’ve reinvented a couple times in my career, at least,” said Mr. Cyrus, who has mostly laid low since Miley’s   cultural emancipation. “But how do you reinvent out of ‘Hannah Montana’?” he continued. “And then it hit me: A dysfunctional Elvis impersonator who lies his way into the church. That made sense. ” “I told Miley about it,” he added, “and she said, ‘Dad, that’s exactly what you need. ’” “Still the King,” a   comedy with a gritty Southern feel, finds Mr. Cyrus, a   of the show, playing an exaggerated take on the worst version of himself: “Burnin’ Vernon,” a louche   wonder scamming his way into a job as a preacher and into the life of the teenage daughter he didn’t know he had. Jayson Dinsmore, the executive vice president of development for CMT, said the show represents a new push for the network into premium scripted programming. He compared Mr. Cyrus’s role in “Still the King” to that of Larry David in the    comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm”  —   but with a star who’s “undeniably charming. ” “Sometimes we forget how successful Billy Ray has been,” he said. “He’s one of those people who has multigenerational fans. ” Also, Mr. Dinsmore added, Mr. Cyrus is “incredibly good looking  —   women flock to him,” a boon for a network whose viewers lean female. Mr. Cyrus, a Kentucky native and politician’s son, whose own   puts him somewhere between George W. Bush and Joe Biden in manner, said that, “I kind of traded my musical soul to be an actor. ” Despite never truly being welcomed into the country establishment, “I’m a   first and foremost” and not technically a   wonder, he said. “Some Gave All”  —   Mr. Cyrus’s first album  —   “had four hit singles on it,” he insisted, adding a few expletives for emphasis. “Here’s the damn truth: I’ve had more hits than any   wonder in the world. I don’t mean that as bragging because I wish that my name wasn’t even in that conversation. But if you look on Wikipedia, it’ll say that. ” Despite his early musical success, Mr. Cyrus saw the writing on the Nashville wall when his third album in three years failed to match the first two. “I said,   they’re coming after me,” Mr. Cyrus recalled. “The teeter has gone to totter  —   I’m on the way down. ” He cited his   songwriting, including an emphasis on the environment. “That’s the last thing they want to hear from me,” he said. Thus began one of the stranger recent sagas in American celebrity bootstrapping as Mr. Cyrus willed his family (six Cyrus children in all)  —   and especially the daughter born Destiny Hope Cyrus  —   into becoming a household name. Following in the footsteps of diversified country stars like Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton  —   and more recently, rappers like LL Cool J and Ice Cube  —   Mr. Cyrus aimed for longevity onscreen, first in an appropriately bizarre meeting with an auteurist director. “I had two stolen chickens in my agent’s car while I did the interview with David Lynch,” Mr. Cyrus said, having rescued the baby birds with Miley and her brother before they could become snake food at a petting zoo in Malibu. After he cameoed as the philandering pool guy in “Mulholland Drive,” Mr. Cyrus was cast as the lead  —   a Christian physician  —   in “Doc,” which ran from 2001 to 2004 on Pax TV. Ms. Cyrus   on the show and by 2006 had debuted as the   star Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel, with Mr. Cyrus appearing as her father, Robby Ray. What followed, along with more fame and fortune, was years of   (and parenting) scrutiny  —   Miley’s risqué Vanity Fair photos, the bong video, the twerking  —   that seems almost quaint in retrospect. “When you work as much in the business as we do, there’s gonna be peaks and valleys,” Mr. Cyrus said. “Fame is a dangerous thing, but when you volunteer for it, you have to accept that it ain’t all roses. ” “Here’s a lady singing about it right now,” he added, motioning to the speakers playing “Piece of My Heart” with Janis Joplin. For her part, Ms. Cyrus relishes a   relationship with her father these days. The pair prefers hanging at home, playing music together (she bought him a Tibetan singing bowl for his birthday)  —   “no TV on, just us talking, not on our phones or out to dinner for show,” she told this reporter last year. “I feel lucky that I’m his kid. When I sit with my dad, there’s a million things I could say that he could’ve done differently  —   as you could with any parent  —   but he’s the best dad I could’ve ever chosen. ” Though he stresses his outsider status, Mr. Cyrus, who favors distressed jeans, big sunglasses and western boots, also enjoys his insider connections. At the John Varvatos store on the Bowery, a staffer referred to Mr. Cyrus as a “friend of the brand,” gifting him an American flag scarf and leather jacket. Further downtown, while perusing the Morrison gallery’s rock ‘n’ roll photos, he told persuasive   stories, as if holding court on a barstool, of intimate interactions with the likes of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, George Jones and even Kurt Cobain. “I wrote a poem about Kurt the day he died called ‘The Circus,’” Mr. Cyrus said. It was about life under the spotlight. “That’s when I said to myself, I need to step back from this because I don’t want to die. ” Mr. Cyrus eased his hard living  —   his only real indulgence since the   is marijuana, he said, but “just about enough to keep me from drinking”  —   though his ambition hasn’t slowed. In addition to his 14th studio album, “Thin Line,” due for release in September, he has been writing an environmental horror film about “fracking and all the damage it’s doing  —   but with blood and guts,” he said. Raised in a family of Southern Democrats, Mr. Cyrus said he follows politics “probably much deeper than anyone would think,” though he stopped short of picking sides in the presidential election, saying only that he respects both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, whom he called “a very brave and very intelligent man. ” (His promotional tour for “Still the King,” with its potential   audience, included Fox News.) “If there’s a heavenly father, there’s gotta be a Mother Earth,” he said, echoing Miley’s own recent   tendencies. (“I have to tell you, she learned that off me,” he added.) He also spoke out recently on Facebook against laws that regulate transgender bathroom access, citing Ms. Cyrus’s involvement in LGBT issues. But   as ever, he shrugged off any suggestion that his continued relevance is due only to his   daughter. “I don’t worry about it,” Mr. Cyrus said, aviator glasses shining on a New York street. “I was here first. ”",0
3141,Few Expect China to Punish North Korea for Latest Nuclear Test - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   North Korea’s biggest nuclear test, conducted last week less than 50 miles from the Chinese border, sent tremors through homes and schools in China’s northeast. But hours later, there was no mention of the test on China’s   evening television news, watched by hundreds of millions of viewers. The decision on Friday to publicly ignore stark evidence of Pyongyang’s expanding nuclear capabilities illustrated the embarrassment that North Korea’s leader, Kim   poses for his patrons in Beijing. But although North Korea remains nearly 100 percent dependent on China for oil and food, Chinese analysts say Beijing will not modify its allegiance to North Korea or pressure the country to curtail its drive for a   nuclear arsenal, as the United States keeps requesting. “The United States cannot rely on China for North Korea,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. “China is closer to North Korea than the United States. ” China sees living with a     state on its border as preferable to the chaos of its collapse, Mr. Shi said. The Chinese leadership is confident that North Korea will not turn its weapons on China, and that China can control its neighbor by providing enough oil to keep its economy afloat. The alternative is a strategic nightmare for Beijing: a collapsed North Korean regime, millions of refugees piling into China and a unified Korean Peninsula under an American defense treaty. The Obama administration’s decision to deploy an advanced missile defense system in South Korea also gives President Xi Jinping of China less incentive to cooperate with Washington on a North Korea strategy that could aim, for example, to freeze the North’s nuclear capacity, the analysts said. The   missile defenses in South Korea, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad, have effectively killed any chance of China’s cooperating with the United States, they said. “China is strongly opposed to North Korea’s nuclear weapons but at the same time opposes the defense system in South Korea,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an assistant professor of international relations at Renmin University. It is not clear which situation the Chinese leadership is more agitated about, he said. Beijing interprets the Thaad deployment as another American effort to contain China. The system reinforces China’s view that its alliance with North Korea is an integral part of China’s strategic interests in Asia, with America’s treaty allies Japan and South Korea and tens of thousands of American troops close by, Mr. Shi said. Washington insists that the Thaad system, due to be installed in 2017, is intended to defend South Korea against North Korean missiles, and is not aimed at China. The system “does not change the strategic balance between the United States and China,” President Obama said after meeting with Mr. Xi in Hangzhou, China, a week ago. But China is not persuaded. Chinese officials argue that the Thaad radar can detect Chinese missiles on the mainland, undermining its nuclear deterrent. So despite what Chinese analysts describe as the government’s distaste for Mr. Kim and his unpredictable behavior, China’s basic calculus on North Korea remains firm. Mr. Xi is expected to continue to ensure that North Korea remains stable. The Chinese leader, 63, has shown disdain for the much younger Mr. Kim, 32. He has not invited him to China, and has authorized only sporadic visits by Chinese officials to Pyongyang. The two militaries remain largely uninvolved with each other. But the personal and professional antagonisms do not alter Beijing’s goal of preventing a unification of North and South Korea under an American defense arrangement. The longstanding fear that punitive economic action would destabilize North Korea makes it very unlikely that Beijing will cooperate with the United States on more stringent sanctions at the United Nations, according to Chinese analysts. In March, after considerable hesitation, China agreed to Washington’s appeals and signed on to tough United Nations sanctions that included a ban on the export of North Korean coal. Now, as the West moves toward another round of United Nations sanctions, China’s mood is very different, said a former senior Chinese official who worked on North Korea. He said some officials were wondering why China would work with the United States at the United Nations after Washington went ahead with the antimissile system against Chinese wishes. Meanwhile, the sanctions imposed in March have been enforced in only a desultory fashion, trade experts said. A loophole in the sanctions allows North Korean coal to be sold if the proceeds are used for humanitarian purposes, and that opening seems to have been exploited, said Stephan Haggard, a Korea expert at the University of California, San Diego. The sale of coal since the sanctions came into force was down 12 percent from the same period last year, a marginal amount, he said. On its own, the United States imposed   secondary sanctions on business entities that do business with North Korea and in the United States. But North Korean businesses have found Chinese partners or are creating front companies to use smaller Chinese banks, Mr. Haggard said. There are differing opinions in China about whether an oil embargo  —   an unlikely punishment  —   would result in Mr. Kim’s giving up his weapons. If China stopped the flow of oil, North Korea would face a severe economic crisis in about one year, and then face a choice between keeping its economy going or maintaining its nuclear program, the former senior official said. It is possible that at that point, Mr. Kim would negotiate, the former official said. But others disagree, saying the Chinese government would not dare cut the oil supply, knowing that North Korea would be able to get supplies from Russia and elsewhere. “The fundamental reason for not cutting oil is they don’t want to sacrifice the buffer zone, and they also know if they cut off the oil supply, it will not force Kim   to surrender his weapons,” Mr. Shi said. Mr. Shi questioned why China would want to risk making North Korea into an enemy by cutting off the oil supply. “If you cut off the oil, there is a 50 percent possibility North Korea will not surrender their weapons, and they will hate China even more,” he said. China’s continued support of North Korea is a fundamental reason the United States should stop relying on China for progress on reducing the North Korean nuclear threat, said Joel Wit, a visiting scholar at the U. S.  Institute at the School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Mr. Wit is among a group of American North Korea experts who believe the United States should take the lead and negotiate with the North.",0
3142,Scientists ‘Prove’ That The Soul Does Not DIE: It Returns To The UNIVERSE,"The debate about the existence of the soul and whether it is immortal or dies with the person is an endless story that for centuries has occupied the time of the great thinkers of universal history. Its mysterious nature continues to fascinate different areas of science, but now a group of researchers has discovered a new truth about it: the “soul” does not die; it returns to the universe. 


Since 1996, Dr. Stuart Hameroff, an American Physicist and Emeritus in the Department of Anesthesiology and Psychology, and Sir Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist at Oxford University, have worked in a Quantum Theory of Consciousness in which they state that the soul is maintained in microtubules of the brain cells.

Their ‘provocative’ theory states that the human soul is be contained by the brain cells in structures inside them called microtubules.

The two researchers believe the human brain is in fact a ‘biological computer’ and the ‘consciousness of humans’ is a program run by the quantum computer located inside the brain that even continues to exist after we ‘die.’

Furthermore, both scientists argue that what humans perceive as ‘consciousness’ is in fact the result of ‘quantum gravity’ effects located within the so-called ‘microtubules.’ This process is named by the two scientists “Orchestrated Objective Reduction” (Orch-OR). 

The theory indicates that when people enter a phase known as ‘clinical death,’ the microtubules located in the brain lose their quantum state but maintain the information contained within them. In other words – as experts explain it after people die, their soul returns to the universe, and it does not die’. 
Speaking to the Science Channel’s Through the Wormhole documentary, Dr. Hameroff said: 
“Let’s say the heart stops beating, the blood stops flowing; the microtubules lose their quantum state. The quantum information within the microtubules is not destroyed, it can’t be destroyed, and it just distributes and dissipates to the universe at large. If the patient is resuscitated, revived, this quantum information can go back into the microtubules and the patient says “I had a near-death experience.” If they’re not revived, and the patient dies, it’s possible that this quantum information can exist outside the body, perhaps indefinitely, as a soul.” 
According to this theory, the human souls are more than just ‘interactions’ of neurons in our brain and could have been present since the beginning of time.

3143,Pitched Battle Inside the FBI,"American Thinker November 1, 2016 
Is it a crisis yet? The fate of a criminal probe into the activities of a possible president has been fought behind closed doors. The nation’s premier investigative agency allegedly is riven by conflict over investigating Hillary Clinton’s email, the Clinton Foundation, and Anthony Weiner’s sexting. 
Devlin Barrett of the Wall Street Journal has apparently mined many sources at the FBI and the DoJ, along with other “people familiar with the matter,” and put together a remarkable piece that is providing a lot of new information. Unfortunately, it is behind a paywall, though I understand that the WSJ is offering very low initial subscription rates, as low as $4, which might be worth it even on a tight budget, considering the history unfolding before our eyes. 
Barrett identifies a timeline for the Weiner email trove that begins: 
… in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau’s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor , they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. The FBI lacked a warrant to read the emails, but they did examine the metadata, that showed “apparently … thousands” of them were from Hillary’s private email server. 
This led to a dramatic meeting: 
At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and FBI officials, a member of the department’s senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said. 
Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop’s contents could be relevant to the Clinton email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant. 
Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned the FBI that telling Congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an election, and some within the FBI have been unhappy at Mr. Comey’s repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his press conference on the subject in July. 
Barrett does not venture into speculation, but I believe that Comey had no choice at that point, because the news would have leaked out. Too many people knew of the discovery at this point (including, possibly, the NYPD , which may have gotten the Weiner probe going in the first place – we still don’t know). Many journalists (including me) in touch with active and retired FBI agents have heard of the extreme disappointment of many within the FBI community with Comey’s damage to the Bureau’s reputation. 
The meatiest reporting, however, covers the investigation of the Clinton Foundation, which Barrett characterizes as one of “ several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. Clinton and her inner circle” (emphasis added). 
New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the Clinton Foundation, sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity. 
Unnamed FBI agents are characterized as “viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity[.]” My guess is that the “senior law enforcement officials” voicing skepticism might be from Loretta Lynch’s staff. But they may include FBI officials.",0
3144,Donald Trump: ’I Wouldn’t Be Here If It Wasn’t for Twitter’ - Breitbart,"Appearing in an interview with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, President Donald Trump said he would not be where he was if it wasn’t for his ability to speak directly to Americans through Twitter. [“Well, let me tell you about Twitter,” Trump said to Carlson. “I think that maybe I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Twitter, because I get such a fake press, such a dishonest press. ”  The president also stated that he utilizes his “own form of media” and noted his massive following on the social network. “The news is not honest,” said President Trump. “Much of the news. It’s not honest. And when I have close to 100 million people watching me on Twitter, including Facebook, including all of the Instagram, including POTUS, including lots of things  —   but we have  —   I guess pretty close to 100 million people. I have my own form of media. ” President Trump also clarified his opinion of reporters in the media, saying, “Some of the press  —   by the way, some of the finest people I know are reporters. Reporters are wonderful. I’m talking about the fake media, the fake news. And there’s a lot of fake news. So if I’m not going to  —   if they’re not going to do me the honor and the public the honor of spreading my word accurately as it was meant, and you know exactly what I’m talking about, because there’s been nobody in history that got more dishonest media than I’ve gotten. ” “You look at some of the stories in The New York Times,” said Trump, “You look at some of the stories in The Washington Post. Take a look at what’s going on with CBS and NBC in particular and ABC  —   take a look at CNN. It’s a complete hit job. No matter what you do, no matter how good  —   no matter how great it is, they don’t report it in a positive fashion. ” Researchers at the University of Massachusetts published a study in December that examined how through Trump’s use of social media, “Twitter became news”: “He knew that he would get attention and it would go beyond Twitter  —   it would be reported on the news and in   comedy [shows],” said Professor Gross. Those   messages, which could be pulled up on screen by news programmes, served as “a mini press release” he added. The medium “made it easier to spread whatever he was thinking very quickly”. “In some sense Twitter made it easier to digest these and push them through the bloodstream of the American public,” said University of Massachusetts Assistant Professor of Political Science Justin Gross. Bloomberg also noted following the presidential election Trump’s successful use of Twitter in spreading his message, allowing him to “reach American voters constantly and without an editor. ” Watch President Trump’s full interview on Fox News below: Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

3145,Chicago Mayor: City Needs More Regulations on Federally Licensed Gun Dealers - Breitbart,"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) is pushing more gun control for Federal Firearms License holders (FFLs) in the city. [He couched the push as an attempt to fight straw purchases but did not mention that Illinois law already makes it illegal to sell a gun to someone who lacks the legal documentation to buy one and also prohibits someone from purchasing a gun for any individual who cannot legally purchase one themselves.  In fact, the   reports Illinois laws governing gun sales and transfers are some of the most stringent in the nation. Regarding the sale of guns: A person commits the offense of unlawful sale or delivery of firearms when he or she knowingly  …     Sells or transfers ownership of a firearm to a  …     person who does not display to the seller or transferor of the firearm either: (1) a currently valid Firearm Owner’s Identification Card that has previously been issued in the transferee’s name by the Department of State Police under the provisions of the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act or (2) a currently valid license to carry a concealed firearm that has previously been issued in the transferee’s name by the Department of State Police under the Firearm Concealed Carry Act. A violation of the Illinois law is a Class 4 felony that can result in up to three years in prison.  And in addition to the rules barring sales to those not possessing a FOID card or concealed carry permit, another law —  720 Ill. Comp. Stat.   .5 —  bars individuals from buying guns for persons prohibited from buying them for themselves: A person commits the offense of unlawful purchase of a firearm who knowingly purchases or attempts to purchase a firearm with the intent to deliver that firearm to another person who is prohibited by federal or State law from possessing a firearm. In addition to the Illinois laws against straw purchases, ATF form 4473 makes clear that the purchaser of the gun must be the actual buyer of the gun as well. This is a federal regulation against straw purchases that is in addition to the state laws. Yet Emmanuel thinks more laws and regulations are in order.

3146,Australian Site Could Rival Stonehenge As World’s Oldest Observatory,"posted by Eddie Scientists studying ancient stone arrangement alongside Aboriginal traditional owners in Australia’s Victorian bush say the site could pre-date Stonehenge and even Egypt’s Great Pyramids. But Wurdi Youang, as it’s known by the people of the Wada Warrung nation, is apparently not the only mysterious stone circle in Australia — just the most intact. Monash University astronomer Dr. Duane Hamacher has been studying Indigenous Australian astronomy for years, and told ABC’s Lateline he believes the Wurdi Youang structure could date back more than 11,000 years. If that’s proven, it will be yet another example of the world’s longest surviving culture’s innovations pre-dating their better known European equivalents. “Some academics have referred to this stone arrangement here as Australia’s version of Stonehenge,” Dr Hamacher said on the program Wednesday. “I think the question we might have to ask is: is Stonehenge Britain’s version of Wurdi Youang? Because this could be much, much older.” Traditional owners like Bryon Powell and the scientists they’re working with say the stones have possible solar indications, marking the movements of the sun over the year, including the summer solstice, equinox and winter solstice. A sacred sundial, if you will. The egg-shaped area is fifty metres wide and contains over 100 basalt boulders. After being noted by early European settlers and recorded by archaeologists in 1977, Wurdi Youang was only relatively recently given the attention it deserves as a site once sacred and significant. Local custodian Reg Abrahams sees the site as playing a role in contesting the increasingly-dated disproved notion that Indigenous Australians were simply nomadic hunter-gatherers. “If you’re going to have a stone arrangement where you mark off the seasons throughout the year with the solstices and equinoxes, it kind of makes sense if you’re at least most of the year in one specific location to do that,” he told the ABC. He continued: “You see a lot of agricultural and aquacultural practices, so evidence of this agriculture may go back tens of thousands of years, pre-dating what anthropologists commonly think of as the dawn of agriculture which is about 6,000 years ago in Mesopotamia.” Mysterious Mullimbimby site Wurdi Youang is just one of many stone arrangements created by Aboriginal nations that have been recorded across Australia, including in Carisbrook, Victoria and outside Mullumbimby, northern New South Wales. The site 40 kilometres outside of Mullumbimby is the stuff of legend. But a few amateur archaeologists say it’s based on much more than hearsay. It was said to contain 181 large standing pieces of sandstone — with the nearest sandstone deposit located over 20 kilometres away. In 2015, a teacher at the Brunswick Valley Historical Society, Richard Patterson unearthed letters from 1939 president of the Australian Archaeological and Education Research Society, Frederic Slater . “The mound is one of the oldest; I should say the oldest, forms of temples in the world and dates back to the Palaeolithic age with the advent of first man,” Slater is alleged to have written. Slater documented inscriptions from the site’s stones, which he said were made up of hand signs, letters and “sacred signs” that amounted to 28,000 words in the ancient language. In the 1940, the site was reportedly bulldozed by the farmer with a deed to the land, following government threats to seize his property, making further investigation virtually impossible. 
A documentary on Indigenous astronomy called Star Stories of the Dreaming was released earlier this year, featuring the CSIRO’s Ray Norris and Euahlayi lawman Ghillar Michael Anderson sharing Indigenous belief systems associated with astronomy. Source:",0
3147,We Are Winning Again: Consumer Confidence Booms to Highest Level in 16 Years - Breitbart,"Consumer’s confidence in March rocketed to the highest level more than 16 years, according to data released Tuesday.  America’s middle class, in particular, registered huge gains in confidence. [The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index soared to 125. 6 in March, up from 116. 1 in February. Economists had expected a decline to 114. 1.  Measures of consumer and business confidence continue to defy experts by climbing ever higher since the election of President Donald Trump. Despite media reports of hate crimes and an ongoing narrative that America has unentered a period of uncertainty and   surveys of consumers show that Americans are feeling better than they have for nearly all of this century. The rise in confidence since the election has widespread, cutting across regional and income groups. The biggest rise in confidence came from middle earners. The confidence index for households with incomes between $50, 000 and $75, 000 has risen from 100. 4 prior to the election to 135. 2. Households with incomes between $35, 000 and $50, 000 registered a rise from 79. 9 to 113. 4. Only those with incomes below $15, 000 are less confident now than before the election. Consumers are more confident about both their present situations and their expectations for the future, according to the Conference Board. Confidence in the jobs market has improved as well, with those saying jobs are “plentiful” rising while those claiming jobs are “hard to get” falling.",0

[Principle David Frankel sent a note home to parents saying, “Students were instructed that physical contact including tag games, touch football, etc. were not allowed on the yard. ”  Why would this   tradition of playground fun get the axe? According to school district spokesman Daniel Thigpen, things had gotten just a bit too physical. Thigpen explained, “In this case, kids were getting too rough  …    so the school told them to stop playing those games  …     It’s not uncommon for a school to enact specific recess rules to address specific behavior problems. ” Students will face disciplinary action should they not comply. The punishments will begin with a referral, and then a   conference, according to school officials. According to The Daily Mail, the school has claimed that the note was only sent home to some parents, and there’s some confusion over whether the ban applies to all students.   Mallory Giddens is not a fan of the new rule. Giddens told KOVR television, “I don’t really like it. I mean I don’t really play tag but I don’t think it’s fair to everyone else that plays tag!” Giddens continued, “My principal, he doesn’t want us to have tag at school because people, they touch too hard.

3149,Families of Terror Victims Urge FIFA to Act Against Palestinian Soccer Chief Incitement to Terror,"TEL AVIV  —   More than 30 Israeli families who lost relatives to terror attacks have signed a letter to FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, accusing the Palestine Football Association (PFA) and its president, Jibril Rajoub, with severe violations of its statutes, including incitement to terrorism. [The letter charges the PFA with breaching two provisions of FIFA’s Statutes and two of the association’s Disciplinary Code.  Included in those violations are Palestinian soccer competitions named after Palestinian terrorists, such as an annual contest named in honor of PLO founder Khalil    who, according to Palestinian sources, was behind the deaths of more than 120 Israelis. Rajoub himself, the letter says, has glorified violence and incited Palestinians, lauded recent terror attacks as “individual acts of bravery” and noted that “he is proud” of the perpetrators. He has also compared Israeli Jews to Satan. In February 2014 he called for the abduction of Israelis. Later that year three Israeli teenagers, Gilad Shaer, Naftali Frenkel and Eyal Yifrach, were kidnapped and murdered. Rajoub subsequently congratulated Hamas for carrying out the triple attack. He was quoted saying, “If we had a nuke, we’d have used it [against Israel] this very morning. ” The letter also said PFA’s boycott of Israel ran contradictory to FIFA’s commitment to using soccer as a “bridge to peace. ” Rajoub has called for the expulsion of the Israel Football Association (IFA) and may use an upcoming FIFA summit in Bahrain to promote the idea again. “We are aware that the Palestinian demand to expel the Israeli Football Association may be raised at the FIFA Council and Congress, respectively on 9 and 11 May,” said Shimon Samuels, the European representative of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC). “We call, on the contrary, for the Palestinian Football Association to be expelled until all names of terrorists are removed from Palestinian teams, tournaments and stadiums. ” Ronald Lauder  —   president of the World Jewish Congress (WJC)  —   wrote to FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Thursday, telling him, “The campaign of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) to sanction Israel has no place on the FIFA Congress agenda. ” Rajoub himself is a former terrorist who spent 15 years in Israeli jails before being released in a 1985 prisoner swap. He has served in several senior positions in the PA, including chief of its secret police. Among the bereaved family members who signed the letter to FIFA were Brenda and Nachum Lemkus, whose daughter Dalia was slain in November 2014, and Doron Mizrahi, father of Ziv Mizrachi, who was murdered in November 2015. Brenda Lemkus said: “Our darling daughter Dalia was murdered as a result of the constant incitement of the Palestinians and their glorification of terrorists. When we heard that the incitement and glorification of terrorists was so widespread in Palestinian football, we didn’t think twice about joining the campaign and signing a complaint. ” Itamar Marcus, the director of Israeli monitoring group Palestinian Media Watch, which was in charge of gathering evidence against the PFA and Rajoub, said that if FIFA neglected to address the letter, “it will be a disgrace for all the member associations and a permanent stain of FIFA’s reputation. ” Last month, Rajoub received a court summons and compensation lawsuit for $250 million upon landing at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York over his alleged involvement in the killing of an   citizen in 1995. Azam Rahim’s family, who live in the state of Texas, served the court summons on Tuesday. According to the charge sheet, on September 29, 1995 Rahim was arrested by Preventive Security officials and taken to a security facility where he was tortured to death.",0
3150,"Elder Bush Plans to Vote for Hillary Clinton, a Kennedy Says - The New York Times","Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the eldest child of Robert F. Kennedy, said in a Facebook post on Monday that the elder President George Bush told her that he planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. The former president, however, is not talking. Ms. Townsend, 65, a former lieutenant governor of Maryland who on Facebook uses her middle name, Hartington, posted a picture of her shaking Mr. Bush’s hand. “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary! !” the caption said. Jim McGrath, a spokesman for the former president, 92, would neither confirm nor deny Ms. Townsend’s claim. “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,” Mr. McGrath said in an email. “He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim. ” Ms. Townsend’s post was  reported on Monday by Politico. CNN posted a screen shot of the post, which did not appear to have been made public on Ms. Townsend’s Facebook page. Ms. Townsend told Politico that she had met with the former president in Maine earlier in the day. A report in The Texas Tribune in May, several months after Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, dropped out of the presidential race, quoted Mr. McGrath saying that the former president was not planning to make a public endorsement. “President Bush is retired from politics,” McGrath wrote in an email then. “He came out of retirement to do a few things for Jeb, but those were the exceptions that proved the rule. ” Former President George W. Bush, Mr. Bush’s oldest son, was also not planning on making a public endorsement, his aide Freddy Ford said at the time. Neither of the former presidents attended the Republican convention, though the younger Mr. Bush has campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates for Senate, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Many influential Republicans, including various members of both Bush administrations, have said they will not vote for the party’s nominee, Donald J. Trump. In June, Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary under George W. Bush, wrote an   article announcing that he would be casting a vote for Mrs. Clinton, making him one of several members of the last Republican presidential administration who have said they would be voting for the Democratic candidate.",0

By A.J. Higgins 
A New York personal finance technology company is giving Maine high marks for its efforts to encourage veterans to re-enter the work force and take advantage of veterans programs. 
Asees Singh, of SmartAssets, says that Maine ranks sixth in the country when it comes to several key programs. 
“When veterans come back from serving, the process to adjusting to civilian life can be really difficult for them,” Singh says. “A survey from Pew Research Center found that 27 percent of veterans had a difficult time re-acclimating to civilian life.” 
SmartAssets’ survey concluded that Maine should be proud of the fact that 10.5 percent of all private businesses in the state are owned by veterans.

3153,Why Uber Keeps Raising Billions - The New York Times,"It feels like almost every other week there is a new headline about Uber raising more money. “Uber Closes $1. 6 Billion in Financing. ’’ “Uber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3. 5 Billion Cash Infusion. ’’ Last week, we got this one: “Uber to Raise Up to $2 Billion in   Market. ’’ If you add up all the money Uber has raised since it started in 2009  —   the idea was born when its founders became annoyed that they could not get a cab in Paris  —   the   app company is on its way to amassing a colossal $15 billion. That’s real cash, not some     valuation. (That figure is $68 billion.) It has done all this while still managing to remain a private company, and its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has insisted that a public offering is not coming soon. “I’m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,” he has repeatedly said. Consider this: When Amazon went public in 1997, it raised $54 million and was valued at $438 million. So what exactly is Uber doing with all that money? And what does it say about Uber  —   and the financial markets  —   that the company has turned most recently to selling the equivalent of junk bonds? Yes, Uber has to finance an   war to gain market share in China and India. But there is more to it than that: Uber’s   is seemingly part of an unspoken strategy to mark its territory. Every time Uber raises another $1 billion, venture capital investors and others may find it less attractive to back one of Uber’s many rivals: Didi Chuxing, Lyft, Gett, Halo, Juno. In other words, Uber’s   efforts have seemingly become part of the contest: It’s not just a rivalry over customers and drivers it’s a war of attrition, a mad scramble to starve the competition of cash. At the moment, Uber’s success has had the opposite effect: It has spawned a long list of rivals, big and little guys who say, “We can do it too. ” But over time, as the smaller competitors run out of cash  —   after heavily subsidizing riders in an effort to steal business from Uber  —   venture capitalists should be less inclined to put up even more cash to go up against Fortress Uber. Uber’s   arms race comes against the backdrop of falling valuations for many Silicon Valley unicorns  —   private companies worth $1 billion or more. So there’s clearly a rush to take the money while it’s still available. “It’s not the second inning or even the sixth, it’s the 14th inning in a   baseball game,” Bill Gurley, the famed venture capitalist who has as a stake in Uber and sits on its board, warned on his blog about the state of Silicon Valley. He alerted investors about unicorns that come to them seeking funds: “You are not being invited to a special dance, you are being approached because you are the lender of last resort. ” The   industry has long been seen as a   game because of the “network effect”: The more customers sign up for Uber, the more drivers sign up, making it tougher for rivals to mount competition. There will most likely be only one or two significant players in any given market. (More on that in a moment, because there might be some cracks emerging in that point of view.) The question is whether the financing game is   too. And the even larger question is whether Uber’s   capital investments could ultimately act as a deterrent to investors who might consider supporting Uber’s competitors: Will they look at Uber’s balance sheet  —   it has some $6 billion in cash just sitting there  —   and throw up a white flag? So far, Uber is clearly winning the valuation game: It is worth more than virtually all of its rivals combined. But Uber still has formidable competition in the   arena: Didi, the market leader in China that is engaged in a   battle with Uber, just raised $7 billion,  some of which came from Apple. (Mr. Kalanick, too, was hoping to raise money from Apple and had planned to meet with executives at the iPhone maker the same week Apple announced its investment in Didi.) Perhaps strangely, several of the same investors that have backed Uber are also backing Didi in China, including BlackRock and Tiger Global, so it is hard to say that one service is deterring investment in the other  —   at least not yet. (It is worth noting that among the investor class, some may be hoping that Uber might one day merge its Chinese operation with Didi.) Uber’s most recent   effort  —   focused on the leveraged loan market  —   aims to avoid diluting the current base of shareholders. It has hired Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to sell about $2 billion in loans. By avoiding a traditional round of financing, the company also avoids the company having to risk trying to sell itself at an even higher valuation. Given the remarkably low interest rates, investors looking for yield may buy into Uber. Uber says it is profitable in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Australia  —   if you factor out taxes and interest payments. The challenge for Uber is breaking into China and India, perhaps the two largest markets in the world. Uber is currently on track to lose about $2 billion annually in those markets as it heavily subsidizes customers and drivers to gain market share. That means that Uber will have to pay up for the financing. But if Uber’s valuation continued to grow, it would be a bargain compared with the value of the equity. Uber is hoping to sell debt with a yield of about 4 or 4. 5 percent. Uber’s I. P. O. will probably come to pass in the next three to four years. That’s because some of the convertible debt it previously issued provides investors with a special discount if the company has not gone public by then. But by 2018 or 2019, at the rate Uber is going, who knows how much money Uber will have raised. It may need none. The question is whether it will have starved all of its competitors along the way.",0

3155,There Should be No Special Deal for Tax-Evading Cameco,"Cameco, the Saskatchewan-based uranium mining colossus, is currently in Federal Court facing charges by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that it illegally avoided a stunning $2.2 billion in Canadian income taxes. It is not only the largest such case in Canadian history but one of the most shameless tax dodges ever hatched by a Canadian corporation. The court case has been delayed for years and just the fact that it has finally made it before a judge is good news. But the news could quickly turn bad if, facing defeat, Cameco makes a pitch to settle for less than the full amount. That would be a miscarriage of justice.
It is absolutely critical that the government not make a deal with Cameco for a smaller sum — as often happens in these cases. Because this is no ordinary case. Cameco is a rogue corporation, contemptuous of the country it operates in, and so arrogant in its tax avoidance scheme that it can’t even bother to try to justify it. Confronted by the facts, Cameco just repeats its executive mantra: “We believe that it was established in accordance with sound business principles and in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.”
At a time when more and more attention is being paid to off-shore tax havens and the billions we lose to them, Canada needs to make an example of this irresponsible corporate “citizen.”
Here’s the bare bones of the scheme. In 1999 Cameco decided to dramatically reduce its income tax bill by setting up a subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax rate is 10 per cent — compared to the (then) Canadian rate of about 27 per cent. At the time the price was at rock bottom — $10 a pound. That’s the price the Saskatchewan head office charged its Swiss “subsidiary.” Then came the windfall manoeuvre: Cameco drafted a 17-year uranium supply agreement at a fixed price of $10 a pound. It was simplicity itself: Cameco would sell literally all of its uranium through the Swiss subsidiary and it would sell it for whatever the world price was. That world price went to almost $140 a pound in 2007 and is now around $35. All the revenue earned above $10 a pound was taxed in Switzerland at the low rate. (An insignificant amount is actually sold in Europe and, of course, not an ounce of the stuff ever finds its way to Zug.)
This scheme is known as “transfer pricing” and sometimes it is perfectly legitimate — companies that sell their products in multiple countries “sell” them to subsidiaries which then sell them in their jurisdiction and get taxed on the profits. But more and more multinationals have been abusing the law that allows this — including Apple, “based” in Ireland, which is now facing a US$15-billion tax bill from the European Commission for its abuse of transfer pricing.
But Apple actually sold its products in European countries and has 5,500 employees in Ireland. Cameco? Not so much. According to a 2014 Globe and Mail story :
“While Cameco says Cameco Europe has its own board of directors and a full-time CEO, documents in the case reveal the European company had no other full-time employees, and no stand-alone office, instead renting space from the law firm performing its legal work.”
Virtually all the substantive work was performed in Canada.
All of the uranium is mined in Canada, all of Cameco’s sales are negotiated and completed in Canada, and literally all of its profits are generated in Canada. The company’s scheme is pure scam which is why fair-tax activists in Saskatchewan call the company Scameco. A citizens’ group, Saskatchewan Citizens for Tax Fairness, has been on Cameco’s case for several years — paying for a billboard demanding Cameco pay up and collecting 36,000 names on a petition which it presented to the federal government.
But it isn’t just citizens’ groups looking askance at Cameco. Investment research firms, like Veritas, have questioned the company’s scheme. In 2013 company analyst Pawel Rajszel stated :
“[A]ll the upside has been transferred to the subsidiary. Meanwhile all the risk has stayed with Cameco Canada. … It’s strange that the company would have created this Swiss subsidiary without having any real operations in Switzerland.”
A Veritas report concludes: “It is therefore difficult to see a reasonable business purpose to [Cameco Europe’s] existence, beyond tax minimization.” In a further comment, Mr. Rajszel told The Globe and Mail in 2014: “Based on our review of Cameco’s [first quarter] results, the dispute with the CRA may force the company to borrow funds and/or cut its dividend in order to finance the back tax payments.” Does that suggest Cameco’s clever tax dodge could actually expose it to a charge of failing to carry out its fiduciary duty to its shareholders?
Another business-focussed group has been sniffing around Cameco’s problems. The Bottom Line , a Canadian publication which bills itself as a “Forensic Accounting and Fraud” magazine, has been in contact with Saskatchewan Citizens for Tax Fairness about the case.
Companies like Cameco have for too long framed the tax haven issue as business as usual. But that is now clearly changing and people are starting to see this behaviour for what it is: the legalized theft of Canadian government services. Cameco started off as a public mining company and its technology was developed in Canada with the help of Saskatchewan government money. The Canadian transportation infrastructure allows them to get their uranium to market, they have enjoyed decades in a stable economy, with low inflation, cheap money, low crime and the legal protection accorded a “corporate citizen” under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Their workers received free and/or subsidized education and Cameco doesn’t have to pay health insurance for its employees — as companies in the U.S. do. Adding insult to injury, the (federal) taxes Cameco is avoiding are amongst the lowest in the developed word: 15 per cent compared, for example, to 35 per cent in the U.S.
Ironically — or maybe not — while the CRA is going after Cameco, Saskatchewan’s unabashedly pro-business premier Brad Wall has said almost nothing about the case (the timid NDP opposition has said even less). That seems a bit strange given that Saskatchewan’s share of the proceeds, if the CRA wins, would be over $700 million. Governments may govern in the era of globalization, but giant companies rule. It is long past time that we put a stop to it. A great first step would be for the CRA to refuse to negotiate and get all of our money back. Then we need to change the law.

3156,The Curse of a Phoenix Weatherman: Finding New Ways to Say ‘It’s Hot’ - The New York Times,"PHOENIX  —   There are certain unspoken talents required of television meteorologists in Phoenix, where the sun shines 296 days of the year and temperatures exceeding 100 degrees faze no one. One such skill is the ability to make the weather sound new each day. As a meteorologist for 12 News, Phoenix’s NBC affiliate, Matt Pace aims to make the recurring sunshine interesting, which is no easy task. I’ve watched Mr. Pace on the air as he searches for just the right words, from a limited list of options, to convey the very straightforward fact that it is so darn hot outside. “I go, ‘It’s hot,’ or, ‘It’s above average,’ or, ‘It’s going to be extremely warm today,’” he said on a   day, from the safety of a Starbucks where he sipped a strawberry smoothie to “take the edge off the heat,” as he put it. “There’s also, ‘It’s really hot out there,’ or, ‘It’s hot, hot, hot,’ or just, ‘Triple hot! ’” On Twitter  —   where Mr. Pace’s often funny, always informative posts often end in exclamation points  —   it may well come to this: There are times when the best approach is to scrap adjectives or superlatives altogether, face the camera and declare, “The high is going to be 118 degrees today. ” When it’s that hot, Mr. Pace said, simplicity is the best way to drive the point across. Before delivering forecasts on TV, Mr. Pace, who has a Ph. D. in meteorology and climatology, was part of a team of meteorologists who monitored the weather from the edge of a runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, where the city’s official temperatures are recorded. (It also happens to be one of the warmest places in Phoenix.) He was basically the official whose temperature readings and assessments of visibility during dust storms might force the tower to suspend takeoffs. “I normally worked the overnight shift, when it was cooler,” he said, drawing quotation marks in the air as he said the word “cooler” to highlight what everyone who lives here knows all too well: that “cooler” has another meaning in Phoenix. During the peak of summer, overnight temperatures hardly drop below 90 degrees. But, as they say, it’s a dry heat, at least when it’s not monsoon season, with its powerful   storms. “What the dry heat means,” Mr. Pace said, “is that it might be 111 degrees, but it will feel like 107. ” He took another sip from his smoothie. “I know that still feels ridiculously hot,” he said. “But I think there’s also this psychological thing to living here: You walk outside and you know it will be hot. People just accept it. ”",0
3157,The Banishment Of Trump Has Begun As The American People Are Tuning Him Out,"By Jason Easley on Fri, Oct 28th, 2016 at 10:57 am It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
It is a cruel reality of American electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse, and that process has already begun for Donald Trump. 
Despite the fact that Trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged, stolen, or unfair, his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears. The latest Washington Post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by 12 points from 31%-43%. The number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from 47%-37%, and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from 34% to 28%. Even Trump supporters are split 50%-49% on whether or not votes will be counted accurately. 
Part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that President Obama did in addressing these concerns, but it is most likely that voters are treating Trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election. 
One of the best indicators of a presidential election’s outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win. 
Hillary Clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election, which is a hint of the way that people are voting. 
The process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the US two party system. Losing candidates who refuse to go away, like Sarah Palin, are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up. 
Trump’s fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end. His words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level, which is why he still needs to be discussed, but as far as changing minds and winning an election, it looks voters are in the process of banishing Trump from the political island.",0
3158,"In Democratic Debate, Clinton and Sanders Spar Over Judgment - The New York Times","Senator Bernie Sanders, seizing on potential vulnerabilities for Hillary Clinton in the coming New York primary, repeatedly savaged her ties to wealthy donors and Wall Street banks during their debate on Thursday night, delivering a ferocious performance that Mrs. Clinton countered with steely confidence and her own sharp elbows. Mr. Sanders, hoping to humiliate Mrs. Clinton in her adopted home state in Tuesday’s primary, bluntly challenged her fitness for the presidency, saying she had the experience and intelligence for the job but adding, “I do question her judgment. ” He listed her most controversial actions over the years, from voting to authorize the American invasion of Iraq to supporting some   deals and taking $675, 000 in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. While he did not repeat his recent remark that she was unqualified to be president, he constantly edged up to the line. “Do we really feel confident about a candidate who says she will bring change in America when she is so dependent on big money interests?” Mr. Sanders asked. “I don’t think so. ” Mrs. Clinton fought back hard, especially in a fierce exchange over Israel, as the two candidates played to a rambunctious and roaring audience at the Brooklyn Navy Yard: a classic New York crowd that interrupted, booed and cheered in sports arena style, creating a highly charged atmosphere. The forum also revealed the increasing animosity between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, who no longer offer each other the polite rejoinders and carefully couched criticisms that characterized the early part of the campaign. Feisty and frequently sarcastic, Mr. Sanders could barely contain his disgust with Mrs. Clinton’s ties with Wall Street, a ripe target among liberals in New York City and in economically depressed upstate regions. After Mrs. Clinton said she had stood up to bankers and “called them out” on their shaky financial practices before the recession, Mr. Sanders delivered his retort with the flair of a veteran Broadway actor. “Secretary Clinton called them out  —   oh my goodness, they must have been really crushed by this,” Mr. Sanders said. “And was that before or after you received huge sums of money by giving speaking engagements?” Mrs. Clinton, who is comfortably ahead in polls of New York voters, seemed to relish taking swings at Mr. Sanders. “Make no mistake about it  —   this is not just an attack on me, it’s an attack on President Obama,” Mrs. Clinton said about the criticism of her use of a “super PAC” and her acceptance of   contributions. As many audience members booed, Mrs. Clinton grinned a little before saying, “This is a phony attack that is designed to raise questions when there is no evidence or support to undergird the insinuations. ” Mr. Sanders needs a landslide victory in New York to improve his slim chances at the Democratic nomination, and throughout the debate he appeared on the hunt for any new advantage. He highlighted a recent report about the failure of banks to plan for their own demise as evidence that his regulatory plans, and not Mrs. Clinton’s, were tough enough to rein in bank executives. He pointed to some polls indicating that he would be a stronger opponent than Mrs. Clinton in a general election against Donald J. Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. Mrs. Clinton showed a determination to deal a devastating blow to Mr. Sanders in the New York primary, and she sought to lay the groundwork on Thursday night with the issue of Israel, which evolved into one of the more memorable exchanges of the evening. In New York, where candidates traditionally compete with one another to align themselves with Israel’s interests, it was startling to see a major Democratic candidate, Mr. Sanders, unapologetically challenge the actions of the Israeli government and call for evenhanded treatment of Palestinians. “If we are ever going to bring peace to that region,” Mr. Sanders said, “we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity. ” He added, “That does not make me  . ” Mrs. Clinton jumped on her rival. “I negotiated the   between Israel and Hamas in November of 2012,” she said. “They do not seek this kind of attacks. They do not invite rockets parading down on their towns and villages. ” Mr. Sanders said Mrs. Clinton was “evading” a major issue: whether she believes that Israel responds disproportionately to attacks, such as during the 2014 assault on Gaza. And he was sharply critical of Mrs. Clinton’s stance on Palestinians, twice bringing up her recent speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, an influential   lobbying group. “I heard almost no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people,” he said of the speech. Mr. Sanders came in for some of his toughest treatment from the debate moderators, led by Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash of CNN, who questioned him aggressively about his grasp of banking regulations and his struggle to provide policy details during an interview with The Daily News’s editorial board. Ms. Bash also challenged Mr. Sanders to give an example of how Mrs. Clinton was unduly influenced by big banks, to which he cited the financial excesses and greed that led to the recession. “The obvious response to that is that you’ve got a bunch of fraudulent operations and they’ve got to be broken up,” Mr. Sanders said. “Now, Secretary Clinton was busy giving speeches to Goldman Sachs for $225, 000 a speech. So the proper response, in my view, is we should break them up. ” Mrs. Clinton drew strong applause when she bluntly said her opponent had dodged the question, adding, “He cannot come up with any example because there is no example. ” The debate was in many ways the sum of the previous eight. Mr. Sanders has grown steadily more assertive and combative since the Democrats’ first debate in October, when he passed up opportunities to attack Mrs. Clinton over her Iraq war vote and her speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. He now raises those issues almost daily in an attempt to win over voters by drawing sharp contrasts between his and Mrs. Clinton’s policy records. He has also been trying to appeal to a broader audience, including   and Hispanics, beyond the liberals and young people who were his focus in the early debates. Mrs. Clinton has remained a polished and nimble performer throughout the debate season, which nearly ended in March as the two campaigns bickered about holding a debate in New York before the primary. The campaigns have also discussed holding one in May  —   perhaps in California, before its June 7 primary  —   though no final agreement has been reached. As aggressive as Mr. Sanders acted in the debate, he has very limited ability to overtake Mrs. Clinton in their critical competition to amass the 2, 383 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. Despite his winning seven of the last eight primaries and caucuses, he continues to trail Mrs. Clinton by 220 pledged delegates. And his chances of catching up are about to get harder: The New York primary will open a period in which the map of nomination contests shifts back in Mrs. Clinton’s favor, with several large states holding primaries instead of caucuses. The most uncomfortable moment for Mrs. Clinton came when the debate turned to the 1994 crime bill, which put 100, 000 more police officers on the streets, built new prisons and banned certain types of assault weapons. The bill, which Mr. Sanders voted for and Mrs. Clinton supported as first lady, has been widely criticized as contributing to the mass incarceration of   and to tensions between police officers and black communities. Mr. Sanders minced no words about Mrs. Clinton’s use of the term “superpredators” to describe urban gang members in a 1996 speech. And he explained why he had criticized former President Bill Clinton this week for standing up for Mrs. Clinton on the issue. “It was a racist term, and everybody knew it was a racist term,” he said, setting off rousing cheers from the crowd. Mrs. Clinton has said she regrets using the term, and on Thursday night, she had no problem putting the blame for the crime bill on her husband. “He was the president who actually signed it,” she said. Mrs. Clinton continually tried to make her opponent appear less versed on policy nuances, frequently diving into   policy issues. Asked about her paid speeches to Wall Street banks, she pivoted, saying she was “the only one on this stage who did not vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives as Senator Sanders did. ” Pressed again to release the transcripts of her paid speeches, Mrs. Clinton called on Mr. Sanders to release his tax returns. Mr. Sanders, in response, said he would release his 2014 tax returns on Friday. The audience frequently seemed on the side of Mr. Sanders, with many people chanting along with him as he said his average campaign contribution was $27. But Mrs. Clinton also earned cheers, which she acknowledged with a knowing smile as she cast herself as the hometown candidate. “I love being in Brooklyn  —   this is great,” Mrs. Clinton said.",0

Russia continues a halt on airstrikes in Aleppo as rebels led by al Qaeda launched an offensive in Aleppo. Turkey masses forces on borders. Experts warn of open-ended conflict with Russia. US politicians continue to accuse Russia of meddling with elections as damning material is exposed. And more from our latest roundup…
Russian Carrier Group in the Mediterranean _ The Russian carrier group is in the Mediterranean. Russian defense minister Shoigu said the fact that NATO countries denied them call at their ports along the way did not affect them as they were replenished by supply ship s.
_ Ruptly published video on Tuesday of the carrier group in the western Med doing helicopter and fighter jet takeoffs and landings.
Mosul _ Iraqi forces moved on Mosul as the battle has entered a new phase of urban warfare. Iraqi forces fought ISIS on the eastern side of Mosul and “artillery and air strikes pounded the city, still home to 1.5 million people.” Civilians from eastern Mosul , and residents of the eastern neighborhood of al-Quds said the “ultra-hardline Sunni militants had resorted to street fighting to try to hold the army back,” according to Reuters .
_ Iraqi special forces Gen. Shaghati held a press conference, saying: “ This is a good sign for the people of Mosul because the battle to liberate Mosul has effectively begun .” His troops captured a state TV building in Mosul. But reportedly there were also complications . Some of Shaghati’s men raised a Shi’ite flag. A brawl broke out between “Kurdish peshmerga fighters and mainly Arab Iraqi commandos” at a checkpoint on the Mosul-Erbil road, where they threatened to shoot each other. Christians waiting at the checkpoint for hours, scattered.
_ Mosul Eye reported that residents are in their homes, the Iraqi forces are advancing rapidly, and ISIS is disappearing from the Al-Karama section. War correspondent Elijah Magnier said Iraqi forces liberated Hay al-Samah and are advancing toward Hay al-Zohur.
_ Refugees are leaving Mosul in small boats, crossing the Tigris river ( video ) from the al-Shora area to “reach territory held by government forces” 6 miles away. Ruptly also published graphic (*caution*) video of ISIS fighters “littering the recently liberated village of al-Shora.”
_ Meanwhile, Turkey is reportedly massing tanks and troops near its border with Iraq, in the town of Silopi , as they expect the Kurdish PKK to take Sinjar. This makes 2 reports of Turkish forces massing on a border (see below reports of Turkish troops in Gazientep on the Syrian border).
_ Patrick Cockburn recalls , first hand, what happened in Mosul during the 2003 US invasion and the fall of Saddam Hussein. The Kurdish Peshmerga and others (but mainly the Kurds) took advantage of the power vacuum and looted the city while US soldiers manned checkpoints. They also took Kirkuk and other Arab territory, expanding the Kurdish territory by 40% after promising that they wouldn’t.
“As we drove into the city, we passed lines of pick-up trucks piled high with loot returning to the Kurdish-controlled enclave in northern Iraq.”
_ Cockburn gives a masterful summary of the different factions involved in the current anti-ISIS coalition advancing on Mosul and urges the Iraqi government to take and maintain control of Mosul so that it doesn’t get ripped apart and looted like before.
“The different segments of the anti-Isis forces potentially involved in seizing Mosul – the Iraqi army, Kurds, Shia and Sunni paramilitaries, Turks – may be temporary allies, but they are also rivals. They all have their own very different and conflicting agendas.”
Raqqa Campaign Will Coincide With Mosul Campaign and Will Happen “Soon” _ In a press briefing on Oct. 26 ( video , transcript ) Lt. Gen. Townsend, Operation Inherent Resolve commander, said that the campaign to take Raqqa in Syria will be done simultaneously with the Mosul campaign. They are working on the plans for the “isolation and eventual liberation of Raqqah.” It will be done in stages — first isolation and then “seizure and liberation.”
_ The Raqqah operation will be done with “a lot lighter coalition footprint” and with “our local partners in northern Syria.” Townsend said there are sufficient local forces but they plan to “recruit and equip and train more local forces for that operation.” The current Syrian Democratic Forces are 30,000 in number, mostly Kurdish. Townsend plans to recruit more local forces from the Raqqah area, similar to the way it was done in Manbij. The training will be done in northern Syria.
_ When asked if the Kurdish YPG element of the Syrian Democratic Forces will participate in the Raqqah campaign, given that Turkey has demanded no involvement of Kurds in Raqqah, Townsend said that is a “tough one.” Townsend said “it’s very important to get isolation in place around Raqqah to start controlling that environment on a pretty short timeline” and “we’re gonna take the force that we have.”
_ As for Turkey, Townsend said: “The Turks have expressed an interest to be involved in that. And we’ll — we’ll work through that later […] And I think that we’ll go with the forces that can go on the timeline that we need.” He stressed that they want to move on Raqqah “soon.”
_ Lt. Gen. Townsend said they’ll take “any partner that’s willing to join the coalition.” Would that include ex-ISIS fighters? “We’re gonna go with who can go, who’s willing to go soon. And then we’ll — once we get initial isolation in position, we’ll — we’ll look at how we prosecute the operation further.”
_ When asked about the urgency of the Raqqah campaign, Townsend said that ISIS is “up to something” and there is “and external plot” “emanating from Raqqah.”
_ A Military Times journalist asked if more US troops would be deployed to Syria, and Townsend would not answer directly but inferred that there would.
The Race for Raqqah _ Townsend, several times, avoided questions about Russia and Syria with respect to the Raqqah campaign, during the Oct. 26 briefing ( video , transcript ), until the end of the briefing when Paul Sonne asked directly about Syria and Russia’s response to Turkey participating in the Raqqa campaign and moving even further into Syria. Townsend’s answer was cryptic and hard to summarize, but important to read in full, as he signaled the official justification for US moving on Raqqah and acknowledged that the Syrian government would oppose it:
Townsend : “I just know that right now Syria seems to have their hands full. And so it’s necessary for our coalition to move about inside Syria to defeat Daesh-ISIL because it poses a threat to Syria, Iraq, the region, and our own nations.”
“So like I said, we’ll welcome any contributing nation that wants to make themselves part of the coalition to go fight Daesh in Syria. But that — join the coalition has to come with not — can’t just come with a whole bunch of strings. They got to be willing to go do what the coalition needs done. We try to employ coalition contributions whether they be troops or capabilities, we try to always, we employ them within the bounds of the wishes of their government. ”
“Once we set out what that arrangement is, then the coalition employs those capabilities. So we’ll use whoever wants to go do that, fight Daesh in Raqqa, that’s a tough place, probably won’t be a very long list. And I would imagine Syria probably isn’t thrilled with any of us there doing that. But it’s necessary to do.”
_ So the official justification for taking Raqqah, is that the Syrian army has its hands full and somebody has to take down ISIS in their capital.
_ Townsend says, multiple times, that any country, any force can join their coalition to isolate and liberate Raqqah. And each time he says it during the briefing, he does not exclude the Syrian coalition forces. When asked about Syria and Russia’s expected reaction to the Raqqah campaign, he brings it up again, that anyone can join the coalition, either with forces or “capabilities.” But they must accept that the US will be leading this coalition, even though they have no legal authority to fight or bomb inside Syria and the Syrian government repeatedly reminds the world of that.
_ Townsend then acknowledges that the Syrian government probably won’t be “thrilled” about the US coalition taking Raqqah or “with any of us” meaning Turkey. But he largely blows it off. which is interesting, and completely avoids addressing Russia specifically, again, though several journalists were anxious for him to address it. Very dicey, vague and unlike other parts of his briefing, this part sounded disingenuous.
_ Turkey is urging that the battle for Raqqa wait until after the Mosul operation is over. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus : “It would be better both militarily and strategically to conduct this operation after the Mosul operation and Turkey’s Euphrates Shield operation are completed.”
Aleppo _ Southfront reports that the Jaish al-Fatah rebel group, led by al Nusra, “has not been able to deliver a devastating blow to the Syrian government forces and to break the siege of eastern Aleppo.”
_ The rebels had launched a recent offensive with “over 2,000 so-called moderate opposition members carried out attacks on residential areas, schools and hospitals with the support of 22 tanks, 15 IFVs, multiple launch rocket systems and eight vehicles with suicide bombers.” They killed 80 civilians and injured 300 from Oct. 29 to Oct. 31 alone, and launched shells with chlorine gas on the Al-Hamdaniya neighborhood in West Aleppo.
_ Russia has not used warplanes in Aleppo for 16 days now. Rebel groups in East Aleppo continue to attack West Aleppo. Russian defense minister Shoigu said that “militants shoot dozens of civilians every day for trying to approach the humanitarian corridors.” The Russian military asked for permission to do airstrikes on Oct. 28 but Russian president Putin refused , continuing to extend the halt on airstrikes as part of a “humanitarian pause.” The Kremlin spokesman said the “humanitarian pause” will be impossible to continue if the opposition groups “resume offensive operations ” (which they have done). The Kremlin spokesman also indicated that “measures are being taken to ensure the evacuation of civilians and injured from eastern Aleppo.”
_ Ruptly published video today of the Syrian army firing “rocket salvos and heavy automatic weapons as they attempted to wrest control of the contested southwestern area.”
_ As the Russians wait for the UN and US to convince the “moderate opposition” to separate from designated terrorist groups, and the UN envoy Steffan de Mistura, in Geneva, “called on the fighters to leave the city to help enable aid to reach” East Aleppo’s civilians, the top negotiator, Khaled Khoja, in the Saudi-backed opposition umbrella group, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), also in Geneva, said it’s impossible for the rebels in East Aleppo to separate from al Nusra (al Qaeda) , and blamed it on the international community. He also denied shelling civilians in West Aleppo, which has been confirmed by numerous officials and media, as have reports of East Aleppo rebels refusing to allow civilians to leave.
_ As Russia keeps extending their halt on airstrikes, continue to keep humanitarian corridors that opposition rebels refuse to allow civilians to use to escape, and rebels launch offensives and refuse to separate from al Qaeda, the foggy, propaganda-mired situation in Aleppo becomes more clear to everyone. The US continues to refuse to provide intelligence on the location of al Qaeda or to convince the rebels they are backing to separate from them.
_ Khoja is hoping that the election next week will bring Hillary Clinton as a savior for the opposition groups and al Qaeda in East Aleppo:
HNC negotiator Khoja : “We heard (Democratic presidential candidate Hillary) Clinton talking about civilian protection, no-fly-zones, which is something we welcome and that we demand.”
Flow of ISIS fighters Between Iraq and Syria _ In the Oct. 26 briefing ( video , transcript ), Lt. Gen. Townsend said they don’t have a complete encirclement of Mosul and it’s not necessary, and there is movement out of Mosul but “when we can identify ISIL fighters, we strike them.” He said ISIS has gotten “savvy since Fallujah” and they mix fighters with families in their convoys so it’s hard to strike them.
Reshaping Syria? _ Turkish government officials are leaking some pretty explosive claims to Turkish pro-government media. Pro-Erdogan Turkish media, Yeni Safak, is reporting that Russia and Turkey made a deal to cede an extensive amount of territory in northern Syria to the control of “local elements and local assemblies after being liberated from the terror groups.” Syrian president Assad’s government” will consolidate its power in Latakia and Tartus.” The Turkish military is reportedly massing on the border in Gaziantep and will advance south to Aleppo, while Assad’s forces will vacate the city. Al Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham will be required to leave.
_ Yeni Safak reports that “a new map will be drawn including the Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, Raqqa, Al-Hasakah and Dery ez-Zor provinces of the country.” Syrian Kurds, allied with the US-led coaliiton, plan to create an “autonomous region” to include “al-Hasakah, Tal Abyad, Ayn al Arab, Jarabulus, Al Rai, Azez, Marea and Afrin.” Turkey and Russia will not accept that plan and the Turkish government sources claimed that Russia and Turkey would fight together under Operation Euphrates Shield.
– On Tuesday,. Yeni Safak reported that the Turkish military chief of staff, Gen. Hulusi Akar, traveled to Moscow to meet with his counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, a deputy defense minister and head of the Russian military, to discuss“military cooperation and regional issues”.
Open-Ended Conflict With Russia _ Spencer Ackerman at the Guardian spoke to people in the US “national security circles,” including “retired senior US military pilots” and the director of national intelligence, who are ” increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clinton’s proposal for “no-fly zones” in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world.” Clinton’s opponent, Trump. has recently said that her “safe zones” plan could lead to World War III . Many considered the risk of aerial confrontation with Russian planes to be “severe.” DNI Clapper said he wouldn’t put it past the Russians to shoot down American aircraft. Others worry that she’ll commit the air force to an indefinite air occupation.
_ A retired Navy pilot who has flown no-fly zone missions went on the record saying no-fly zones are “the cocktail party military application of power of choice” and “it’s going to be a disaster. I hope it’s political posturing.” He also said: “I see almost nothing positive that can come from implementing [a no-fly zone] at the current time over Syria. Conversely, the potential to make a bad situation worse is very, very high.”
_ Guardian war correspondent Jonathan Steele calls Hillary Clinton’s no-fly zone plan for Syria “madness” that would not deescalate the war and “threatens to engulf us all.” He then provides a Syrian war rarity — some US/UK media truth-telling about the so called rebels:
Steele : “Syria is also mired in a propaganda war, and in the heart-rending images that the rebels put out on social media about life and death in Aleppo, the seamier side of the armed groups’ control is suppressed.”
_ Paul Mulshine from the NJ Star Ledger notes that top generals on both sides believe that a no-fly zone in Syria would lead to war with Russia.
_ Mnar Muhawesh of Mint Press News interviewed FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley on the risks of Hillary Clinton starting a world war.
Plan B for Syria: Anti-aircraft and Anti-Artillery Weapons to CIA-Backed FSA _ On Sunday, the Washington Post reported that Pres. Obama had neither agreed nor disagreed with a Plan B for Syria, to rush ship heavy weapons to “tens of thousands of” CIA-backed “rebels” in Syria, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which could be used against Russian aircraft and artillery. Plan B is supported by CIA director John Brennan and Sec. Defense Ash Carter. Some White House officials are skeptical about the CIA’s assessments. Overall, the CIA has backed “50,000 or more” fighters in a “constellation” of groups in Syria. The article had some interesting quotes:
Anonymous US official : [CIA-backed fighters are] “not doing any better on the battlefield, they’re up against a more formidable adversary, and they’re increasingly dominated by extremists […] What has this program become, and how will history record this effort?”
2nd Anonymous US official : “The FSA remains the only vehicle to pursue those goals […] You can’t defeat ISIL without removing Assad […] As long as there is a failed state in Syria, ISIL will have a homeland.”
Former senior administration official (involved in 2012 White House discussions of CIA program): “It’s a fine mess we’ve gotten ourselves into[…] “There’s a huge risk here since the Russians entered. . . . The lesson out of this is that if you don’t take action early on, you should almost expect the options to get worse and worse and worse.”
2nd administration official involved in Syria discussions : “The Russians have seized the initiative […] You can’t pretend you can go to war against Assad and not go to war against Russia.”
Senior Turkish official : “They [US] promised to give more support [… But it now seems like nothing is going to happen. This coalition hasn’t delivered. It’s obsolete now. So we’re going to look at our options. If Aleppo falls, Assad wins.”
Russian Ministries Accuse US Anti-ISIS Coalition of War Crimes _ An airstrike on a mourning procession at a Shia shrine in the town of Daquq (near Kirkuk) on Oct. 21 resulted in civilian casualties leaving 17 people (15 women) dead and 50 injured, mainly women and children. Iran and Russia claimed that it was a US coalition airstrike. An official from the Kirkuk provisional council claimed it was an Iraqi plane , misinformed about ISIS positions. Iraq is investigating .
_ The Pentagon denied involvement in any airstrikes in Daquq that resulted in civilian casualties. Jason Ditz at antiwar.com notes that the “denial’s very specific caveats, that they didn’t deny attacking Daquq, or indeed the mosque, doesn’t help with credibility.” The US track record on admitting to civilian casualties during anti-ISIS missions hasn’t been very good . Locals identified the attacker as a warplane but could not tell whose plane it was.
_ Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, said :
Ghasemi : “Attacking innocent and mourning people cannot be justified by any excuse. The suffering people of Iraq should not be under terrorist attacks on the one hand, and on the other, bombardment by foreign military forces that prance around in Iraq under the pretext of fighting terrorism.”
_ The Russian Ministry of Defense said the US-led coalition was responsible for the strikes and inferred that they commit war crimes almost daily:
Russian MoD : “Russian reconnaissance pinpointed two jets conducting airstrikes on Daquq, located 30 kilometers to the south of Kirkuk, where, according to our data, there are no ISIS fighters. […] “These deadly attacks on civilian areas, which have all the marks of war crimes, are becoming almost a daily routine for the international coalition.”
Amnesty International: US Coalition Severely Underestimates Civilian Casualties in Syria _ Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office said :
Maalouf : “It’s high time the U.S. authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria […] “We fear the U.S.-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria […] “Analysis of available evidence suggests that in each of these cases, coalition forces failed to take adequate precautions to minimize harm to civilians and damage to civilian objects […] Some of these attacks may constitute disproportionate or otherwise indiscriminate attacks.” [Emphasis added]
_ Based on Amnesty’s analysis of 11 US coalition attacks, the evidence suggests “as many as 300 civilians were killed.” The Pentagon has only acknowledged 1 death in these attacks. Research by other monitoring organizations indicates that the total number of civilians killed in US coalition airstrikes has been as high as 600 or more than 1000 . The strikes hit villages, homes, public markets, and shelters. In one case, a double-tap strike was reported in the village of Ayn al-Khan, Hasakah, where a helicopter gunship returned and killed first responders, even though the Kurdish fighters claimed to have warned the coalition of civilians in the area. [Emphasis added]
Survivor : “‘At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him… I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me… My mother, aunt, wife and children – a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I’d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,’ he said.”
UN and Rights Groups Condemn Russia and Syria for Airstrikes on Idlib School _ UNICEF and monitoring groups accused Russia or Syria of airstrikes on a school compound in the rebel-held village of Haas in Idlib province. 35 people were killed, including 22 children. A graphic photo of a child with a partially severed arm was circulated on social media. UNICEF’s director called it an outrage and a war crime, if deliberate. The UN humanitarian chief said he was “incandescent with rage” and held the UN Security Council for not stopping the suffering.
_ At the UN Security Council meeting, the Russian ambassador Churkin was attacked by several parties including US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power. Churkin said Russia and Syria had halted airstrikes for the past week and there had been no recognition . US Power, after accusing Russia of not cooperating with the UN and mocking the humanitarian pause, said: Power : “You don’t get congratulations and credit for not committing war crimes for a day or a week.” She walked out again when the Syrian ambassador spoke.
Russia Lost Seat on UN Human Rights Council _ Russia was stripped of its seat on the UN Human Rights Council during a UN general assembly secret vote for re-election for membership. The US and UK won seats on the council. Rights groups had lobbied for this outcome. Hungary and Croatia gained seats in their region. Saudi Arabia kept their seat on the Human Rights Council.
Operation Euphrates Shield: Syria Threatens to Down Turkish Planes _ As Turkish-backed forces (CIA and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) and the Turkish military) invaded Syria in Jarablus late August, in an offensive called Operation Euphrates Shield, under the pretense of clearing ISIS from the Syrian-Turkish border areas but with the real aim of preventing Kurdish forces from securing a contiguous area in northern Syria. As they advanced westward to northern Aleppo, in the vicinity of al-Bab, they began fighting with Kurdish forces and on Oct. 20 hit the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) with airstrikes. Hurriyet reported , via an anonymous official, that the Syrian government then activated their air defense and threatened to shoot down any Turkish planes in Syrian airspace.
_ RT reported on Oct. 29 that the Turkish air force has not been used in Operation Euphrates shield for the past week and that “coalition forces have also decreased the number of flights in northern Syria.” The lack of air support has slowed their advance toward al-Bab.
_ Until the past few days, the Turkish forces have fought with ISIS and the Kurds in northern Syria, but not Syrian coalition forces. But Turkey claims that the Syrian forces attacked them this week near Marea. On Wednesday the Turkish foreign minister said Operation Euphrates Shield would not be deterred by the government forces “ until retaking the city of al-Bab .”
East Aleppo “Rebels” Firing Chemical Weapons Rockets at Civilian Areas in West Aleppo _ On Sunday, Syrian media reported “shells containing poison gases” fired at residential areas in West Aleppo from opposition fighters in East Aleppo. An RT crew on the ground reported “36 cases of suffocation” and Al-Mayadeen media reported that all victims were civilians. The Russian ambassador to the UN reported via the Russian foreign ministry that 16,000 people were killed by US-backed opposition groups between February and September.
_ The head of Aleppo University Hospital said 36 people (both fighters and civilians) were injured by the chlorine gas fired into West Aleppo by the opposition in East Aleppo, who have launched a recent offensive on the government-held areas after more than a week of Russia and Syria halting airstrikes. The London-based and pro-rebel Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that chemical weapon attacks happened.

Ukraine _ Fighting has broken out in “the northern suburbs of Donetsk, the airport district, the Yasinovataya checkpoint, and Spartak village” in Ukraine, where there had been a ceasefire, according to Fort Russ .
_ The Ukraine military has reportedly been massing on the frontlines of Lugansk . There is also a report of a team of NATO troops from “Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands” meeting with the Ukraine miltiary in the Donbass to “study the real situation on the demarcation line in Donbass” and to test weapons.
War and Elections _ Retired Col. Lawrence Wilkerson and Gordon Adams on the National Interest: “ No, Hillary Clinton’s Foreign Policy Judgement Isn’t As Good As Everyone Says .” Wilkerson also discussed the article on The Real News this week. Wilkerson, who served under the George W. Bush administration, says he’s very concerned because of her past history and the fact that a lot of the people who are advising her look like the people who were advising Pres. George W. Bush. Trump has been all over the place, Wilkerson said, but he has also indicated that he wouldn’t get us into the wars “on the edge of empire” that cost us so much and don’t produce good result. Wilkerson said from what he has heard, the military and the Joint Chiefs are reluctant to intervene in Syria against Assad. The policy to take down Assad is a mistake.

_ Ray McGovern, on the Real News , said nothing happened at the latest meeting on the Minsk Accords. Germany, France and Russia want the violence in Ukraine to stop, but Poroshenko is “not his own man,” according to McGovern. He’s a puppet of the US. Hillary Clinton “and the people she’s bringing in with her, they’ve openly favored giving arms, offense arms to Ukraine.” The Europeans “to their credit are worried about that.” McGovern recently visited the region on a mission with 20 people. He said Ukraine is in a shambles and the people are malnourished.

_ James Carden at The Nation: “ Obama’s Foreign Policy: A Hostage to Bipartisan Consensus .” “ He may have criticized the ‘Washington playbook,’ but he couldn’t overcome DC’s interventionist orthodoxy .” Carden notes that all of Obama’s foreign policy pledges have been unfulfilled and his likely successor is a hawk which is “ an all-too-fitting monument to an era of dashed expectations.” Obama gave the wars in Libya and Syria “a veneer of legality,” started a “new and more dangerous cold war with Russia,” and launched the “Asia pivot” to begin efforts to contain of China. Obama was expected to improve the mess from the Bush years but instead “the convergence of the neoconservative and Wilsonian interventionist creeds has solidified into orthodoxy” that became necessary for war selling after the 2003 Iraq invasion fiasco. Hardcore neocons “have become devoted supporters of Hillary Clinton.” Samantha Power declared that the US national interest have been expanded from interstate affairs to intrastate affairs as well and Obama “remains firmly in the grip of a foreign-policy orthodoxy that he himself has dismissed” largely because the of the narrow spectrum of policy options considered acceptable by the “Borg”.
“Power’s casual disregard for the Westphalian principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of other states, now de rigueur among interventionists of both parties, is fused with a belief in American global hegemony, of which the Obama administration’s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review is representative.”

3160,WATCH: CNN Called ‘Clinton News Network’ On Air by Fiery British Conservative,"WATCH: CNN Called ‘Clinton News Network’ On Air by Fiery British Conservative The implosion that followed is something to see Image Credits: Wiki Commons . 
CNN anchor Hala Gorani wasn’t expecting her network to be called the “Clinton News Network” by British firebrand conservative columnist Katie Hopkins from The Daily Mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a must-see. 
Hopkins’ first offense was daring to believe Donald Trump is going to win the election — never a good way to start on CNN: 
“I think he’s going to win. I think you guys are in for a big surprise, which I’m quite excited about. I think we’ve seen a very similar think here in the UK with Brexit. We saw a lot of the liberal press, kind of, sneering at Brexiteers. We saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the Clinton News Network.” 
“That’s CNN. You’re calling us the Clinton News Network?” Gorani said in shock. 
“You’re exactly correct,” Hopkins said. 
The two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls, especially the ones showing Hillary Clinton in the lead. Hopkins destroyed Gorani saying, “Having sat in the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and watched your news network, it is entirely biased, I think, in coverage.” 
Gorani refused to believe and said over her 18-year career at CNN, she’s only seen “nothing but balance” at the network. 
Oddly enough, as the sparring match continued, Gorani repeatedly cut Hopkins off when she criticized the Clintons.

3161,Chinese political dissidents are having their organs cut from their bodies for 'transplant tourists',"Chinese political dissidents are having their organs cut from their bodies for 'transplant tourists' 
Tuesday, November 01, 2016 by: J. D. Heyes Tags: China , organ harvesting , political prisoners (NaturalNews) In the U.S. these days, supporting GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump will earn you an assault from Left-wing cowards and bullies who support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton . But in China, being a political dissident and opposing the ruling Communist government could earn you a trip to a hospital operating room.Where you'll have your organs removed for waiting ""transplant tourists.""As reported by the Epoch Times , Chinese officials began persecuting the 100 million practitioners of Falun Gong in July 1999, and have continued to do so ever since. To the Chinese communists, there is no such thing as a religious deity or belief, because communists insist that their form of government should be the only thing requiring loyalty and faithfulness.Not long ago this kind of treatment of Chinese ""dissidents"" would draw loud rebukes from the U.S. government, the United Nations and various human rights organizations around the world, as well as major media coverage. But since the Chinese manufacturing economy has become such an integral part of the economies of most of the world's advanced countries, outrage has been muted.The lack of outrage and subsequent media coverage and pressure by governments has essentially given the Chinese communists a green light to treat Falun Gong – and anyone else deemed a political dissident – in any barbaric way they choose. 'A new form of evil' Hence, the creation of a cottage industry of sorts – Transplant Tourism. As the Epoch Times noted, this is essentially "" murder on demand "" for an organ that is purchased ahead of time by someone who then travels to China for a transplant operation. It is a huge source of revenue both for the Chinese military and for private hospitals around the country, according to Nobel Prize nominees and investigators David Matas, an international human rights attorney, and David Kilgour, a former Canadian foreign secretary for Asia-Pacific.Matas and Kilgour published their first investigative report in 2006 , and evidence about forced harvesting of organs in China from prisoners of conscience has only mounted in the years since. The investigators found that the overwhelming majority of the pool of victims did not come from prisoners sentenced to death but rather from prisoners of conscience, primarily followers of Falun Gong – the largest group in China's prisons.In their 2006 report, Matas described the systematic harvesting of organs from Falun Gong adherents by the Chinese Communist Party as ""a new form of evil we have yet to see on this planet.""One of the founding board members of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH), Dr. Dana Churchill, spoke at rallies in Los Angeles and Santa Monica Beach earlier this month. She said that to this point the world had never witnessed a ""more horrific and barbaric crime as the Chinese Communist Party has committed against Falun Gong."" 'Crime against humanity' She added that it wasn't just Falun Gong adherents who were being victimized, however. Others include Christians, the Uyghurs and Tibetans, all of whom have also had their organs harvested ""while they are alive, unwilling, and between 20 and 40 years old, the prime of their life,"" Churchill – a naturopathic doctor from Pasadena, Calif., said. Epoch Times noted that recently released findings on the number of Chinese prisoners who have been murdered go way beyond original estimates collected from various investigators and organizations.Churchill said: ""With Falun Gong, approximately 65,000 have been murdered, and that is according to DAFOH, our organization.""At a Washington, D.C., rally on July 17, 2015, following nine years of investigation, the World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong announced that it had ""concluded that since July 20, 1999, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), lead by its former head Jiang Zemin, has utilized China's entire state apparatus to harvest organs from living Falun Gong practitioners,"" as a way to ""physically destroy"" the group as a whole.""This is genocide and a crime against humanity,"" the organization concluded.
