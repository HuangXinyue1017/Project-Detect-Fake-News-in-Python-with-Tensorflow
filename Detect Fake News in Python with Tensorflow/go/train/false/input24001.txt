583,"In Trade Stances Toward China, Clinton and Trump Both Signal a Chill - The New York Times","HONG KONG  —   For Asia, the bad news this week was not that Donald J. Trump detailed a   plan to toughen American trade policy, especially toward China. It was that Hillary Clinton’s campaign accused Mr. Trump a few hours later of purloining her ideas, noting that she favored similar action on those issues. A strong dose of economic populism, with an occasional sprinkling of geopolitics, has suffused the trade plans of the leading American presidential candidates this year. Vying for votes, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are each promising to do more to preserve American jobs at a time of slowing global economic growth. And China  —   with its vast trade, rising international influence and authoritarian government  —   is a natural target. Presidential candidates vow every four years to do more to help American workers facing competition from abroad. After taking office, they have consistently pursued more conciliatory trade policies toward China, seeing a strategic benefit to warm relations with Beijing. But broad political distress this year over the loss of   working class jobs to global competition, coupled with mounting concern about China’s increasingly assertive military posture, suggest that the next president could actually follow through on the pledges. If they do, the policies could pose a real predicament for China, and for other Asian countries that depend on its economy. Millions of jobs in China and across the region require the continued willingness of the United States to rely overwhelmingly on imports to supply American families with everything from the clothes they wear to the smartphones they carry. Rapid economic growth in China and the development of a strong consumer market had seemed to reduce the country’s need for huge exports to the American market. But China’s economy has recently slowed, hurting domestic players from small exporters to large steel makers. Weaker growth at home has made it all the more important for China to maintain a large trade surplus with the United States, selling more to consumers and businesses there than it buys. For years, China has exported four times as much to the United States as it imports, and it continues to do so. “If there are tougher trade policies from the United States,” said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, “that will dampen Chinese exports. ” The candidates plan to take direct aim at the two countries’ trade gap. They want to label China as a currency manipulator that undervalues the renminbi to help its exporters win sales in overseas markets. They want to file more trade cases against China and impose more tariffs. They want to investigate how the Chinese government subsidizes businesses. They also want to rethink big trade deals. Mr. Trump wants to scrap the   Partnership, a   agreement between the United States and a group of countries, mostly in Asia. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign took a subtly different position, saying that she opposed the agreement in its current form. The Asian countries involved in the trade pact, notably Vietnam and Japan, made significant concessions to American negotiators because they felt threatened by China’s rise. Now, the presidential candidates are lumping them together with China, holding them responsible for killing American jobs. With few exceptions, Chinese officials have tried to steer clear of commenting on the American candidates. Even Chinese academics, the usual pipeline to Beijing’s thinking, have been wary of doing so, to avoid being accused of violating China’s policy of not interfering publicly in other countries’ politics. To the extent that Chinese experts say anything, it is to express hope that this year’s talk of getting tough on trade will not be a harbinger of policy shifts ahead. “There is no big difference from previous presidential campaigns, only more emphasis, due to the poor world trade performances” and weak global economic prospects, said He Weiwen, a   of the  . S. . U. Study Center at the China Association of International Trade in Beijing. The uncertainty for China, and much of Asia, is whether the candidates will sing the same trade tunes once in office. Mr. Trump’s confrontational approach would seem to indicate some  . Mrs. Clinton seems less likely to change American policies, given that she supported President Obama’s free trade efforts during his first term of office, when she was secretary of state. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and Mr. Obama, at least initially, all tried to help China become more involved in the world economy. They hoped that more enmeshed trade and financial relationships would mean a more democratic China with closer diplomatic ties to the West. It seemed to work for a while. But in the last three years, China, under President Xi Jinping, has shifted toward more authoritarian rule. China has embarked on a   military buildup, constructed artificial islands with   runways in the South China Sea and challenged Japan’s control of a cluster of islands north of Taiwan. And a combination of strict censorship and comprehensive propaganda has fanned the already strong nationalism of the Chinese public. Those geopolitics have left American policy makers with two choices, neither of them appetizing. Further trade with China and additional investments there by Western multinationals could strengthen the Chinese economy and help Beijing afford even more ambitious territorial and military policies. Discouraging trade and investment could cause lower economic growth that might slow China’s military rise but also might feed   sentiment and foster public demands for more assertive foreign policy. If the candidates’ ideas became policy, China would almost certainly retaliate in some fashion. American exports, while sharply smaller than those China sends in the other direction, are a potential focus. Beijing has proved especially adept in the past at targeting American exports from swing states in presidential elections and closely fought congressional districts, maximizing its leverage in the political process even if the economic effects were limited. The biggest immediate casualty of tougher trade policies could be the Obama administration’s effort to strengthen relations with countries like Japan, Singapore and Vietnam as a way to balance China’s growing muscle in East Asia. The economic centerpiece of the administration’s   pivot to Asia has been the negotiation of the   Partnership. That agreement calls for dismantling barriers to American trade with many of the countries that find themselves increasingly uneasy about China’s growing dominance. Mr. Trump denounced the pact again on Tuesday, saying that it would force American workers to compete with   Vietnamese workers. Mrs. Clinton, after supporting the early negotiations as secretary of state, has come out against the pact since the fall, saying that the deal does not go far enough to address issues like currency manipulation. Yet canceling the trade pact could actually cause more problems, by pushing American allies in the region into China’s arms and preventing American companies from developing in emerging Asian markets. “If America kills the T. P. P. ,” said Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, “then China becomes the main center of economic gravity. ”",0
584,"Review: ‘The Secret Life of Pets’ Amuses, but Misses Opportunities - The New York Times","First things first: “The Secret Life of Pets” is preceded by a short film starring the Minions, in which those irrepressible yellow gelcaps take up landscaping so they can purchase a blender. You may regard this extra little cartoon as a bonus or a tax, depending on your level of Minion tolerance. Mine reached its end around 90 seconds before the movie did. But in any case, Illumination Entertainment and Universal Pictures are determined to keep selling toys and Halloween costumes, and it’s pointless to protest the merchandising of manufactured cuteness. Part of the Minions’ ostensibly universal charm lies in the fact that they speak no known language, but rather a chirpy, vaguely   patois. “The Secret Life of Pets,” Illumination’s newest feature, relies on the more conventional sound of celebrity voices, mostly belonging to people who are professionally funny on television. Children may not be all that familiar with many of them, including Louis C. K. who plays the main character, a dog named Max. Louis C. K. on his television projects and in his   tends to work on the blue end of the spectrum, trafficking in melancholy as well as profanity. His presence here may be a gift to his own children, and to their college funds. It might also provide a measure of consolation to gloomy, sensitive   dads who need to sense a kindred soul on the other side of the screen. Similarly, Hannibal Buress (a dachshund) Jenny Slate (a fuzzy white lap dog whose exact breed I could not identify) and Lake Bell (a cat) might be here not because kids will recognize them from “Broad City” or “Obvious Child” or “In a World” but because youngish parents might want to feel a little bit cool at the multiplex on a Saturday afternoon. No shame in that! Fans of “Modern Family” will be happy to hear Eric Stonestreet as a big furry dog. Fans of Kevin Hart who want more after “Central Intelligence” and “Ride Along 2” will enjoy his impersonation of an angry bunny. Albert Brooks is a grumpy raptor. That sentence was a pleasure to write. There is also a guinea pig, some other birds, lizards and even a few human beings. But this is mostly a dog story, full of capers and complications arising from the arrival of Duke (the big shaggy one voiced by Mr. Stonestreet) into the household Max shares with Katie (Ellie Kemper) his millennial owner. There is rivalry and resentment and eventually friendship. “The Secret Life of Pets,” written by Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch and directed by Yarrow Cheney and Chris Renaud, is like one of those picture books about how to deal with a new baby, but with talking animals. Which is, all in all, pretty good fun.   cartoons generally are, if they have even a modest quantity of wit or   insight. And while this movie never achieves  —   and does not really aim for  —   the emotional richness or visual inventiveness of the better Pixar features, or the sly social consciousness of “Zootopia,” it has a playful absurdity and a winning, friendly spirit. As the title suggests, the conceit is that when we humans are away, our furry, scaly, feathered companions get up to all kinds of mischief. They visit one another’s apartments, they dance and flirt and play loud music and then, when we return, pretend that they’ve been waiting for us the whole time. Except for the cats, of course, who make a great show of not caring. Here I should say that, while Ms. Bell’s purring vocalizations are beyond reproach, the film is clearly the work of dog people, and traffics  —   like nearly every other movie in its genre  —   in some tired   stereotypes. I could go on about this, but I’m not supposed to let my political opinions affect my reviews. And I’m not biased. Dogs are fine. I have shared my home and opened my heart to a few of them. But they’re also just too easy, with their wet noses and broad pink tongues and eagerness to please. Cats are demanding. Complex. A more daring movie would have ventured beyond fat, pampered house cats and scrawny alley predators in its depiction of them. Representation matters. Speaking of politics, the house pets encounter an underground militant organization led by Mr. Hart’s adorably fuzzy, implacable little rabbit. He steals the movie, of course, and helps it ascend to a level of anarchic delight. The animated action is bouncy and frenetic, and if the story becomes a little too busy, it moves quickly and makes room for a barrage of jokes and even some character development. Ms. Slate’s Gidget the lap dog evolves from a lovestruck princess (pining for Max) into a fierce and resourceful action heroine. Max himself grows less  . Everyone gets home safely. Like the “Despicable Me” movies, which put Illumination on the map (and spawned those furshlugginer Minions) “The Secret Life of Pets” is adequate animated entertainment, amusing while it lasts but not especially memorable except as a catalog of compromises and missed opportunities. Among those are the New York setting, a potential wonderland of glamour, filth and imagination that is rendered as blandly as if the movie had been shot on a   set. “The Secret Life of Pets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Fewer poop jokes than you might expect.  Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes.",0
585,Компания Alibaba открыла вакансию кота,"0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Как сообщает Crienglish.com, кота компания рассчитывает найти до 10 ноября. В этот день в преддверии крупнейшего в КНР торгового фестиваля состоится гала-вечер интернет-магазина Tmall (его символом является черный кот). В Alibaba рассчитывают, что животное станет объектом для новых мемов и вирусных видео, а также увеличит продажи. 
Ранее Alibaba ранее уже удалось привлечь ставших популярными в сети котов, к примеру, сердитого котика из США (Grumpy Cat), кота по кличке Анри из Франции, Мару из Японии. В должности заинтересованы Милк и Орео из Великобритании, а также китайские коты, сообщает портал. 
Напомним, компания Alibaba основана в 1999 году. В ее структуру входит десяток интернет-площадок, в том числе AliExpress, Taobao и китайское подразделение Yahoo!. 
Американские ученые пришли к выводу, что гладить кошек - опасно для здоровья. 
В ходе исследований ученые выяснили, что близкое общение с кошками опасно для человеческой жизни, сообщает РИА VladNews со ссылкой на Информинг. 
Согласно исследованиям, домашние любимцы передают своим хозяевам инфекции чаще, чем считалось ранее. Результат исследования показал, что кошачьи царапины, которые появляются в ходе общения между кошками и их хозяевами, могут привести к серьезному заболеванию - «кошачьей лихорадке». 
Ранки от кошачьих ногтей могут спровоцировать высокую температуру и даже могут стать причиной летального исхода. 
По словам специалистов, не следует заводить кошек, когда в доме есть маленькие дети, а также после общения с животными следует тщательно мыть руки. 
Специалисты-фелинологи уже полгода ведут наблюдение за хвостатыми подопытными и к 2021 году обещают объяснить, что означает вся гамма издаваемых нашими любимцами звуков. 
Исследователи в процессе опыта записывают все звуки, которые выдают 50 подопытных котов, когда они голодны, испуганы, ищут ласки или просто довольны. 
Полученные результаты анализируют и классифицируют. Уже установлено, что кошки способны изменять интонацию или мелодику осознанно, желая донести до хозяина определенную информацию, делится наблюдениями специалист в области фонетики Сусанна Шетц . Например, когда кошка просит еду, она мяукает тоньше. 
По мнению фелинологов, вербальное общение - не главное средство связи этих животных с человеком: диалог в основном идет на языке тела и запахов. Некоторые проблемы во взаимопонимании возникают еще и потому, что по сравнению с собаками, и уж тем более людьми, мурки имеют очень мало лицевых мышц. Впрочем, научившись шифровать эмоции, сами они легко считывают информацию с лиц хозяев.

586,First case of demonetisation-related HIV after man has unprotected sex with an ATM machine,"First case of demonetisation-related HIV after man has unprotected sex with an ATM machine Posted on Tweet 
10th day into demonetisation and things are going from bad to worse. There is mayhem everywhere. We have already had reports of suicides, murders, robberies, cyclones, earthquakes, and Rohit Sharma’s ouster from Indian squad because of demonetisation, and now we have the first case of HIV that this dreadful ban has caused. 
The incident happened when a man contracted the disease from an already infected ATM machine in Mumbai. Despite numerous warnings issued by India Today and other media houses about ATM keypads transmitting the virus, he went to an ATM and touched the dangerous keypad. He was later diagnosed with HIV positive. 
“So did he actually have sex with the machine?” we asked an insider from India Today. 
“No, but withdrawing cash is as good as having sex with the machine. You have more or less the same feeling when you get the cash in your hand,” he affirmed. 
“Ok that’s interesting. So the engineering students are not virgins anymore and they can proudly brag about their sex lives.” 
“Well, technically speaking, yes, they can.” 
“So, who is at risk of catching the virus? Someone with a poor immune system?” 
“No, anyone who is withdrawing cash from an ATM.” 
“You mean, balance inquiries and other transactions are safe, right?” 
“Who stands in the queue for 3 hours to check balance?” 
“Oh ok, you are talking about the current scenario.” 
“Yes, people should avoid an ATM machine at any cost because it may cause STD as our researcher suggested, and once you are infected with an STD, you become more susceptible to HIV infection.” 
“And who is the researcher at India Today you are referring to? Is it Rajdeep Sardesai?” 
“No, he is in Goa. The person who published the report is Jane Carlton.” 
“Ok but the report was published in 2014. Why are you linking it to currency ban?” 
“Because it’s always relevant.” 
“But what made you search the report two years after it was published and exactly at a time when people are desperately trying to use ATMs? We are just curious, what was going through your mind when you decided to look it up and what were the keywords you entered into Google that returned this report?” 
“Listen, I think I am done with the interview. If you have more questions then ask Rajdeep Sardesai. I am going to call him. Here are your boxing gloves.” 
“But you said he is in Goa,” we hurriedly wrapped-up the interview.",0

588,Koch Brothers Battle to Prevent Dark Money Disclosure in South Dakota,"We Are Change 

By David Armiak and Mary Bottari 
The Koch network has mobilized in South Dakota to defeat the “ South Dakota Accountability and Anti-Corruption Act ,” a state-wide initiative on the ballot November 8.
The anti-corruption measure, Initiated Measure 22 or IM-22, was launched by a bipartisan group called the South Dakotans for Integrity and put on the ballot with signatures from over 20,000 state residents.
IM-22 cracks down on dark money and phony industry front groups by barring candidate coordination with outside groups and regulating independent expenditures. It cracks down on sham “issue ads,” which are really the functional equivalent of express advocacy, by requiring them to be reported electronically within 48 hours, requiring donor disclosure and requiring the top five donors to be disclosed on air. The initiative also provides a small dollar public financing mechanism, sets rules for lobbyists and gifts and creates an ethics commission to investigate violations of ethics and campaign finance rules.
The measure is one of four on ballot nationwide that seek to increase transparency in the financing of elections in a post-Citizens United world. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Citizens United v. FEC to strike down limits on “independent” political spending, which opened the floodgates for billions in dark money into elections nationwide.
If passed, South Dakota voters may finally have some way of knowing who is bankrolling those big money ads and before the election too.
Koch’s Americans for Prosperity Behind “Defeat 22” Group The Kochs are bankrolling the group working to defeat the initiative.
According to its statement of organization filing , Defeat22.com was founded by Ben Lee, the state director for the Koch’s astroturf group Americans for Prosperity , on July 1, 2016. The group promotes itself as a coalition, listing its 18 “partners” on its website including AFP, the South Dakota Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and the different GOP organizations, among others. But, a campaign disclosure filed on Friday with the South Dakota Secretary of State tells another story.
Of the $609,110 raised by Defeat22.com so far, $590,000 came from AFP. The next largest contribution of $1,500 from the SD Farm Bureau Federation was even dwarfed by AFP’s total in-kind contributions of $36,756 .
The opposition to IM-22 is led and organized by AFP. Chad Krier, AFP’s South Dakota Field Director, who has organized many of the campaign events to answer questions and solicit volunteers. AFP also appears to have tapped into its staff network to not only phone bank, but also go door to door to urge voters to Vote No on IM-22. Defeat22.com has send out mailings , placed radio ads , and put up billboards .
The Kochs are battling the measure because “the Kochs see IM-22 as a threat to the dominance the millionaires and billionaires have under the [current] political system,” says former Republican State Senator and co-chair of South Dakotans for Integrity Don Frankenfeld. The Kochs have been battling weaker donor disclosure laws in California in court for years.
And Koch allies in other states are lending a hand.
A right-wing Floridan think tank has been helping out the Defeat IM-22 forces. The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) has set up an “educational” website, Measure22.org , where it published poll results from 478 South Dakotans that demonstrates opposition to the measure in the state. The website operates under the name FGA Action, Inc., a 501(c)(04) that shares an address with FGA and lists its contact as Jonathan Bechtle , the COO and General Counsel at FGA.
The site also hosts two videos which are unsupportive of the measure, one produced by FGA Action, Inc. and another by UnitedforPrivacy.com. UnitedforPrivacy.com is the website for People United for Privacy, an SPN backed group that states , “To change our laws to subject people to the chilling effects of having their privacy invaded and their personal information compiled in government databases and Google searches is not they way our democracy should operate.”
FGA is a member of the State Policy Network (SPN) , a right-wing web of “think tanks” in 48 states, which has been working hard to convince the public that the “free speech” rights of millionaires and billionaires are harmed by campaign finance disclosure laws. Both SPN and FGA are largely funded by the Donors Capital and Donors Trust investment vehicles utilized by the Koch network.
The amount of money spent by FGA Action, Inc. and People United for Privacy against IM-22 is unknown because both groups have yet to file disclosures.
The Kochs Protest “Taxpayer Funded Elections” The Kochs are attacking the anti-corruption measure for its creation of a small dollar publicly funded campaign finance system, which will give each registered voter two $50 vouchers that she can contribute to the candidate of her choosing if the candidate agrees to only fundraise from small donor South Dakotans. AFP argues in its Defeat22.com radio ad and mailings that this system will “divert” public tax dollars from roads and schools–an interesting line of attack from the anti-government Kochs which have opposed taxes for roads in states like Wisconsin.
In state, the Kochs protest “taxpayer funded elections.” “Don’t let politicians take your tax dollars to fund their campaigns” is the Koch spin. Their preference is to put millionaires and billionaires in charge of campaigns and elections.
Nationally, Ben Lee is taking a different approach. In a recent opinion piece in Forbes , Lee trots out the Koch line that the ballot measure is a “full-on assault on the First Amendment cloaked in the guise of transparency.” The Kochs might believe that their right to bankroll politicians secretly is written into the constitution, but super majorities of average citizens–both Democrats and Republican—disagree and the popularity of campaign finance transparency and limits continues to rise .
The widespread support for IM-22 is best demonstrated by South Dakotans for Integrity’s financial disclosure submitted on Friday with attachments that list over 6,000 donations for a total of over $1.2 million. More than 99% of contributions were for $100 or less. The good government advocacy organization Represent Us provided $55,079 in in-kind contributions to South Dakotans for Integrity.
If IM-22 passes on November, it will put the brakes on secret political spending by AFP, the Kochs, and others pulling the strings in South Dakota. But, more significantly, if the law succeeds in setting up a campaign finance system that is more responsive to all citizens, not just the wealthy, it could become a model for other states to follow.
And this is precisely what the Kochs fear.
Two other two ballot measures promoting transparency and clean elections are Proposition 59 in California and Amendment 2 in Missouri.

590,"""Authoritarianism"": How the West demonizes strong, popular leaders","November 22, 2016 -  Deena Stryker, Katehon -  


In 1944, against a groundswell of concern for the democratic process, FDR ran and won a fourth presidential term, because Americans did not want an untried leader in the midst of two wars. (Unfortunately, Roosevelt died soon after that election, leaving President Truman to formulate the disastrous American policy toward the Soviet Union that brought us Cold Wars I and II.) 
Today, FDR’s presidency would probably be considered ‘authoritarian’: he pretended not to see Japan preparing to attack Pearl Harbor, so that shocked Americans would finally be willing to declare war on both Japan and Germany. He is famous for packing the Supreme Court, and although they were milder than would have wanted the Progressive Movement, he wrung workers’ rights and protections out of Congress by signaling to his advisors “Make me do it.” He is still revered today, while one of the polities that ranks highest on key governance criteria is Singapore, a tiny, multi-ethnic country led by the same man for four decades. 
After achieving independence from Great Britain, Lee Kuan Yew moved Singapore’s Third World economy to First World affluence in a single generation. According to Wikileaks: “Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century. Freedom House ranks Singapore as ""partly free” and The Economist ranks it as a ""flawed democracy"", however the ruling party gets 83 of 89 seats with 70% of the popular vote, while in the mid-eighties, Gallup reported Singaporeans’ confidence in the government and judicial system among the highest in the world. 
Although Singapore ranks among the top countries for ""order and security"", ""absence of corruption"", and ""effective criminal justice,” gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers' Corner. Yet, this multi-lingual (English, Chinese and Hindu), country is among the top internationally in education and government supported health care. Although the system can only be classified as authoritarian, there is absolutely zero chance that a US president will declare that its leader “has to go”. That is because like Europe, it combines entre-preneurship with socialist citizen protections. 
Today, ’authoritarianism’ is applied equally to the Saudi Arabian monarchy, where women are not allowed to drive, much less legislate, to China, where the Communist Party watches over the biggest ever economic miracle, and to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Interestingly, it was not applied to Dmitri Medvedev when he was President (Vladimir Putin serving as his Prime Minister). Medvedev was referred to as ‘a man we can work with’ —and even as ’Our man in the Kremlin’. 
At home, however, his ‘Atlanticist’, neo-liberal faction is referred to by Putin supporters, who cherish their social protections and believe the state should be in charge of a nation’s key sources of wealth, as a ‘fifth column’. 
What was the state of Russia when Vladimir Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin, America’s first ‘man in the Kremlin’? 
Putin first won election in 2000, three months after Yeltsin’s resignation for ill health. At forty-eight, thanks to his steadfastness as a KGB officer, then as advisor on international affairs to the mayor of St Petersburg, as head of the KGB, then Prime Minister to Boris Yeltsin (a president famous for his drunken displays), Putin was his designated successor at a time when Russia was in a shambles. 
Its crown jewels had been privatized at rock bottom prices to a group of men who became known as ‘the oligarchs’. State employees weren’t getting their paychecks on time — if at all — and virtually nothing had been done to build a fair liberal —or social democratic — system ten years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. (When Vladimir Putin declared that this event had been a catastrophe, he was not, as the Western press implies, alluding to the demise of Communism, but to the terrible social conditions in which rabid privatization left most Russians.) 
Putin is invariably tagged as a ‘former KGB officer’ by US journalists, who conveniently forget that the first President Bush ran the CIA for a year. The truth is that the Russian president’s wide-ranging jobs prepared him well for the challenge of reviving the largest country in the world, home to 160 ethnic groups speaking some 100 languages and practicing four different religions, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam—(estimates for this latter ranging from 5 - 14%). 
The Western media claims that President Putin’s 80%+ ratings reflect a herd mentality, the result of centuries of autocratic rule under the Mongols (four centuries), the Tsars and the Communist Party. In reality, unbeknownst to most Americans, today’s Russians enjoy individualist lifestyles, vacations abroad and the latest cars. 
For twenty centuries, the lure of Athenian democracy (in which only free males participated) increased in tandem with the power of Kings. But applying democracy has proved ever more difficult as populations and threats grew larger. As he prepares to leave office after eight years of Republican refusal to cooperate with his laudable projects, I suspect President Obama, like most other Western heads of state, secretly envies Putin his ability to get things done. 
When I was in Cuba in 1964, Fidel Castro was being billed in the US as a dictator. I asked then president Osvaldo Dorticos whether or not he agreed that it was risky to have a ‘king’, since one could never know whether inherited leadership would be good or bad. (The outside world did not know that the Cuban government was already experimenting with various forms of local democracy.) Today around the world, ‘the people’ are still impotent to prevent worsening economic conditions — and even war, which first fills the coffers of arms makers, then of industry, needed to rebuild what war has destroyed. Yet Raul Castro has overseen a transition toward a form of national participatory democracy, and Putin appears to be encouraging the same approach in Russia. Meanwhile, in the West it becomes increasingly difficult to affirm that free and fair elections guarantee efficient government or popular satisfaction. 
In the complex 21st century world, peace and prosperity are probably best achieved when strong central governments jointly deal with global challenges, while participatory local governments oversee domestic affairs. (Iceland, a country so sparsely populated that almost everyone knows everyone else, is successfully applying this system.) 

Although he has been elected ‘fair and square’, Donald Trump may not make it into the White House, whence he, together with Putin and Xi could move toward a multi-polar world organized along those lines. Guided by ‘an invisible hand’, thousands of people protest the neo-fascist, misogynist, racist president who defeated his neo-fascist rival preparing for nuclear-war against Russia, and whose backers, unlike the protesters, have the means to once again implement the ‘ultimate solution’ against an American president.

591,Swedish Journo: Sweden Will Collapse Without Illegal Migrants,"Swedish writer Åsa Linderborg has claimed the Swedish economy would collapse if it was not for illegal migrants who she says are vital to the economy. [Ms. Linderborg, who serves as the cultural editor for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, wrote an opinion piece on Monday: “Yes, there is a problem with those who are denied their asylum applications and then go underground,” but added: “It’s equally true that Sweden would stop working if the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants who are here vanished for real. ”  Linderborg made the argument that illegal migrants do the jobs that Swedes refuse to do saying illegals were the ones who worked   jobs like cleaning and in the service industry. The piece comes as a reaction to the news the terrorist in the Stockholm attack was a failed asylum seeker set to be deported. Following the attack, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven said that Sweden would no longer employ an open door policy for illegal migrants.  Though Linderborg claimed the Swedish economy relies solely on migrants, various reports have shown the opposite is true and that migrants are often the most likely to be unemployed in the country. A report from December 2015 predicted that six out of every 10 unemployed people in Sweden would come from a foreign background by 2017.  In October 2016, the employment numbers for Swedes were so high that some economists considered Swedes to have full employment. People from migrant backgrounds were almost opposite with some 21. 6 per cent being unemployed.    Of the 163, 000 migrants that Sweden took in during the migrant crisis in late 2015, fewer than 500 had found jobs as of June 2016.      Linderborg claims Sweden is “exploiting” the migrants who do work because many of them are low skilled and are paid low wages. She then called on the prime minister to invest in migrants to improve their job prospects. The daughter of a former member of the Left Party, Linderborg was also a member of the Left Party and a member of the “Communist Youth” during the 1980s.  Sweden is not the only country to have issues with migrants and unemployment. In Germany, economists have said the idea that migrants will become the skilled workers of tomorrow is an illusion and that mass migration will ultimately hurt economic growth in the long term.

593,"In Iowa, Trump Voters Are Unfazed by Controversies - The New York Times","MONTICELLO, Iowa  —   The Table of Knowledge was delving into   Donald J. Trump’s plans to upend government, and marveling at how he had forced his fellow Republicans in the House to reverse themselves on gutting the Office of Congressional Ethics. “He’s getting responses things are happening,” Jerry Retzlaff, a retiree, said. “He got Congress to turn themselves around with one tweet. ” “There’s no secret the press doesn’t like him, and neither does a lot of the leadership,” he added. “And that’s because he’s planning on making a lot of changes. ” The eight men around a rectangular table, sipping coffee from a hodgepodge of mugs donated by customers, meet daily for breakfasts of French toast, eggs and bacon at Darrell’s diner, all while solving the world’s problems, hence their gathering’s nickname. Washington may be veering from one Trump   controversy to another: unproved reports of Russia’s holding embarrassing information against him, possible ethical conflicts, the donors and billionaires of his cabinet, his pushback against intelligence findings on Russian hacking in the election. But there does not seem to be much angst in Iowa among those who voted for Mr. Trump, including some Democrats and independents. Monticello, in rural eastern Iowa, is as close as any place to the epicenter of the political quake that made Mr. Trump president. The state’s longstanding reputation as a political bellwether had led The New York Times to move me to Iowa for a full year ahead of its presidential caucuses in early 2016. I had not returned since. In the intervening year, Iowa gave  Mr. Trump his largest triumph of any battleground state: a    reversal over President Obama’s easy victory here in 2012. Al Ameling, 58, a technical analyst who lives in Marble Rock, near the Minnesota border, is representative of the profound demographic shift among white rural voters in the northern Midwest that helped produce Mr. Trump’s stunning upset. Mr. Ameling voted for Mr. Obama in 2008, sat out in 2012 and enthusiastically backed Mr. Trump. Nothing he has heard since Election Day has shaken his support, including reports this week that American intelligence agencies are investigating unverified accounts of meetings between Trump aides and Russian officials, as well as sex tapes purportedly made of Mr. Trump in Moscow. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the allegations completely false. “The way it is nowadays, unless I see positive proof, it’s all a lie,” Mr. Ameling said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. He added he was more concerned that government officials might have leaked the material to the news media. “I don’t know if it was classified, but if it was, whoever leaked it needs to go to jail,” he said. “We need law and order back in this country. ” I headed to Monticello because it was the site of Hillary Clinton’s first campaign stop after declaring her candidacy for the Democratic nomination in 2015. When she rolled up in her black van, a pack of journalists took off at a run, myself included, an enduringly silly image. Mrs. Clinton rarely returned to the state in the general election campaign, giving it up as all but lost. Jones County, which includes Monticello, is the birthplace of the painter Grant Wood, and where older men still wear the style of pinstriped overalls in his “American Gothic. ” It is a beautiful place, with bald eagles soaring over wintry farm fields. Mr. Trump carried the county by 20 percentage points Mr. Obama easily won there four years earlier. At Darrell’s, there are actually two Tables of Knowledge, one favored by Democrats and the other by Republicans. Among them are an optometrist, farmers and former employees of a utility company. I asked if there was anyone who had voted for Mr. Trump after having previously supported Mr. Obama. “Yeah, there is, but they won’t tell you,” said Mr. Retzlaff, an outspoken conservative who usually chooses to sit with the liberals. Mel Manternach, a retired farmer, said many farmers who had once voted for Mr. Obama switched to Mr. Trump, which he found perplexing. “Trump was against T. P. P. which would help exports of ag commodities,” he said, referring to the   Partnership, a   deal. “They voted against their own  . ” The Iowans I interviewed largely went about their lives outside the political hothouse of social media. They did not follow    developments of the presidential transition. Indeed, on Wednesday, several were unfamiliar with the reports that Russia was holding compromising information on the   which Mr. Trump addressed in a news conference. Many were hazy on specific policy details about how, say, House Republicans were seeking to replace Medicare with a voucher system. These voters feared an outbreak of   terrorist attacks by Muslims in the United States, maybe in their own communities. And overwhelmingly, Trump supporters did not want their   money redistributed to people they regarded as undeserving. A year ago, I shadowed a Clinton   in Newton, a small city in central Iowa that has struggled since Maytag closed a washing machine plant. Jeff McKibben, one of the   workers, traded down for work at a prison. Once a “straight Democrat,” as he called himself, he refused to commit at the time to support Mrs. Clinton. Contacted recently, he did not want to say how he voted, although Jasper County, which includes Newton, was one of the more than 30 Iowa counties that swung to Mr. Trump from Mr. Obama. “Maybe it’s time to have some change,” Mr. McKibben allowed. “I saw neighbors I knew were strong union people with Trump signs in their yards. ” The story was the same in Des Moines County, in southeastern Iowa. The local Democratic Party chairwoman, Sandy Dockendorff, knew there was trouble when she saw a Trump sign in the yard of an electrician who had always supported Democrats. “When I called him,” Ms. Dockendorff explained last month to a group of demoralized activists at a United Steelworkers union hall, “he said, ‘You stopped talking my language you don’t care about jobs.’ ” In an interview, Ms. Dockendorff, who is running for chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said rural Iowans were critical of Democrats for opposing   projects like oil pipelines while running a presidential campaign focused narrowly on Mr. Trump’s shortcomings. “It was all about making fun of Donald Trump  —   he would never be president and how horrible it would be,” she said. But “the only one talking about jobs was Trump,” Ms. Dockendorff added. At a Des Moines County diner in Burlington, a small city on the Mississippi River, Melissa Ell, a waitress, said she had voted for Mr. Obama in 2012. But this Election Day, she stayed home. “I didn’t want to vote for either one of them, to be honest,” she said. Ms. Ell, 46, earns a base wage of $6. 50 an hour at Jerry’s Main Lunch, a   restaurant across from the Burlington Northern Railroad tracks. As she bused a table, Ms. Ell commiserated with Jackie Furman about those who take advantage of government aid. “I think they should be   if they’re on welfare,” Ms. Ell said. “The welfare system needs to be reorganized,” agreed Ms. Furman, a retired commercial bakery manager, complaining that “Chicago people” were moving to Burlington to receive higher benefits and bringing crime. Ms. Furman, 70, said, “I’m ashamed to say we caucused for Obama” in 2008. “My view is he purposely got into the presidency so he could ruin America. ” There are contrary views. On Washington Street in Burlington, I expected Post 10102 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to be a bastion of support for the   who had promised repeatedly to “take care of the vets. ” But there was deep skepticism. “Forget about me,” Dan Meade, a Navy veteran, said. “What’s going to happen to our kids, our grandkids? I think the guy’s nuts. ” He and three others sipped $1. 50 draft beers from plastic cups. They sarcastically echoed notable Trump lines from the campaign trail. “He knows more than the generals he doesn’t like prisoners of war,” Dan Warren, an Army veteran, said. “When Trump was running for office he said he’d run the country like he runs his companies,” Fran Boyle, who served in the Navy, chimed in. “Which one of his bankrupt companies is he going to run it like?” Still, Trump voters in the state say they are hoping for the best. Mike Staudt, a retired farmer from Marble Rock, voted for Mr. Obama in 2012, but called the Affordable Care Act a form of socialism. He said he had no problem with a candidate who had run as the voice of the working people but was stocking his cabinet with the ultrawealthy. “I know these guys are really rich,” he said. “They may have pulled off a few plays that weren’t exactly on the    but they all had to be pretty smart to be billionaires. If they replace their own concerns with the concerns of the country, they can make things really move forward. That’s what I’m excited about. ”",0
594,Radical American-Grown Marxist Terror Group Just Made Announcement For January 20th | Conservative Daily Post,"
Posted by Elliot Bougis | Nov 18, 2016 | National Security Trump/Pence 2016: Lawful Good vs. Chaotic Evil 
I’m a nerd but please bear with me: 
Yesterday I asked some friends online about an economic theory that some of them are interested in and one friend, who does not support this theory, made a joke about “getting the Marxists out of the way first.” A little later a friend who does support the theory replied with irritation that it must be a joke to think Marxists are actually in power in this country. 
I won’t bore you with the rest of the discussion, but imagine my surprise when I saw an article this morning about–wait for it–powerful Marxists in America! 
As Michael Volpe reports at The Daily Caller: 
A Marxist, a Venezuelan diplomat and an illegal alien headlined a meeting of organizers of the Trump resistance as they announced their plan to shut down Chicago on Saturday and Washington, D.C. on Inauguration Day. Chicago ANSWER was one of the radical leftist groups that helped to organize anti-Trump protests when his campaign tried to hold a rally in March ; that rally was canceled after protesters clashed with attendees. As The DC reported last week , the group is responsible for organizing rallies in Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Albuquerque. Since holding those rallies, the group has announced “mass marches” on Inauguration Day in Washington and another one in Chicago on Saturday; the group hopes to “shut the streets down” at both rallies. In other words, if they can’t win an election legally, they’ll try to reverse it with violence and “birddogging” chaos. Before we go any further down this sad road, I want you to keep two things in mind. First, this is what Marxism always does. When it fails one group of people, it oozes away like a red version of The Blob to consume some other poor, unsuspecting populace with its cultural and economic acids. Now that Marxism has left Venezuela devastated and poor, the swarm of Marxist fire ants are trying to do the same here. The Socialist Blob: Coming Soon To A Community Center Near You! Second, like a lot of critics of Trump, these Marxist ants don’t listen to his positive message and policy proposals. Instead, like a swarm of worker ants following their queen, the mainstream media, they fixate on the “racist” or “sexist” or “mean” things Trump reportedly said. As I wrote yesterday, Trump hired Steve Bannon for many reasons, but one reason in particular is because they both care about economic justice, middle-class prosperity, and a strong national labor force. So remember: 1) these ants are making trouble for Trump because they smell fresh meat after leaving rotten meat in other places and 2) they are fighting a presidency that will actually help the people they say they care about. Now back to Volpe’s report: On Nov. 15, the group held a meeting to plot its next move in its ongoing resistance of the Trump in a space normally operated by the Mexican Solidarity Network, a less well-known group in the mold of La Raza. CHICAGO ANSWER organizers, Stephanie and Mika, co-chaired the evening and Mika said he was also an organizer with the Party for Socialist and Liberation, a radical Marxist group and a frequent partner of ANSWER. Mika fired up the crowd. “What do want?” he yelled at the crowd. “Justice,” the crowd roared back. Same as Donald Trump! Law and order! Drain the swamp! “When do we want it,” he screamed again. “Now,” the crowd roared even louder. “People can and must be organized in a deepening resistance,” Stephanie said. “As united as possible, as militant as possible.” She also said she was willing to “work with anyone to resist this administration.” Because these ants have no ideas or skills to contribute to society, they prefer to tear anyone who is trying to help in concrete ways–hence they hate a celebrated DOER like Donald Trump. Jesús Rodríguez-Espinoza is the Counsel General for the Venezuelan consulate in Chicago and while the rest of the speakers accused Trump of the normal litany of grievances — that he’s a racist, homophobe, misogynist and charlatan — Rodriguez said his diplomatic position forbade him from weighing in on Trump. “Before I was the Counsel General in Chicago, I was a regular citizen in Venezuela just like you, in 2002, was moved in my basement because of the attack against Hugo Chavez. Because of that I started getting involved in politics. Rodriguez-Espinoza said he became a supporter of Chavez after that. Just goes to show: never trust a Jesus that isn’t in the Bible. Rodriquez-Espinoza also claimed the current economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is over-blown. “All the humanitarian crisis that you hear in the media most of that is an exaggeration. The only crisis we face is destabilization in Venezuelan oil. I’m not saying everything is perfect; I’m just saying it’s overmagnified because it’s in the interest of the most powerful countries in the world to get rid of the progressive government in Venezuela.” According to a June Guardian story , Venezuela has an economic crisis where Gross Domestic Product is contracting by 8 percent, unemployment was at 17 percent, and the inflation rate was at 482 percent. As always, facts are inconvenient things at times. Plus, if oil is Venezuela’s main (only??) economic problem, then people like Rodriguez-Espinoza should try to work with Trump as a successful business developer, dealmaker, and, as of this Tuesday, the President-elect over the largest oil discovery in America of all time (20 BILLION barrels in the Permian Basin in southwest Texas). But because he is a short-sighted ant, Roqriguez-Espinoza, and all Marxist ants, to be honest, only know how to swarm and scurry and bite so they can feel “progressive.” Far be it from them to take the humble, slow route of working, developing, building, and planning like Trump and most of his supporters do on a daily basis.

595,"Guardian Opinion Writer: Trump, Bannon Counting On Terrorist ’Massacre’","Writing at the Guardian newspaper, global warming advocate Bill McKibben claimed that President Donald Trump and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon are “counting on” a terrorist “massacre” on American soil to “tilt things their way. ”[McKibben, who has contributed numerous opinion pieces to the Guardian, wrote a column titled “Donald Trump and Steve Bannon have turned the White House against America. ”  In the piece, McKibben claimed the White House, which he argued was acting more like a “Black Tower,” was “sending out its Breitbartian orcs and   winged harpies to poison the politics of a nation. ” He referred to Trump’s temporary halt on refugees while the U. S. revamps its flawed screening process as an “immigration ban,” which McKibben claimed was actually a “calculated assault” on Muslims, morality, and “on simple kindness. ” “It was a probe to find out if Americans would come to the defense of a minority that we’d been told to fear and hate,” he claimed.  “And it failed  —   not because a federal judge struck down the ban, but because Americans in their millions poured into airport baggage terminals and city squares. ” McKibben went on to charge that Trump and Bannon may be “counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. ” He wrote: The outpouring was not a show of Muslim strength  —   there really isn’t much Muslim strength in America. It was a demonstration that, for the moment, our moral commitment to the underdog still holds. But there are no guarantees: morality can bend pretty easily in the face of fear, and you know that Bannon and Trump are counting on a   Bowling Green massacre to tilt things their way. And in any event, morality is the not the only pillar they’re after. Next on the list is reason: the attack on climate science is, in fact, an attack on science itself, on the enterprise that undergirds modernity. McKibben’s charge about a “Bowling Green massacre” referred to an error made by Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, who mistakenly said that “President Obama had a   ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. ” In actuality, Obama’s State Department in 2011 reportedly imposed a six month freeze on the processing of Iraqi refugees. The halt was the result of the discovery of two   members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and admitted to targeting U. S. troops in Iraq. McKibben is founder of 350. org, which bills itself as a grassroots group building a “global climate movement. ”  The group is funded by the George   Tides Foundation and a slew of   philanthropies. In a 2010 review of one of his books, Time magazine opined that McKibben “may be the world’s best green journalist. ” Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

596,Putin’s Pro-Trump Online Trolls Just Spilled The Beans To Samantha Bee,"Comments 
The conservative political machine has been working overtime to try to deny that the government of the Russian Federation is interfering with the American election in support of Republican nominee Donald Trump – but this explosive investigation by former Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee proves once and for all that dictator Vladimir Putin is using every tool at his disposal to tilt the scale in favor of Trump. 
Samantha Bee, now the host of her own show, traveled to Moscow to interview two of the “thinkfluencers,” members of Putin’s underground troll farms that pose as Americans online and flood social media with pro-Russian and pro-Trump propaganda. 
“The reason I’m hired is to make simple people change their mind about their vote and also about Russia” said one woman, who admitted she identifies herself as a Nebraskan housewife online. When asked why they thought their propaganda was working, she replied it was because Americans are “lazy and they believe everything they read.”",0
597,"Along Mosul’s Front Line, Desperate Civilians and Dug-In Troops and Fighters - The New York Times","In the battle against the Islamic State for Mosul, Iraq’s   city, there is no continuous front line, but a patchwork of battlegrounds in the city and all around its edge. When the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, retreats from a position, it tries to leave as much damage behind as possible, including burning oil field wells to provide concealment ahead of a government advance. Snipers are also in place, ready to strike. A village or neighborhood that is retaken by government troops could soon be flooded again with extremist fighters, who are rarely far away. I recently spent three weeks in this volatile zone, first with the Iraqi Army in eastern Mosul and then, after setbacks for the army, whose    battle of attrition was not going the way it had hoped, with units of the Iraqi federal police. The police, traveling in armored vehicles, are playing a significant role in the battle for Mosul, sometimes supporting the army. They are also responsible for holding their own territory around the city. The police have been tasked with maintaining areas of the front line nearby, ISIS fighters are ready and in position. When holding ground and not on an advance, the two sides intermittently exchange rifle and mortar fire,   shows of force that tend to harass more than inflict serious casualties. For the two days I was embedded with the police, they had been ordered to pause in their advance. So for the most part, they were left to wait along a muddy front until the next push forward. For the civilians trapped by the fighting, life is bleak, and most are desperate to leave. Areas along the contested front have no water, no electricity and no way for people to obtain basic supplies. Those trapped by the fighting and those who return hoping to restart their lives  —   or at least to recover some belongings  —   are at risk of being caught in the   and injuries and deaths among civilians are increasing. When government forces liberate an area, most civilians act quickly to try to evacuate. However, the Islamic State appears eager to keep as many civilians as possible in the urban center, using them as shields against aggressive bombing campaigns by the government and coalition forces. Anyone seen fleeing risks a sniper attack. Government troops sometimes escort families to safety, urging them to hurry through streets that offer little cover. Once civilians reach a safe zone, a more organized system is in place to transport them in buses and on the backs of trucks to camps for displaced people. On the way, they receive donations of food and water. Iraqi forces have been told to destroy evidence of the Islamic State after retaking an area, but signs of its control can sometimes be difficult to efface. Coalition   bombings destroyed an Islamic State training base in a former agricultural college in the town of Hamam Alil, below. But ISIS writing, which states the name of a unit, remains visible on the wall. Residents, like the women below in the town of Bashiqa, are starting to return to areas recently freed from the Islamic State to learn what became of their homes and to gather the few belongings that have not been looted or destroyed. The woman below was recovering a wedding photo from the rubble in Bashiqa, northeast of Mosul. The town, famous for its olive groves, was once a popular day trip destination from the city and had a large population of Yazidis. The Islamic State’s control of Mosul and the nearby area separated families for long stretches. The relatives below, reunited on the side of the road, had not seen one another in two years. The battle for Mosul has forced many tens of thousands from their homes, and displaced people are a common sight along the roads across the city. Early in my assignment, I accompanied the Iraqi Army to this neighborhood below, which is in the eastern part of Mosul, where civilians dared to venture outside as government troops patrolled. But just a few hours after this photo was taken, Islamic State fighters attacked an Iraqi Army field base nearby, killing soldiers, destroying their armored vehicles and almost immediately posting a YouTube video triumphantly showing their accomplishment. After that, access for photographers was severely curtailed by the army, and journalists quickly went from having a   seat to this very critical battle to struggling to get any information at all. Ambulances carrying those gravely injured from sniper fire, artillery, mortars and mines are driven out of Mosul in a steady flow en route to hospitals in nearby Erbil. When fighting is heavy, dozens of injured people arrive at the hospitals every hour. Field hospitals inside Mosul have few supplies, so victims must be evacuated to where they can be treated. Some do not survive the journey. The emergency vehicles offered me one of the most reliable indications of how the battle was going, and a chance to document the results. The government has been trying to consolidate its gains, first in the outer provincial villages, and now in suburbs and city districts ever closer to the city center. But the Islamic State had a long time to prepare for this battle, and its fighters are skilled and   taking full advantage of their underground network of tunnels throughout the region. A long and difficult fight lies ahead for Iraqi forces trying to liberate Mosul, like this lone federal policeman on a still very dangerous and shifting front line.",0
598,"As Second Avenue Subway Opens, a Train Delay Ends in (Happy) Tears - The New York Times","Finally. The Second Avenue subway opened in New York City on Sunday, with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making. They descended beneath the streets of the Upper East Side of Manhattan to board Q trains bound for Coney Island in Brooklyn. They cheered. Their eyes filled with tears. They snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations. It was the first day of 2017, and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line. In a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened New Yorkers, they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes, taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations. “I was very choked up,” Betsy Morris, 70, said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th Street station, at noon. “How do you explain something that you never thought would happen? It’s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes. ” It was a major moment for New York’s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of Manhattan the subway did not reach. The opening of the first segment of the line  —   an extension of the Q train to 96th Street  —   promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains along Lexington Avenue, the nation’s most overcrowded subway line, which had been the only line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. When the stations opened shortly before noon, they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old, and strollers, suitcases and dogs  —   all familiar sights across the system. But for all the excitement, the line, with just three new stops, is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of Manhattan that was once envisioned. It serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city, which has more than eight and a half million people and many   and minority residents who live far from a subway line. With the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948, much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays, even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in March. Still, there was reason to cheer. The opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the United States and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation’s infrastructure, from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems. Few new subway stations have opened in recent years, even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in Asia, and most American cities never built any in the first place. The major subways in the Northeast  —   in New York, Washington and Boston  —   are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls, with Washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems. With mounting bills for basic maintenance, these subways have largely failed to grow. So the arrival of the   Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s, was a notable achievement for the   Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s vast network of subways, buses and commuter railroads. The first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4. 4 billion. With the opening, the map of the city’s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations, bringing the total to 472  —   the most of any subway in the world. A station that opened at Hudson Yards on Manhattan’s Far West Side in 2015 was the city’s first new station in a  . On Sunday, New Yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls. At the 72nd Street stop, Sumana Harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of South Asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari, looking at her cellphone. Ms. Harihareswara was overcome with emotion. “I don’t think I’ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen,” she said through tears. “This woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin. ” She and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance. “Representation matters,” they agreed. Ms. Harihareswara, a longtime transit enthusiast from Astoria, Queens, said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics, including a mural of a gay couple holding hands. “There is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of New York,” Ms. Harihareswara said. After decades of aborted efforts to build the Second Avenue line, and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s, construction on the current segment began in 2007. The line was originally projected to open in 2013, but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who effectively controls the authority, pressed officials to meet the December 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time. Still, the agency made the deadline  —   just barely  —   with a lavish inaugural ride on New Year’s Eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast. Although many New Yorkers believe the city runs the subways, it is actually the governor who appoints the authority’s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency. Mr. Cuomo has capitalized on the Second Avenue opening to raise his national profile, overshadowing his frequent nemesis Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who attended the inaugural ride on Saturday but was not given a speaking slot. Despite general good will over the opening, some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th Street in East Harlem as planned. On Sunday morning, Mr. Cuomo arrived at the 96th Street station with the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, to join the first trip for regular riders, who cheered as the train pulled out of the station. Then Mr. Cuomo’s voice came over the loudspeaker. “Rest assured: I’m not driving the train,” he joked. The first day of service was smooth, although there were a few hiccups. Around 3 p. m. there were delays on the Q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the City Hall station. About an hour earlier, the elevator at the new 86th Street stop had begun to malfunction, stranding passengers above and below ground. Strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators. Parents became upset. Jill Tallmer, 62, and her mother, Margot Tallmer, 91, contemplated visiting another day. “We’ve been waiting for 10 years, or more, to ride,” the younger Ms. Tallmer said while standing with her mother, a lifelong New Yorker who is in a wheelchair. “Hopefully, it’s almost ready for us. ” It was not, and they left after a few minutes. At the 72nd Street station, George Braith, a jazz saxophonist, was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi. The reason for his newfound celebrity: His likeness is featured in a mosaic there. “Would you look at that guy?” Mr. Braith, 77, said. “Pretty handsome fellow if you ask me. ” He is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork, including chef Daniel Boulud. In Mr. Braith’s mosaic, he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature Braithophone, alto and soprano saxophones melded into one. Taking the instrument from his suitcase, he obliged the crowd with a brief tune. “Are you famous?” a   asked, seeing the hubbub. “In the jazz world,” Mr. Braith replied. The man shook his head and said, “Well, you’re immortalized as far as I’m concerned. ” Another   celebrant, Ian Ma, 15, lives in Sheepshead Bay, a waterfront neighborhood in southern Brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line. But he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child, he said, and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this train my whole life,” he said, seemingly speaking for many others.",0
599,71-Year-Old Cher Dons See-Through Top and Nipple Pasties at Billboard Awards,"Pop icon Cher left little to the imagination while performing some of her biggest hits at Sunday night’s Billboard Music Awards, the singer’s first awards show concert in 15 years. [The    icon performed her smash hits “Believe” and “If I Could Turn Back Time” Sunday night before accepting the ceremony’s Icon Award for her   career in the music industry.  The   and   danced on stage wearing a silver diamante dress, with her chest covered up by   nipple pasties. The sparkling dress, which consisted of multiple hanging diamond strips, barely covered the singers chest and groin area. She later returned to the stage in a black catsuit and a large   wig, a throwback to her early 80s look.  “So, I wanted to do what I do since I was 4 years old, and I’ve been doing it for 53 years,” Cher said in accepting the Icon Award. “That is not an applause thing, I’m 71 yesterday! And I can do a   plank, okay? Just saying. ” The singer steered clear of politics in her acceptance speech, focusing instead on the advice she received when she was younger and on something her mother told her before she became famous, that she would never be the “smartest,” the “prettiest,” or the “most talented,” but she would be “special. ” “I think luck has so much to do with with my success,” she continued. “I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in. ” Cher’s outfit drew plenty of commentary on social media and on television, including on Good Morning Britain, where host Piers Morgan said he was not a fan. “At what point do Cher’s outfits become inappropriate? She’s 70,” he said. “That one in particular, come on, Cher, for goodness’ sake, love. ”   Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

600,Report: Stopping Only Nine Percent of Illegal Alien Border Crossers Would Pay for Trump’s Border Wall - Breitbart,"If President Donald Trump’s promised border wall stops only a small fraction of illegal aliens from coming into the U. S. it would save the U. S. billions and easily cover the cost of the wall, a report released Thursday finds. [The   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) using the estimated education level of illegal alien border crossers and immigrant education estimates from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) found that each illegal alien entering the U. S. racks up at least $74, 722 in lifetime costs, funded by American taxpayers.  “[I]f a border wall stopped a small fraction of the illegal immigrants who are expected to come in the next decade, the fiscal savings from having fewer illegal immigrants in the country would be sufficient to cover the costs of the wall,” writes CIS Director of Research Steven Camarota.  Even a minimally effective border wall that stopped less than ten percent of illegal crossings would save the U. S. billions. “If a border wall stopped between 160, 000 and 200, 000 illegal crossers —  nine to 12 percent of those expected to successfully cross in the next decade —  the scaled savings would equal the $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall,” Camarota writes. Approximately 170, 000 illegal aliens crossed into the U. S. without going through a port of entry in 2015, according to a study commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “[T]here may be 1. 7 million successful crossings in the next decade. If a wall stopped just 9 to 12 percent of these crossings it would pay for itself,” the CIS report states. “If a wall stopped half of those expected to successfully enter illegally without going through a port of entry at the southern border over the next 10 years, it would save taxpayers nearly $64 billion —  several times the wall’s cost,” the report adds. And that’s excluding the cost of children produced by illegal immigrants. The federal government imposes a massive, unfunded mandate on school districts around the country by forcing American parents to divert funding from their own children to educate roughly 3. 62 million foreign students, many of whom are extremely   students and do not speak English. The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) found it costs taxpayers $59. 8 billion per year to educate roughly 3. 62 million   students, children with one or two legal migrant parents, and refugees. Approximately one in ten students enrolled in public schools is designated as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and their academic performance has been described as “abominable”: The number of eighth to twelfth grade LEP students performing Advanced work rounds to zero percent, for example. The CIS report notes that the estimates do not include illegal aliens who overstay their visas, and state and local governments bear a significant portion of illegal immigration’s costs.",0
601,ICE Union Issues Final Warning to Voters,"Email 
In September the National ICE Council, representing some 5,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers charged with protecting the country’s borders, did something it has never done: It endorsed a candidate for president: Donald Trump. In its statement at the time, the union said: In [Trump’s] immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security — including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory retainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. 
On the contrary, said the union, Hillary Clinton supports furthering “amnesty” and a “radical” immigration plan that will cost thousands of Americans not only their jobs but their lives . 
On Friday the union issued a “final warning,” expanding its concern about how open borders would cost Americans their lives. Wrote the council’s president, Chris Crane: Hillary’s pledge for ‘open borders’ will mean disaster for our country, and turn the present border emergency into a cataclysm. Hillary’s plan would unleash violent cartels and brutal transnational gangs into US communities and cause countless preventable deaths…. ICE officers on the front lines are witnessing a deluge of illegal immigration unlike anything we have seen before. The corporate-funded media won’t cover it. Our officers are being ordered to release recent border-crossers with no idea what their intentions are or what they are planning. Gang members, drug cartels and violent smugglers are taking advantage of the situation and threatening American communities. The influx is overwhelming public resources, especially in poor communities — including Hispanic communities and immigrant communities bearing the economic brunt of the illegal immigration surge. 
There are economic, cultural, and moral reasons for concerns about open borders, as noted by economist Gene Callahan. Unlimited immigration would likely lead to lower wages for Americans who would have to cut their wage demands or be replaced by immigrant workers willing to work for lower wages. 
Culturally an unlimited dumping of immigrants onto an unprepared and unsuspecting culture would alter that culture irreparably. Consider the Native American culture, he said: If Native Americans had been able to limit the flow of European immigrants, they might have been able to preserve their land and cultures. 
Morally there is a responsibility to take care of those less able to care for themselves but not to the point of reducing their own circumstances to penury: While the rich have an obligation to help the poor, that obligation does not extend to the degree that they must become poor themselves. 
Since every resident in the United States, except maybe for those Native Americans, is either an immigrant or a descendent of one, it makes sense to welcome immigrants. Until 1875, there were no immigration laws. But with the passage of the Page Act of 1875, legislators began defining the procedures under which those desiring to immigrate into the country would have to follow. 
Since then immigration laws have been heavily modified, but they have always defined those procedures and conditions. If the laws need to be changed again, then legislators should change them. But they must be followed, not ignored for political purposes. Otherwise, unintended consequences, such as those noted in the ICE Council’s warning, will overtake the culture and risk destroying the very culture that makes it presently so inviting for those seeking a better life.

602,How an Elite New York Police Unit Rehearses for a Terrorist Attack - The New York Times,"In the winding hallways and stuffy rooms of an old factory in Brooklyn, under bulbs flickering as if in a horror movie, an elite new police unit prepares, over and over again, for the attack it knows is coming. Day after day, the officers comb the highest floor of the building, looking for witnesses to point them to the right door and listening for gunshots like those that have echoed all over the world in recent months. They are conducting exercises to help them hunt down an “active shooter. ” “It’s going to happen,” said Chief James R. Waters, who leads the New York Police Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau. “Something like Orlando’s going to happen. ” Last year, the police announced the creation of a heavily armed and armored regiment called the Critical Response Command. Teams of officers work all over the city and are trained to respond to many locations in three to five minutes. They represent a new response to a new threat. Gone are the days when the first officers on a scene set up a perimeter and waited for backup or a   team. The perpetrators of the most recent wave of mass shootings around the world  —   Paris San Bernardino, Calif. Orlando, Fla.  —   were not interested in taking hostages and negotiating. They came to kill for the sake of killing. And these officers are trained to find and stop them. On Thursday, Chief Waters allowed journalists from The New York Times to watch the Critical Response Command train. “This is seven months of work,” he said, standing before a team of officers in bulletproof vests who were cradling Colt M4 semiautomatic rifles. “It’s incredible progress. ” The officers were practicing in a former pharmaceutical factory on Flushing Avenue in the Fort Greene neighborhood. The Police Department is not listed among the building’s tenants, but it has worked there since before the command’s creation. The journalists were allowed to observe the exercises under restrictions. A photographer and videographer were forbidden to document the command as it moved in drills, and a reporter was asked to describe the tactics only in broad strokes. Department leaders believe terrorists study descriptions of police training in preparation for attacks. “The perpetrators in France demonstrated a familiarity with the French response,” Deputy Chief Scott Shanley said, referring to the coordinated attacks in Paris that killed more than 130 people in November. The officers, who also played the roles of gunmen and bystanders, conducted two exercises. The first began with a dispatcher’s call: shots fired in the building. Officers in a patrol car would typically be the first to respond in this situation, and that was the case in the drill. Two officers, clutching pistols, entered the hallway, crouching, one in front and the other behind him with a hand on the first officer’s back. Officers in the command do not know the details of an exercise beforehand. Suddenly, a man ran toward them, screaming for help. The officers ordered him to his knees and asked about the gunman the man pointed down the hall. The officers hurried around a corner. Gunfire rang out. “Shots fired!” the rear officer shouted into his radio, and the pair ran to the sound. A masked gunman, wearing green fatigues in a room with cubicles, opened fire. The officers fired back. Rounds with a chalklike substance, similar to paintballs, struck the gunman. He fell to the floor. The rear officer shouted “Loading! Loading! Loading!” and ejected a spent magazine from his pistol, sliding in a new one. The other officer bent and took the gunman’s pulse. Dead. They called for backup and waited. What followed was an extraordinary show of paramilitary precision and force. New Yorkers have grown accustomed to seeing heavily armed officers standing in subway stations and at city landmarks. They have not seen what journalists were allowed to see on Thursday  —   a response to an   scene from within the scene itself. The door through which the first responding officers had entered crept open again, and a head popped out. Then the entire team emerged, six officers in this case, moving fast in single file, each touching the back of the man before him. They seemed to move as a single organism, like a long black snake darting across the hall to the closest door. There was no hesitation at the door, no peeking inside. The officers burst through and moved in different directions. “A dynamic entry,” Capt. Eugene McCarthy said, watching. “The perpetrator’s processing is disrupted by dynamic entry,” Deputy Chief John O’Connell said, standing beside him. To demonstrate, the command later allowed journalists to stand in an empty room and wait for the team to enter. The silence was startling, unnerving. The officers did not speak as they snaked toward the room. They communicated in pats on the back and hand signals. There was no warning of their arrival. One moment, the room was empty. A heartbeat later, it was filled with the six men and their guns. Traditionally, when officers stormed a room, the first one was known as the “rabbit,” likely drawing the fire of the gunman inside while the second officer took aim at him. With this team, it was as if there were no rabbit  —   the entire team seemed to swarm the room at once. In the exercise, the team joined the first two officers near the dead gunman, until they all heard more gunfire down the hall. The team regrouped into its line and raced toward the shots. The officer in front fired at a gunman, and others behind him stepped out of the line and did the same, and in what seemed like a second, that gunman was down and the drill over. The officers pulled off their helmets, sweating after minutes of intense action. Captain McCarthy stepped forward and ran through a quick review. The officer who played the second gunman praised the speed and accuracy of the officers who shot him. “No    issues,” he said. “Good job. ” An officer who played a victim, with fake blood on his leg, said: “No shots on me. Good job. ” The officers switched roles and prepared to do it again, the details of the drill different this time. The strategy, though, was constant. “Move to the shooter,” Chief Waters said. “You’ll hear it 50 times. Move to the shooter. It’s got to be ingrained. Like muscle memory. ” The Critical Response Command is made up of 525 handpicked officers and superiors who applied and were chosen after a screening process that included   interviews with Chief Waters and others. Their training must override lifelong human instinct. “It goes against all their upbringing,” Chief Waters said. “They have to walk past and run past victims on the ground. Kids crying. They’re grabbing at your legs. ” The training is always evolving with world events. The command recently introduced suicide belts into exercises. Chief Waters declined to elaborate. The visit on Thursday concluded with directions through more hallways to the elevator. There, waiting, one could hear, from behind, more gunfire.",0

The man who obliterated Donald Trump's Hollywood Walk of Fame star says on video that he just did it to 'help' people. 
The man, who identified himself to Deadline Hollywood as Jamie Otis, pretended to be a construction worker to give himself cover at 5:30 Wednesday morning, as he took a pickaxe and sledgehammer to the terrazzo and cement star. 
Trump earned the star, which is situated on Hollywood Boulevard near the Dolby Theater, in 2007 for his work on “Celebrity Apprentice.” But in just a few minutes it was destroyed:

Now the man has reappeared on video admitting the vandalism, but says he did it for an altruistic cause: 
“I really wanted to do this. I think it's a symbol for all of us against sexual assault.” 
He said his intention was to sell pieces of the star to raise money for the women who have accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing. None of the women have provided concrete proof of their claims. 
The man, a self-proclaimed activist, admitted in an exclusive TMZ interview that this isn't his first rodeo: 
“I'm a non violent activist. I've been arrested 24, 25 times. I'd love to go to court with Mr. Trump, it would be a great honor.” 
Without irony, the man claimed that Trump is “a bully” and that he needs to “ease up.” 
This isn't the first time Trump's star has been the target of vandals. Recently, the star was surrounded by a cement box:

Unfortunately for Mr. Otis, police are currently looking for him, with the possibility that he'll be charged with a felony. Additionally, the star he destroyed in the name of justice is worth $30,000. ",0
604,California Today: A View of San Francisco’s Leaning Tower From Space - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Two European satellites have captured a stunning portrait of the subtle topographical shifts at work in the landscape of the San Francisco Bay Area. The Sentinel satellites, operated by the European Space Agency, have been snapping radar scans of the region since 2015 as part of their mission to collect data on the earth and oceans. Analysts have since compared the movement of physical features over time  —   down to mere millimeters. Among the project’s starkest depictions are shifts along the Hayward Fault, the gradual sinking of reclaimed land in the San Rafael Bay, and the rise of the city of Pleasanton, a possible side effect of replenished groundwater. The images align with already understood geological processes, said Roland Bürgmann, a professor of earth and planetary science at U. C. Berkeley, who was not involved in the project. But scientists believe that the acute level of detail offered by the technology could deepen knowledge in a number of areas, among them structural engineering, earthquake prediction and insurance risk. “It’s developing a new potential for the world that has never existed,” said Dag Anders Moldestad, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Space Center who participated in the project. In the case of the Millennium Tower, it could also become a factor in a court fight as San Francisco wages a legal battle that accuses the developers of failing to disclose issues with the structural integrity of the downtown skyscraper. The Sentinel satellite images  —   captured from early 2015 to September of this year  —   show that the   luxury condominium building is sinking into the soft soil below at a rate of nearly two inches a year. A separate examination this year found that the tower had descended about 16 inches altogether, while tilting roughly six inches, since opening its doors in 2009. The developer has insisted that the building is safe. Nicholas Sitar, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said that a small amount of sinking was to be expected among structures on the reclaimed land along San Francisco’s waterfront. The Sentinel satellites, for example, found that the new Salesforce East tower, across the street from the Millennium Tower, was also sinking. The rapid rate of the Millennium Tower’s descent, however, was troubling, Dr. Sitar said.

About a dozen readers wrote to point out the error: the towering rock in the photograph was Yosemite Valley’s Half Dome, not Sentinel Dome as the caption claimed. That made us wonder if it might be time for a visit. While summer tends to be the park’s busiest time of the year, Yosemite regulars will tell you it is never more blissfully serene than in the winter. Crucially, it’s much less crowded. In the summer, up to 600, 000 people visit each month, said Scott Gediman, a park spokesman. During the winter months, it’s usually fewer than 200, 000. “The park is beautiful right now,” said Mr. Gediman, speaking by phone from the Yosemite Valley on Tuesday. “Yosemite Falls is flowing. You’ve got ice on the canyon walls. It’s just gorgeous and peaceful. ” Most of Yosemite is cloaked by snow in the winter, including at times the valley, which sits about 4, 000 feet above sea level. Visitors can ice skate, snowshoe,   ski or even hit the slopes. Established in 1935, Yosemite Ski and Snowboard Area, formerly known as Badger Pass, is California’s oldest ski area. According to Frank Dean, a former park ranger who lived in the valley for eight years, Yosemite in the winter offers pageants of nature that you don’t get the rest of the year. He recalled once going   skiing with some friends on New Year’s Eve. The sky had just cleared after a storm and a bright moon was illuminating a dusting of snow on the valley’s soaring granite walls. As the group passed by the luxury Ahwahnee Hotel, a onetime host of Queen Elizabeth II, they noticed a holiday celebration inside. “We couldn’t afford to go to that party,” said Mr. Dean, who now runs the Yosemite Conservancy. “But I was thinking, ‘Boy, I think we’re having the better deal out here. ’” California Today goes live at 6 a. m.

It is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion.
Our esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case.
But I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest.
I think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow, is very topical.
Last year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed.
The tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed.
I think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries’ elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature.
But some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests.
In their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this.
We may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely.
If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules.
Thus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos.
We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said.
At the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out.
But they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders.
Of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe.
It is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims.
Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.
You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.
I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.
The question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world?
Sad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood.
Sociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy.
Yes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power.
People sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite’s vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside.
At first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities’ labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda.
Friends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet.
As for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority – we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem.
By the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt – who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you’ll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any.
It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain.
This begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones.
People are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item – from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck – can be used to carry out a mass killing.
Moreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures – they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us.
The terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises.
But this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake.
We all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow.
We all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia’s calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What’s more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose.
Colleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter.
Today it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models.
We have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone.
In our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today.
There are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won’t be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners.
It is necessary to add to the international agenda the issue of restoring the Middle Eastern countries’ lasting statehood, economy and social sphere. The mammoth scale of destruction demands drawing up a long-term comprehensive programme, a kind of Marshall Plan, to revive the war- and conflict-ridden area. Russia is certainly willing to join actively in these team efforts.
We cannot achieve global stability unless we guarantee global economic progress. It is essential to provide conditions for creative labour and economic growth at a pace that would put an end to the division of the world into permanent winners and permanent losers. The rules of the game should give the developing economies at least a chance to catch up with those we know as developed economies. We should work to level out the pace of economic development, and brace up backward countries and regions so as to make the fruit of economic growth and technological progress accessible to all. Particularly, this would help to put an end to poverty, one of the worst contemporary problems.
It is also absolutely evident that economic cooperation should be mutually lucrative and rest on universal principles to enable every country to become an equal partner in global economic activities. True, the regionalising trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the medium term. However, regional trade agreements should complement and expand not replace the universal norms and regulations.
Russia advocates the harmonisation of regional economic formats based on the principles of transparency and respect for each other’s interests. That is how we arrange the work of the Eurasian Economic Union and conduct negotiations with our partners, particularly on coordination with the Silk Road Economic Belt project, which China is implementing. We expect it to promote an extensive Eurasian partnership, which promises to evolve into one of the formative centres of a vast Eurasian integration area. To implement this idea, 5+1 talks have begun already for an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between all participants in the process.
An important task of ours is to develop human potential. Only a world with ample opportunities for all, with highly skilled workers, access to knowledge and a great variety of ways to realise their potential can be considered truly free. Only a world where people from different countries do not struggle to survive but lead full lives can be stable.
A decent future is impossible without environment protection and addressing climate problems. That is why the conservation of the natural world and its diversity and reducing the human impact on the environment will be a priority for the coming decades.
Another priority is global healthcare. Of course, there are many problems, such as large-scale epidemics, decreasing the mortality rate in some regions and the like. So there is enormous room for advancement. All people in the world, not only the elite, should have the right to healthy, long and full lives. This is a noble goal. In short, we should build the foundation for the future world today by investing in all priority areas of human development. And of course, it is necessary to continue a broad-based discussion of our common future so that all sensible and promising initiatives are heard.
Colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I am confident that you, as members of the Valdai Club, will actively take part in this work. Your expertise enables you to understand all angles of the processes underway both in Russia and in the world, forecast and evaluate long-term trends, and put forward new initiatives and recommendations that will help us find the way to the more prosperous and sustainable future that we all badly need.
Thank you very much for your attention.

607,Chinese Social Media Rages over United Airlines Controversy - Breitbart,"Users across Chinese social media expressed their anger and called for a boycott over a viral video of an Asian doctor being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight this week. [The Wall Street Journal reports that China’s own Twitter clone and microblogging service Weibo lit up on Sunday night after the video was posted to the social media service. Within hours, the incident was the number one trending topic on the platform with 100, 000 comments and nearly 160 million views by Tuesday.  Many of the comments across Weibo focused on what many believed to be discrimination against the man based on his ethnicity. Chinese author Song Hongbing wrote, “This is inherent arrogance  …    I don’t think a    white doctor would be treated like this. ” Other Weibo users discussed boycotting the airline. Wang Guanxiong, a   investor, also posted his disapproval of the company on Weibo, saying, “Overselling is the responsibility of the airlines. Why was it an Asian who got beaten? This is purely racial discrimination  …    boycott United Airlines. ” Oscar Munoz, the CEO of United Airlines apologized for the incident in an online statement, but later an internal memo reportedly sent to United employees was leaked that stated, “Our employees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this,” China is quite a large market for United Airlines, who have operated in the country for more than 30 years, providing more nonstop routes to and from China than competitors such as American Airlines or Delta. The incident on United Airlines has sparked such a response from Chinese travellers due in part to the rise of China’s middle class, according to Linda Du, general manager at consultancy APCO Worldwide. “International travel is now really common for people, either for business or personal pleasure,” said Du. “[Chinese consumers] want equal treatment, a good experience and to be respected. They have a sense of protecting  . ” Du also noted the use of social media to express anger over the incident as an example of the Chinese public using new media to make their voices heard: “In China, most of the traditional media is regulated by the Chinese government, so social media —  the   voice —  is the only resource they have. ” In February is was reported that Weibo had 313 million active users each month, just slightly behind Twitter’s 319 million active monthly users. The service, which was developed as a clone of Twitter only for use in China, is expected to outgrow Jack Dorsey’s social media platform this year.

608,America Is Better Without Borders,"America Is Better Without Borders Steven Hahn, TIME, November 1, 2016 
“A nation without borders,” Donald Trump has warned us , “is not a nation at all.” Trump was explaining the logic of the multi-billion dollar wall he promises to build along the U.S.-Mexican border, but he was hardly the first to make the case. Years ago, Ronald Reagan said much the same about the threat of illegal immigration, and others urging border vigilance have wrapped themselves in the high-flown rhetoric. Tee-shirts and coffee mugs have turned the idea into a saleable slogan. 
{snip} 
{snip} For much of its early history, the United States had hazy borders in good part because through war, conquest and diplomacy the country was constantly expanding and the shifting boundaries were not clearly marked. There was no agreement about how far west the Louisiana Territory reached or how far south the state of Texas stretched or how far north the Oregon Territory extended. Highly charged political words and brutal conflict followed (like the U.S.-Mexican War), while the imperial eyes of many leaders fell on Cuba, Central America and Hawaii. 
What’s more, the borders that were agreed upon were remarkably porous. Until well into the nineteenth century, immigrants could come and go at will and even participate in electoral politics if they simply declared an intention to become citizens; indeed, for decades it was not at all clear what a citizen of the United States was. The only international migration policed was the African slave trade, which Congress outlawed in 1808 after nearly half a million captives had been forcibly deposited on North American shores. 
{snip} 
It is easy, when politics and ethnocentrism serve, to proclaim the principle of the nation with borders as the nation itself, while the borders are, in fact, regularly traversed by policy makers, investors and moneyed interests pursuing the main chance and wielding the big stick. Trump himself regularly touts, though refuses to reveal, his international dealings, many of which confound his goal of keeping jobs within American borders if they don’t outright violate American laws. 
Truth is that the nation’s prosperity has long rested on the labor and resourcefulness of immigrants–voluntary and involuntary, free and slave–and that those who most loudly denounce a “nation without borders” are likely descendants of immigrants who were themselves harassed for their origins, faith and lifeways at some point in the past. We would do well to recognize that in a global economy such as ours, where the movement of people and goods are the lifeblood of our sustenance, a nation’s security is best maintained not by walling itself off but by lifting the prospects–and thereby creating political allies–of working people around the world.",0
609,"More Than ’Chaos’: Terror Ties Make Venezuela Direct Threat to USA, Former UN Security Council President Says - Breitbart","The international community should not only act against Venezuela’s socialist dictatorship as a matter of principle, but to protect the world from a growing web of criminal influence to which Venezuela belongs  —   alongside Iran, Syria, Cuba, and North Korea. [So argues Diego Arria, a lifelong Venezuelan diplomat and former president of the UN Security Council who now advocates for the freedom of his country. In an interview with Breitbart News, conducted in both Spanish and English, Arria argues that the socialist Venezuelan government’s ties to terrorists, drug traffickers, and rogue states make it a threat to the global community, not merely its Latin American neighbors.  “Venezuela is a risk to international peace and security,” Arria argued. “Venezuela has extremely dangerous ties to groups in the Middle East, to Hezbollah, for example. Some say, ‘Iran’s missiles can never reach the continental United States,’ and I say, ‘yes, but if they are in Venezuela, they can reach Miami directly. ’” “We are associated with the worst causes of humanity,” Arria lamented. “We were with [former Iranian president Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad in Iran, we had ties to [late Iraqi dictator Saddam] Hussein, we had them with [late Libyan dictator Muammar] Qaddafi, we have them with the Palestinians. Never have there been in Venezuela so many Palestinians serving in high positions in the Venezuelan political hierarchy. ” Venezuela may serve “not only as an occupation site for the Cubans,” Arria argues, “but for the Chinese, the Russians, the Indians, the Palestinians  …     [this] turns Venezuela into an agitation center that is potentially very serious, and the United States has never given this the stature and importance that it should have for them. ” Arria also noted that Venezuela has close ties to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) a Marxist   organization that in 2015 was considered the wealthiest   terrorist organization in the world, surpassed in wealth only by the Islamic State and Hamas. “The relationship between Venezuela and the FARC in Colombia is extremely dangerous in my estimation because the FARC will soon be the most important and richest political party in Latin America. Those who do not enter the [President Juan Manuel] Santos pacification process will make of Venezuela an even greater drug and weapons transporting site than it is today. ” The “peace deal” between Santos’ government and the FARC will allow the terrorist group to evolve into a political party, and most FARC members are likely to avoid prison time for their crimes. The government of dictator Nicolás Maduro maintains the close ties with Iran that his predecessor Hugo Chávez cultivated, ties so close that Ahmadinejad risked a violation of sharia law to embrace Chávez’s mother at his funeral and declared he would return to earth alongside Jesus Christ and the Imam Mahdi, the Shiite Muslim figure believed to be in hiding until the prophesied end of the world. The ties between Venezuela and Iran  —   and its terror proxy, Hezbollah  —   are so close that multiple reports have accused Venezuela of selling legal documents (birth certificates, passports, etc) to   citizen Shiite terrorists to grant them easier access to the Western hemisphere than their Middle Eastern passports would allow. Maduro has also kept ties with Palestinian leaders and Syrian dictator Bashar   whose   SANA news agency regularly publishes friendly diplomatic notes from Maduro. Maduro has enjoyed economic and political support from China and Russia, and North Korea’s state newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, regularly publishes announcements that dictator Kim   has received accolades from socialist officials in the Latin American country. Venezuela’s closest ally, however, is Cuba  —   a communist state with a history of gross disregard for human rights that has killed U. S. citizens engaging in humanitarian efforts and embraced U. S. fugitive murderers as “revolutionaries. ” Asked about the role the United States can play in weakening Venezuela’s socialist tyranny, Arria suggests there is little outside sanctions and frozen assets that the international community can do. “The United States is playing a very interesting role, imposing sanctions on people tied to the regime, but they can do much more important things like following the money,” he proposed. “The United States and the Europeans know perfectly where the money is that people tied to the regime keep” and can freeze it, he added, noting that Republican legislators like Florida’s Ileana   and Marco Rubio and New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez have proposed such measures. Should the international community act to freeze Chavista assets worldwide, they will count on a Latin America more convinced than ever of the evil of Maduro’s regime. “There is a political change in Latin America, the countries who were the primary accomplices of the tyranny in Venezuela  —   Brazil with Lula [da Silva] Argentina with [Cristina Fernández de] Kirchner  —   [those governments] are not there anymore,” Arria noted. “That has been of great importance because now we have two of the largest Latin American nations supporting our efforts to recapture liberty. This is a notable change. ” Even Mexico, Arria added, a nation with what he identified as a “very accommodating policy of ” has “broken with this policy and categorically pronounced itself on Venezuela. ” “Today we have Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, about 90 percent of Latin America repudiates and condemns the Venezuelan regime,” he noted. With the support of the Organization of American State (OAS) and a few unforced errors from the Maduro regime, Arria sees an unprecedented chance to recapture the country from the socialists. “This is the largest peaceful insurrection in the history of Venezuela,” he notes. “In Latin America, we have never seen for 42 days straight 1, 000 protests, 20 daily. And it is not just in Caracas, it is in many towns. Every time they kill a young [protester] more mothers, fathers, siblings show up. ” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.",0
610,Rick Ross Documentary Video Doubles as Ad for Checkers - The New York Times,"In an effort to give back to his hometown community in Florida, Carol City, the   star Rick Ross decided to fulfill a childhood dream: He bought a Checkers   franchise. Why a Checkers? One reason seemed to rise above them all. “The No. 1 fries in the game,” Mr. Ross says in a   video released in December. The video shows Mr. Ross driving around town in his Ford truck, puffing cigars and relating stories from his childhood in the downtrodden community, which is in the Miami area. At a certain point, Mr. Ross begins talking about the burger joint he frequented as a teenager, across the thoroughfare from the carwash where he worked. There was a McDonald’s that was closer, but Checkers, he says, was more affordable. “I made $30 a day from 8 in the morning to 8 at night,” Mr. Ross says. “I went to Checkers. ” Checkers does not typically pursue celebrity endorsements. But when Mr. Ross applied to purchase the Carol City franchise last summer, he seemed so genuine in his affection for the   chain that Checkers recognized a marketing opportunity as straightforward as a  . Still, it did not want a typical campaign. Scott Wakeman, director of marketing for Checkers   Restaurants Inc. and the company’s ad firm, Fitzgerald  Company in Atlanta, turned to the    digital media upstart Woven Digital. The firm has heavy traction among Mr. Ross’s primary audience  —   young men  —   on the entertainment sites that it owns, like Uproxx, Dime and BroBible. Woven has also specialized in   productions that, on the surface, do not feel like ads. To Mr. Wakeman, it seemed like a perfect way to take advantage of Mr. Ross’s charisma and authenticity. “It just felt like such a unique opportunity,” he said. The video, which is 3 minutes 31 seconds long, was filmed over two days in Carol City in late September, mostly as Mr. Ross drove his truck around. Spliced in is footage of pickup basketball games and bikers popping wheelies. The first mention of Checkers comes about halfway through the video. Checkers invests the bulk of its annual marketing budget, about $20 million, in standard television spots, Mr. Wakeman said. By contrast, the Rick Ross ad has been distributed only on social media channels and Uproxx. But Mr. Wakeman said he believed the unusual authenticity of the video  —   and the compelling way Mr. Ross related his story  —   would resonate with viewers more than anything Checkers had tried in the past. “We don’t think of it as an advertisement,” Mr. Wakeman said, adding of Mr. Ross, “We wanted to create a piece of content that captured his love for the brand. ” Last year, Woven teamed up with MillerCoors on a series of short documentary videos that profiled entrepreneurs with expertise in making items like watches and surfboards, or, in one case, doing calligraphy. The   series, sponsored by Coors Banquet beer and run across Uproxx, was intended to reach an audience that has become adept at avoiding traditional advertising. According to Brad Feinberg, senior director of media and digital marketing for MillerCoors, it was a success, receiving more than 33 million views. “This is content that people want to see they’re intrigued by it, they seek it out,” Mr. Feinberg said. “And putting it in long form is something you can do in the digital space that is very cost prohibitive in other places. ”   storytelling might sound incompatible with the   attention spans of millennials, but it can have its advantages. Young men in particular have demonstrated a willingness to sit through longer pieces of content if it aligns with their values and gives them something of value in return, said Leah Swartz, senior content specialist for FutureCast, a part of the Barkley agency of Kansas City, Mo. that focuses on research into millennials. Her team considers this a rewriting of the old ABCs of sales. Rather than the mantra “always be closing,” brands must now think about how they can “always be helping. ” “You have to think about helping your consumer, what you’re providing, what benefits you’re giving, how you’re making their lives more fulfilled,” Ms. Swartz said. For Checkers, turning a story about a hit rapper’s upbringing into a selling point for hamburgers and chicken wings was a bit of a gamble, Mr. Wakeman said. In the video, there are only a couple of references to Checkers’ products, such as Mr. Ross’s unequivocal praise of the French fries. But Mr. Wakeman said the documentary format allowed Mr. Ross’s true voice to shine through. “Food and value are our two big brand pillars, and I think they come through in the spot, in a cool way,” Mr. Wakeman said. “It wasn’t a script. It was just Rick talking about what he loves” about the place. The video also captures moments of spontaneity. The producers originally intended just to film Mr. Ross outside the Checkers, but on the way there, he sent out a message on Instagram offering free burgers to any fans who wanted to meet him in Carol City. About 200 people showed up, and the cameras rolled as he shook hands and ripped open bags of food. Benjamin Blank, the chief executive of Woven, said the company was not trying to conceal that the video was an advertisement. But he said he thought the content itself was meaningful and captivating enough that   viewers ultimately would not mind being sold to. “There were plenty of things Rick could have gotten involved with from a business standpoint,” Mr. Blank said. “But his reason for getting involved with Checkers was a great story. ”",0
611,Oil has been spilling into the Pacific Ocean since last month and its being totally ignored,"VIDEOS Oil has been spilling into the Pacific Ocean since last month and its being totally ignored This is in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest, which is seen as “one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth” By Chris ""Kikila"" Perrin - Friday, November 18, 2016 8:53 AM EST 
Bella Bella, British Columbia — When is environmental damage too much? When is it acceptable? In what is being called “ a relatively tiny ” marine oil spill, for the Heiltsuk First Nations of the Central Coast of BC, the question is being asked in quite real terms, forcing government to answer the questions that it might have preferred to have evaded. 
Since running aground in mid-October , a small boat has been leaking oil into the Pacific Ocean, and along BC’s Central Coast. Despite the fact that this spill comes in the aftermath of the Royal Visit to the region — a visit that sought to place the health of the coastline and all the life that dwells there within the global lens — there appears to be very little international interest. Making matters worse, there appears to be little interest from Canadian lawmakers on how best to reduce the potential for disasters like this. 
Along the Central Coast of British Columbia, the Great Bear Rainforest is seen as “one of the most pristine wilderness environments on earth.” Stretching approximately 400 kilometers along this sparsely populated area, the Great Bear Rainforest has long represented the very idea of conservation and intrinsic preservation to Canadians and environmentalists around the world. 
Along with the Kermode Bear , the area made National Geographic’s “ Places of a Lifetime ” list and has been called the planet’s last large expanse of coastal temperate rain forest by people like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Natural beauty, conservation projects , and provincial parks are not, however, all the region is known for. 
Of all things, the Central Coast offers access to the Pacific Ocean. It also provides a more-or-less direct line for fossil fuel exportation from various LNG (liquefied natural gas) sites around the province, as well as tar sands oil from the neighbouring province of Alberta. 
North of Bella Bella, the town of Kitimat serves as the proposed terminal destination of Enbridge’s Northern Gateway Pipeline , a project that has seen a great deal of protest that, in many ways, echoes the issues coming to a head in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. One of the most attractive aspects of the region, insofar as fossil fuel extraction is concerned, is the access it offers to Asian markets , pitting the desires of big oil corporations against those of First Nations and environmentalists , alike. 
Even with the legislative death of Northern Gateway, the region continues to be the focal point for resource extraction. October’s oil spill — which is ongoing — provides a visceral reminder of what is at stake in such discussions, pushing many local residents to demand a full tanker ban along the Central Coast . 
Yet, while the Coastal Rainforest is inundated with thousands of litres of oil, the federal government seems content to remain reactive . Rather than agreeing to the suggested ban, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instead proposed a $1.5 billion (CDN) fund to help deal with oil spills after they occur. 
Reactive policies like this leave the fragile ecosystems found in the Central Coast region to suffer contamination before they are dealt with, and offer no change for the way issues of sovereignty are evaluated between First Nations and the colonial Canadian government. 
Since his election in 2015, PM Trudeau has taken several quick steps back from his promises to respect First Nations’ sovereignty and deal with environmental issues . Although this “ relatively tiny marine oil spill” can be seen as just that, a minor environmental issue that will be cleaned up with more federal money, there is a deeper implication that can be seen — one that pits ongoing environmental degradation and cultural assimilation and genocide against neoliberal economic policy .",0
612,Podesta To Mills: “We Are Going To Have To Dump All Those Emails”,"
In today’s, 25th, Wikileaks release of hacked Podesta emails, one of the notable highlights is a March 2, 2015 exchange between John Podesta and Clinton aide Cheryl Mills in which the Clinton Campaign Chair says “On another matter….and not to sound like Lanny, but we are going to have to dump all those emails.” 
The email, which may indicate intent , was sent just days before the NYT story revealing the existence of Hillary’s email server, and Hillary’s press conference addressing what was at the time, the stunning revelation that she had a personal email account, and server, in her home.
Mills’ response: “Think you just got your new nick name.”
It is unclear which Lanny is referred to: the infamous former DOJ staffer Lanny Breuer who quit in January 2013 after telling Frontline that some banks are too big to fail, or, more likely Lanny Davis , special counsel to President Bill Clinton, and spokesperson for the President and the White House on matters concerning campaign-finance investigations and other legal issues.
It is also unclear for now which emails Podesta is referring to in the thread, but Podesta adds: “better to do so sooner than later.” We can hope that a subsequent response, yet to be leaked by Wikileaks, will provide more color.
If the exchange is shown to disclose intent to mislead, it will negate the entire narrative prepared by Clinton that she merely deleted “personal” emails and will reveal a strategic plan to hinder the State Department and FBI “investigation.”
This is the first time that particular exchange has emerged among the Podesta emails.

And in a separate email sent out just days later by Clinton campaign communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, we get yet another confirmation that the president actively mislead the public when he said he didn’t know Hillary was using a private email address:
Suggest Philippe talk to Josh or Eric. They know POTUS and HRC emailed . Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet’s email addresses.
Perhaps while the DOJ/FBI is taking a second look into Huma Abedin’s emails, it can also take a repeat look at some of these, especially the ones involving POTUS. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

Hillary Clinton’s sad last push for votes was supposed to culminate in a gathering of “talent” the left was calling “The Avengers of campaigning.” Hillary, Slick Willy, Barry Soetoro and Moochelle along with Creepy Uncle Joe Biden were to all come together at a huge show featuring hasbeens Bon Jovi and working class sellout Bruce Springsteen. 
From one libtard to the next, promises of work-free lives filled with food stamp steak and lobster flew amid delusional dreams of free college education for everyone and a health care system that will cure what ails you for eleven bucks a month, no questions asked. The $15 minimum wage and 90 percent tax on the people who have done well in America were celebrated with great vigor, until it came time for the woman of the hour herself to take the stage. 
Bruce Springsteen, acting as master of ceremonies, shouted over the roar of the feminist-laden crowd, “Here she is, and I’m with her!” Unfortunately, she never appeared in the spotlight. 
Springsteen, after holding a finger to his earpiece, picked up his acoustic guitar and started slowly picking away a familiar tune. He turned to the audience and said: 
“You know, before the next President of the United States comes out here I want to make sure we’re all ready. Are you ready?” The crowd cheered. “If there’s one thing we’ve always known about this amazing woman, one thing that w2as never in question, it’s that she was born to run.” 
As the crowd went nuts for the popular song, interns and medical staff were reportedly attending to Clinton backstage after she collapsed from an unknown ailment. The press was quickly corralled and swept aside, but a couple of rogue stagehands tweeted about the incident before they were discovered and their posts deleted. This screenshot was grabbed within a minute of it being tweeted: 
Clinton is said to have looked pale and distant, unaware of her surroundings. As of the writing of this article, Springsteen was still playing his set. Join The Resistance And Share This Article Now! 234 ",0

Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary’s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR’S HANDS! 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

617,"Hillary Clinton Liked Covert Action if It Stayed Covert, Transcript Shows - The New York Times","Hillary Clinton longs for the days when Americans knew how to execute a covert action abroad and not spill the details to reporters. Addressing a Goldman Sachs event in 2013, in one of the speeches that WikiLeaks published on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton gave a   realpolitik answer to the question of how to handle a problem like Syria. If the best chance of success was to act secretly inside that country, she made clear, she had no problem doing that. She went on to say  —   as her audience already knew because of revelations in the news media  —   that as secretary of state she had advocated secretly arming the Syrian opposition and moving forcefully to counter the Russians, who at that point were supporting President Bashar   but had not yet fully entered the conflict. “My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she said in answer to a question from Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which paid Mrs. Clinton about $225, 000 a speech to give what felt like an insider’s view of the making of American foreign policy, months after she left office. But she quickly acknowledged that “we used to be much better at this than we are now. ” “Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves,” she added, and officials go out to “tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: ‘Look what we’re doing, and I want credit for it. ’” The three hacked speeches from 2013 that WikiLeaks published, most likely with Russian government assistance, help explain how Mrs. Clinton approaches some of the world’s knottiest problems. They are a reminder of the   way she often assesses her most vexing opponents when the television cameras are not on. By the time she left office that year, she had met and assessed two of the three world leaders who were determined most prominently to challenge the United States: President Xi Jinping of China, whom she clearly admires President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whom she clearly detests (and who has returned the sentiment this election) and Kim   of North Korea, whose determination to build a nuclear weapon and missiles that could “reach Hawaii and the West Coast, theoretically” poses a risk “we cannot abide,” she said. At moments in the speeches, Mrs. Clinton was cleareyed about how difficult it would be to execute some of the actions she advocated, including a   zone over parts of Syria. “To have a   zone, you have to take out all of the air defense, many of which are located in populated areas,” she said. “So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so we’re not putting our pilots at risk  —   you’re going to kill a lot of Syrians. So all of a sudden this intervention that people talk about so glibly becomes an American and NATO involvement where you take a lot of civilians. ” Her assessment of the risk came before she was formally running for president. But two years later, in a television interview in October 2015, she sounded willing to take that risk. “I personally would be advocating now for a   zone and humanitarian corridors to stop the carnage on the ground and from the air, to try to provide some way to take stock of what’s happening, to try to stem the flow of refugees,” she said. Her successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, tried last month to open those humanitarian corridors, but the effort collapsed in a dispute with Russia. A push to get it restarted during a meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday between Mr. Kerry and his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, also failed. In the talks at Goldman Sachs, Mrs. Clinton was often more analytic than prescriptive, describing her perceptions of individual leaders and the domestic politics and foreign threats they face. In that regard, her approach is quite different from that of Donald J. Trump. In two interviews on foreign policy with The New York Times, one in March and another in July, Mr. Trump moved directly to his plans of action: bombing the Islamic State and taking oil, for example, or withdrawing troops from Europe and Asia if allies do not pay their share. While Mr. Trump often talks in terms of striking deals, Mrs. Clinton talks in the more traditional terms of  . When she became secretary in 2009, she posed a question about China to an Australian leader: “How do you deal toughly with your banker?” In the Goldman transcript, she suggested that she had answered her own question when sparring with the Chinese over its claims in the South China Sea. “I made the point at one point in the argument that, you know, you can call it whatever you want to call it,” she said. “You don’t have a claim to all of it. I said, by that argument, you know, the United States should claim all of the Pacific. We liberated it, we defended it. We have as much claim to all of the Pacific. And we could call it the American Sea, and it could go from the West Coast of California all the way to the Philippines. ” “And, you know, my counterpart sat up very straight and goes, ‘Well, you can’t do that. ’” Mrs. Clinton segued into an evaluation of Mr. Xi, the Chinese leader, who she noted had consolidated power in a way his predecessor never did, but had quickly traveled to places like Russia and Africa to assuage “doubts about Chinese practices. ” “So he’s someone who you at least have the impression is a more worldly, somewhat more experienced politician,” she said. Mr. Xi has since become more aggressive in the South China Sea, and it is unclear how forcefully Mrs. Clinton, if she became president, would confront him over his claims. She acknowledged at one point that the administration had gotten distracted from its “pivot” to Asia. In North Korea, the situation has worsened much more drastically. She summarized the Chinese message to the North Koreans this way: “We don’t care if you occasionally shoot off a missile. That’s good. That upsets the Americans and causes them heartburn, but you can’t keep going down a path that is unpredictable. ” That, of course, is exactly the path they have gone down.",0

619,US: Kurdish Troops Will Be Involved in Invading ISIS Capital of Raqqa,"Turkish Objections Won't Stop YPG's Involvement by Jason Ditz, October 26, 2016 Share This 
US Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the leader of the US military forces in Iraq and Syria , today announced that Kurdish YPG forces will participate in the invasion of the ISIS capital city of Raqqa, despite Turkish government demands that the Kurds not be allowed to take part. 
Townsend was a bit vague on the details of Kurdish involvement, saying the US are “going to take this in steps,” and that Turkey has to realize the only way that the US is going to have enough force to take over Raqqa any time soon is with a significant portion of the YPG involved. 
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that his government wants only “local forces” involved in the Raqqa battle, and that the YPG, who Turkey considers a terrorist organization, must not be allowed to take part in any way. 
Turkey’s military has been attacking the YPG in several locations around Syria over the past week, including heavy airstrikes which killed an estimated 200 YPG fighters who were engaged in an offensive against ISIS around Afrin. The Turkish government has repeatedly complained the YPG is gaining too much territory in Syria, and that they must abandon much of it. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",0
620,Awakened Humanity Awaits Fully Scripted Ending As Controversial Election Day Nears,"in: Consciousness , Government Corruption , Society , Special Interests , US News No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We’ve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their “democracy” tactics using “special forces”, NGO’s, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson’s disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We’ve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer show-like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I’m understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? And to answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. That’s right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media “stories” and narratives unless we could “prove” that the account didn’t happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a “conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged “ political terrorism “, a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this “terrorism” or planned “event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many “events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today’s events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free spirited consciousness desiring to simply be free, will allow you to see what’s coming this November 8th 2016. What’s coming is a long awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a birds-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they too are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they’ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I’ll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution of plan will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs) 2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let’s not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the state) get away with what they have done. 3- Don’t rely ONLY on the internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos don’t assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don’t discount that some “news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the anti when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult) because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn’t ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of it’s kind to save the rest of the species and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. There is nothing to fear for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. And so today I’m thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no “political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. Finally, I’m reminded of the very last line of the film ‘ The American Dream ‘ when the villain asks “what do you think this is?” and the answer “this is AMERICA!!”. Likewise, let’s remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term not about one isolated moment or day. Submit your review",0
621,George Soros-Backed Climate March Brings Celebs to National Mall on Sweltering Saturday - Breitbart,"Protesters at last Saturday’s March for Science faced a continual downpour of rain when they gathered on the National Mall to protest President Donald Trump and his policies. This Saturday’s People’s Climate March may take place in record temperatures, as forecasters say the mercury could reach the   degree mark. [Actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Virgin Airlines founder Richard Branson, and former vice president Al Gore are expected to attend, according to the Washington Post.  Tomorrow, we’re marching for a better world. March with us and #BeInconvenient https:  .  #ClimateMarch pic. twitter.   —   Al Gore (@algore) April 28, 2017,  The people backing the march range from the Communist Party USA, the Sierra Club, CODEPINK, and the Barack   Organizing for Action. But the man funding many of the organizations listed on the march’s website as members of the steering committee have received millions of dollars from George Soros, the   billionaire who has deep roots in the U. S. environmental movement and other liberal causes. “The ‘People’s Climate March,’ scheduled for the 100th day of Donald Trump’s presidency, claims to be a movement of the people. But is it really?” Newsbusters reported on Friday. “It turns out   of the steering committee organizations have one thing in common  —   donations from George Soros,” Newsbusters reported. “The liberal billionaire gave them more than $36 million combined. ” “Between 2000 and 2014, Soros gave $36, 018, 461 million to 18 of the 55 steering committee members of the People’s Climate March,” Newsbusters reported. “Donations to six of those groups were more $1 million each: Center for Community Change, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) People’s Action, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists. ” Newsbusters noted that only three of these six organizations  —   NRDC, Public Citizen and Union of Concerned Scientists  —   have climate as all or part of their mission, calling into question why so many   focused groups are taking part in the march. “The presence of many   related organizations leading the march indicated that this climate march (just like the March for Science and the Women’s March) is not about a single issue, but about attacking the new administration,” Newsbusters reported. The People’s Climate Change website states: Everything we have struggled to move forward in the United States is in peril. Our loved ones feel under siege, and those in power in Washington are advancing a dark and dangerous vision of America that we know is untrue. To change everything, we need everyone. On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, we will be in the streets of Washington D. C. to show the world and our leaders that we will resist attacks on our people, our communities and our planet. We will come together from across the United States to strengthen our movement. We will demonstrate our power and resistance at the gates of the White House. We will bring our solutions to the climate crisis, the problems that affect our communities and the threats to peace to our leaders in Congress to demand action. Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports, “Environmentalists will once again rally in the nation’s capital this weekend, this time for the People’s Climate March,” noting that the march “will be more political and aimed at specific Trump administration policies. ” The Post said it’s “unclear” just how many people will show up, but “organizers are prepared to accommodate 50, 000 to 100, 000 people. ”",0
622,"Edward Snowden’s Long, Strange Journey to Hollywood - The New York Times","The summer light was fading to gold near Red Square as Oliver Stone maneuvered through the lobby bar of a   Moscow hotel last year. He walked past the marble staircase and the grand piano to a table in the back. A group of businessmen in suits lingered nearby. Stone grimaced. “I think we should move,” he said. His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner. “How’s this?” Borman asked. Stone didn’t answer. He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving. A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons. Such security precautions had become routine. Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American   blower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director  —   who became a Buddhist while making “Heaven  Earth” and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for “The Doors”  —   had gone all method again. On “Snowden,” he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once. The director hadn’t been sleeping well. Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie’s grand finale. He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies. “Last January, Moritz calls me,” Stone said. “He says: ‘You got a call from this fella who represents Mr. Snowden. You’re invited to Moscow. ’’u2009” The call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden’s Russian lawyer. In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister. In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V. Putin, and soon after Snowden landed in Moscow, Kucherena showed up at Sheremetyevo Airport and offered his services. Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client. Titled “Time of the Octopus,” it follows a National Security Agency leaker named Joshua Cold who is marooned in the airport and the Russian advocate who liberates him. In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie. “And I know you from working on, what, three films?” Stone said at the bar. “Five,” Borman said. At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a   out during the making of “Savages,” a beachy Blake Lively thriller. “We’ve had our fights,” Stone said. “You know, he’s German I’m American. ” He didn’t elaborate. “He calls, and I go: ‘Oh, [expletive]. Not again,’’u2009” Stone continued. It wasn’t just about Borman. Stone wanted nothing to do with another political docudrama. He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. off the ground, only to see “Selma” get made to critical acclaim. Then there was the My Lai massacre film. Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand. As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated. “You get these scars, and they don’t go away,” Stone said. So Stone was skeptical. But this was Snowden, who   handedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens. Plus, the director needed a hit. After early successes like “Platoon” and “Wall Street,” his more recent films didn’t receive the attention he hoped. The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith. If it panned out, it could be Stone’s millennial   up to “Born on the Fourth of July,” the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990. But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real. Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two   tickets to Moscow. Both arrived the next day. In case they still had doubts, Kucherena’s office gave Borman a number to call. On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of “The Life of David Gale,” a film Borman produced. They were issued visas that same week. (Kucherena denies buying   tickets for Stone and Borman or helping expedite their visas.) “When that happened,” Borman said, “I thought, O. K. I guess Kucherena can pull the strings. ” As   narratives go, Snowden’s is a compelling one. His transformation from a shy and pale   something  —   full of the sort of idealism those years can afford  —   to political dissident made him a hero figure to   establishment liberals who are in the business of storytelling. Raised in a family of federal employees, Snowden grew up near Fort Meade, Md. He enlisted in the Army, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and became a technology specialist for the N. S. A. By the summer of 2013, he had downloaded thousands of documents, taken off for Hong Kong and asked the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to meet him there. The initial revelations were sensational. Not only had the N. S. A. been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans, but it also had been tapping into the networks of Google, Yahoo and other companies to do so. The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras. Depending on your feelings about national security, the N. S. A. ’s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional. The Apple   founder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero. Secretary of State John Kerry called him a traitor. Donald Trump called for his execution. As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened. Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson.   liberties lawyers wanted to represent him. Activist journalists wanted access to him. Publishers rushed out books, including “The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man,” by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and “The Snowden Operation: Inside the West’s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,” by Edward Lucas of The Economist. Despite promising an “inside” look, neither writer had ever met Snowden. Those with intimate knowledge documented the experience, too. In 2014, Greenwald published “No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N. S. A. and the U. S. Surveillance State,” a dramatic retelling of how Greenwald broke the story. That fall, Poitras released “Citizenfour,” a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop. (It won the 2015 Oscar for best documentary.) Snowden, meanwhile, ended up in Russia. He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow. For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window  —   or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present. But politically speaking, he could be useful. After enduring the United States’ endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed   American hypocrisy. Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden’s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia’s asylum laws. An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F. S. B. ). Snowden’s case presented a new opportunity. It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden’s stay and three months to write “Time of the Octopus. ” Stone’s first meeting with Kucherena was a disaster. (“I thought he was a gruff bear,” Stone told me.) The director wanted to meet Snowden, but Kucherena said Snowden wouldn’t meet them until they agreed to option “Time of the Octopus. ” (Kucherena denies this.) According to Stone and Borman, by the end of a long weekend, they reached a gentlemen’s agreement: Stone would option the novel  —   if Kucherena could provide regular access to his client. I first spoke to Stone in June 2015, after reading that he was in the midst of shooting a film based on Kucherena’s novel. He said he would be traveling to Moscow again that week to shoot Snowden and agreed to let me tag along. A day later, a peeved Borman called me. “You’ve been disinvited,” he said coolly. During those 24 hours, this magazine had contacted Ben Wizner, Snowden’s lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, to arrange an interview with his client. Kucherena may be Snowden’s Russian representative, but in the United States, Wizner runs the show. Wizner was furious. Not just because Stone had invited a reporter to Moscow, but because of how it all looked: that Snowden was involved in a Hollywood movie and that the whole production was seemingly brokered by a lawyer with ties to the Kremlin. Borman would later tell me that we had waded into the sticky territory of Snowden’s multiple emissaries. “There are two ways to access him: One is Kucherena and one is Wizner, and it’s completely political,” Borman said. “It’s a political situation that goes way above your head. ” When Wizner and I finally got on the phone, he was in   control mode. He told me that Snowden wasn’t profiting from Stone’s film in any way. “One    rule Ed always had was, I’m not selling my life rights,” Wizner said. Snowden’s participation in a Hollywood movie would only fuel the claims of his critics  —   that he was a narcissist eager to cash in. That said, Stone’s film would be seen by millions of people, which meant it could sway public opinion. “We were choosing between two bad options,” Wizner said. “He could have stubbornly stayed completely at arm’s length and had no input whatsoever. Or he could have some input and compromised the arm’  relationship. And I didn’t know how to advise him on that. ” According to Wizner, Snowden met with Stone only to make sure that the film told an accurate story. “It’s been us walking this tightrope between clearly not having any formal connection to the project  —   not deriving any benefit from it  —   and also not wanting to just be completely helpless and, you know, see what Oliver Stone comes up with,” Wizner said. Despite some initial discomfort, he was tentatively optimistic. “Maybe it’ll be good,” Wizner added. “You know, Oliver Stone wrote ‘Scarface. ’’u2009” Still, Stone was heading to Moscow to film Snowden for an appearance in the movie, which could be seen as an endorsement.   checking is one thing, I said a cameo is another. “It is, and I’m not entirely comfortable with it,” Wizner said. Wizner had negotiated veto control over any footage featuring Snowden in the film. After we spoke, the lawyer says he asked Borman to put that in writing. He also reiterated that if Stone took a reporter along, Snowden would not participate. Stone and I eventually reached a compromise: I wouldn’t observe the shoot, but I could still come and meet Kucherena. A few days later, I met Stone in Moscow. The director, who is 69, has a   leaning gait and unruly eyebrows, so that he looks a bit like a bull that is always about to charge. He emerged from the hotel’s elevator with a pained look on his face. It was drizzling, and Stone’s hair, which is the color of dark shoe polish, was pointing laterally. “I have some bad news,” he said. “I cannot deliver Anatoly. ” He had just seen Snowden, who had been in touch with Wizner and was very upset, Stone said. “Ed said he doesn’t want Anatoly talking to you, and he said that very clearly,” Stone added. I would spend the next few days camped out at the hotel. When Stone wasn’t shooting, we would meet in the lobby bar as he continued to tell me about the making of his film. Soon after optioning Kucherena’s novel, Stone had returned to Moscow with his   writer, Kieran Fitzgerald, a recent University of Texas M. F. A. graduate. Anticipating a homesick Snowden, Fitzgerald hauled over a duffel bag packed with the stuff of Americana dreams: Kraft macaroni and cheese,    cups, Oreos, Pepperidge Farm cookies, Twizzlers, peanut butter, Spam, an Orioles baseball cap and a pair of Converse sneakers. “It was like delivering a care package to a kid at summer camp,” Fitzgerald told me. He also slipped in a copy of “The Odyssey” translated by his grandfather, Robert Fitzgerald. “I thought it was appropriate, since Ed was on his own kind of odyssey trying to get home. ” Snowden and Stone had gotten off to a slow start. Snowden was squeamish about a movie being made about his life. Stone, in turn, said the film would be made with or without him. Fitzgerald says he played referee. “Oliver can be a bit of battering ram,” Fitzgerald said. “He’s accustomed to hard men who need to be cracked, but that’s not Edward Snowden. He’s not an   male type. He’s a very sensitive mind. So I was there to say: ‘Everything is going to be O. K. He’s a good guy. It’s going to be a good movie. ’’u2009” Eventually, Snowden began to open up, answering questions about his childhood his girlfriend, Lindsay Mills and what he could about his work for the N. S. A. While Fitzgerald returned to Austin to work on the script, Stone set out to plant his flag in the Snowden story. In Hollywood, book options are the equivalent of calling dibs, and Stone had competition. In May 2014, Sony Pictures optioned Greenwald’s “No Place to Hide. ” By June, Stone had announced that he acquired Kucherena’s book and Harding’s “The Snowden Files. ” The tactic worked. Sony got nervous. “Now what?” Amy Pascal, then Sony’s   chairwoman, wrote to another executive. (The email would be leaked during the Sony hack.) Pascal’s colleague reminded her of the case of the dual Steve Jobs biopics  —   “Jobs,” with Ashton Kutcher, might have come out first, but it was “Steve Jobs,” starring Michael Fassbender, that was the better film. Pascal wasn’t convinced. “Oliver Stone is not Ashton Kutcher,” she responded. She wrote to George Clooney to pique his interest in adapting Greenwald’s book, but Clooney passed. “Stone will do a hatchet job on the movie, but it will still be the film of Snowden,” he replied. For Stone, the impending Sony project was a call to arms. Fitzgerald cranked out a first draft of the script, and that fall Stone went out to studios with a budget of $50 million and a release date in December 2015. Each one turned it down, and Stone became convinced that the studios wanted to quash the project because of its controversial subject matter. “This is why corporations owning movie studios is not a good idea,” he said. While Borman hustled to find independent financing, Stone dove into casting. For the lead, he chose Joseph   Levitt, the son of liberals from Sherman Oaks, Calif. and a former child actor who has retained a pleasingly boyish look. “There’s an interesting blandness to him in the same way that Jimmy Stewart might’ve been considered bland,” Stone said. “There’s a neutrality there, which allows him to grow on you. ” Shailene Woodley was cast to play Lindsay Mills, Zachary Quinto as Greenwald and Melissa Leo as Poitras. By early 2015, Borman and Stone had racked up several hundred thousand dollars in debt, but the money was still short. The shoot was ultimately delayed three weeks as the producer cobbled together European partners. In the United States, “Snowden” was picked up by Open Road Films, a small production company that had just put out “Jobs”  —   the Kutcher version. “It was painful that we ended up with this independent distributor,” Stone said. Borman offered that Open Road was not so independent anymore. “I’d never heard of it,” Stone said, adding: “I’ve been there before, but not on this level and not at this age. So for me, it was very difficult personally. ” The cover of “Time of the Octopus” features a   image of Snowden’s face and a globe peeled like an orange to reveal the logo of the C. I. A. In his author photo, Kucherena indeed looks bearish, with a round face, matted white hair and a cellphone pressed to his right ear  —   as if he were midnegotiation. “The whole truth about the American agent on the run,” the cover boasts. Also: “Oliver Stone is currently shooting a film based on this book. ” I had gotten my copy from Stone, who handed it to me with a disclaimer. “Now, it’s easy to take a shot at this,” he said. “You know, it wasn’t the basis of the movie. But it’s fun. I enjoyed reading it. ” “Time of the Octopus” takes place in a single night. The protagonist, Joshua Cold, is sequestered in a bunker at Sheremetyevo Airport, where his Russian lawyer keeps him company. The chapters alternate between their   stamped conversations and those labeled as digital files (“File 004. wav”) suggesting that they are the lawyer’s transcribed recordings. The basic facts of Cold’s case sound familiar, as do the character names: There are journalists named Boitras and Greywold and an organization called Mikileaks run by an Augusto Cassangie. For the most part, Cold and the lawyer sit and talk about life, quoting Laozi to each other. But there is also a distinctly   Soviet tone to the novel, which reads both like a love letter to American culture  —   Steven Spielberg, B. B. King, “The Terminator,” Penthouse magazine, Popeye, “The  ” Paul Newman, Bon Jovi, “  Man,” “Braveheart,” Quentin Tarantino and Tupac Shakur are all mentioned  —   and a gleeful taunt to its government. “Not only did [Cold] snap the beak of the American eagle,” Kucherena writes, “but he also gave him a good kick and a very humiliating one, as if it was not a menacing predator but a rural hen. ” In the bunker, Cold enjoys pizza and whiskey, but he is worried about American agents coming to retrieve him. “Believe me, Russia is not the worst option for you,” the lawyer tells Cold. “And you needn’t regard us with such mistrust. ” Once Cold is granted asylum, the propaganda is dialed up. “I shall work in Russia and get an apartment!” Cold announces. “I thought I would spend the rest of my life in this underground prison. ” “As far as I know Mr. Putin, he is not one to change his mind easily,” the lawyer assures him. “All will be O. K. ” The novel concludes with Cold vowing to learn to drink like the Russians, but the lawyer suggests he try Kvass instead, a fermented beverage made from rye bread. (“It is the Russian   Cola,” the lawyer says.) Then they leave the bunker. “Weird, huh?” Fitzgerald said when I asked about the novel. In fact, few people associated with either Snowden or “Snowden” wanted to discuss it. “I don’t want to say anything on the record about that book,”   Levitt told me. According to WikiLeaks, Stone paid a million dollars for “Time of the Octopus,” which seemed like a hefty amount to pay for material that Stone admitted he had no plans of using. (That’s the same figure Sony reportedly paid for the rights to “Eat, Pray, Love. ”) “We bought it because we did get good access to Ed,” Stone explained. “He had to be brought along. ” During Stone’s visits, Kucherena hosted the director at his favorite restaurants and at his dacha outside Moscow. “They had a kind of bromance,” Fitzgerald told me. Photos from the trips look like vacation postcards, with Stone and Fitzgerald grinning in Red Army caps (a gift from Kucherena) and Fitzgerald and   Levitt posing for a selfie in front of St. Basil’s Cathedral. While out in public, the group referred to Snowden as “Sasha,” a nickname Kucherena had given him. Kucherena and I would eventually speak by phone. He said he wrote the novel because he had received calls from many “representatives of Hollywood,” writers and filmmakers. “At some point, I just thought to myself, Why don’t I try to write the book?” he said. I asked which writers and directors had called him. “Very many people called me,” he replied. “But I honestly don’t remember their names now. ” The lawyer was deeply troubled by the news media’s insinuations that he is connected to the Kremlin. He pointed to several clients he has defended against the F. S. B. including Platon Obukhov, a writer accused of spying for Britain. “I never had any kind of agreement with the Kremlin,” he said. “They tried to say I’m tied to the F. S. B. but that’s complete nonsense, excuse me. ” Kucherena said he was inspired by his favorite authors, who include Tom Clancy, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell. “The Octopus in my novel is, you can say, a direct offspring of Big Brother,” he said. Like most writers of fiction, he was reluctant to discuss which parts of his book were based in reality. “A person can only be open with someone he trusts,” Kucherena said. “And here, because he had no one else, it turned out that I took on the role of mother and father. Accordingly, we had confidential conversations of various sorts. ” He did not see a conflict of interest in his writing the novel. “I wrote an artistic book,” Kucherena said. Because he represents Snowden pro bono, he never expected to capitalize on the relationship. “I don’t take any money from him,” Kucherena said. “He doesn’t have any. So I wrote a book, yes, fine. So I got a little, as we say in Russian. ” Despite being the one to put the “Snowden” project into motion, Kucherena shied away from assuming any credit. “I’m very far from all that,” he said. “I’m just an advocate. Look at where I am and where Hollywood is!” When I told Wizner that Stone said he bought Kucherena’s book to gain access to Snowden, his voice climbed a few octaves again. “Virtually every single other person who’s met with Snowden, and there have been dozens of them, have just gone through me, and we’ve hooked it up,” Wizner said. He listed some names, which included the film director Doug Liman, as well as the actors Jared Leto and John Cusack. (Cusack took Snowden Cool Ranch Doritos, as well as DVDs of “Network” and “Dr. Strangelove. ”) Wizner, who is 45, has been at the A. C. L. U. since 2001. Before Snowden, he tried to bring several suits to increase oversight over the intelligence community. Wizner likes to say that he spent a decade banging his head against a wall, and then Snowden came along and brought that wall down. Snowden had not only revealed the scope of the surveillance apparatus, but also that top government officials routinely misled the public about it. Since becoming Snowden’s advocate, Wizner has become a figure of not insignificant geopolitical importance. Those revelations have since formed a critical backdrop for legislative reforms, and there are few things that irritate Wizner more than claims that threaten to tarnish Snowden’s character and their common cause. It would not be a stretch to say that for Wizner, Kucherena has become a bit of a liability. Since 2013, the Russian lawyer has announced that Snowden landed a job at a major Russian website  —   news that turned out to not be true  —   and has supplied the news media with photos of his client enjoying his new life in Russia, attending an opera at the Bolshoi Theater and cheerfully hugging a dog named Rick. (Rick later turned out to be the dog of one of Kucherena’s friends.) Now Kucherena had sold a novel to Stone, making it seem as if the director had to pay a Russian fixer to have access to Snowden  —   or worse, that Snowden was somehow under the lock and key of the Russian authorities, lent to Stone for a Hollywood movie. Wizner’s counterefforts in the United States have been successful. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, once a fierce critic, has acknowledged that Snowden performed “a public service. ” President Obama has called for the reform of phone metadata collection, and last June, Congress passed the U. S. A. Freedom Act, a law that directly resulted from Snowden’s leaks. Snowden has come to be seen as a levelheaded activist. According to Wizner, he leads a free existence in Russia, making appearances via live video and publishing   against Russia’s human rights violations. “I think people are inclined to believe that Russia would never let him stay there unless he was paying for it in some way,” Wizner said. “But it’s just not true. Not only is he not cooperating, but he’s actually being critical. ” When I asked Wizner about Kucherena’s book, we were meeting at a cafe near his office in Lower Manhattan. “Maybe you should just characterize my facial expression  —   ‘He smirked,’’u2009” Wizner said. (Except that his smirk was mixed with a frown.) According to him, Snowden has not read Kucherena’s book. “The thing is, Ed has much bigger fish to fry,” he said. “If you had people calling for your assassination, you’d be annoyed. If you were facing life in solitary confinement, you’d be concerned. If someone wrote some book in Russia that no one is going to read, it doesn’t register. ” Wizner was reluctant to discuss Kucherena’s role in Snowden’s life, but he conceded that it was somewhat unorthodox. “It seems like the ethical rules governing the   client relationship may be somewhat different in Russia,” he said. “It would be very unusual for a lawyer in a   profile case to provide exclusive photos of his client to newspapers or write an unauthorized book and sell it to Hollywood. ” Kucherena and Wizner have never met. Whatever uneasiness there may be, Kucherena spoke warmly about his American counterpart. “We are on the same team!” he told me. “Ben works in America, I work in Russia. If he wanted to write a book, I would have no problem. ” Wizner told me he has no plans to write a book about Snowden, fictional or otherwise. “Mission accomplished,” Stone announced. We had met in the lobby bar again, the day after he filmed Snowden, and the director was in better spirits. The shoot took place at Kucherena’s dacha. The day went long. Stone’s idea was to interview Snowden and capture an affecting moment that would give the film its dramatic ending. But the first takes were stiff. “Ed is used to answering questions on a level of intelligence,” Stone said. “But I was interested in the emotional, which is difficult for him. ” Stone ended up doing nine takes. At one point, they took a break and went for a walk around Kucherena’s property. By the end of the day, Stone decided that he had gotten Snowden to go as far as he was going to. “He was cooperative,” Stone said. “He wanted to make it work. But as an actor  —   he’s not used to that. I mean, he’s not an actor. And I don’t think he became one that day. ” To make Snowden more comfortable, Stone worked with a minimal crew. Some were meeting the   blower for the first time and still seemed a bit  . “Suddenly this little creature comes teetering in  —   so fragile, so lovely, such a charming,   behaved, beautiful little man,” the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, told me. “He’s like an old soul in a very young body. He’s got fingers like violins. ” Filming Snowden reminded Mantle of shooting other men with outsize reputations and slight builds. “It’s like Bono or Al Pacino,” he added. “Those guys are   weenies. But if you isolate him into a frame, he can be as big as anybody else. ” Mantle shot Danny Boyle’s “Slumdog Millionaire” and “127 Hours,” but “Snowden” proved to be a special challenge. Convinced that making the film on American soil would be too risky, Stone decided to film in Germany, where Borman was able to score some tax subsidies. With roughly 140 script pages to shoot in 54 days, the crew sprinted from Munich to Washington, to Hawaii, to Hong Kong, and then back to Munich. Often, Mantle wouldn’t get to see locations before he had to film in them. To cut costs, the suburbs of Munich had to stand in for rural Maryland and Virginia, with German extras cast as Americans. “Thank God the Germans act like Americans,” Stone said. The production itself resembled a covert operation, with a code name (“Sasha” had stuck) and elaborate security protocols. Worried that “Sasha” would be of interest to the N. S. A. Borman and Stone avoided discussing production details by phone or email  —   “It was all handwritten notes and long walks in the park,” Borman said  —   and kept the script on   gapped computers, ones that have never been connected to the internet. If it had to be mailed, Borman would mix up the pages into four packages, which he would send with four different couriers to four different addresses. “Maybe nobody gave a [expletive],” Borman told me. “Or maybe the N. S. A. is laughing at us like, ‘Look at those idiots  —   of course we copied everything that came through DHL and FedEx!” For the actors, the frenetic schedule and paranoia on set added to the mood of the production. “Snowden himself was in the midst of a stressful situation, so the fact that our shoot was a little bit that way, I think, helped,”   Levitt said, before catching himself. “Making the movie was obviously a walk in the park compared to what he did. But just to have those little emotional touch points can help when you’re acting. ” Committed to inhabiting Snowden’s robotic speech pattern,   Levitt lifted the audio from “Citizenfour” and played it on repeat while he slept. He also worried that some of the dialogue felt   handed. “Oliver is very into making his point,” the actor said, “as he should be. I really admire him for that. But I felt like it was my job to be like, ‘O. K. I want to make the point, too, but this is a human being and not just a mouthpiece. ” Stone found   Levitt’s approach too “  ish” at times. “I was trying for the dramatic side as much as possible,” Stone said. Fitzgerald was ultimately flown in to the set to execute   minute rewrites. By late spring of 2015, Stone was close to wrapping when his mother, Jacqueline Goddet Stone, died at 93. She had called him in Munich, but Stone felt he couldn’t risk leaving. “To go to L. A. would have cost us three down days,” Stone told me. “I knew she was going to pass, but I thought I could make it. ” Stone remained on set during the funeral and kept shooting. Stone’s trip to Moscow to film the real Snowden was the last bit he needed to complete the film. But he was still worried  —   that the footage would be leaked, that critics would eviscerate it, that Snowden wouldn’t like it. “I want him to vet it,” he said. He was heading to New York to begin editing and planned to return to Moscow at the end of the summer to show Snowden a rough cut. “O. K. my dear,” Stone said, getting up to leave. “See you in New York. ” Then he disappeared for six months. Before Stone set out to make his film, he had met Snowden’s chief biographers, Greenwald and Poitras. Stone and Greenwald became friendly, and when Greenwald’s book drew interest in Hollywood before it was published, the journalist turned to Stone for advice. “In the back of my mind, I thought if he had any interest in making a film, that would be a good segue for him to say so,” Greenwald told me. At the time, Stone wasn’t interested, and Greenwald negotiated the deal with Sony. Stone later came back and offered to match Sony’s bid, but Greenwald declined. “I think he was a little perturbed,” Greenwald said. Of the principal cast, Zachary Quinto, who plays Greenwald in Stone’s movie, was the only actor who didn’t meet his   counterpart as research. “I always thought that was a little weird,” Greenwald said. “I think Oliver thought I had some competitive hostility toward his project, or he had some hostility  —   I’m not really sure. ” (According to Stone, Quinto didn’t need to meet Greenwald because there were so many videos of the journalist online.) In the spring of 2014, Stone flew to Berlin and met with Poitras. The meeting did not go well. According to Poitras, Stone proposed that she delay the release of “Citizenfour,” which she was then in the middle of editing, to time up with his film. “Because his film would be the real movie  —   because it’s a Hollywood movie,” Poitras told me. “Obviously I wasn’t interested in doing that. To have another filmmaker ask me to delay the release of my film was  —   well, it was somewhat insulting. ” Stone was annoyed, but he stuck around for a few drinks. They discussed new movies, including “12 Years a Slave. ” As Poitras recalls, Stone found the film too violent, while Poitras thought the brutality was appropriate given the subject matter. Stone was growing increasingly frustrated. “At some point, he reached over and had his hands around my neck,” Poitras said. “It was sort of in a joking way. I think he was a little bit drunk. But it was not a particularly pleasant evening. ” According to Stone, he only offered to help Poitras get distribution. “We thought we’d help her either bring out her film with our film, or in the wake of it or before it, if we could,” Stone said. He didn’t recall pretending to strangle Poitras. “I think from talking to her, you sense she’s superparanoid,” he said. “But I liked her,” he continued. “I admired her. I saw her films. I was trying to help her. If Laura is accusing me of trying to aggress her or kill her, she’s crazy. ” Despite his occasional bullishness, Stone craves approval. His films tend to resemble his character: at once original, impetuous, dogmatic and stubbornly ambitious. They typically run up to three hours, and he is often hurt when they’re underappreciated. Once, I was with Stone when he was handed a copy of “A Child’s Night Dream,” the novel he wrote at 19. Stone began to recite the blurbs aloud. “The language moves in torrents, always energized . .. shamanistic,” Stone read, quoting The Boston Globe. “I don’t get many good reviews, but this is good. ” I said that he has gotten plenty of good reviews since then. “You should see Rotten Tomatoes,” he said, referring to the   review aggregator. Stone’s torment is at least in part   inflicted. Biopics can be a nasty business, and Stone routinely throws himself into historical narratives and the messy negotiation between fact and fiction. The haggling with historians and family estates is the reason Stone was never able to make films about Martin Luther King Jr. and Hank Williams, and it was why he had to wait for Richard M. Nixon to die to make “Nixon. ” For Stone, the   characters of the stories he is after have become both the obstacles and the necessary arbiters of his work. It’s why he refused to make “Snowden” without Snowden, and why his appeals to Greenwald and Poitras were his way of getting them on board. If Poitras had a strong reaction to Stone’s proposal, it was because she had already been hounded by Sony. After the studio optioned Greenwald’s book, Poitras says Sony asked to buy her life rights  —   an offer she declined. Sony suggested that she come on as a consultant, but when the contract arrived, it stipulated that the studio would have access to Poitras’s tapes and notebooks. “So I’d already gone through that when Oliver came in trying to position himself,” she said. Poitras is a   spoken, cautious woman who has spent much of the past decade on government watch lists. Her resistance to participating in various Snowden projects has less to do with her feeling territorial than with her trying to maintain some control as she has become a character in a story that is no longer hers. Poitras’s radical position is that the “Snowden story” can really belong only to Snowden. “I could have asked him for a   contract in Hong Kong, but I don’t believe in that as a concept,” she said. “It’s his story, and I hope he tells it when he’s ready. ” Neither Greenwald nor Poitras ultimately object to Stone making his film. While his own movie still lingered in development, Greenwald thought Snowden’s story might in fact be safer in Stone’s hands than it would be elsewhere. The Sony leaks would eventually reveal that Stone’s paranoia may have been justified: In emails about the purchase of Greenwald’s book, an executive in Sony’s   affairs office suggests toning down the news release, changing “illegal spying” to “intelligence gathering” and “misuse of power” to “actions. ” “My big worry with Hollywood and the Snowden story is that they’re either going to be cowards and completely drain it of its political vitality,” Greenwald told me, “or that they’re going to do a superbiased smear job. For all the talk about how liberal Hollywood is, the reality is that they’re really close to the government. And whatever other things you might say about Oliver, I was actually relieved that someone was going to do this film where there was no danger of those things happening. ” This January, I drove to Stone’s office in West Los Angeles to watch a rough cut of “Snowden. ” Stone works out of a discreet suite in a pristine office complex. The décor is eclectic. There are tribal masks, Indonesian throw pillows, a Che Guevara painting and a lone potted palm tree. Like “Citizenfour,” “Snowden” takes place in Hong Kong, but this time the story has the eerie feeling of a familiar scene   enacted by skilled Hollywood actors. Stone was right about   Levitt. His performance is not an interpretation so much as a direct replica of the   blower’s even demeanor and intonation. Quinto plays Greenwald with such intensity that he appears perpetually enraged. Melissa Leo’s Poitras is in turn warm and protective, almost maternal. Stone came in just as the credits rolled. He was nursing a cold but was back on caffeine and asked his assistant for Bulletproof, the trendy coffee brand made with “  butter. ” “It’s supposed to be nutritional,” Stone said. “No radicals. ” Since I last saw him, the film’s release had been pushed from December 2015 to May 2016 as Stone rushed to complete it, and then once more to September 2016. The biggest challenge was pacing. Stone likes to structure his movies around a series of   pivoting, battlelike scenes  —   the concerts in “The Doors,” the football games in “Any Given Sunday” or actual warfare in “Alexander. ” A story in which the drama hinges on a tech specialist downloading classified documents was more subdued than he was accustomed to. “Coding is not exciting,” Stone said. “At the end of the day, it’s a nerdlike behavior  —   it’s dull on a screen. ” Stone got around the tedium of reality by turning his film into a cross between a cyberthriller and a love story, using Snowden’s relationship with Mills to inject emotional stakes. Cutting between Snowden in Hong Kong and flashbacks to his past, the film speeds through Snowden’s biography with the help of techno music, snappy explanations of N. S. A. programs and tricky camerawork to build in the tension of surveillance. (There are scenes filmed from the perspective of tiny phone cameras  —   the modern peephole  —   and suggestive   on eye pupils.) But there are also unmistakable  . “I just don’t really like bashing my country,”   Levitt says to Woodley as they stroll past a   era antiwar protest in front of the White House. “It’s my country, too,” Woodley says. “And right now, it’s got blood on its hands. ” Snowden’s N. S. A. boss is unsubtly named Corbin O’Brian, after the antagonist in Orwell’s “1984. ” “Most Americans don’t want freedom,” O’Brian tells Snowden. “They want security. ” Snowden’s many storytellers all tell a similar hero narrative. But if Greenwald’s account is about journalism, Poitras’s is a subtle and artful character study and Kucherena’s is an attempt at the Russian novel  —   a man alone in a room, wrestling with his conscience  —   Stone’s is the explicit blockbuster version, told in high gloss with big, emotional music and digestible plot points that will appeal to mass audiences. As Wizner wisely anticipated, it is the narrative most likely to cement Snowden’s story in Americans’ minds. Snowden declined to comment for this article, but Stone told me he had seen the film and liked it. At a screening at   Con a few months later, Snowden would beam in via satellite to give his somewhat wary approval. “It was something that made me really nervous,” he said of Stone’s film. “But I think he made it work. ” As Stone intended, Snowden shows up at the end of the film. He appears in a   paneled room in Kucherena’s dacha, a modest,   looking space, with little to see except a vase of flowers and some curtains in the background. The Snowden who speaks is not the stoic version, but one who manages to deliver a   caliber movie line. “I no longer have to worry about what happens tomorrow,” he says, “because I’m happy with what I’ve done today. ” Just before the screen fades to black, Snowden is shown gazing toward a window, a faint, inscrutable smile on his face. By this summer, whatever anxieties there may have once been seemed to have dissipated. With the film completed, Stone would officially beat Sony’s project. Open Road, the distributor he was worried about, had won an Oscar for “Spotlight. ” After “Snowden” earned similar marks to that film during test screenings, everyone seemed optimistic, if a little surprised. “At first I thought there must be something wrong,” said Borman, who told me that he hadn’t seen such high scores in 25 years. Open Road had pushed for a fall release, placing it firmly among Oscar contenders. (“Snowden” will open in theaters on Sept. 16, the day after Stone’s 70th birthday.)   Levitt was so moved by Snowden’s story that he donated most of his salary from the film to the A. C. L. U. and used the rest to collaborate with Wizner on a series of videos about democracy. Wizner was preparing to petition Obama to grant Snowden a presidential pardon in the fall, and he hoped Stone’s film would help transform the public’s perception of his client. Kucherena, meanwhile, had turned “Time of the Octopus” into a trilogy  —   in the sequel, the N. S. A. sends an assassin to Russia to “eliminate” Joshua Cold. He hoped to come to the United States for the premiere of the film, in which he has a cameo as a Russian banker who encounters Snowden at a party. “If I can get a visa, why not?” he said. In July, Stone and Wizner joined forces for an A. C. L. U. event. The evening was billed as a conversation with Wizner about surveillance and Edward Snowden, with Stone hosting at his   style home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. As several dozen West Coast supporters of the A. C. L. U. filtered into Stone’s backyard, the director sat camped out on a bench by the pool, taking the party in from a distance. He boasted that he had recently cut four more minutes from the film, bringing the run time to a lean 134 minutes. I asked if he would keep finessing until the end. “No, it’s over,” he said. “This is it. Now I die. ” Wizner roamed around, inspecting a meditation gazebo outfitted with a large gold Buddha. After several people inquired who was playing him in the movie, the lawyer came up with a pithy reply. “Kevin Spacey, reprising his role as Keyser Soze,” he joked. “The guy behind the guy behind the guy  —   hiding in plain sight. ” (Wizner is not a character in Stone’s film.) That week, NPR ran an interview with a Russian security official who posited that Snowden is maybe, probably, most definitely cooperating with Russian intelligence. This inevitably set Wizner off. “Of course, this is the same week that Snowden is blasting Putin on Twitter every day,” Wizner said to Borman, who nodded along. The producer suggested that Snowden’s critics would claim it’s a cover. “That’s what they say!” Wizner said. “This is preapproved criticism so that it’ll seem like he’s free, but actually Putin is the master pulling the strings. ” Eventually, everyone moved to the den, a spacious, brightly lit room filled with family photos. Matthew Weiner, the “Mad Men” creator, took a seat by a stack of DVDs, which included multiple seasons of his own hit TV show. Others arranged themselves along wicker chairs that lined the room’s perimeter. The whole thing had the feeling of a P. T. A. meeting, but without the stale cookies. Wizner got up and spoke for some time about his efforts as Snowden’s lawyer. As he opened the room to questions, someone asked how long Russia could be relied on to keep Snowden safe. Wizner turned the question over to Stone. “Oliver is the Russia expert,” he said with a hint of   aggression. Since completing “Snowden,” Stone had become absorbed in his newfound interest in Russia and announced that he was making a documentary about Putin. In recent months, he had accompanied the Russian president to a theater performance and a World War II Victory Day parade in Moscow. “He represents a different point of view that Americans don’t want to hear,” Stone had told RIA Novosti, a Russian news service. When someone else asked about Stone’s experience of making “Snowden,” his answer was despondent. “It was really a horrible experience in every way,” he said. Everyone laughed except for Stone. As the guests dispersed, Wizner lingered in the foyer, admiring Stone’s art collection depicting important and mostly dead men. He thought that a print of   Sartre looked like Steve Buscemi and that a   looking Beethoven was actually Stone. On the opposite wall was a sketch of Genghis Khan, the feared Mongolian emperor. Stone called him a liberal. “Yes, Genghis Khan  —   misunderstood,” Wizner teased. Stone smiled and cocked his head. “Listen, the A. C. L. U. should defend him!”",0
623,The “Blacks For Trump” Man Once Belonged To A Murderous Cult,"Comments 
Republican nominee Donald Trump has been strategically placing certain people behind his him at rallies to create a false illusion about the diversity of his supporters. You may have noticed a man holding a “BLACKS FOR TRUMP” sign behind the racist rabble-rouser at his events, with a website URL “GODS2.com” underneath it. If you’ve wondered just what kind of black Americans could bring themselves to support Trump or if this election could get any weirder, well, hold on to your seat. 
The man holding the sign is “Michael the Black Man,” also known as Maurice Woodside or Michael Symonette. LittleGreenFootballs did some research and discovered that Michael isn’t your ordinary concerned citizen. He’s a former member of a murderous cult , Yahweh ben Yahweh, led by preacher Hulon Mitchell Jr. 
Michael, along with 15 other Yahweh followers, was charged for allegedly conspiring in two murders; his brother, who was also in the cult, told jurors that Michael had helped beat one man who was later killed and stuck a sharpened stick into another man’s eyeball. But jurors found Michael (and six other Yahweh followers) innocent. They sent Mitchell away for 20 years in the federal pen. 
Michael later reinvented himself as a radio host and an anti-gay, anti-Obama preacher and soon found himself in the spotlight at Republican events, whose organizers were delighted to have found another person of color to attack Obama without being obviously racist. His website, GODS2.com, is filled with the delusional, vaguely anti-Semitic rantings of a madman and homages to Yahweh. 
This may not mean much in the long run, but it’s worth pointing out just how outrageous the hypocrisy of the Trump campaign is. Trump attacked Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton when the father of the Orlando nightclub shooter appeared in the stands behind her at a rally out of chance, accusing her of associating with the father of a deranged murderer – but this man is actually being planted behind Trump because of his skin color.

624,Bill Clinton’s Lover: He Called Ruthless Hillary ‘The Warden’,"  Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted ‘monster’ who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her ‘The Warden’ in front of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle. Kyle, now 68, says she had a decades-long affair with   before and during his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill’s salacious double-life in the 1970s and ’80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the 1990s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to ‘destroy’ Kyle if she spoke to the media about their relationship. Kyle’s decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail.com as well as in her 2016 book The Other Woman, provide a unique perspective on the Clintons’ marriage and the couple’s treatment of the women who have accused   of infidelity or sexual assault over the years. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton’s sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the ‘right to be believed’.  35  ",0

Hillary Clinton has taken her illegal actions to a new level with a new move that involves enlisting the help of illegal immigrants to help her beat Donald Trump in November. 
Once again, Hillary is in violation of 8 U.S. Code § 1324, which makes it a felony to ‘conceal’ or ‘harbor’ any ‘alien’ ‘including any means of transportation.’ The penalty is five years in prison (ten years if it was done for “commercial advantage or private financial gain,” could be made for that). Hillary and the DNC also violated this law a few weeks back at the Democratic National Convention when they paraded two illegal immigrants across the stage to give an anti- Trump speech. 
Hillary Clinton is enlisting undocumented “Dreamers” into a new voter registration drive aimed at signing up sympathetic voters with warnings that Donald Trump ’s immigration plans could result in their deportation – though the Dreamers themselves cannot legally vote. 
Clinton’s national voter registration program, called “Mi Sueño, Tu Voto/My Dream, Your Vote,” was announced Sunday, on the four-year anniversary of the 2012 order that temporarily shielded from deportation some young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. 
The 730,000 young people known as Dreamers are prohibited from voting. However, they remain a powerful political organizing force, and the Clinton campaign hopes to use them to convince Latino and other households to go to the polls for the Democratic nominee. HERE’S WHAT LOU HAD TO SAY… ",0
626,"Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita domano l'egemonia del dollaro, di Ariel Noyola Rodríguez","Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita domano l’egemonia del dollaro di Ariel Noyola Rodríguez 
Gli Stati Uniti aumentano gli ostacoli tentando di mantenere l’egemonia del dollaro come valuta di riserva mondiale. Negli ultimi mesi, i Paesi emergenti hanno venduto un molti buoni del tesoro degli USA, principalmente Russia e Cina, ma anche Arabia Saudita. Inoltre, per proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro, le banche centrali di diversi Paesi acquistano enormi quantità di oro per diversificare le riserve valutarie. In breve, l’offensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro è esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli Stati Uniti e, in parallelo, l’acquisto colossale di metalli preziosi. Rete Voltaire | Città del Messico (Messico) | 5 novembre 2016 français Español 
La supremazia di Washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito un colpo tremendo ad agosto: Russia, Cina e Arabia Saudita vendevamo titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti per 37,9 miliardi di dollari, secondo l’ultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni [ 1 ]. Dal punto di vista generale, gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli Stati Uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio 2012. Chiaramente, il ruolo del dollaro a valuta di riserva mondiale è ancora messo in discussione. 
Nel 2010, l’ammiraglio Michael Mullen, presidente del Joint Chiefs of Staff statunitense, avvertì che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale [ 2 ]. A mio avviso, non è tanto l’alto debito pubblico (oltre i 19 000 miliardi [ 3 ]) ad ostacolare l’economia degli Stati Uniti, ma per Washington è di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno, per coprire i deficit gemelli (commercio e bilancio); cioè per il dipartimento del Tesoro è questione di vita o di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e così finanziare le spese degli USA. 
Si ricordi che dal fallimento di Lehman Brothers nel settembre 2008, Bank of China ha subito forti pressioni da Ben Bernanke, allora presidente della Federal Reserve (FED), a non vendere i titoli del debito degli Stati Uniti. In un primo momento, i cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro. Tuttavia, da allora, per due volte, la PBoC evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli Stati Uniti e, allo stesso tempo, avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie. 
Pechino acquista oro in maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni, e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della Russia. Nel secondo trimestre del 2016, le riserve auree della Banca di Cina hanno raggiunto le 1 823 tonnellate contro le 1 762 tonnellate registrate nell’ultimo trimestre del 2015. La Federazione Russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa 290 tonnellate tra dicembre 2014 e giugno 2016, chiudendo il secondo trimestre di quest’anno con un totale di 1 500 tonnellate. 
Di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro è fondamentale acquistare asset più sicuri come l’oro che, in tempi di grave instabilità finanziaria, agisce da rifugio sicuro. Quindi la strategia di Mosca e Pechino nel vendere titoli del Tesoro degli USA e comprare oro, viene seguita da molti Paesi. Come stimato dal Fondo monetario internazionale (FMI), le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno già raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi 15 anni, registrando ai primi di ottobre un volume di circa 33 000 tonnellate [ 4 ]. 
La geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale. Dopo l’imposizione delle sanzioni economiche al Cremlino, a partire dal 2014, il rapporto con la Cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per i russi. Da allora, le due potenze hanno approfondito i legami in tutti i settori, dall’economia e finanza alla cooperazione militare. Inoltre, assicurando la fornitura di gas alla Cina per i prossimi tre decenni, il Presidente Vladimir Putin ha costruito con l’omologo Xi Jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense. 
Attualmente, gli idrocarburi che Mosca vende a Pechino sono pagati in yuan, non dollari. Così, la “moneta del popolo” (‘renminbi’ in cinese) emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra Russia e Cina, Paesi che, a mio parere, guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare. 
La grande novità è che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione dell’economia globale si è unita l’Arabia Saudita, Paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di Washington. Sorprendentemente, negli ultimi 12 mesi Riad s’è sbarazzata di più di 19 miliardi di dollari investiti in titoli del Tesoro degli Stati Uniti, divenendo insieme alla Cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli Stati Uniti [ 5 ]. A peggiorare le cose, il regno saudita si accanisce sempre più con la Casa Bianca. 
A fine settembre, il Congresso degli Stati Uniti approvava l’eliminazione del veto del presidente Barack Obama ad una legge che impediva negli USA di denunciare l’Arabia Saudita in tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell’11 settembre 2001 [ 6 ]. Insieme, l’Organizzazione dei Paesi Esportatori del Petrolio (OPEC) ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la Russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere l’aumento dei prezzi [ 7 ]. 
E’ anche sorprendente che giusto oggi Pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il Trading System Foreign Exchange della Cina (CFETS, nell’acronimo inglese) per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro. Di conseguenza, è molto probabile che, più prima che poi, la compagnia petrolifera Saudi Aramco accetti pagamenti in yuan invece che dollari [ 8 ]. Se si accadesse, la Casa dei Saud punterebbe tutto sul petroyuan [ 9 ]. Il mondo cambia davanti ai nostri occhi…",0
627,"In Its Third Month, India’s Cash Shortage Begins to Bite - The New York Times","NEW DELHI  —   First, Yashpal Singh Rathore’s marriage was delayed by his future   who, like most Indians, ran short of cash after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the country’s largest currency notes in November. Then the    lost his job when the ensuing cash crunch hit demand for motorcycles and scooters sold by the company where he worked, Hero MotoCorp Ltd. After that, the prospective   refused to let the wedding go forward until he found another job. “So I lost my job and I lost my marriage,” he said in an interview at a protest, where he shouted slogans with more than 100    workers let go by Hero. Mr. Rathore is one among a large number of Indians  —   the precise number is not known  —   who have lost their jobs since Nov. 8, when Mr. Modi abruptly banned 86 percent of the country’s currency in a bid to eliminate “black money,” currency on which taxes had not been paid. For the sake of secrecy, the government largely avoided printing replacement notes in advance. So there has been an acute and protracted shortage of cash as the government struggles to catch up. That, in turn, has proved economically damaging. Exactly how harmful remains hard to determine, but the available data is not reassuring. Demand for vegetables is declining because people don’t have the money to pay for them, for example, and some service industries are reporting steep job losses. The International Monetary Fund this month cut its projected growth rate for India by one percentage point for the current fiscal year, to 6. 6 percent. While the full impact is still difficult to discern, there is little doubt who is suffering the most. “This has actually hurt the poor enormously,” said Nasser Munjee, chairman of DCB Bank and a company director at HDFC and Tata Motors. The pain is hidden, for the most part. Accustomed to hardship, many who lost employment were at first convinced by Mr. Modi’s speeches that their setbacks were transitory and, in the long run, would be worth the suffering. But as the crisis drags on, with no end in sight, some are growing frustrated, as they told us in a series of interviews at protests and at day labor gathering points. Many of them, even children, are forced to go without fruit, vegetables and milk  —   now unaffordable luxuries. Most had not paid apartment rents and their children’s school fees in the months since the cash ban. Many had sent their families back to their villages, and were ready to give up and follow if things did not turn around soon. Sending cash to the elderly parents they had long supported is now out of the question. As is common in India, the workers said that although they had worked on Hero MotoCorp’s shop floor, wearing company uniforms, they had been formally employed by other contractors, meaning they could be let go more easily without benefits. Sunil Kumar, 28, who had been earning 15, 000 rupees a month, about $220, at Hero, said he had been supporting his wife and two children when he lost his job without notice Nov. 29. They immediately cut milk, green vegetables and fruit from their diets, including for their    and    children. Paying rent is out of the question. “This is like a massacre for us,” he said. “My livelihood is gone after the cash ban. What do I do now?” The decline in vegetable demand is so steep that the prices of eggplants, potatoes, cauliflower and tomatoes dropped between 42 percent and 78 percent, the NCDEX Institute of Commodity Markets and Research said. In the first month alone after the currency ban, micro and   service industries cut staff by 35 percent, the All India Manufacturers’ Organization said, based on a survey. It released a study this month saying that job losses in a variety of industries, including automobile parts, infrastructure and construction, would swell to as much as 35 percent by March. The anecdotal evidence is painful. Mr. Rathore, whose wedding was postponed, is among 582 workers who reported losing their jobs at Hero MotoCorp in November and December, as the company suffered a 34 percent drop in   sales in December from a year earlier. Hero did not respond to requests for comment. Most economists believe the economy will rebound, but nobody knows how long it will take. In Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, hundreds of unshaven men in rumpled clothing stood recently at a   intersection called Khoda Labor Chowk that is a gathering place for people seeking work. Before the currency ban, they told us, they would be hired most days, earning 400 to 600 rupees, about $6 to $9, for a day of carpentry, floor tiling or masonry. But since the ban, most interviewed said, they had worked for only a week each month, at best, and even on the few days when they were hired their wages had fallen by half. Rafiq Ali, 46, said that, having worked only 12 days in the last two months, he had sent his wife and two children back to his native village about 200 miles away, where it is cheaper to live. “I am surviving on roti and potato with salt,” Mr. Ali said, referring to the flat Indian bread that is a staple in the Indian diet. “I’ve stopped taking milk, even in tea, and eating vegetables. ” But what hurt him most, he said, was a recent call from his wife, back in the village, who wanted money to take their sick daughter to a doctor. Mr. Ali said he had nothing to send. “A sense of desperation and helplessness is emerging,” he said. “This currency ban is not helpful for poor people. ” Hoti Lal, a    father of three, said he could get work for only six days during the last two months, forcing his family to survive on money his    son made cleaning offices. Mr. Lal had hoped his son could give up that job to go to college, but that dream is fading fast. His son’s salary of 7, 000 rupees a month, a little over $100, is about half of what he used to earn regularly, Mr. Lal said. So, Mr. Lal said, his family has cut back entirely on green vegetables and milk. Almost every man we interviewed said he was a migrant who had been sending a portion of his salary home to support his parents in his native village  —   and had been unable to do so since the currency ban wiped out work. Vikas Sahu, 30, who had been working at Hero for four years, has been unable to send money back to his parents, wife and children, who live in his village about 100 miles west of New Delhi. His first grader’s school fees are overdue by months, and his father took out a loan of 70, 000 rupees, about $1, 000, for agricultural expenses, including paying for repairs on the family’s tractor. “How long I can survive like this?” he asked. With little else to do, Rakesh Yadav, 28, shows up most days to protest, hoping for some relief from the government or some upbeat economic news that might induce Hero to begin rehiring. He had worked there for eight years as a machine operator on the shop floor. To cut costs, his wife and daughter went home to his village. He gave up the one room they had shared at a monthly rental of 3, 300 rupees, or about $50, and moved in with four other men who share a room. “I do not know where to go or what to do,” he said. Mr. Rathore said he thought about giving up and returning to his village in Bilaspur district, about 750 miles south of Delhi, but he just cannot bear to do so, at least not yet. “What can I do in my village?” he asked.",0
628,There’s Only One Trump Administration Position That’s Gaining Popularity And It’s Going To Shock You - Breitbart,"While support for the Trump administration’s positions on many issues has declined in recent months, one of the president’s most controversial policies has held its ground or perhaps even grown in popularity. [Some of the administration’s most popular positions have seen their popularity decline, according to CNBC’s quarterly “All American Survey. ” The share of Americans who say they somewhat or strongly support the administration’s plans to rebuild American infrastructure, for example, has declined to 62 percent from 75 percent three months earlier. Support for individual tax cuts has fallen to 59 percent from 64 percent, while support for cuts to business taxes fell to 50 percent from 54 percent.  Renegotiating trade deals has lost support, falling to 50 percent from 58 percent. Support for regulatory relief has declined to 44 percent from 47 percent. Public support for repealing Obamacare very nearly held steady, losing just one percentage point of support from 45 percent to 44 percent. But the public remains strongly divided on healthcare, with opposition to the administration’s repeal and replace plans edging up to 38 percent from 37 percent in April. So which issue has gained popularity? Banning immigration from specific Middle Eastern and African countries. Public support for the ban rose by a percentage point, with 44 percent of Americans now saying the strongly or somewhat support the ban. That slight rise was due to a one percentage point gain in the “strongly support” category. Opposition to the ban has slightly declined, falling to 49 percent from 50 percent. The share of respondents who said they “strongly oppose” the plan, however, saw a steeper decline, to 32 percent from 36 percent.    ",0
629,Bill Clinton Said White Middle-class Life Expectancy Declined During Obama Years,"Email 
Speaking at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser in Canton, Ohio, last November, former President Bill Clinton (right) expressed disappointment concerning a then-recent Democratic presidential candidates’ debate, during which, he said, there was not a single mention of the fact that “84 percent of the American people, after inflation, had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash.” 
The financial crash of which Clinton spoke began in late 2007 and extended into 2008 — the year Barack Obama was elected president. Though his administration was not responsible for the crash, when Clinton spoke last year, Obama had been president for more than six years. Therefore, Clinton’s observations indicated that the vast majority of Americans had made no financial progress during Obama’s entire first term and half of his second term. 
Britain’s Daily Mail reported that the former president’s speech was published by WikiLeaks as part of the website’s release of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s e-mails. 
In addition to the lack of income growth among most Americans, Clinton revealed a remarkable statistic: The life expectancy of middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans is declining. Said the former president: And in the middle of all this we learned, breathtakingly, that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans’ life expectancy is going down and is now lower than Hispanics, even though they make less money. And the gap between African Americans and whites is closing, but unfortunately not because the death rate among African Americans is dropping but because the death rate among white Americans is rising. Why? Because they don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning. Because their lives are sort of stuck in neutral. 
Clinton’s explanation that the reason that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans’ life expectancy is going down is because “they don’t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning” is probably an oversimplification that requires greater analysis. 
The obvious reason why someone may not have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning is because they are unemployed and therefore have no job to go to. Figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2015 — the year Clinton gave his speech — indicated that those with only a high-school diploma had a 5.4 percent unemployment rate, compared with a 2.8 percent rate for those with bachelor’s degrees. (These figures did not account for race, and they didn't count literally millions of unemployed Americans: After a few months of looking for work, the government drops them from the unemployment rolls, deeming them to not want to work. In 2009, 80 million Americans were deemed not in the labor force; now it's 95 million. Also, if an American is able to find a low-paying part-time job out of his field, he is considered employed by the government.) 
An article published by Fortune on November 3, 2015 (about two weeks before Clinton’s speech) may have provided him with a basis for his statement. The article’s headline? “Is the Economy Killing Middle-Aged White People?” The article cited a survey released by a pair of researchers at Princeton University the previous day showing “a striking increase in the death rates of white, middle-aged Americans who have less than a college education.” 
Though the researchers Angus Deaton, the 2015 Nobel laureate in Economics, and his wife, Anne Case, both professors at Princeton, didn’t form any steadfast conclusions about the reasons for the increase in death rates, they did speculate that economic factors are likely at least partly responsible. Fortune reported: Between 1999 and 2013, white men and women ages 45-54 saw their mortality rate increase by a half-percent per year, reversing decades of improvements up until that time. The main causes were suicide and the use of alcohol and drugs (both legal and illegal), according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The article noted that while it is impossible to know for sure how attributable the high death rates are to economic forces without more study, the Princeton researchers have speculated that the economic crisis of 2008 might have been a major factor. 
The research paper considered an explanation for why the higher death rate has affected white middle-aged people more than those in other ethnic and racial groups subject to the same economic downturn. Their explanation was that “working-class whites have decades of relative success and security behind them…. For the first time, perhaps, that group has seen a reversal of its fortunes.” 
We might add another explanation for the increased mortality rates: Workers accustomed to having their medical care paid for by their employers may find that, upon becoming unemployed, they can no longer afford medical insurance and, as a result, neglect the healthcare necessary to maintain their health. 
While Clinton did not refer to the Princeton professors' paper in his speech, it is possible that its release just weeks before did provide him with some talking points. 
Clinton’s comments were made in the context of a stump speech on behalf of his wife’s candidacy, and he did not offer any substantive solutions for the crisis among white middle-aged Americans. He instead offered this vague proposal: We have unlimited potential in America to grow our economy if we do a few things right, and not a lot. Five or six or seven things, really we’ll see jobs start forming again; we’ll see business formation going up again; we’ll see wages rising again. And I believe she’s outlined reasonable responses to all the things that will do that. And I ought to have some credibility on that, because the only time in 50 years when all sections of the American economy have grown together were in the eight years I had the privilege to serve. 
In that regard, Clinton (on behalf of his wife) shared in rival candidate Donald Trump’s tendency to make many promises to grow the economy and create jobs offering higher wages, while offering few concrete details about how these lofty goals might be realized. Considering that the best thing that government can do to stimulate the economy is simply to get out of the way and allow the free market to flourish, however, any plan offered by a former Cabinet member of the administration that gave us ObamaCare might well be viewed with skepticism. We might also want to remember that the former president is the one who signed NAFTA, the trade deal that negatively impacted American jobs — leaving many Americans without ""anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning.”",0
630,Furious Eric Holder Just Issued A Dire Warning About Comey’s Partisan Smears,"Comments 
Former US Attorney General Eric Holder just wrote an op-ed warning the American people to disregard the FBI Director James Comey’s unprecedented decision to release information about an ongoing investigation during the heat of an election. Comey released a vague memo when he had little more to go on other than a mere suspicion and is now facing bipartisan calls for removal from office. Democratic congressional staffers now claim that their first warning of the Comey memo was when a House Republican tweeted it out with the usual anti-Hillary spin. That alone demonstrates exactly what Holder wrote about preventing “investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion,” which happened nearly instantly on Friday afternoon. 
Former Attorney General Holder also pointed out that Comey’s “newly discovered” emails have no known significance and that the FBI Director violated long standing policies in the Department of Justice – which are non-partisan – aimed at upholding the integrity of America’s form of electoral democracy, free from government intervention: 
I understand the gravity of the work our Justice Department performs every day to defend the security of our nation, protect the American people, uphold the rule of law and be fair. That is why I am deeply concerned about FBI Director James B. Comey’s decision to write a vague letter to Congress about emails potentially connected to a matter of public, and political, interest. That decision was incorrect. 
The department also has a policy of not taking unnecessary action close in time to Election Day that might influence an election’s outcome. These rules have been followed during Republican and Democratic administrations. They aren’t designed to help any particular individual or to serve any political interest. Instead, they are intended to ensure that every investigation proceeds fairly and judiciously; to maintain the public trust in the department’s ability to do its job free of political influence; and to prevent investigations from unfairly or unintentionally casting public suspicion on public officials who have done nothing wrong. 
Director Comey broke with these fundamental principles. I fear he has unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI. And he has allowed — again without improper motive — misinformation to be spread by partisans with less pure intentions. Already, we have learned that the importance of the discovery itself may have been overblown. According to the director himself, there is no indication yet that the “newly discovered” emails bear any significance at all. And yet, because of his decision to comment on this development before sufficient facts were known, the public has faced a torrent of conspiracy theories and misrepresentations. 
High ranking former Justice Department officials like Eric Holder do not make a career out of slamming their former colleagues, so it’s a very rare break in the ranks to see a former Attorney General publicly slam his former subordinate. The Hatch Act prevents federal officials from interfering in partisan elections and strictly demands that public officials refrain from doing anything that could impact an election. Holder wrote : 
I served with Jim Comey and I know him well. This is a very difficult piece for me to write. He is a man of integrity and honor. I respect him. But good men make mistakes. In this instance, he has committed a serious error with potentially severe implications. It is incumbent upon him — or the leadership of the department — to dispel the uncertainty he has created before Election Day. It is up to the director to correct his mistake — not for the sake of a political candidate or campaign but in order to protect our system of justice and best serve the American people. 
FBI Director James Comey knew better than to release a vague memo about an ongoing investigation, which, even under normal circumstances, should never be done. That is why former Attorney General Holder felt compelled to rebuke him in this scathing op-ed. 
Hopefully, the current members of the Justice Department tasked with reviewing the bipartisan complaints read the memo and expedite their decision concerning the future of the FBI Director. 
It should not take long for any rational investigator to determine that James Comey’s “cry wolf” memo was little more than a partisan prop handed to a failing campaign — and to remove the FBI Director from his office.",0
631,Memo to Trump: 'Action This Day!',"  => 
“In victory, magnanimity!” said Winston Churchill. 
Donald Trump should be magnanimous and gracious toward those whom he defeated this week, but his first duty is to keep faith with those who put their faith in him. 
The protests, riots and violence that have attended his triumph in city after city should only serve to steel his resolve. 
As for promptings that he “reach out” and “reassure” those upset by his victory, and trim or temper his agenda to pacify them, Trump should reject the poisoned chalice. This is the same old con. 
Trump should take as models the Democrats FDR and LBJ. 
Franklin Roosevelt, who had savaged Herbert Hoover as a big spender, launched his own New Deal in his first 100 days. 
History now hails his initiative and resolve. 
Lyndon Johnson exploited his landslide over Barry Goldwater in 1964 to erect his Great Society in 1965: the Voting Rights Act, Medicare and Medicaid. He compromised on nothing, and got it all. 
Even those who turned on him for Vietnam still celebrate his domestic achievements. 
President Nixon’s great regret was that he did not bomb Hanoi and mine Haiphong in 1969 — instead of waiting until 1972 — and bring the Vietnam War to an earlier end and with fewer U.S. casualties. 
Nixon’s decision not to inflame the social and political crisis of the ’60s by rolling back the Great Society bought him nothing. He was rewarded with media-backed mass demonstrations in 1969 to break his presidency and bring about an American defeat in Vietnam. 
“Action this day!” was the scribbled command of Prime Minister Churchill on his notepads in World War II. This should be the motto of the first months of a Trump presidency. 
For the historic opportunity he and the Republican Party have been given by his stunning and unanticipated victory of Nov. 8 will not last long. His adversaries and enemies in politics and press are only temporarily dazed and reeling. 
This great opening should be exploited now. 
Few anticipated Tuesday morning what we would have today: a decapitated Democratic Party, with the Obamas and Clintons gone or going, Joe Biden with them, no national leader rising, and only the power of obstruction, of which the nation has had enough. 
The GOP, however, on Jan. 20, will control both Houses of Congress and the White House, with the real possibility of remaking the Supreme Court in the image of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have indicated they are willing to work with President Trump. 
There is nothing to prevent the new GOP from writing history. 
In his first months, Trump could put a seal on American politics as indelible as that left by Ronald Reagan. 
A partial agenda: First, he should ignore any importunings by President Obama to permit passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame-duck session — and let the trade deal sink by year’s end. 
On Jan. 20, he should have vetted and ready to nominate to the high court a brilliant constitutionalist and strict constructionist. 
He should act to end interference with the Dakota Access pipeline and call on Congress to re-enact legislation, vetoed by Obama, to finish the Keystone XL pipeline. Then he should repeal all Obama regulations that unnecessarily restrict the production of the oil, gas and clean coal necessary to make America energy independent again. 
Folks in Pennsylvania, southeast Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia should be shown, by executive action, that Trump is a man of his word. And when the mines open again, he should be there. 
He should order new actions to seal the Southern border, start the wall and begin visible deportations of felons who are in the country illegally. 
With a new education secretary, he should announce White House intent to work for repeal of Common Core and announce the introduction of legislation to put federal resources behind the charter schools that have proven to be a godsend to inner-city black children. 
He should propose an immediate tax cut for U.S. corporations, with $2 to $3 trillion in unrepatriated profits abroad, who will bring the money home and invest it in America, to the benefit of our economy and our Treasury. 
He should take the president’s phone and pen and begin the rewriting or repeal of every Obama executive order that does not comport with the national interest or political philosophy of the GOP. 
Trump should announce a date soon for repeal and replacement of Obamacare and introduction of his new tax-and-trade legislation to bring back manufacturing and create American jobs. 
Donald Trump said in his campaign that that this is America’s last chance. If we lose this one, he said, we lose the country. 
The president-elect should ignore his more cautious counselors, and act with the urgency of his declared beliefs.

632,Chaos and Desperation as Thousands Flee Aleppo Amid Government Advance - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Hundreds of Syrian men who escaped   areas of eastern Aleppo to reach   parts of the city are missing, United Nations officials said on Friday, adding that they had received reports of government reprisals, including numerous arrests and several cases of summary killings of suspected supporters of the opposition. At the same time, the officials said, some rebel groups have prevented civilians from leaving and even killed or kidnapped those who demanded that insurgents leave their neighborhoods. The United Nations reports largely reflect what residents of East Aleppo have told The New York Times in recent days as Syrian government forces retook control of most of the city. Several have said family members were detained, arrested or conscripted after crossing into   areas, and one resident recounted how rebels in the Bustan   neighborhood stopped people from leaving. Other residents, however, said rebels had helped them cross the front lines or warned them not to go at certain times or in certain places because of the danger. Rebel groups inside east Aleppo are fragmented and do not always act in concert. As government forces continued to advance on Friday, panic was growing among those still trapped inside, who either could not make their way out or were afraid to enter government territory. More than 10, 500 people have left   areas in the last 24 hours, Russian officials said on Friday, nearly half of them children, while others have moved deeper into the   district under intense bombardment. At the same time, government forces have escorted hundreds of the displaced back to recently retaken districts, such as the Bab   district below. But those areas are heavily damaged, and officials have told families to move into any available abandoned apartments. In areas the government has recently retaken, like this one south of Aleppo, it has placed posters of President Bashar   amid rubble and handed out Syrian government flags. Many people who escaped eastern Aleppo have been filmed thanking government troops and their ally, Russia, and chanting praise for Mr. Assad. In the newly retaken Bab   neighborhood, a man greeted a   fighter. But for those viewed as opposing the government and men wanted for army service, there is a riskier side to entering government territory. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said family members had reported that they had lost contact with men aged 30 to 50, echoing several interviews The Times conducted in which Aleppo residents said their males relatives were arrested or forced to join the army. “Given the terrible record of arbitrary detention, torture and enforced disappearances by the Syrian government, we are of course deeply concerned about the fate of these individuals,” Mr. Colville said. He also said that two members of the   forces that took over Aleppo’s   neighborhood were reported to have summarily shot four men in front of their families on Sunday because they were suspected of working with the opposition. The last two weeks have seen the fiercest bombardments yet of   districts. Those still inside describe chaos and intense crowding in some areas as people scramble for shelter. They said wounded people and bodies were left in the streets with no one to help them. Here, what is believed to be the charred body of a rebel fighter can be seen in retaken Bab  . Mr. Colville said the agency had heard reports that two armed opposition groups had abducted and killed an unknown number of civilians who asked them to leave their neighborhoods. He added that residents trying to leave the Bustan   neighborhood may have come under fire from armed opposition groups, something that could amount to the war crime of  . “Civilians are caught between warring parties that appear to be operating in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,” Mr. Colville said. “All sides are deeply culpable. ” The government has retaken most of the medieval Old City, a Unesco World Heritage site severely damaged by years of fighting. At its center is the citadel, which the government has held and used as a fortress throughout the conflict. The government’s offensive over the last week has left rebels in east Aleppo facing   defeat. On Friday, Russian officials said that 93 percent of Aleppo had been captured by the Syrian Army. There has been some talk of at least a temporary   to allow for evacuation of the city, but on Friday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said that military operations “will go on until bandits leave eastern Aleppo. ” Mr. Lavrov said he still had hope of reaching a final resolution for the city in talks with the United States, but Jan Egeland, the United Nations’ humanitarian chief, on Thursday described the two countries as being “poles apart. ” At the United Nations on Friday, Russia suffered a sharp diplomatic blow when a large majority of members voted for a mildly worded, legally nonbinding General Assembly resolution calling for a pause in fighting and access to humanitarian aid in Syria. In practice, the resolution means little, with no specifics and no force of law. So Syria and Russia, which lobbied vigorously against the resolution, can continue their military operations, including those on the   parts of Aleppo. The resolution, advanced by Canada, received 122 votes in favor and 13 against.   members abstained. The no votes included Syria, its chief allies Iran and Russia, along with China, Cuba and Venezuela. It comes days after Russia, along with China, defeated a resolution in the Security Council that would have imposed a   cessation of hostilities to allow aid into besieged parts of Aleppo and allow residents to get out.",0
633,Wildfire Empties Fort McMurray in Alberta’s Oil Sands Region - The New York Times,"OTTAWA  —   The entire community of Fort McMurray, the heart of Alberta’s oil sands region, was ordered to evacuate on Tuesday night as a   wildfire advanced on the city and cut off its only highway link to the south. The fire destroyed a number of homes in one neighborhood and some trailers in a trailer park, said Robin Smith, a spokesman for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray. According to television news reports, commercial buildings downtown were also ablaze. There were no reports of injuries by early evening. A video  showed flames and smoke rising hundreds of feet into the sky, prompting the largest fire evacuation in Alberta’s history, The Edmonton Journal reported. The fire was expected to get worse on Wednesday, when winds were forecast to switch direction and increase in speed. Mr. Smith said early Tuesday that Highway 63, which connects Fort McMurray to Edmonton, Alberta, to the south and the main oil sands production areas to the north, was heavily congested with cars fleeing the fire, which began over the weekend. Late in the afternoon, however, the fire jumped over the highway, making evacuation to the south impossible, Mr. Smith said. He added that there was no immediate danger in areas north of Fort McMurray. The highway was later reopened. As of early Tuesday evening, the city’s airport was open, but some airlines were canceling flights, said Jillian Philipp, an airport spokeswoman. After leaving the airport earlier in the day, Ms. Philipp said she was unable to return because of the fire. But employees still there told her that it did not appear to be in the immediate path of the flames. The provincial government had ordered residents out of six neighborhoods and a trailer park by late in the afternoon after declaring the fire “out of control. ” The fire had consumed about 6, 500 acres of forest by late Monday night and increased substantially in size by Tuesday, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for the provincial government. Ms. Stewart said that strong, changing winds were shifting the fire’s direction, making it unsafe for firefighters on the ground. As a result, their efforts had been limited to aerial water bombing. A photograph posted by the government showed only a relatively small line of trees and a hill separating a commercial district from a tower of flame. Until last year, the oil sands had made Fort McMurray Canada’s boomtown, where the biggest concern was dealing with frenetic growth and the housing shortages and social problems it created. The collapse of oil prices, however, has hit the city particularly hard. Oil sands companies have been laying off workers as projects are completed, but no major oil sands projects have shut down. Last year, the regional municipality had a population of about 125, 000, excluding thousands of workers who officially claimed residency elsewhere but who commuted by air to Fort McMurray and lived in work camps.",0
634,PressTV-Russian warships flotilla off Syrian coast,"Syria This October 19, 2016 photo provided by Norwegian Armed Forces shows a plane taking off from Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov (R) with helicopters escorting nuclear-powered battle cruiser Pyotr Veliky (L) southwest of the city of Trondheim in international waters on its way to the Mediterranean. 
A fleet of Russian warships has entered the eastern Mediterranean off the coast of Syria amid speculations that Moscow and Damascus are about to launch a massive operation against terrorists in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. 
The commander of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov told state-owned Russia-1 television network on Saturday that the military vessels were positioned in the “designated zone... in the eastern Mediterranean and are now jointly carrying out tasks, maneuvering to the west of the Syrian coast.” 
Captain 1st rank Sergei Artamonov added that fighter jets have already started taking off from the carrier’s deck to survey the conflict zone. 
“Flights are being carried out from the deck... they are working on coordination with the shore port. The flights have been going on practically every day for the last four days,” the high-ranking Russian naval commander pointed out. 
The remarks came a day after Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that Russian MiG and Sukhoi warplanes routinely fly from the Kuznetsov aircraft carrier into the Syrian airspace to “determine combat missions.” 
Meanwhile, the commander of the Pyotr Veliky nuclear-powered battle cruiser, Captain 1st rank Vladislav Malakhovsky, said on Saturday that no foreign aircraft dared to “come closer than 50 kilometers” away from the Russian fleet. This file photo shows Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich on its way to the Mediterranean. (Photo by Reuters) 
On November 4, Russian frigate Admiral Grigorovich passed through the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey and arrived off the Syrian coast. 
Grigorovich is reportedly capable of launching land-attack Kalibr cruise missiles, which are equivalent to US Tomahawk ones and equipped with the latest high precision guidance systems. 
Russia has been bombing Daesh and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as the al-Nusra Front, terror groups in Syria since September 30, 2015 at the official request of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Backed by Russia’s aerial campaign, the Syrian troops have retaken several militant-held areas in the Arab country. 
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. United Nations Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura estimates that over 400,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Loading ... ",0
635,Schumer: Sessions Should Be Investigated - He ’Seems To Be Violating’ His Recusal - Breitbart,"On Sunday’s broadcast of on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) said Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemed to be violating his recusal over Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election by participating in the firing and replacement of FBI Director James Comey.  Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: As you know, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions who had said he would recuse himself for anything having to do with the probes raised eyebrows when he participated very directly in the firing of Comey, and then there are questions about him interviewing candidates to replace Comey, but what do you think about Sessions claim to have recused himself? Do you think he should be investigated by the senate and should it be investigated by the inspector general at DOJ? yes. SCHUMER: Yes. I have asked the inspector general and the request I’ve made is not only to look into any interference to thwart the investigation but whether Attorney General Sessions should have participated in the firing of Comey and should participate in FBI director. You know Attorney General Sessions has a higher obligation. He didn’t tell the truth meeting with the Russians so he recused himself. He seems to be violating that recusal that seems on its face to be part of this. And look, I called for him to step down when he didn’t tell the truth about the Russians because it’s the highest law in enforcement officer in the land. If the actions of the last week make all the more reason he should not be attorney general. (  The Hill) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
636,"Amid Division, a March in Washington Seeks to Bring Women Together - The New York Times","A movement is growing to bring together women across race, creed and political beliefs by luring them off social media and arranging for them to meet in person. It’s a nice idea, but there’s one catch: The Women’s March on Washington is being organized on Facebook, the nation’s preferred platform to battle over race, gender, politics and just about everything else. The timing of the event, which organizers began planning the morning after the election but are careful not to call a protest, is aimed at the coming administration of   Donald J. Trump. More than 100, 000 people have said on Facebook that they will travel to the capital to participate. The plan is to walk from the Lincoln Memorial to the White House on Jan. 21, 2017, the morning after Mr. Trump’s inauguration. “We’re doing it his very first day in office because we are making a statement,” one organizer, Breanne Butler, said. “The marginalized groups you attacked during your campaign? We are here and we are watching. And, like, ‘Welcome to the White House.’ ” Since Election Day, there has been momentum around supporting groups that are opposed to Mr. Trump’s espoused views on women and minority groups. Nonprofit organizations, including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, have reported a surge in donations after the election. But the election taught Americans that women are deeply divided along party lines, education level and race: 53 percent of white women voted for Mr. Trump, according to exit poll data. On the march group’s Facebook page, it is easy to see how complicated the idea of the “women’s vote,” an already mythological concept, has become, and how difficult it might be for organizers to fulfill their aim of gathering women who remain fiercely divided on reproductive rights, gun control,   marriage and immigration, among other issues. Not everyone on the page believes, for instance, that Hillary Clinton would have made a good president, or that Stephen K. Bannon, a chief strategist under Mr. Trump, holds divisive views about minorities. Debates over both have sprung up in recent days. Bob Bland, one of the march organizers, said in an email that organizers in Maryland had to change a Facebook page from public to private to protect the safety of women who want to attend. Evvie Harmon, a yoga teacher from Greenville, S. C. who is helping   efforts to organize for the march, said the group had nixed a possible idea for a slogan  —   “Human rights are women’s rights, and women’s rights are human rights”  —   because it was something that Mrs. Clinton once said. “This is not an   protest,” Ms. Harmon said. “This is the reaction of women and minorities across the world who are very disturbed by the rhetoric that was said over the last year and a half. ” Aside from dueling political views, organizers are trying to take feedback from a cacophony of voices in real time as they try to assemble a network of state volunteers, plan programming and arrange transportation and lodging for the event. Ms. Butler, a chef who is organizing the event in her spare time, said the march had no official means of funding yet. There are women on the page who have said that the march is not inclusive enough, and that they don’t want an event organized by white women. Ms. Butler acknowledged the criticism but stressed that the women who are organizing are from different racial and religious backgrounds. (There was even controversy over the original name: Organizers have changed the name from Million Woman March to the Women’s March on Washington because observers took issue with the fact that the original name echoed a black women’s march held in Philadelphia in 1997.) Ms. Butler, 27, said the greater concern would be helping local groups raise money to help women who can’t afford to travel to Washington. “The reality is that it’s incredibly expensive to fly to D. C. on inauguration weekend,” Ms. Butler said. “We don’t want only an   class of people at this march because no one else can afford to go. ” Tabitha St.   34, who plans to help sign up attendees by visiting churches, synagogues and community centers in New York City, said she had been working to include all types of people  —   including those who have not been on Facebook lately. “I am a woman of color and I am an immigrant,” said Ms. St.   who lives in Brooklyn. She said of the march: “For me, it has been completely inclusive. ” This is all plenty of pressure for a     movement without a concrete path to funding itself, but organizers are optimistic as they look ahead to January. According to Ms. Butler, the group’s request for a permit to march is still pending. On Friday, Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said in an email that the group’s request to march is one of at least 13 requests currently under review for areas the agency administers in the nation’s capital. Those also include rallies and demonstrations. Mr. Litterst said the Park Service was also reviewing five requests for official inauguration events.",0

638,‘Anti-Establishment’ Trump Plans to Appoint Goldman Sachs and George Soros Insiders,"Videos ‘Anti-Establishment’ Trump Plans to Appoint Goldman Sachs and George Soros Insiders “I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” Be Sociable, Share! Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. 
Contrary to his anti-establishment stance — which supporters readily boast as a viable alternative to Hillary Clinton — Donald Trump’s establishment roots run so deep, the billionaire real estate mogul plans to appoint a former Goldman Sachs partner and George Soros Fund manager as Secretary of the Treasury should he win the election. 
Steve Mnuchin came on board Trump’s campaign as finance chair in May, raising eyebrows of many who felt his 17-year history with Sachs — and affiliation with liberal globalist George Soros as an Investment Professional of Soros Fund Management — conflicted directly with the then-presumptive nominee’s conservative stance and criticisms of establishment politicians. 
“It is difficult to see how a second-generation Goldman Sachs partner would secure such a prominent position in an administration delivered by a populist wind,” Compass Point analyst Isaac Boltansky told Politico of Trump’s curious choice for Treasury Secretary. 
According to Fox Business Network , Trump’s confidence in winning the White House has fomented enough to begin picking Cabinet members, and besides the anomalous choice of Mnuchin for the Treasury, sources said he’s considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie for Attorney General and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for Homeland Security Secretary. 
Trump has, of course, expended great efforts in criticizing opponent Hillary Clinton’s deep ties to the banking and Wall Street elite; and prior to garnering the Republican nomination, extended that critique to competitor Ted Cruz, saying in one debate: 
“I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.” 
Zero Hedge noted when Trump hired the left-leaning hedge fund manager and financier as finance chair that Mnuchin had previously donated multiple times to various Democrats, including Barack Obama and none other than Hillary Clinton. 
Further substantiating his establishing banking insider status — the precise profile Trump claims publicly to loathe — Mnuchin worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, headed OneWest Bank prior to its purchase by CIT Group in 2015, and now sits on CIT’s board while also serving as chairman and chief executive of Dune Capital Management, a private investment firm with a focus on financing big-time Hollywood movies, like “Avatar.” 
If Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties don’t trouble Trump’s supporters enough, the hedge fund manager’s links to George Soros — an ardent Clinton fan — certainly will. 
In fact, in terms of opposition, Soros has spent billions influencing global politics by inserting his brand of leftism wherever possible — and earlier this year even pledged , with others, some $15 million specifically to mobilize Latinos and immigrants to defeat Donald Trump. 
“Steven is a professional at the highest level with an extensive and very successful financial background,” Trump said upon bringing Mnuchin into his campaign. “He brings unprecedented experience and expertise to a fundraising operation that will benefit the Republican Party and ultimately defeat Hillary Clinton.” 
Indeed, Trump’s campaign, quoted by the Daily Caller , said Mnuchin “has previously worked with Mr. Trump in a business capacity and brings his expertise in finance to what will be an extremely successful fundraising operation for the Republican Party.” 
While business dealings certainly bring ordinarily clashing personalities into contact on occasion, these details about the relationship between Trump and Mnuchin evidence the former’s links to the left. 
Despite the nominee’s many diatribes excoriating Hillary Clinton as out-of-touch with the American populace, Trump’s own status as a billionaire belies both their decades-old friendship and striking similarities — particularly as darlings of the establishment. 
Should you choose to vote on the 8th, it would be prudent to keep in mind blustery campaign rhetoric — from any politician — only constitutes so much hot air.

639,Do Cholesterol Drugs Have Men By Their Gonads?,"Statins my disrupt vascular function On the Greenmedinfo.com Statin Research database we have cataloged over 15 studies from the National Library of Medicine indicating the heart-damaging properties of this class of supposedly ‘heart friendly’ drugs. View our professional data page here , or if you are not a member, view the open access reference page for public view and linking here . Statins do not only reduce lipoprotein production but have so-called pleoitropic properties, which include immune system down-regulating and anti-inflammatory properties, which is why they are believed to have a small benefit in reducing the inflammatory burden caused by autoimmune processes in the artery that can precipitate myocardial infarction (heart attack) in some individuals — but not without having the unintended, adverse effect of increasing cancer risk (at all sites) and contributing to congestive heart failure, effectively cancelling out the small, mostly theoretical benefit of reduced heart attack risk. For instance, it has been estimated that “…at least 23,000 low-risk people would have to take statins for five years to prevent one death from heart disease.” [ Source ] Statins are also clearly diabetogenic , increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes by about 50% in some populations , with the FDA now requiring drug manufacturers to include a warning of diabetes risk on statin drug labels . Considering morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes is caused not by the elevated blood sugar in and of itself, but the damage glycated sugar does to the vascular system and the subsequent cardiovascular harm it produces, the case against using statins for primary and secondary prevention of heart disease seems clear as day. Moreover, cardiovascular harm is not the only concern. Statin drugs have been linked to over 300 adverse health effects. We issued a consumer alert on the topic several years ago . For the more technically minded, here is the database page on Statin drugs listing 300+ adverse health effects based on 465 published studies. Heart Disease Is Not Caused By A Lack of A Drug Should we be surprised to find so much research on this drug class’s adverse health effects? After all, cholesterol is fundamental for the health of each cell in the human body, and low cholesterol has been found to cause a wide range of health problems , including psychiatric states such as violence against self and other. The food and drug industries have used cholesterol phobia to manipulate health professionals and the lay public into believing that the cause of heart disease is genetic, and can only be addressed through the use of synthetic, patented, essentially toxic chemicals, i.e. pharmaceuticals, or eating semi-synthetic ‘low fat,’‘low cholesterol’ foods with very little nutritional value. This latest study speaks to why we must exercise the precautionary principle when considering taking a patented chemical – technically a xenobiotic alien to human physiology – for suppressing a symptom of a much deeper and more complex problem. While oxidized cholesterol forms a significant part of the problem of atherosclerotic build-up in the arteries, it is not the primary cause of the damage to the inner lining of the arteries (endothelium), and the pre-existing endothelial dysfunction that can go on for many decades silently in the background. Ox-LDL deposits in atheromatous lesions have been viewed as an epiphenomenon, generated as part of a cascade of immune-mediated events the body activates in order to attempt to heal arterial damage. In certain respects, cholesterol deposits in the arteries at the site of damage can be likened to a Band-Aid. Do we blame the Band-Aid for causing the injury upon which it is placed? It is important to point out that oxidized cholesterol (ox-LDL) can be toxic and harmful to the vascular system, but the problem with modern blood testing for ‘cholesterol’ is that it does not take into the quality of the lipoproteins, only their quantitative dimensions. Depending on one’s diet, environmental factors, and overall bodily health, LDL particles will oxidize at different rates. If you are eating an antioxidant rich diet, full of healthy fats, phytocompounds, etc., your properly functioning LDL will be less susceptible to conversion to ox-LDL. On the other hand, eating a diet full of non-essential, oxidized fats, deficient in phytonutrients, antioxidants, etc. – and adding in environmental toxins and toxicants, e.g. smoking – will produce more ox-LDL, rendering it artherogenic. Obviously, therefore, diet and lifestyle form the basis for a sound preventive approach if the ‘ lipid hypothesis ‘ of cardiovascular disease is even deemed truly relevant. [For more research on natural substances which inhibit cholesterol oxidation, view our database on the topic: Prevent Cholesterol Oxidation .] Furthermore, there are many ways to address underlying vascular pathologies without suppressing the production of a vital building block and signaling molecule, which is what cholesterol is. Pomegranate , chocolate , and many other natural substances, have been confirmed in research to have profound heart disease preventive and reversing properties . You can explore our database sections relevant to the topic within our Heart Health guide , to find hundreds of studies proving this point. Basic nutritional incompatibilities, including the consumption of wheat which has cardiotoxic properties in genetically susceptible individuals, and excessive consumption of omega-6 versus omega-3 fats can profoundly increase the risk of heart disease. One groundbreaking study published last year, in fact, indicates that statins actually reduce the health benefits of omega-3 fats in the diet – adding another mechanism by which statin drugs exert heart disease promoting effects . Beyond the Pharmaceutically-Driven Medical Paradigm If statin drugs are toxic to human sperm, and if the men within whom this statin-induced damage is occurring are of reproductive age, the implications of this latest study on statins and fertility are potentially devastating to the health of future generations. Changes in our species germlines – sperm or egg – are carried on to future generations, possibly forever. With recent research indicating that even changes to somatic cells in this lifetime are capable of transferring information to the sperm , what we do here and now – our chemical exposures, our nutritional status, and even our psychospiritual and mental orientation (which gear into real physiological and genetic/epigenetic processes – can have critical and irreversible affects on our offspring. Clearly, the time has come both to re-evaluate the role of pharmaceuticals in ‘preventive’ health care, as well as the effects these novel new chemical compounds will have on the next generation, and the next. For alternatives to lipid lowering chemicals, take a look at the following, evidence-based natural interventions:",0

641,"California Today: In Virtual Reality, Investigating the Trayvon Martin Case - The New York Times","Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Peña combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Peña, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called “One Dark Night,” was recently shown at Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. “This is immersive journalism,” she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Peña by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. “One Dark Night” is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I’m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it’s meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I’ve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman’s position. We’re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what’s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

Years of drought put a damper on the foraging of fungus in the state’s forests, a hobby that has burgeoned with the growing popularity of fresh, local food. Amateur clubs up and down the state are organized around both the culinary and scientific celebration of California’s many mushroom species. As the rainfall began to surge last October, so did the autumn mushrooms, said Debbie Viess, a   of the Bay Area Mycological Society. “We had a tremendous year for porcinis,” she said, “and it’s been a really good year for chanterelles too. ” Even with the continuing rain, several mushroom experts were wary about making predictions for the spring season, when popular morel mushrooms are normally abundant. While water is necessary, it isn’t sufficient, said Patrick Hamilton, a longtime mushroom picker in Sonoma County. “There are so many things, from soil conditions, to climatic conditions, to the age of the trees, all these things are difficult to understand,” he said.

642,"Nearly 8 Decades Later, an Apology for a Lynching in Georgia - The New York Times","LaGRANGE, Ga.  —   Some people here had never heard about the lynching of Austin Callaway  —   about how, almost 77 years ago, he was dragged out of a jail cell by a band of masked white men, then shot and left for dead. Some people never forgot. But on Thursday evening, the fatal cruelties inflicted upon Mr. Callaway  —   long obscured by time, fear, professional malfeasance and a reluctance to investigate the sins of the past  —   were acknowledged in this city of 31, 000 people when LaGrange’s police chief, Louis M. Dekmar, who is white, issued a rare apology for a Southern lynching. “I sincerely regret and denounce the role our Police Department played in Austin’s lynching, both through our action and our inaction,” Chief Dekmar told a crowd at a traditionally   church. “And for that, I’m profoundly sorry. It should never have happened. ” He also said that all citizens had the right to expect that their police department “be honest, decent, unbiased and ethical. ” “In Austin’s case, and in many like his, those were not the police department values he experienced,” he said. The apology for the Sept. 8, 1940, killing is part of a renewed push across the American South to acknowledge the brutal mob violence that was used to enforce the system of racial segregation after Reconstruction: In a 2015 study, the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala. documented 4, 075 of what it called the “racial terror lynchings” of blacks by white mobs in 12 Southern states from 1877 to 1950. The group has begun construction of a memorial to lynching victims in Montgomery, which could open by March 2018. To Chief Dekmar, however, the apology in the town he has called home since 1995 is about more than righting history’s wrongs. It is also an effort, in the age of the Black Lives Matter movement, to address some of the deepest roots of minority mistrust in the police, and create a better working relationship between officers and the community. “It became clear that something needed to be done to recognize that some things we did in the past are a burden still carried by officers today,” Chief Dekmar said in a recent phone interview. “Institutions are made up of people, and relationships go like this: Before you trust somebody, you need to know that they know that they did you wrong, and that you’re stepping up and apologizing for it. ” Chief Dekmar, 61, a New Jersey native raised in Oregon, embraces a view of law enforcement that extends beyond the narrow goals of protecting the good and locking up the bad. He tends to speak about his department as one organ of a broader social body, though one that is perhaps more exposed than others to its ills. He leads regular meetings of a “community outreach committee” in which he shares with other civic leaders what his officers see on the streets  —   homelessness, juvenile delinquency, children with learning and literacy issues  —   and looks for ways that various   entities might work together to solve them. He has also sought to address trust issues: The department, he said, has mandated the use of body cameras on officers for the last five years. The chief became familiar with the lynching of Mr. Callaway only about two or three years ago, when one of his officers overheard two older   women who were looking at old photos of the LaGrange police on display at the headquarters building. One woman said to the other, “They killed our people. ” Chief Dekmar began researching the episode but found, he said, only “sketchy reports”  —   there was “no investigation I could find, no arrest, no   by the media. ” Indeed, the details of the crime appear to have been deliberately obscured for the   residents of LaGrange. Then, in 2014, Jason M. McGraw, a student at the Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, wrote a research paper about the lynching. He noted that while newspapers around the country had reported that a band of masked whites had abducted Mr. Callaway, the local paper, The LaGrange Daily News, wrote only that Mr. Callaway had died “as a result of bullets fired by an unknown person or group of individuals. ” The paper’s headline on the Sept. 9, 1940, article declared, “Negro Succumbs to Shot Wounds. ” Mr. Callaway is generally believed to have been 16 or 18 years old on Sept. 7, the day he was arrested and charged with trying to assault a white woman. According to Mr. McGraw’s research, six white men arrived at the jail that night with at least one gun, forced the jailer to open the cell and forced Mr. Callaway into a car. He was driven to a spot eight miles away and shot in the head and arms. He was later found by a roadside and taken to a hospital, where he died. Mr. McGraw noted that the investigation of Mr. Callaway’s death fell to the town’s police chief, J. E. Matthews, and the Troup County sheriff, E. V. Hillyer, but that an investigative report was never made public. Chief Dekmar has learned that generations of   were well aware of what happened. “There are relatives here and people who still remember,” he said. “Even if those people are not still alive, down through the generations, that memory is still alive. That’s a burden that officers carry. ” As Chief Dekmar learned more about the case, he decided that something must be done to acknowledge it. The city he has sworn to protect is less than 70 miles southwest of Atlanta. Before the Civil War, LaGrange was a wealthy hub in Georgia’s cotton kingdom: Troup County, of which LaGrange is the seat, had the state’s   number of slaves. Today, according to recent census figures, the city is about 48 percent black and 45 percent white. A Kia plant in nearby West Point, Ga. suggests an economic future for the area beyond the textile industry that once sustained it. But nearly one in three LaGrange residents live in poverty. Residents say race relations here, as in many multicultural American communities, run the gamut from friendly to frayed, depending on the day and the issue. When LaGrange College, a private liberal arts school in town, announced that it had invited Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, to speak at a Martin Luther King Jr. event scheduled for Thursday, protests poured in, in part because Mr. Lewis had questioned the legitimacy of President Donald J. Trump. On Thursday, some businesses around town bore signs promoting Mr. Lewis’s appearance, while some homes featured   signs declaring “Back the Blue. ” For the last two years or so, city and county residents, including Chief Dekmar, have been engaged in a program of racial reconciliation and racial  . At a monthly meeting this summer, Chief Dekmar approached the president of the county N. A. A. C. P. chapter, Ernest Ward, and asked if he would help set up a public apology for the lynching. Mr. Ward served on the police force for nearly two decades starting in the  . He acknowledged that some of his fellow black residents harbored an    attitude toward the police. “I lost many friends when I became a police officer,” he said, “because they felt that I sold out. ” He was asked how much the apology would help with    police work. “I believe it’s a start,” he said. “And it’s helped me to have a newfound respect for Chief Dekmar. ” “Historically certain people in the white race don’t like to bring up the past when it may not show a good light on their ancestors,” Mr. Ward said. “And so they would prefer to keep things hidden. ” Chief Dekmar issued his apology to relatives of Mr. Callaway on Thursday night at Warren Temple United Methodist Church here. The month after the shooting, Mr. McGraw noted, a church minister named L. W. Strickland wrote to Thurgood Marshall, the future Supreme Court justice who was then a lawyer for the N. A. A. C. P. telling him that the local branch of the rights group had asked the authorities to look into the case, but that “nothing is being done  —   not even acknowledgment of our requests. ” Some white LaGrange residents said on Thursday that they were deeply skeptical about whether the apology would have any practical effect. They noted that the crime took place before most people here were even born. “I don’t care if they apologize or don’t,” said Jessie East, 74, who works at a furniture and appliance shop. “It’s not going to change a thing that happened 77 years ago. ” But to others, including one of Mr. Callaway’s relatives, the apology was a step toward healing. “I speak your name, Austin Callaway, and ask God for forgiveness for the people that did this inhumane thing to you,” Deborah Tatum, a descendant of Mr. Callaway, told the congregation. “Some might say ‘forgiveness’? And I say to you that I believe God when he tells us that there is power and freedom in forgiveness. ”",0
643,Marcia Clark Finally Has a Moment to Savor at the Emmys - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   From the stars to the producers to the executives, no one involved with “The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story” seemed to realize the significance of where they were celebrating their triumphant Emmy night after the awards ceremony Sunday. They were all at an   at an event space called Vibiana, about two blocks from the courthouse where the Simpson case was tried. A couple of decades later, the case was recreated on this FX program, which won the Emmy for best limited series, capping a big night for the show. When the Fox executive Dana Walden heard about the proximity of the courthouse to the party, she said, “That just gave me chills,” a sentiment echoed by FX’s chief executive, John Landgraf, who called it “a little chilling. ” But there was one person who understood the odd coincidence of ending up back where it all started, after a circuitous and sometimes torturous route. “I know where I am,” Marcia Clark, the prosecutor in the Simpson case, said, a little gravely. She was sitting on a couch, inches away from the actress Sarah Paulson, who was holding the Emmy she won for portraying Ms. Clark. Ms. Clark, who was Ms. Paulson’s guest at the Emmys, said she couldn’t help but think about how near the courthouse was on the ride over from the ceremony. It was a bitter reminder for Ms. Clark, who was ridiculed in the news media in the    —   the perception being that she had blown the prosecution and let Mr. Simpson go free. She has found her public comeback only in the last year, after the explosive popularity of the series and the sympathetic portrayal from Ms. Paulson, who in her acceptance speech for her best actress award offered up a moving public apology to Ms. Clark. “The world saw me in sound bites,” Ms. Clark said. “Now I feel like I’m more understood. ” As Ryan Murphy, the prolific television producer who shepherded this show, put it: “The great story tonight is Marcia Clark finally won. ” And so did FX. At the Emmys, it’s usually an HBO night, and to a certain extent it was again: The premium cable channel won the best drama and comedy categories for a second consecutive year with “Game of Thrones” and “Veep. ” It also broke Comedy Central’s hold on the variety category, with a victory by John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight. ’’ But propelled by a category that FX is reinventing  —   the limited series  —   the network arguably stole the show, smashing the basic cable Emmy record by winning 18 awards over all. The previous record was eight awards. The FX show also won acting Emmys for Courtney B. Vance’s portrayal of the defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran and Sterling K. Brown’s depiction of another prosecutor, Christopher Darden. (Louie Anderson won his first Emmy for his role as the mother of Zach Galifianakis’s character in FX’s “Baskets. ”) Mr. Landgraf has said in the past that he feels like he has to play “Moneyball” to compete with his rivals. Last month, he said his budget was about a sixth the size of Netflix’s. (Netflix’s programming budget is about $6 billion, HBO’s is $3 billion, and FX’s is about $1 billion.) But despite that, FX outshined them on Sunday. The success of the O. J. show wasn’t a sure thing. For decades, Hollywood did everything it could to stay away from the Bronco chase, Judge Lance A. Ito and the trial, in what proved to be a divisive national episode. “Like most things, it’s a   in retrospect, but it wasn’t at the time,” said Brad Simpson, a producer of the show, with his Emmy in hand. “There was such a heavy saturation of O. J. that nobody wanted to hear about it again. When we announced the show, all the comments were, ‘Oh lord, don’t put the country through this again.’ But the show touched on things that obsesses America: class, race, the criminal justice system. ” By turning it into a limited series, which requires a relatively easy time commitment, FX was able to attract actors including John Travolta, Cuba Gooding Jr. and David Schwimmer. (All were nominated for awards on Sunday night.) And though the Academy Awards have been criticized for their   lineup of acting nominees, the Emmys have done better with diversity: Three   won acting awards on Sunday, including Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown from “The People v. O. J. Simpson. ” “Actors and directors follow the writing,” Mr. Vance said at the party. “The writers in TV are writing for different hues of color. Hopefully the movies start to see that if you want to get the people, you better do the writing. ” Mr. Murphy, the producer, has been a regular at the Emmys (he’s the man behind shows including “Glee,” “ ” and “American Horror Story”) and he said that between the diversity onstage and the large number of   winners, Sunday night’s ceremony represented “a sea change. ” “I feel like sometimes you go to those award shows, and there are some people who win over and over again, but it wasn’t that type of night,” he said. “The Television Academy and the voters have moved onto a different feeling, a different embrace, and it felt good. ” There was arguably nobody who benefited more on Sunday night than Ms. Clark. Though Ms. Paulson was joined at the hip with Ms. Clark on Sunday, the two did not meet until late in production. They’ve become close since then, and Ms. Paulson provided one of the night’s stirring moments when she apologized to Ms. Clark during her acceptance speech, saying that the public in the 1990s was “superficial and careless. ” Ms. Clark seemed to be enjoying the rehabilitation of her reputation. “I think the benefit of this   was people got to see the fullness of everyone involved,” she said. “Not just me. Chris Darden, too. Everyone. As well as the historical context. I think everybody got more of what was going on, more than they did ever before. ” For two hours, Ms. Clark and Ms. Paulson sat cozily in a corner near Mr. Murphy and the “Narcos” star Pedro Pascal. At a little before midnight, Ms. Paulson got up to leave with Ms. Clark. As they walked through a courtyard, a group of young women were gawking at them, but they weren’t interested in the one holding the Emmy. “Oh my God, that’s Marcia Clark!” one woman said. Ms. Clark heard it, looked over, pointed triumphantly and waved. She walked out of the party and toward an S. U. V. with Ms. Paulson, and just a few blocks away from her first brush with fame, Ms. Clark finally had her Hollywood ending.",0
644,"In ‘Brexit’ Speech, Theresa May Outlines Clean Break for U.K. - The New York Times","LONDON  —   “Get on with it. ” With those words late in a major speech on Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May charted Britain’s course toward a clean break with the European Union and expressed her fondest hope: that the time for “division and discord” is over. Her   speech outlined what promised to be a hugely complex,   negotiation, and it defined the broad objectives, but not the details, of British withdrawal. “The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, and my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do,” she said. With the address, Mrs. May began the jockeying that will lead to a break after more than four decades of tight integration, and define Britain’s relations with its neighbors for decades to come. She confirmed that Britain is determined to regain control of migration from the European Union and rejected the supremacy of the European Court of Justice. That stance is anathema to the European Union, which has made the free movement of people  —   as well as goods, capital and services  —   a bedrock principle and which relies on the court to arbitrate. “Let me be clear,” Mrs. May said, acknowledging the differences. “What I am proposing cannot mean remaining in the single market. ” She said that she hoped to complete a final deal with the European Union by March 2019 and that it would be voted on by both houses of Parliament. She was not clear about what would happen if Parliament rejected the deal, though some speculated that a rejection would result in the sort of chaotic, “cliff edge” breakup that she and Britain’s bankers and business leaders hoped to avoid. Mrs. May struck a diplomatic note, including an appeal for a new partnership with Continental Europe, but not at all costs. “We seek a new and equal partnership  —   between an independent,   global Britain and our friends and allies in the E. U.,” Mrs. May said. “Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out. ” And she appealed to Britons, especially to those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to unite behind the government and stop refighting the referendum that backed leaving the bloc, which she had opposed. The reaction among her opponents in the “remain” camp was predictably harsh and seemed to herald a long and bruising process. “Theresa May has confirmed Britain is heading for a hard Brexit,” said Tim Farron, the leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats. “She claimed people voted to leave the single market. They didn’t. She has made the choice to do massive damage to the British economy. ” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the Tories of turning Britain into “a   tax haven,” with their recent threat to slash corporate taxes if a good deal cannot be reached with the European Union. The speech, which provided some degree of substance, gained a warmer reception in the markets, with the pound seeming to stabilize after several jittery days. It rose as much as 1 percent against the dollar during her speech, while stocks on the London exchange fell. Supporters of a withdrawal have been encouraged as well by reports that other countries in the bloc have recognized that they might suffer if there was a complete rupture and they were denied access to London’s financial services sector. But British businesses remained nervous. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobbying group, welcomed the greater clarity provided by Mrs. May but worried that “ruling out membership of the single market has reduced options for maintaining a   trading relationship between the U. K. and the E. U. ” Kallum Pickering, senior Britain economist at Berenberg Bank in London, was more blunt, writing in an analysis that “as we do not expect the E. U. to compromise its principles, the U. K. is set to face significant economic consequences from Brexit. ” Few analysts expect the negotiations to go as smoothly or as quickly as Mrs. May seemed to say in her speech. In recognition of the troubles that may lie ahead, Mark Boleat, the policy chairman for the City of London Corporation, the heart of Britain’s financial services industry, urged Mrs. May to swiftly secure a transition deal that would provide the certainty that businesses crave. Charles Brasted, a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm, cautioned that the deal Mrs. May wanted was likely to be seen by the European Union as “precisely the cherry picking that they have warned against. ” He added: “The objectives are now clear. The path towards them is uncharted. ” But he warned that “every one of the aspirations expressed by the U. K. government today will demand exceptional political skill to negotiate and will be complex to implement legally and commercially. ” In Europe, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said on Twitter: “Sad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. ” Germany’s foreign minister,   Steinmeier, welcomed Mrs. May’s “desire for a positive and constructive partnership, a friendship with a strong E. U.,” which Germany would reciprocate. Mrs. May’s speech, delivered in the grand surroundings of Lancaster House in London, was the most closely watched statement on European policy since January 2013, when the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, promised to hold a referendum on European Union membership. The prospect that Britain would remain part of the single market has been fading since Mrs. May said in October that she would demand complete control of migration from the European Union and release from the European Court of Justice. The extent to which Mrs. May would be willing to compromise to maintain some access to the single market and to the customs union for goods was less clear. Membership in the customs union limits the ability of member countries to strike individual   deals with   nations. So she said she wanted a deal that would allow Britain to trade freely with the world, but still have as much   trade as possible with European Union countries. Ideally, Britain would like to have its cake and eat it, in the memorable phrase of the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. In other words, Britain would reject what it disliked about the bloc, like freedom of movement, but keep trade unencumbered as it tried to get the best possible trading deal consistent with its other objectives. While European nations are expected to be stingy with market access, Mr. Pickering says he believes they will eventually bend. In the final deal, he wrote, he still expects Britain and the European Union to agree to a deal in which “the U. K. maintains a good level of access to the E. U.’s goods markets and limited access to the   services markets. ” “Crucially, we expect the U. K. to lose its E. U. financial services passport,” Mr. Pickering wrote, referring to a system that allowed banks based in Britain to offer financial services throughout the bloc. “This follows from the U. K. raising some modest barriers to migration from the E. U. ” Many European Union countries have backed taking a hard line against Britain to send a message to other member states that might consider leaving. Anticipating that, Mrs. May said that Britain wanted a successful European Union and a friendly partnership, but that “no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain. ”",0
645,A Man Who Hated Black Men Found a Victim Who Cared for Others - The New York Times,"Since he was a boy he has hated black men. A bitter hatred of black men that boiled in his mind and consumed him. Then last week, apparently, he decided to kill them. This was the   investigators say they gathered of James Harris Jackson, a morose and seemingly directionless    white man who lived in Baltimore and had been having trouble getting rooted since leaving the Army. He had registered few obvious traces of who he was and what he stood for. Those who intersected with him found him to be a disagreeable and solitary figure who waved away contact with others. By all accounts, Timothy Caughman, 66, was a benevolent man content with an unassuming life. He lived in a former single room occupancy residence that had been his longtime home. The son of a home health care aide and a pastor, he had worked in antipoverty programs in Queens. Religion and philosophy were constants in his conversations over unhurried meals of turkey bacon and grits at local diners. In recent years, he had caught the familiar New York infatuation with celebrities and delighted in collecting their autographs and pictures. On St. Patrick’s Day, Mr. Jackson boarded a bus in Washington and rode it to New York. There were black men everywhere, and he told investigators he contemplated going elsewhere, but settled on New York because of the flood of media there. His goal was to draw the widest possible attention to his murderous plan. He made his statement of what hate looks like late on Monday night when the authorities said he pulled out a sword and fatally stabbed Mr. Caughman. He had been scavenging for cans in Midtown Manhattan around the corner from his home. Presumably, Mr. Jackson had little intention of getting away with it. Just after midnight on Wednesday, he surrendered to the police and took responsibility for the murder. He was arraigned on Thursday in Supreme Court in Manhattan and charged with   murder as a hate crime. He was ordered held without bail. The attack comes at a particularly anxious moment in America as hate crimes are on the rise in the country and especially in New York City. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo forcefully condemned the killing. At the arraignment, Joan Illuzzi, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Jackson was particularly offended by black men who were with white women. She told the judge that additional charges may be filed, including murder in the first degree, “as this is an act, most likely, of terrorism. ” Dressed in a Tyvek suit, handcuffed and his legs in shackles, Mr. Jackson sneered several times as the charges were read. At one point, he gazed at the ceiling as though bored. He did not enter a plea. Sam Talkin, Mr. Jackson’s defense lawyer, declined to comment on the specifics of the case. “We just need for the dust to settle,” he said. If the information put forth by the authorities is accurate, he added, they will have to deal with Mr. Jackson’s “obvious psychological issues. ” The investigation into Mr. Jackson is still in its early stages and much remains unknown. But pieces of his life  —   and of the man he is accused of killing  —   were beginning to come together. Thus far, investigators have not linked Mr. Jackson to any white supremacy or hate group. Their sense is that he’s a discontent, not unlike many others who carry out senseless killings. But he was blunt about his prejudices when questioned by detectives. According to a law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity since the investigation is continuing, “He told the cops, ‘I’ve hated black men since I was a kid. I’ve had these feelings since I was a young person. I hate black men. ’” Mr. Jackson told detectives, according to the official, that his intention was to keep on killing, the first attack being a springboard. At one point during his interrogation, he said he thought about grabbing a police officer’s gun and using it to shoot others. Investigators have not yet determined the origins of this hate. Mr. Jackson told them that he had written his beliefs down and was going to deliver his writings to The New York Times. “He said, ‘Listen, I wrote this all down, it’s in my laptop,’” the law enforcement official said. He apparently grew up in Baltimore. In 2007, he graduated from the Friends School of Baltimore, a small and prestigious Quaker day school. Matt Micciche, the head of school, said the campus community was “shocked and saddened by the news of this horrific attack. ” “Our school  —   and the Religious Society of Friends  —   has a long history of commitment to diversity, racial equality, social justice and nonviolence,” Mr. Micciche said in a statement. “The entire Friends School community extends our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Timothy Caughman. ” In March 2009, Mr. Jackson joined the Army and served at various locations in the United States, working in military intelligence. He was deployed to Afghanistan between December 2010 and November 2011. Afterward, he was stationed in Baumholder, Germany, before being discharged in August 2012, when his rank was specialist. During his service, the Army said, he received several awards. It’s unclear what he did after leaving the Army, though he seemed lost. In the spring of 2015, he was nearly evicted from an apartment building in Baltimore’s Mount Vernon neighborhood for falling behind on his rent, according to Marcus Dagan, who was filling in then as the building’s manager. Speaking by phone from Omaha, where he now lives, Mr. Dagan said Mr. Jackson occupied a   apartment and was at least six months in arrears. Mr. Dagan described him as a “slob” and a “deadbeat,” who refused to let anyone inside his apartment and never engaged in the building’s social atmosphere. “He turned into the tenant from hell,” Mr. Dagan said. He began eviction proceedings, but Mr. Jackson left before they were completed. The apartment, Mr. Dagan said, was the most disgusting thing the person hired to clean it had ever seen. “He definitely had some issues of some kind,” Mr. Dagan said. “How do you describe it? He was off. ” Yet he said he had never heard Mr. Jackson say anything that could be construed as racist. “Never had an intimation of that,” he said. “When you shake hands with somebody you can guess the character,” he said. “In his case, you’d get like three fingers and a cold fish. ” Mr. Jackson’s most recent address was a   house wedged into a narrow street lined with rowhouses in the Hampden neighborhood of Baltimore, just west of Johns Hopkins University, a historic area that is filled with restaurants and shops. No one answered the door at the home on Thursday. A patrol car from the Baltimore Police Department was posted outside. Members of Mr. Jackson’s family appeared to be together in his parents’ home in a gated community several miles away. On Thursday afternoon, his family issued a brief statement through a lawyer: “Our family is shocked, horrified and heartbroken by this tragedy. We extend our prayers and condolences to the family of Timothy Caughman. We have no further comments at this time and ask that our privacy be respected. ” After Mr. Jackson got to New York last Friday, he checked into the Hotel at Times Square on West 46th Street, using an assumed name. As far as the police know, he attacked no one else during those first days. As best they can tell, he was hunting. His weapon was a sword, and he carried two smaller knives. From surveillance cameras, investigators managed to track some of his movements, though there are gaps. In one video, he can be seen tailing a black man. When detectives questioned Mr. Jackson, they said he acknowledged zeroing in on that man but didn’t strike because there were too many people around. Late Monday evening, he found a target on a Midtown street corner. Timothy Caughman was bent over some garbage. Like many New Yorkers living spare lives in their retirement years, Mr. Caughman was once someone else, his identity not defined by empty pockets and a modest address. He was born in Jamaica, Queens, and grew up in a comfortable apartment in the South Jamaica Houses. One of his cousins said the family has roots in Georgia dating back to the 1700s when their ancestors were first brought to America as slaves. He was the son of Tula Caughman, a home health care aide for wealthy residents of nearby Jamaica Estates, and William Caughman, the pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church. Growing up, he was called Hard Rock, for he knew his way around a boxing ring  —   and a street fight. “He was known in the community as not to be someone who started a fight, but if you started it, he finished it,” said one of his cousins. According to Seth Peek, another cousin, Mr. Caughman earned an associate degree after attending college in Brooklyn and Staten Island. For several years in Queens, Mr. Caughman ran a division of the Neighborhood Youth Corps, a federal antipoverty program designed to provide   jobs to poor youths. “He probably gave out about two or three thousand jobs to people in the community,” said one of his cousins. He also freely contributed homespun advice on how to excel: “‘If you know that someone is going to be somewhere, and you want to meet them, you got to be there an hour early,’” the cousin recalled Mr. Caughman instructing him. Later, he held a succession of jobs, including as a concert promoter. He was particularly proud of booking an early gig by Earth Wind  Fire, before they attained fame, his cousin said. For the last 20 years, he lived in a room at the Barbour Hotel on West 36th Street that now houses formerly homeless people transitioning to permanent housing. Svein Jorgensen, the chief executive of Praxis Housing Initiatives, which manages the Barbour, said that of the   residents, Mr. Caughman was one of the few who were actually permanent tenants and not part of the transient program. In reports of the murder, Mr. Caughman was incorrectly assumed to be homeless. “He was an extremely gracious individual and respectful of his neighbors,” Mr. Jorgensen said. He read avidly, and mainly kept to himself. He was a recycler of redeemables, his currency for his modest wants. His relatives said he viewed this as an entrepreneurial undertaking, a way to keep active and help pay for his room. He did maintain a social media presence. He had a Twitter account, and in his profile he defined himself as a can and bottle recycler, autograph collector and a good businessman. He said he aspired to visit California. On his Twitter feed, sandwiched between posts about celebrity culture, are links to articles about preventing cholesterol in babies and others about autism, echoing his broad interests. Among those aware of his fandom is Shari Headley, an actress who most recently played a district attorney on Tyler Perry’s “The Haves and the  ” television soap opera. She held a live chat on Twitter every Tuesday, and she said Mr. Caughman rarely missed one. One day he requested a photo of her, and she mailed him an autographed photo. “What kind of world are we living in right now?” she said, overcome with emotion. “What a harmless guy. He spends his days just wanting to take pictures with celebrities. ” When Ms. Headley’s character on “The Haves and the  ” was killed off recently, she said Mr. Caughman was downcast, wishing it weren’t true. When her agent told her Mr. Caughman had been stabbed, she hoped the same thing. Late Monday evening, as Mr. Caughman rooted through trash on Ninth Avenue, near his home, a white man in a dark coat approached him from behind. He said nothing. The man withdrew a sword from beneath his coat. A woman heard commotion, but didn’t realize what was actually happening and she ran off. But she told detectives she heard Mr. Caughman say, “Why are you doing this? What are you doing?”",0
646,Michael Flynn Failed to Disclose Income From Russia-Linked Entities - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who was forced out of the job in February, failed to list payments from   entities on the first of two financial disclosure forms released Saturday by the Trump administration. The first form, which he signed in February, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any nongovernment compensation that exceeds $5, 000 “in a year. ” That list appears to include all of the work that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The   payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45, 000 speaking fee from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a   news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Mr. Flynn attended the network’s lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Flynn has faced fierce criticism for the Moscow speech and for his lobbying efforts for Turkey. But the work paid well, and the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1. 5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago. What Mr. Flynn, who spent most of his adult life earning a military officer’s salary, does not appear to possess is the kind of   investment portfolio enjoyed by most wealthy Americans, including the numerous millionaires and billionaires in the Trump administration. His form listed assets valued at $380, 000 and $800, 000, most of which is tied up in retirement funds. Mr. Flynn reported an income of $1. 37 million to $1. 47 million. The bulk  —   $827, 055  —   came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The rest included speaking fees and income earned for doing consulting work and sitting on corporate boards, such as that of Adobe Systems, which paid him $125, 250. The speaking fees, all of which were from 2016, ranged from about $10, 000 to about $22, 000. He gave talks to relatively     groups like the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce in Nebraska, but also to the David Horowitz Freedom Center in California, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an   hate group. It is unlikely that Mr. Flynn, who is seeking immunity from congressional and federal investigations into Russia’s meddling in the election, will match the same income this year. He shuttered the Flynn Intel Group at the end of 2016, and then was forced out of the White House in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December. The payments for lobbying work that Mr. Flynn did for the Turkish government  —   and did not disclose until March  —   were handled through the Flynn Intel Group, and are not listed separately on the disclosure forms. Mr. Flynn did not work directly for the Turkish government the firm that hired him, Inovo, is owned by a   businessman with links to leaders in Ankara and asked him to work on an issue important to the government.",0
647,US Supreme Court justice groped female lawyer in 1999: Report,"Society US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas 
A female lawyer has accused US Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexually assaulting her in 1999, a report says. 
Moira Smith, who works as a corporate lawyer with an Alaska energy company, said the judge made unwanted sexual advances on her during a dinner party when she was 23-year-old, the National Law Journal reported on Thursday. 
She said Thomas grabbed and squeezed her buttocks several times during the party in Falls Church, Virginia. 
“Justice Thomas touched me inappropriately and without my consent,” Smith said. 
“He groped me while I was setting the table, suggesting I should sit ‘right next to him,’” Smith said. 
“He was 5 or 6 inches down and he got a good handful and he kept squeezing me and pulling me close to him,” she stated, according to the journal. 
In a statement to the National Law Journal, Thomas, 68, dismissed the allegation as “preposterous”, saying that the incident “never happened."" 
Smith, currently vice president and general counsel at Enstar Natural Gas Co in Alaska, said she decided to speak out after hearing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's lewd comments about women. 
A 2005 video was released earlier this month by The Washington Post, in which Trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them. 
A number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them. 
Trump has called the allegations “slander and libel” and part of a “concerted, coordinated and vicious attack” by Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and the news media to undercut his campaign. Moira Smith said Justice Clarence Thomas groped her at her boss' dinner party when she was 23. 
""That willingness by men in power to take advantage of vulnerable women relies on an unspoken pact that the women will not speak up about it,"" Smith, now 41, told the journal. 
""Why? Because they are vulnerable. Because they are star-struck. Because they don't want to be whiners. Because they worry about their career if they do speak out. But silence no longer feels defensible; it feels complicit,” she stated. 
""As the mother of a young daughter and son, I am coming forward to show that it is important to stand up for yourself and tell the truth,"" Smith said. 
Thomas was nominated to the top court in 1991 by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Loading ...",0
648,Federal Judge Throws Out Convicted D.C. Sniper’s Four Life Sentences,"A federal judge threw out a convicted D. C. sniper’s four life sentences Friday because he was 17 when he was originally sentenced. [U. S. District Judge Raymond Jackson in Norfolk, Virginia, ruled that Lee Boyd Malvo has a right to be   in new sentencing hearings due to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that made it unconstitutional for juveniles to receive mandatory life sentences in prison without parole, the Daily Mail reported.  Malvo, now 32, was arrested in 2002 for his role in several shootings in the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia that left ten dead and injured three. The attacks were widely covered in U. S. and international media over concerns that the sniper attacks, which were carried out from a modified car trunk, were acts of terrorism. Malvo entered a guilty plea in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, and agreed to two sentences of life in prison without parole. A judge in Fairfax County, Virginia, also sentenced him to two additional life terms in Fairfax County. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional for courts to issue mandatory life sentences without parole to juvenile offenders. The Supreme Court further ruled in 2016 that the 2012 ruling could be applied retroactively to all sentences before the 2012 ruling. Jackson, as a result of these two rulings, threw out the four life sentences and ordered that Malvo be   in the counties of Fairfax and Spotsylvania. The Virginia attorney general, however, can appeal Jackson’s ruling, according to Fairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh, who prosecuted Malvo in 2003. The Virginia Attorney General’s Office is “reviewing the decision and will do everything possible, including a possible appeal, to make sure this convicted mass murderer serves the life sentences that were originally imposed,” Michael Kelly, a spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, said Friday. Kelly added that Malvo could still be   to life in prison based on the convictions even if he is granted a new sentencing hearing. Defense lawyers for Malvo, however, have argued that he was an adolescent who did not know any better and was influenced by his older accomplice, John Allen Muhammad, USA Today reported. They remain hopeful that these new court hearings might give him a shot at parole. The Washington Post reported that Jackson’s ruling does not apply to Malvo’s six life sentences in Maryland that he received after pleading guilty to six counts of murder there, but Malvo’s Maryland lawyers are trying to appeal his convictions based on the Supreme Court rulings at the state and county levels. A hearing is set for June in that state.",0
649,"Donald Trump, Obama, Thanksgiving: Your Weekend Briefing - The New York Times","Here are the week’s top stories, and a look ahead. 1.   Donald Trump filled some top national security posts last week, naming loyalists who reflect his campaign’s   views. His choice for attorney general is Senator Jeff Sessions, above, who was blocked from becoming a federal judge in 1986 because of accusations of racially charged remarks. Michael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who sees Islamic militancy as an existential threat, will be national security adviser. Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas was nominated to be the director of the C. I. A. Here’s our latest coverage of Mr. Trump’s transition to the White House. ____ 2. “Build something  . Something Americans can be proud of. ” That’s our   columnist, urging Mr. Trump to follow a lofty vision for his pledged upgrade of the country’s aging infrastructure. We even have a list of 10 projects, balanced between red and blue states, where he could leave his mark while helping unify a bitterly divided America. ____ 3. In the days after the election, our reporters and photographers fanned out across the country as a new political reality set in. They returned with a portrait of a country at odds with itself. We’re also beginning a podcast of  conversations among siblings,   classmates and friends who voted for different candidates. “I could never believe you’re a racist, man, that’s silly, that’s stupid,” said one young black man to a friend of Hispanic heritage who supported Mr. Trump. “Can’t believe you’re sexist. Cannot. But part of me is puzzled. ” Here are 19 questions to ask loved ones who voted differently. ____ 4. President Obama will return to the United States on Monday after the last major foreign trip of his presidency, with stops in Greece, Germany and Peru. On Tuesday, he’ll give the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom to 21 recipients, including Kareem   Ellen DeGeneres, Tom Hanks and Bill and Melinda Gates. And on Wednesday he’ll pardon a turkey for the last time as president. ____ 5. Seventeen new cardinals received their “red hats” at a ceremony Saturday, officially joining the Roman Catholic Church’s College of Cardinals. Who Pope Francis selects for the college is critical to his efforts to reshape the church, as the group will eventually elect Francis’ successor. Three Americans are among the new additions, the most Francis named from any one country. And while U. S. politics is never a determining factor in who is selected, all three men have been outspoken opponents of Republican Party positions. ____ 6. In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began six years ago, the voices of torture victims and their loved ones are being heard. The   public hearings are an effort to salve the wounds from nearly 60 years of dictatorship. Mothers demanded justice for sons who were shot to death during the protests that ushered in democracy, and former prisoners described being tortured, humiliated and even forced to engage in homosexual acts. ____ 7. The skyline of New York City has changed drastically over the past decade. We’ve gathered a number of notable new buildings that you may recognize (like 1 World Trade Center) or may not (um, a salt shed? ). Think you know the city’s recent additions pretty well? Here’s a quiz to test your knowledge. It includes the hyperbolic paraboloid, or   pyramid, above. ____ 8. Scientists who drilled into what is considered ground zero of the dinosaur extinction found something that surprised them: granite. The drilling happened in the Gulf of Mexico, where some 66 million years ago an asteroid crashed into Earth with the energy of 100 million atomic bombs. It left behind a    scar known as the Chicxulub crater, shown in an artist’s rendering above. Their finding suggests that powerful impacts can catapult materials buried deep in a planet’s crust much closer to its surface. ____ 9. After  Thursday’s Thanksgiving turkey, people across America will head to big box stores and camp out in preparation for “doorbuster” deals to kick off Black Friday shopping. Ah, the holiday season. But whatever your shopping strategy is, there are some innovative ways to save a buck. Like triggering retailers to email you coupons by filling up a virtual shopping cart, then fully logging out of the site. Here are some other tips, and a guide to not overpaying on Black Friday. ____ 10. Finally, a story about Thanksgiving. Specifically, the story of a    homesick college student who made a traditional dinner for the first time in an icy cold dorm. The guests were five other kids who couldn’t get home. That was in 1981. “I wish I could remember if we had the sense to be grateful then, for the food, for the comfort of one another, for the luxury of our education,” she wrote recently.

651,The Crisis of the European Union Is Irreversible - Giancarlo Elia Valori,"Taming the corporate media beast The Crisis of the European Union Is Irreversible 
The political-economic block and its common currency cannot be salvaged Donate! The author is an Italian industrialist and honorary member of the Academy of Science of the Institut de France 
According to a well-known Italian Research Centre, from 2003 to 2014 the European single currency cost an 11% GDP reduction throughout the Eurozone and 18 million additional unemployed people. Conversely, as a result of the Maastricht agreement only, throughout the Eurozone we have lost 8 million jobs and an additional 5% of Gross Domestic Product, owing to the obligation to eliminate deficit and cut investment. Furthermore, the report of said Research Centre shows that, again in late 2014, the average EU unemployment rate was approximately 11.6%. In a scenario of parity with the dollar, the EU unemployment in the Eurozone would have been 5.8%, more or less the same as the US rate in that phase. Hence a monetary policy characterized by an excessive overvaluation of the European currency blocked both exports and the internal market at the same time. Furthermore, it created the conditions for a deterioration of public budgets in terms of deficit and debt. In fact, again at the end of 2014, the Eurozone recorded a public deficit totalling 269 billions which, without the single currency, would even be turned into a surplus of 165 billion euro, with a difference equal to 445 billions. In terms of GDP percentage, the difference would be 4.1 points while, with specific reference to the Eurozone’s public debt, we would have had three trillion euro less. Only for Italy, as many as 400 billion public debt less. Working on this assumption, all current evils would have been avoided if there had not been the overvaluation of the euro against the dollar. There would have not been the massive impact of the financial crisis coming from the United States, at first with Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy on September 15, 2008 and later with the recurrent banking crises in Europe, which put a strain on the public finances of major European governments. Considering that all EU governments were accustomed to borrow huge sums directly from the banking system, we can imagine the effects of the financial and credit crisis on the various European countries’ budgets. It is worth recalling that the United States have never liked the euro – quite the reverse they have always considered it ""imaginative and useless"", as former President George Bush I stated in recently-published public papers. Reading between the lines of its official documents, the EU itself maintains that the financial crisis came from the United States and that it made serious mistakes. Also according to the EU official documents, the mistakes were allegedly the following: 1) too much attention focused on the public budget deficit on an yearly basis, without being too much worried about the public debt as a whole. According to European standards, the EU government submitted reduced annual budgets for obtaining EU funding - later obviously the public debt increased anyway and real trouble came. Also thanks to the EU operating logic, the naive myth that the crisis was not structural and could be managed with some cosmetic measures has led to the current decline. Said decline has been triggered off by the rapid growth of interest rates on the EU Southern countries’ public debt. 2) Again according to the EU papers, there has also been a lack of surveillance over competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances. This is not great news. However, there is always someone who benefits from the economic disharmonies – just to use the old terminology of the remarkable Italian philosopher Mario Calderoni - while others stand to lose as a result of them. There has never been a solidarity-based Europe during crises, but only in ""good times"". Therefore, in the losing countries, we recorded growing indebtedness of the private sector, not controlled owing to the myth of companies’ autonomy - and hence an increasing weakening of banks. The other EU ""winning"" countries took over the losers’ market shares. Again, instead of imposing draconian penalties which worsen the economic problems, we should have supported the weakest economies and the most unbalanced ones in terms of trade with the United States. The United States exported their mass of bad loans, disguised as new securities, to the European Union, the financial enemy that had dreamt of relegating the dollar to the rank of a Euro ancillary currency. There was also this geopolitical war within the crisis of the European currency. Moreover, the European Central Bank aimed at maintaining financial stability but, by statute, it could not buy public debt from other non-EU countries, as all issuing banks do. This is the main way in which central banks can nip in the bud speculative attempts against them. Furthermore, in Italy, as in other South Europe’s economies, foreign competition has kept wages at very low levels and, in dealing with competition for exports, our political and economic structure has only reduced the labour incomes almost to the level of the worst competitor. 3) Another EU public self-criticism is relating to the slow decision-making mechanism: the European establishment has interpreted the small shocks of the global crisis as isolated phenomena and not as a common geoeconomic problem. Hence the slow pace and often the ineffectiveness of the EU ""solutions"". And this faced with a ""market"" - if we may call it so - of investors who, as soon as they saw the crisis in the South, played a downward game or went away quickly. Good old days when the Treasury rightly bought the unsold debt securities at the Bank of Italy’s auctions. And, it is worth noting that, in so doing, it did not create inflation at all. Currently, however, markets are fast like jackals, which smell corpses, while States have been slow as marmots. This is the real problem of today’s politicians. States must increase their pace and be very quick and capable of understanding both adverse media and the political and military operations which are objectively dangerous for them. Moreover considering that, at the time, the public debt securities were held mostly by banks, their default was possible and easy to take place. Today there is a new crisis looming large on Europe, namely the crisis of non-performing loans: in Portugal, Italy and Spain, but also in some North European countries, the non-performing loans are worth over 540 billion euro. Hence shortly another European debt crisis will materialize. 4) Currently the European Union is basically a Gaullist-style ""Europe of States""– even though it strongly denies so. Hence the idea of ​creating the ""United States of Europe"" is extraordinary nonsense: the EU Member States are so different from one another, and with such a diversified economy, that these ""United States of Europe"" would create more contrasts internally than externally, namely with the United States of America, Russia and China. Not to mention that, with a view to becoming today’s USA, America had to undergo a wide civil war, whose echoes are not completely over even today. 5) Moreover, the united Europe - and I am talking about the Euro zone - will be increasingly entangled in an area of ​​structural deflation which condemns 'Italy, together with other less economically strong countries, to face an indefinite period of very low growth rates. On the contrary, the other North European countries will continue to grow and, above all, will not have to tackle the same problems we have, namely low wages and exports facing fierce competition, not protected by the Euro. 6) Hence what can be done? We must prepare for a slow but safe exit from the Euro, not waiting for the EU ""bureaucratic Caesarism"", as well as redefining and protecting our export area. Then we must use our credit instruments and debt securities as alternative currency, where possible – as well as use some well-disguised protectionism also vis-à-vis the EU itself. Finally, we must rethink our overall strategy, which we have never done. The economic crises are always geopolitical crises. Furthermore we must fund the companies’ technological upgrade projects with State funds, without waiting for the EU claims. Last but not least, we must put an end to young people’s ""brain drain"". It is true that, as some liberal-masochists maintain, the current professions’ market is global, but it is also true that the cost of their education and training has been borne by our State and our families.

The voting machines have decided who will be the next puppet figurehead of the Pax Americana deep state for the next four years. The circus is over and the peanut shells are being swept out of the stands. So what do we have to show for all of it? 
Well, I have some good news, some bad news, and some not-so-good news for you. Let’s start with the bad news. 
Apparently some people voted for Trump in the belief that he was some sort of anti-establishment truth-telling hero of the working class. I hate to be the one to disabuse you of this notion, so let’s just look at his transition team, his campaign team, the people who have already been tapped to be part of the new administration and the people who are being contacted for potential cabinet appointments.

655,11 Things To Let Go Of Before The New Year,"in: Special Interests , US News The new year is almost here and it’s often a time when we all start to think about what we want to change for the next year. I’ve never been much a fan of the whole cliche of changing because of the new year, but why not embrace it as a time where we can make change? Do a quick reflection right now. Do you feel like you have followed your dreams and passions this past year? Do you feel you got caught up in the stresses of life quite often? Did you feel judgement, negative self talk and anger were a big part of your days? Reflecting on how you’ve felt over your year and being honest with yourself about it gives you the chance to know how to adjust and move forward from this moment forward whether it be the new year or not. I’ve found in my own life that if I don’t pay attention to how I feel, what I create, what’s playing out in my life and take responsibility for it, it doesn’t change. It stays the same, I experience the same emotions or stagnant feelings, and I don’t move forward. But the moment I decide to take it into my own hands, I see how much I’m not a victim to what happens. 11 Things To Let Go of Before the New year 1. Stop all the negative self talk – It’s first because it’s probably one of the most important. The more we talk poorly about ourselves to ourselves or others, the more we disempower ourselves and empower all the things we wish to adjust about ourselves. Observe it, take note of it, and kick it. It’s not helping you. 2. Choose one bad eating habit and kick it! – Taking care of and fuelling your vessel is one of the most important things we can do in life to stay mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy. Pick one of your worst eating habits and aim to cut it out completely in 3 months. Whatever it might be, be honest with yourself and make it happen. Then take on the next bad eating habit in 3 months. 3. Let go of chasing ‘success’ – So often we put up goals or plans for ourselves yet have this tiny limited scope of what success is. Next thing you know we bring stress, worry and fear into the equation throughout the whole journey because we may not be totally in line to hit this pin prick point of what success looks like to us. Instead, do your best to take the steps needed to get to where you want to go, but let go of the lure of success and what it looks like and means. There’s no such thing as failure. (more) 4. Kick the idea that you cannot achieve or follow your dreams – So often we have our ideas of what we are excited or passionate about, but let it go because we think we can’t do it or because it’s unrealistic. Instead of believing every word of that, take ONE step. One step towards making your passion or your dreams happen. The one step will lead to the next and the next, but you have to take the first one. Plan out that first step and take it! 5. Let go of the idea that you should run from your problems – We often get into this mentality that we just need to “get over it.” In theory this sounds sorta good, you move on from things that happen in the past or something to that effect. But by just forgetting about it, did we really move on? No, it gets triggered again later or lies dormant as a resented event etc. Instead, let’s face our problems and truly move past them. Journal about it, talk to someone else about it. Put the cards on the table to someone who cares about you and who can help you move past it. Pick someone who will see the bigger picture and be honest with you. You have all it takes to move past what challenges you. 6. Stop comparing yourself to others – This is a big one. So often we are looking at others and using what they have, do or are to compare it against us and make up a story. This whole game can make us sad or feel down about ourselves or it can feed our ego in a big way. Let it go, respect everyone’s journey, including your own and stop the need to compare yourself to others. 7. Stop judging others – Judging other people can become a habit and an addiction. It’s like something we can’t stop doing sometimes! Take a moment the next time you judge someone and observe it. Ask yourself why you did it, how did it make you feel? Etc. Make a conscious effort to stop. (more) 8. Stop the blame game – Blaming and pointing fingers when it comes to our challenges or what happens to us doesn’t allow us to look at and observe how we might have created or aligned with an experience to help make it happen. I’m not saying there’s no such things others can do to hurt you, I’m simply saying take responsibility for how you feel and don’t even point blame, it doesn’t help us. 9. Stop worrying and trying so hard to fit in and be accepted – This is something far too many of us do just to save face and not be “the weird one.” The reality is, it’s more ‘weird’ to be a version of yourself that isn’t genuine or real simply because you want to be accepted by others. It’s a choice you can’t maintain forever and the longer it goes the more uncomfortable you will feel. Be you, accept yourself, be genuine and don’t try to make others do the same when. Let it happen. Trust. 10. Let go of the need to control everything – Sometimes we can’t take a step forward in anything because we don’t know all the answers or all the variables. This is our obsession with control sometimes. Yes, observe a situation and make the best choices available to you, but don’t worry so much about needing to control or know every detail about it. Learn to leave things up to trust and knowing that things will work out as they need to. This doesn’t mean be reckless, just that you don’t need to control every thing, person and detail. 11. Stop procrastinating – This one goes with everything on the list. Stop putting it all off. Whatever it may be. The changes listed above, the hobby you want to, the career you want to explore, or the thing you want to tell to someone important to you. Stop putting it off and just do it! Submit your review",0
656,Comment on MA police union posts pics of Hillary being arrested on Facebook by Dan,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn | 5 Comments 
Last Saturday, Oct. 29, the Medford Police Patrolmen’s Association (MPPA) of Medford, Massachusetts, posted 3 photos on its Facebook page of two Medford police officers seemingly arresting a person in a Hillary Clinton mask and orange prison clothes at the Halloween Fall Festival in Haines Square, West Medford. 
CBS Boston reports, Oct. 30, 2016, that the caption on the photos read: 
“Look who MPD grabbed at the Fall Festival in Haines Square today…” 
Another photo showed three Medford police officers posing with someone in a Donald Trump mask, with the caption, “Making America GREAT again in West Medford Square!!” 
By 8:15 pm that night, MPPA removed the posts from its Facebook page, with an apology in a statement from MPPA President Harry MacGilvray: 
“These were Halloween costumes. It was meant totally as a joke. I apologize if this offended anyone in any way. I never expected this sort of reaction. It was poor judgment on my part.” 
MacGilvray was one of the officers in the photos. LOL 
Fox25 WFXT reports that the police union removed the photos because of a flurry of negative Facebook comments from Hillary supporters, such as: 
Jennifer Popkin: “I can’t believe this unprofessional behavior. Police in uniform should not be espousing political beliefs, let alone the kind of irresponsible rhetoric coming from Donald Trump. Absolutely deplorable and also likely illegal under Section 23(b)(2)(ii) of the conflict of interest law.” 
Mike Piehl: “Trump goes on trial for fraud in November and child rape in December but YOU . . . .” 
Jeremy Thorpe: “This is illegal. I am screen-shotting this comment to demonstrate that you are deleting critical comments.” 
Katarina Dutton: “As a citizen of Medford, I am appalled by police making it clear that I, and so many others, are not welcome or safe here.” 
Tamar Amidon: “This is so shameful for Medford. I’m so glad I don’t live there now. I never thought of them being one of the bad apple bins.” 
That Popkin, Piehl, Thorpe, Dutton, Amidon, et al. are outraged by the Medford police Halloween prank but not in the least bothered by of Hillary Clinton’s criminal use of an unsecured email server, her utterly corrupt pay-for-play Clinton Foundation, and her abandoning four Americans to die in Benghazi, can only mean one thing:

657,Koch Brothers Secretly Allied w. George Soros for Hillary Clinton,"Posted on November 6, 2016 by Eric Zuesse. Eric Zuesse The leading financiers of the Republican Party, the Koch brothers, were exposed on November 4th by the great investigative journalist Lee Fang, as being solid supporters and heavy financiers of congressional candidates who have been leaders in expanding the U.S. military budget and moving America toward a police state (including militarization of the police). The leading financier of the Democratic Party, George Soros, has long been known to provide major financial backing for the most-neoconservative Democratic candidates, such as Hillary Clinton, who favor every possible military invasion and coup (and see this , for more on that). In fact, Soros was one of the top three financial backers (the other two were the U.S. government and the Netherlands government) for the television station in Ukraine that championed extermination of the people in Ukraine’s Donbass region, where the coup-imposed government, which he helped to install, is loathed . And also on the Ukrainian matter, the Kochs have championed the view that when considering whether Crimea should be part of Russia, or else part of Ukraine, or else entirely independent, the people who live there shouldn’t have any opportunity to vote on the matter, and they should instead be forced to be ‘Ukrainians’ , even if they loathe this post-coup Ukrainian governmen t. Soros and the Kochs insist that this Ukrainian government should be imposed upon Crimeans, regardless of what they want. In fact, Soros has proposed adding from 20 to 50 billion taxpayer dollars to the effort by the coup-imposed Ukrainian government’s military, in order for that government to achieve this conquest of Crimea (to restore it to Ukraine, to which it had been forcibly joined, by the Soviet dictator Khrushchev in 1954, after having been for hundreds of years a part of Russia — and to which Obama and the Kochs and Soros insist it belongs). Regarding the U.S. Presidential contest, the difference between the Kochs and Soros is that the Kochs in 2016 directed all of their political financing away from the Presidential contest altogether, so as to weaken Trump’s effort to beat Hillary, whereas Soros has devoted tens of millions of dollars to the financing of Hillary’s campaign and of PACS (such as this) that support Hillary against Trump. Hillary is supported by Kochs and the big oil-and-gas firms as well as by Soros and Wall Street. Virtually all of the U.S. aristocracy want Hillary Clinton to become President. Right after the nominating conventions, the Kochs withdrew their financial backing of the Republican ‘hawk’ U.S. Senatorial candidate Ron Johnson in Wisconsin because Johnson had just endorsed Trump . But afterwards, the Kochs — as Lee Fang noted — spent big on the campaigns of Ron Johnson and of other pro-Lockheed-Martin (etc.) Senators. To be pro ‘Defense’ industry, isn’t to be pro-U.S. defense, but instead to be pro-mega-corporate investors, and that’s something America’s entire aristocracy are, because they control all of the large U.S.-based corporations. Those corporations expand by the U.S. military having the might to enforce in foreign countries what their owners want — so that America’s State Department and USAID etc. can serve as spokespersons for, essentially, the billionaires who own controlling blocs of stock in U.S.-based international corporations. That’s “the system,” which Hillary Clinton and the Kochs and Soros and all the rest of the U.S. aristocracy support, and which Bernie Sanders opposed without understanding it. If Donald Trump understands it, he’s been keeping that fact secret from his followers, who generally understand nothing of it at all. Maybe if he were to try to explain it to them he’d be called ‘unpatriotic’ — even though his trying to explain it to them would actually be the deepest form of patriotism. Unfortunately, for him to be patriotic in that way would probably be politically suicidal for his campaign. He instead points to “foreigners” as being America’s enemies, when the real enemies are actually right at home in America — and they’re enemies of the entire world, not just their own country. These are the people at the top of the global food-chain. It’s not clear whether Trump feels mainly that he’s one of them, or instead that they’re his chief enemies. How much more ambiguous could a person be than that? And is the ambiguity intentional? The most reliable answer might be found by identifying whom his actual political enemies are — and they seem to be virtually all of the global aristocracy. Maybe they know him in ways that the U.S. public don’t and can’t. The public will just have to guess. But no guesses are necessary in order to understand Hillary Clinton. She has a lengthy record in public office, and it’s entirely consistent, as a neoconservative .",0
658,Trump Expands Search for His Secretary of State - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump is broadening the field of candidates for secretary of state as his transition team remains divided nearly a month after the election over how to fill the most prominent gap in his prospective cabinet. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters on Sunday that the search had expanded beyond the four men thought to be under consideration and that Mr. Trump planned to interview additional candidates early this week. Those new candidates appeared to include John R. Bolton, an ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush Jon M. Huntsman Jr. the former Utah governor and ambassador to China under President Obama Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia. Asked about the search on the ABC program “This Week,” Vice   Mike Pence mentioned Mr. Bolton as a potential candidate and said others could be added to the list. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. Trump for about an hour on Friday, and Mr. Tillerson is set to meet with Mr. Trump on Tuesday, according to two people briefed on the meetings. Despite their differences over the Iraq war, which Mr. Bolton ardently supported, Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he turned to Mr. Bolton for military advice and called him “a tough cookie. ” The transition team had previously signaled that the group under consideration had narrowed to four men: Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a close ally of Mr. Trump Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and David H. Petraeus, the retired general and director of the C. I. A. under President Obama. Some of those candidates may be brought back in for further interviews, the people briefed on the meetings said. An announcement of a selection for the post is not expected for at least several more days. In an audition of sorts, Mr. Petraeus appeared on “This Week” to highlight his foreign policy experience in the military and his work abroad in the private sector. He also sought to put behind him a potentially significant hurdle to his candidacy: his mishandling of classified material while he was a top general. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge in 2015 and was forced to resign as C. I. A. director. “Five years ago, I made a serious mistake,” Mr. Petraeus said. “I acknowledged it. I apologized for it. I paid a very heavy price for it, and I’ve learned from it. ” But he added that it was up to others to “determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not. ” The wrangling over who should be America’s top diplomat comes as Mr. Trump’s team continues to face questions about his   phone conversation with the president of Taiwan last week, which angered China and rattled other Asian nations. Mr. Bolton advocates closer ties with Taiwan as a means of putting pressure on China, arguing that Beijing’s growing power in the region should be checked. Mr. Trump’s advisers are battling, at times publicly, over whether he should choose from among his campaign loyalists or go outside that circle, a move that could alienate voters who were angry at the Republican establishment. Much of that wrangling has centered on Mr. Romney, who was among Mr. Trump’s fiercest critics during the campaign. Mr. Trump has told aides that he believes that Mr. Romney would “look the part” as the face of American outreach to the world and would make a fine secretary of state. But Ms. Conway, who has been openly critical of Mr. Romney, continued to attack him during a “Fox News Sunday” appearance, saying that the backlash to his candidacy among Mr. Trump’s core supporters had been “breathtaking. ” Asked if her criticism of him was appropriate, she said, “I would turn the question around and ask, was it appropriate for Governor Romney to stick his neck out so far in attacking Donald Trump, and never walking it back, never encouraging people to support the nominee once Mr. Trump had won the nomination squarely and fairly. ” Ms. Conway, answering questions from reporters about the expanded search as she entered Trump Tower in New York on Sunday, said the transition team had been happily surprised by the number of wealthy businesspeople who had come forward to express interest. Mr. Trump, who was lifted to victory in the election in large part by the support of white   voters, has faced criticism over his appointment of several   people to top posts. “There are a number of people that we may not have thought wanted to leave their very lucrative private industry positions to go and serve the government,” Ms. Conway said. “It’s exciting, frankly, to at least get their counsel. ” Another person who will meet this week with Mr. Trump is James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral whose name was floated as a potential running mate for Hillary Clinton. It was unclear if he was being considered for a specific position. Despite the very public    over the secretary of state appointment, Mr. Trump remains well ahead of the pace set by most of his predecessors in naming members of his cabinet. In addition to meetings this week, he is scheduled to travel at least twice, to Fayetteville, N. C. and to Des Moines, on his “thank you” tour. Mr. Petraeus spoke on the ABC program from the sideline of a conference in Germany, greeting the host, George Stephanopoulos, with a “guten tag” before beginning the interview. The retired general praised Mr. Trump as “actually quite pragmatic. ” He appeared careful not to contradict Mr. Trump on a range of his foreign policy priorities, including building a border wall between the United States and Mexico, potentially working with Russia to defeat the Islamic State, and discarding the Iran nuclear accord. “In our conversation, what I enjoyed, most frankly, was the discussion of issues, or, say, campaign rhetoric, if you will, and then placing that in a strategic context,” Mr. Petraeus said. Before he appeared on the show, Mr. Petraeus seemed to get a lift from Mr. Pence, who dismissed concerns about Mr. Petraeus’s mishandling of classified material, in which he gave secret materials to a biographer with whom he was having an affair. Mr. Pence called Mr. Petraeus an “American hero” and said Mr. Trump would consider him based on “the totality” of his career. “Look, he made mistakes, and he paid the consequences for those mistakes,” Mr. Pence said.",0
659,"Teacher To 11 yr Old: 'I Can't Wait Until Trump Is Elected,He's Going To Deport All You Muslims'","0 427 
“That’s going to be you,” the Academy of Excellence teacher allegedly warned a 12-year-old Muslim student after showing the class a movie about the 9/11 attacks. And if that sounds outrageous, brace yourself because it gets a lot worse. 
No wonder the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Arizona are siccing the U.S. Dept. of Justice and the U.S. Dept. of Education on this travesty of a public charter school and this shameful example of an educator’s sorry a**. Heather Weaver from the ACLU’s national office reports they’ve filed formal complaints on behalf of the Muslim student and his family. 
Asli Noor and her five children are refugees who settled in Phoenix, Arizona after fleeing Somalia. Like most parents, she wants opportunities and a good education for her children. And for many families — especially those living in low-income neighborhoods — that means a public charter school like the sadly misnamed “Excellence Academy.” 
The boy and his eight-year-old sister (referred to in the complaint as A.A. and F.A.) had started the 2015-2016 school year when the family’s new set of troubles began. 
According to the complaints, an “Academy of Excellence” teacher named Faye Myles began “singling out” the then 11-year-old, sixth grade Muslim student as the 2015-16 school year began for “disfavorable treatment because of his faith and nationality.” 
‘Another time, when A.A. raised his hand to answer a question, his teacher snapped at him — “All you Muslims think you are so smart” — in front of the entire class.’ 
Oh, and then the boy recalls the math and science teacher for grades 5-8 digressing into a special kind of lesson in civics and current events. 
‘I can’t wait until Trump is elected. He’s going to deport all you Muslims. Muslims shouldn’t be given visas. They’ll probably take away your visa and deport you. You’re going to be the next terrorist, I bet.’ 
Faye Myles also allegedly found other ways to wound her young Muslim student with her bigotry. She repeatedly denied him the right to pray during recess, which is hard to imagine ever happening to a Christian student. The child also claims his “Academy of Excellence” teacher would also would tell him to “shut up” and punish him during class “downtime” when the other students were allowed to talk with each other. 
The bus rides home added to the child’s misery as his classmates began to follow the teacher’s example and pile on the insults. 
‘On the bus ride home, A.A.’s classmates took up his teacher’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant crusade, taunting him about the fact that his visa would be revoked because he is a Muslim, calling him a “terrorist,” and accusing him of planning to blow up the bus.’ 
The child, of course, started feeling anxious and physically ill “with a stomach ache” and had no desire to return to the “Academy of Excellence.” 
In January, Asli Noor met with school officials to complain about these incidents. Three days later, the school asked her to pick her son up early because he had supposedly tried to open the school bus’ emergency window. Noor demanded they verify these accusations with footage from the security camera but school officials refused. 
And then Brenda Nelson, an “Academy of Excellence” board member, printed out two “voluntary” withdrawal forms for A.A. and his younger sister F.A. She then allegedly ordered Ms. Noor to sign them, saying: 
‘Get your kids out of here. I don’t want them here.’ 
When Asri Noor begged for time to find another school for her children, Brenda Nelson callously refused. 
Unfortunately, these incidents of anti-Muslim bigotry in publicly-funded schools are happening more frequently. Think Progress reports that even in schools where teachers try to fight it, Trump-inspired bullying is a serious issue. 
‘In spite of some teachers’ valiant efforts to teach students about Trump, it would appear that schoolchildren already invoke the candidate’s name to scare their Latino and Muslim classmates, referencing the candidate’s harsh claims of Latino criminals and Muslim terrorists.’ 
And, sadly, it’s not just the kids. 
‘A predominantly Latino elementary school in California was graffiti-tagged with the words “Build the wall higher” last week, alluding to Trump’s policy plan to build a southern U.S. border wall to keep out undocumented immigrants.’ 
And in case you assume the “Academy of Excellence” teacher is one of those mean white Trump supporters, you’re wrong. Apparently, she’s a mean black Trump supporter. @KhaledBeydoun The teacher works at Academy of Excellence & her name is Faye Myles per the article. She should be called out. pic.twitter.com/BbL3YdzEG8

660,"Cost, Not Choice, Is Top Concern of Health Insurance Customers - The New York Times","It is all about the price. Millions of people buying insurance in the marketplaces created by the federal health care law have one feature in mind. It is not finding a favorite doctor, or even a trusted company. It is how much  —   or, more precisely, how little  —   they can pay in premiums each month. And for many of them, especially those who are healthy, all the prices are too high. The unexpected laser focus on price has contributed to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses among the country’s top insurers, as fewer healthy people than expected have signed up. And that has created two vexing questions: Will the major insurance companies stay in the marketplaces? And if they do, will the public have a wide array of plans to choose from  —   a central tenet of the 2010 Affordable Care Act? “The marketplace has been and continues to be unsustainable,” said Joseph R. Swedish, chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers. Most Americans with health insurance get it through their employers or from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The marketplaces were created under the health care law to give the millions of people not covered in those ways a way to buy health plans. While major insurers continue to make profits over all, they say that the economics of the marketplaces do not work for them. Insurers can offer marketplace plans at four different coverage tiers, and the government subsidizes the premiums for millions of people. The thinking was that enough healthy people would buy insurance to balance out the costs for the   . But things are not going exactly as envisioned. People shopping in the marketplaces are overwhelmingly choosing the cheapest plans they can find, according to a federal analysis. In 2014,   of people went for the   or    plans in each of the tiers. In 2015, about half chose the cheapest plans. The pricing pressure is playing out on multiple fronts. People with expensive medical conditions, knowing that they need reliable coverage, seem willing to pay a little more for plans offered by the large companies. Those plans tend to have a wider choice of doctors and a stronger brand name, and the insurers say the people signing up are sicker than they expected. Healthy and young people  —   who are essential to insurers to offset the costs of care for unhealthy people  —   are regularly turning to whatever plan is cheapest, including those from   insurers or with the smallest networks of hospitals and doctors. Many other young and healthy people, particularly those not eligible for generous subsidies, are shunning plans altogether, finding all of the prices too high. That decision puts them at risk of tax penalties. By some estimates, about 10 million people are signed up, fewer than half of the 21 million expected by now. All of this has the major insurance companies, as they finish their third year of selling individual policies under the law, reevaluating their role in the marketplace. The top insurers have essentially stopped talking about expanding their marketplace ambitions. Two companies, UnitedHealth Group and Humana, have said they plan to largely exit the marketplaces. Aetna has halted plans to enter more states. Even insurers that insist they are committed, like Anthem, which offers   Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states, are struggling to find their way. Mr. Swedish describes the market as “not predictable and not reliable. ” If the major insurers keep cutting back, it could lead to a cascade of effects for the people who depend on the marketplaces for coverage. People could potentially face higher premiums because there are fewer insurers competing, and they could have more limited choices of plans and doctors. The apprehension is not lost on regulators and lawmakers. On Thursday, the Obama administration said it was exploring ways to protect insurers from very expensive medical claims. And recently in The Journal of the American Medical Association, President Obama wrote that more financial assistance for people may be needed. So the mainstream insurers are struggling to find a business model for the marketplaces that works. If an insurer is successful at being the cheapest in a market, it has often found that it priced its plans too low to cover its medical costs. Some smaller insurers have already gone out of business. But if an insurer prices a plan too high, it might not attract enough healthy people to break even. Companies both large and small now plan to raise prices sharply for 2017, which could prevent even more people from buying policies. “The price competition has turned out to be much more cutthroat than anyone expected,” said Larry Levitt, an executive with the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks the law. Still, most experts say there is no immediate danger that the market will collapse. Marjorie Connolly, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement that the Obama administration was confident that the marketplaces would “continue to thrive for years ahead. ” The department said on Thursday that the people entering the marketplaces are becoming more mixed over time, and the marketplaces are attracting more young and healthy people over all. The major insurers, though, say the healthy people are going to other plans, often the least expensive ones offered by their smaller competitors. Some defenders of the law say it is working as intended, harnessing competition to keep premiums as low as possible. “We have to be realistic,” said Linda J. Blumberg, a health care expert at the Urban Institute, noting that some large companies may not be nimble enough to succeed. “You can’t lower costs without breaking some eggs. ” Not every insurance company is struggling. The exceptions seem to be those that offer the most limited choice of doctors and hospitals and may pay them the least, including plans offered by companies like Molina and Centene, which previously specialized in covering   Medicaid patients. The insurers faring the worst sell plans that resemble those traditionally offered through employers. The plans give customers much greater latitude over where to get care and cover some of the   doctors and   hospitals. The trouble is that people signing up for those plans are less healthy  —   and more expensive to treat  —   than anticipated. The companies also say that the provisions of the law aimed at stabilizing the market and protecting them from heavy losses are not working. Several say that consolidation is the answer. Anthem, for example, says the only way it can expand in the marketplaces is by merging with Cigna, a deal the Justice Department is trying to block. Another remedy is to attract a broader range of customers. “We have to get a healthier pool of people in the market,” said Kurt Kossen, an executive at Health Care Service Corporation, which operates nonprofit Blue Cross plans in several states but lost $1. 5 billion last year. The result could be a market essentially left to insurers that offer the same narrow networks found in Medicaid plans and some remaining Blue Cross plans, said Mr. Levitt, of the Kaiser Family Foundation. “The market is sustainable but with a different mix of plans,” he said.",0

663,Pirates Fail to Take the Helm: Iceland’s Pirate Party Gains Mileage But not Enough to Steady Ship Alone,"Email 
Hafnarfjorður, Iceland. 
The votes are in. In a greater-than-expected 79% turnout, election results show that Iceland’s Pirate Party has not come out in first place as earlier polls indicated might be the case. They have, however, increased their size in the Parliament 3-fold (from 3 seats to 10) but this will not be enough to steer Iceland in their direction. 
Now it´s all about coalition building. 
Had they maintained those poll numbers from earlier this summer (at a one-time high of 35%), that would have given them the probable first choice to form a coalition government with either the Left-Greens, the Social-Democrats, or the center-leftish Bright Future. As it stands now, they will need to band together, something they all they agreed to consider during a pre-election press conference. 
The largest single party remains the corporate-right Independence Party with 29% or 21 seats and which is now part of the governing coalition along with the center-right Progressive Party (who suffered a humiliating loss of 11 seats, now down to 8). This coalition is the same center-right configuration which led Iceland to financial disaster, the flight of skilled doctors and other professionals, and whose members were implicated in off-shore money scams which led to the resignation earlier this year of their last PM from the Progressive Party, causing these early elections, and now to the formal resignation of their present PM just a few hours ago. Technically these two parties could form a 3-party coalition along with the new Regeneration Party. However, Regeneration leader Benedikt Jóhanesson has said he wouldn´t consider a coalition with the governing parties. Thus that particular scenario is doubted. 
After years of political stagnation following the collapse of the economy, and controversy over the Panama Papers leaking of wealthy Icelanders´ involvement in Tortola, this new development reflects a growing, widespread disgust at the traditional two party coalition rulers who have alternately or in pairs run the country for most of its years following Iceland’s independence. 
The ship is floundering and the present course is unsustainable. 
The other numbers however, are pointing to a change of course: The Pirates won 14.5% giving them 10 seats in the 63 seat Parliament, the Althing. The Left-Greens received 15.9% (for 10 Seats); the Social Democrats 5.7% (3 seats) and Bright Future 7.2% (winning 4 seats).Together they represent almost 30% of the electorate. These are the groups which began talking about joining forces this past week, just before the election. 
If a four party coalition is solidified, then Iceland becomes the second nation to have a viable Pirate Party within its government (Germany is the first) and the first to have it this close to the helm in the country´s governance. 
The kingmakers could very well be Regeneration, a new, center-right grouping who won 10.5% of the votes getting them 7 seats. They characterize themselves as “liberal”, though the head was a long-time supporter of the Independence Party before leaving this past year. On the 18th of October he said he wouldn’t consider joining a coalition with the two-headed ruling hydra of the Independence and Progressive parties. Were he instead to agree to an alliance with the four roughly left, center-left groups of which the Pirates are a part (something he declared he was open to the morning after the election), then that would net a total of 34 seats (27 + their 7) and a solid majority. A five party coalition. 
What does this all mean? It means several things: in the short run, the helm of the Icelandic political ship will remain loosely dominated by the Independence Party as the largest single grouping in the Althingi (Parliament). But aside from that approximately 30% of the electorate who aren´t swayed by anything but their loyalty to the ruling class, the rest of the country is moving on. They are actively exploring hitherto unheard of politics (with the Pirates) and considering broad coalition politics (5 groups trying to control the direction of the country). This may be the wave of the future. Or it may simply be a transitional era where loyalties are split and serious discussions about radical ideas like ownership of public resources (and actually and clearly defining such) occur openly as the public coalesces around a new, dominant ideology. In the long run, things are changing. And then there is this issue of a new Constitution which was voted on and accepted by the public but which the ruling coalition simply ignored and shelved. If that was now formally accepted, then some serious changes may be in store for the Owners of the country. But today is only the day after, and nothing has been decided yet. 
So what´s next? Well, the new President’s job just got more complicated as he is the one who traditionally asks the leading party to form the new government and, if they fail in securing a stable majority, the next leading party would get a shot. This was easier when the totals were generally in favor of one or the other of the two ruling groups. Now, however, a new multi-party dynamic is at play. Who knows how the discussions are heading right now, and which horses are being traded? 
Iceland has always been the most USAmerican of the Nordic countries but with tugs in both directions. Much like the island itself, rent down the middle by volcanic cracks dividing the European and American tectonic plates, these tugs are causing great tension as to which political direction the country should follow. With history having taken them this far and a growing unease about the dominant parties´ corruption and rehashed free market rhetoric, it appears Iceland is not quite ready to jump ship and hand the wheel over to the Pirates. But they and their kind are looking better and better as each year passes and Iceland drifts without a clear direction to prosperity and fairness. In the long run, that tectonic split in politics is getting wider and wider, just like its geographical counterpart. 
But it is the Pirates who at least have captured the imagination of the people (and, in particular the young). If they can convince the rest of the public that they are more seriously interested in governing than in luring Edward Snowden here (a publicity stunt at best) and have more relevant meat and potato concerns beyond internet privacy, then they may very well be the ultimate winners a few years down the road.

664,The Billionaire Who’s Building a Davos of His Own - The New York Times,"In a   conference room at Stanford University, a score of scholars, many of them eminent and some from as far away as Johannesburg and Beijing, gathered last month to compare philosophical notions of hierarchy and equality. The gathering itself had no overt hierarchy, though one participant seemed a little more equal than the others. When Nicolas Berggruen spoke, no one interrupted. Only he occasionally checked his phone. And at dinner, the guests received fruit tarts for dessert  —   except for Mr. Berggruen, who was served chocolate mousse. Mr. Berggruen, 54, is an investor and art collector who was once known as the “homeless billionaire” because he lived in itinerant luxury in   hotels. Now he is grounded in Los Angeles where he presides over a bespoke think tank, the Berggruen Institute. The institute is a striking example of how wealthy philanthropists are reshaping the landscape with smaller versions of the foundations established by Bill Gates and George Soros. Sean Parker, one of the entrepreneurs behind Napster and Facebook, has a research institute, The Parker Foundation, which this month pledged $250 million for cancer immunotherapy. He is also a   of the Economic Innovation Group, which labels itself an “ideas laboratory. ” Tom Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund manager in California, has several environmental nonprofit groups, and last year created the Fair Shake Commission to redress economic inequality. “There is a generation of new donors who have huge assets, and their own ideas, and think traditional think tanks are ” said James G. McGann, the director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania  —   a think tank that thinks about think tanks. In a   culture where tweets, not position papers, shape the national conversation, these kinds of   “are likely to be more influential than we are,” Mr. McGann said. Mr. Berggruen stands out because he is a   but   player at the nexus of wealth and rumination who is also a bit mysterious  —   a Gatsby who shows up at his own parties. “I am a person who likes to engage in learning,” Mr. Berggruen said, in an accent reflecting his Parisian upbringing and dual German and American citizenship. The next step was “to see if I can produce some ideas,” he said. Mr. Berggruen’s investment company, Berggruen Holdings, is registered in the British Virgin Islands and his charitable trust is based in Bermuda. The institute bankrolls several conferences a year, and Mr. Berggruen attends almost every session, takes careful notes and sometimes even appears to dress the part. At a dinner for philosophy scholars at the Stanford Park Hotel in March, he wore a dark blazer and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to his sternum, the signature look of the French celebrity philosopher   Lévy. There are conflicting views about this kind of endeavor. “One of the delights of philanthropy is that it isn’t programmed, it is scattershot, with so much room for idiosyncratic choices,” said Karl Zinsmeister, author of “The Almanac of American Philanthropy. ” He cited the example of Daniel Guggenheim, who championed the rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard in the 1930s when he was widely dismissed as a crackpot. “Of course there is a high percentage of waste,” Mr. Zinsmeister said, “but that’s how discovery works. ” Others worry, though, that at least some of these initiatives are vanity projects. Mr. Berggruen’s institute “seems like a   of his creation,” McGann said, referring to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland  —   the Ascot of conferences for the global elite. Mr. McGann publishes an annual report on the world’s top think tanks, ranking them in more than 50 categories. The Berggruen Institute is not included in any of them. Mr. Berggruen happens to be a Davos habitué, but his institute has a more eclectic mandate. Besides philosophy, he has spent time and money on efforts to reform the California budget. He has established councils to study European integration and China. The Berggruen Institute will award an annual $1 million prize in philosophy beginning this year. It is presently funding six Berggruen academic fellowships to China and other places, and it has selected 16 others for the   academic year. Mr. Berggruen says he bought more than 400 acres in Brentwood, Calif. and has commissioned the renowned Swiss architecture firm Herzog  de Meuron to design his institute’s headquarters. Craig Calhoun, who is leaving the directorship of the London School of Economics this summer, was appointed president. Mr. Calhoun said his mandate was to “deepen the conversation. ” Mr. Berggruen has a gift for networking. “He knows everyone,” said his friend Stefan Simchowitz, an art dealer. At the philosophy conference in Stanford, he hosted a conversation about artificial intelligence with Antonio Damasio, a neuroscientist who heads the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern California, and Reid Hoffman, a   of LinkedIn. Mr. Hoffman met Mr. Berggruen through a mutual friend who mentioned Mr. Berggruen’s interests in California governance and Chinese philosophy. “I said, ‘Yeah, that’s interesting. Let me meet him,’” Mr. Hoffman recalled. The luminaries listed on the institute’s advisory boards are the kind who pop up at White House state dinners or on Barry Diller’s yacht: Arianna Huffington,   of The Huffington Post the SpaceX founder Elon Musk Tony Blair, the former British prime minister Francis Fukuyama, the Stanford professor and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. “I’m not really involved anymore, but I like Nicolas,” Ms. Rice said in a phone interview. She served on the Think Long Committee for California, a brain trust Mr. Berggruen assembled in 2010 to address the state’s budget crisis. Mr. Berggruen makes it easy for even very busy people to lend their prestige. He foots the bills, booking guests in luxury hotels and sometimes ferrying them on his private jet. In workshops, he asks the kind of   questions that politicians, intellectuals and billionaires like to answer. Last November, Mr. Berggruen convened former prime ministers and other eminences in Beijing to discuss the future of China. Upon the group’s arrival in Beijing, the roads were cleared for their motorcade to the Great Hall of the People for a meeting with President Xi Jinping. Orville Schell, a China scholar at the Asia Society in New York and an adviser to the Berggruen Institute, said that Mr. Berggruen gained access to Chinese leaders because he focused on philosophy and culture, not politics and human rights, and noted that his approach was “astute. ” It also helped that Mr. Berggruen did not appear to have a business agenda. “In some ways he is a thinking man’s Donald Trump,” Mr. Schell said. “He doesn’t want anything from anybody, except to be of consequence. ” While Mr. Berggruen has arrived, even in his early days he wasn’t exactly an arriviste. His father, Heinz Berggruen, was an art dealer who fled the Nazis in 1936, romanced Frida Kahlo in New York and befriended Picasso in Paris. The younger Mr. Berggruen attended Le Rosey, an exclusive Swiss boarding school, and studied finance at New York University, but he says he began investing as a teenager, borrowing a few thousand pounds from a friend to buy stocks. Forbes estimates his fortune to be about $1. 5 billion. Last year, Town  Country magazine named him one of the world’s 50 most eligible bachelors. And last month, he became a bachelor father. Or, as he put it when asked who the mother is: “Me. I am the mother and the father. ” Mr. Berggruen has two newborns, a boy and a girl, born three weeks apart to different surrogates and conceived using eggs from two donors. Single fatherhood has now tethered him to Los Angeles, he said, but not too tightly: He bought the apartment one floor down for the children and their nannies. Since 2015, his institute has been funded by his   charitable trust. He says it has a $1 billion endowment. Foreign status means that Mr. Berggruen forfeits United States tax breaks but can give away money as he chooses. Bermuda has almost none of the restrictions or disclosure rules that bind American nonprofits. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Berggruen said, he began to question his life’s purpose. That led him, in 2010, to hire professors from the University of California, Los Angeles, to tutor him in philosophy. Brian Walker, a political science professor and expert in Chinese philosophy, was one of those. Professor Walker would discuss Plato and Confucius with Mr. Berggruen over lunch in his suite at the Peninsula Hotel. “It was sort of a surreal setting, but he always did the reading and asked good questions,” Mr. Walker said. “I found him a little mysterious. He didn’t invite personal confidences. ” Mr. Berggruen is courteous and even courtly: In restaurants, he stands when his date leaves the table. But he isn’t a schmoozer. His Stanford conference ran from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. with little time for small talk. At the philosophy dinner, he asked that his guests discuss harmony and freedom in the East and West. He was playful, but only on topic. “I am going to say something that will make all of you want to kill me,” he said, bringing conversation and forks to a halt. “The West is absolutist, India is pluralist, and China is  —   and I don’t mean this in a negative way  —   conformist. ” Mr. Berggruen spoke proudly of the work his Think Long Committee did to address California’s deficit, including supporting Proposition 31, which among other things would have barred lawmakers from creating expenditures over $25 million without finding the money for them. Mr. Berggruen spent more than $1 million to get the proposition on the ballot. The initiative was voted down in 2012. Think Long was on the winning side, though, of a 2014 measure to make ballot initiatives more transparent. Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, which supported the measure, said that she didn’t recall the Berggruen Institute’s adding much to policy ideas, but that it did help finance legal advisers and recruit experts. “I wouldn’t say it was deep thinking,” Ms. Feng said, “but he did bring in some very   individuals. ” In 2010, Mr. Berggruen took the Giving Pledge  —   which has become a kind of social register for   philanthropists  —   joining billionaires who have promised to give away more than half of their fortunes. But he is not a spendthrift. He is a trustee of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and tax records show that in 2014 he gave the museum $100, 000, the minimum annual gift required many give double that amount, or more, according to two trustees. That year, Mr. Berggruen gave U. C. L. A. $4, 750. Mr. Berggruen says he wants to nurture innovative thinking, not just donate to causes. His institute, he said, is “not just a   operation it’s an ideas and   operation. ” Several scholars say that Mr. Berggruen’s interdisciplinary approach to philosophy is refreshing in an academic world that can be siloed. Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher at New York University, said he attended a Berggruen event because it gave him a chance to talk to experts about Confucianism, which is not his primary field of study. “I can’t say whether it’s the best use of his money,” Professor Appiah said. “I can only consider whether he is making the world better or worse, and in this case I would have to say, better. ”",0
665,Running Into Danger on an Alaskan Trail - The New York Times,"It happened so fast: One moment I was running trails, the next I was staring a   sow in the face, so close I could smell it, wild and pungent and alarming, and I knew it could smell me, too, my fear. I was in the middle of a rainy   run in Far North Bicentennial Park on the outskirts of Anchorage, where I live. It was late July, a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the   salmon swimming up Campbell Creek. But I was miles from the water. I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadn’t seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting. I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips. Then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me. It’s impossible to run the trails around Alaska without thinking about bears. There are piles of scat everywhere, dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun, reminders that you have to be careful. You have to be versed in bear awareness, bear etiquette and bear protocol. Headphones are a   and going alone is discouraged. Making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended. Still, I often ran alone. I preferred it that way. I liked the serenity and the loneliness, liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees. That day, I wore a bear bell attached to my hydration pack, and I sang, too, whenever I came to dense areas. I sang old rock ’n’ roll songs, loudly and badly. I was cautious but not afraid. I ran these trails all summer and the summer before, and while I saw bears on many other trails, I only twice saw them on these sections. Maybe I let down my guard. Maybe I felt invincible, the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results. Maybe the bear was having a bad day. When the bear charged, time stood still. I felt every millisecond. I stood in the drizzle, rain coating my face like tears, and I did what they tell you to do if a black bear charges: I waved my arms and yelled. “I’m human!” I cried, my voice rising through the birch trees, through that silent and   moment. “I’m a person!” The bear paused and ran back toward the brush. A minute later, it charged a second time. And again I waved my arms and yelled and again it stopped, this time so close I could almost reach out and touch its snout. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t swallow. I wondered, briefly and almost idly, if this was how I would die. Suddenly, I wanted to talk to my son, who was grown and off living his own life. I wanted to hear his voice. A lifetime later, the bear turned and ran off, its backside swaying into the trees. I had to get back to the trail, to the possibility of safety, yet I couldn’t step away from the alders. It was my only protection. That’s when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc. That’s when I knew I was in trouble, became really afraid. When my son was young and nothing would comfort him, I would talk. It didn’t matter what I said, he needed my voice, the steady flow of words. As I stepped from the shelter of the alders, I talked out loud, my voice surprisingly calm. I talked to the bear to show that I meant no harm, but mostly I talked to reassure myself. As the bear circled for a second time, I stumbled through devil’s club, snagging my shorts and scratching my legs, and I talked about the day my son was born, how I recognized his face immediately. When I reached the trail, I kept talking. The bear followed, but I didn’t look back. A half a mile later, I glanced over my shoulder, and the bear was gone. I started running and didn’t stop until I encountered two hikers, and I collapsed at their feet. For weeks I saw that bear’s face in my dreams, and I woke up, heart pounding. I swore I would never run trails again, but I missed it too much, and soon I was out with the trees and that big, big sky. Some things are worth the risk, though I made sure to carry a canister of bear spray, just in case. And sometimes even now when I’m running, I think of that bear charging and how I stood there, so still and yet so alive. It opened something inside of me that can never be closed. It offered a taste of the unknown: At any time I might find myself crouched in the brush, face to face with my own fragile existence. So much of life is chance. There are no guarantees. But there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck.",0

Pese a lo impresionante de la calidad de imagen, Carrasco lamenta que el guión de su vida no estuviera a la altura. “Además, con tanta definición en la imagen he comprobado que llevo treinta años con un trozo de lechuga entre los dientes y nadie jamás me ha avisado”, lamenta. 
“Los mejores momentos de mi vida, mi primer ordenador, mi primera novia online… todos los momentos memorables en la existencia de un informático se vieron empañados por un simple trozo de lechuga. Qué pena de vida y qué pena dedicar la última tecnología a esto”, se queja. 
Tras una profunda remodelación de sus instalaciones, la antesala de la muerte ha adquirido varios televisores Samsung con tecnología Quantum dot que permiten a los usuarios como Jordi vivir una experiencia más realista. Esto, por supuesto, pide que las vidas de las personas estén a la altura de los avances tecnológicos. 
La misma tecnología, además, ha permitido destapar grandes mentiras del pasado: la popular doña Rogelia, personaje de “Mari Carmen y sus muñecos”, era en realidad el actor Quique San Francisco.

Though, the postgame scene became one of unity and camaraderie as the Democrats presented the trophy to Scalise, who is still in critical condition after the attack. Representative Joe Barton of Texas accepted the trophy on Scalise’s behalf.  According to ESPN: A huge ovation came from the crowd, which swelled to a record 24, 959, when Special Agent David Bailey, one of the Capitol Police officers injured in the attack on Republicans at their ball practice in Virginia, threw out the first pitch. “ONE FAMILY,” proclaimed a sign in the crowd. The announcer’s mention of Scalise, the House majority whip who was critically wounded in the attack Wednesday, brought the masses to their feet. The highlight of the evening featured President Donald Trump delivering a video message to the assembled crowd.

The game will go on. ” ESPN reported, “When the president intoned three words he said have brought Americans together for generations —  ”Let’s play ball” —  cheers rang out. ” While the game provides some relief and bipartisanship in a town dominated by faction and division, the other more important aspect of the game has to do with how it benefits various charities. This year, the charities are the “Boys  Girls Club of Greater Washington, Washington Literacy Center, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and, after Wednesday’s shooting, the Capitol Police Memorial Fund. ” After Thursday’s result, the   record in the game is 39 wins each, for both Democrats and Republicans, with one tie.

668,France 2015 to Present: Strict Gun Control a Paper Tiger - Breitbart,"The strict French gun control that makes it extremely difficult for   citizens to defend themselves has proven little more than a paper tiger when it comes to prohibiting terrorists and public attackers from acquiring the guns they need to kill innocents. [The April 20 attack on a police patrol on the Champs Élysées illustrates this perfectly in light of the fact that the alleged attacker —  Karim Cheurfi —  was previously jailed for shooting at officers with a . 38 Special revolver. The Daily Mail reports that Cheurfi was imprisoned “in 2005 for trying to kill two policemen” and wounding a third person with the revolver.

In that attack, multiple terrorists opened fire with   or   rifles. They killed 130 innocents. The universal background checks were not a hindrance, and the rest of the French gun laws were powerless to prevent the attack. It is important to note that A Review of French Gun Laws (2012) shows that the background check in France is an ongoing process rather than a one time event. Such checks entail acquiring and maintaining “an active shooting club [membership]” and going to the range “at least three times a year. ” They also include “seeing a doctor every year,” who declares one “physically and mentally capable of owning a firearm,” and filling out various pieces of paperwork as well. Yet 130 innocents were gunned down on November 13, 2015. And we cannot overlook the January 7, 2015, attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters. Twelve innocents —  including two police officers —  were gunned down by armed terrorists who were not hindered by strict gun control. French police unions responded to the Charlie Hebdo attack by explaining that gun control simply was not working for them they could not continue to walk the streets of Paris presuming that terrorists would not acquire arms. The Associated Press reported that the police unions demanded “more” guns and “heavier” guns, as well as “protective gear, better training for   and more legal tools to guard against terrorists. ” Gun control reduces   citizens’ ability to defend themselves and places police officers at a marked disadvantage. On the other hand, it poses no hindrance to determined terrorists who target citizens and police officers alike.

669,"China, Russia, The Silk Road, Commodities, Nixon And A Massive Bull Market In Gold & Silver","52 Views October 31, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
With most markets on lockdown on Halloween trading day, here is a big picture view of where the world is headed. 
Stephen Leeb: “This past week a New York Times headline that caught my eye was: “At Heart of U.S. Strategy; Weapons That Can Think.” The gist was that over the next few years the U.S. will be spending billions of dollars to make “smart” weapons, while also boosting our cyber budget by billions of dollars. It struck me as another example of how anytime we in the U.S. pound our chest about our mighty military, we always point to how much money have spent and plan to spend… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. 
In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, Michael O’Harlan and David Petraeus, men with exceptional military pedigrees, declare: “U.S. forces have few, if any, weaknesses and in many areas…they play in a totally different league from the militaries of other countries…Nor is this likely to change anytime soon, as U.S. defense spending is almost three times as large as that of the United States’ closest competitor, China.” 
Reassuring words? Maybe for a moment. But as soon as you think about it, they become anything but reassuring, showing that even when it comes to our most vital security issues, we make the fundamentally flawed assumption that money equates to wealth. 
I’ve long been convinced that if the U.S. continues on what appears an ever more inevitable slide, historians will point to the day Nixon dropped the gold standard as launching that skid. Gold is wealth; paper is merely money. Money can facilitate the exchange of wealth, but by itself it is just paper or entries on a computer ledger and a very poor substitute for wealth. Commodities are wealth, and many vital commodities, as we pointed in a recent interview, can’t even be purchased any more – period. Information is also wealth. And no amount of money can guarantee an edge in information. 
A few weeks ago, a 15- or 16-year-old who had recently become interested in chess wrote a letter to a chess blog asking how much he’d need to spend to become a Grand Master – how much for training, how much for practice time, coaches, etc. The only possible answer: not all the money in the world could turn a novice who’s already a teenager into a world-class player. Grand masters have a wealth of knowledge and savvy that can’t be acquired once you’re much past 7 or 8 years old. You’ve missed the boat. 
Similarly, no amount of money enabled U.S. experts to crack the cell phone of the San Bernardino terrorists. But cyber experts from Israel, which spends a lot less on cyber issues, cracked it with relative ease. Israel, along with China and Russia, are among a number of countries, mostly located in Asia, that develop the skills of their gifted children at early ages. This has left the U.S. a poor second in critical areas ranging from cyber security to super computers, which will be the most essential tools in the next generation of a gold-centered monetary system. 
Even nonbelievers should be starting to perceive the inevitability of gold replacing paper. A few metrics tell the story. First is the relationship between the dollar and economic growth. Despite the recent report of better-than-expected third-quarter GDP, the economy’s growth has been declining as the dollar has risen. In the wake of the Great Recession the dollar traded in a fairly tight range, while GDP growth in fits and starts peaked at 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. The higher dollar has held GDP growth to less than 2 percent for the past two years. 
But commodities have begun to rise. Most major commodity indexes have climbed 10 percent or more this year. Even the temporary setback in obtaining an OPEC agreement won’t hold back real goods. Recently, for the first time since China announced its Silk Road initiative in 2013, a major article on the undertaking appeared in a major magazine, Foreign Affairs. Gal Luft , a senior advisor to the United States Energy Security Council, urged Washington to get aboard or lose out on the chance to benefit from the greatest infrastructure project in the history of civilization, many times the size of the Marshall Plan and already the destination of $1 trillion in Chinese exports this year, with dramatic growth likely for the foreseeable future. 
But instead we’re likely to continue to use our dollars in ways that bear ever less connection to real wealth. Bear in mind that any effort to hold inflation down will crumble in the face of Western economies even weaker than ours. The result is that real interest rates will remain negative, an unalloyed positive for gold. At the same time the currency used along the Silk Road will be some combination of gold, the SDR, and the yuan. As we have said before, China’s edge in critical information technologies ensures its domination in virtual currencies such as the bitcoin, which will have multiple advantages in tomorrow’s gold-based world. 
How High Will Gold & Silver Trade? How high will gold go? Much depends on how much trade the Silk Road generates. Which means that if think gold could go to five digits, you don’t need a shrink – you’re sane as can be. And let’s not overlook gold’s poor cousin, which in the end could make you even richer, silver. The energies of our future will be anchored to solar, nuclear, and wind. The solar anchor will mean that already peaking silver will become some of the scarcest wealth around. If you’re dreaming of $100 silver, your dreams will be coming true before long. 
To me it’s an ironic footnote to the Nixon years. Yes, history will record that America’s decline began when the much-maligned Nixon delinked the dollar from gold and let us conflate money and wealth. Meanwhile, though, you can make a fortune on the coming bull market in gold that will be the direct result of that decision.”

670,Troubled Quarterback Johnny Manziel to Appear at Shopping Mall to Sign Autographs During Next Super Bowl - Breitbart,"Former Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel has gone from one of the most celebrated players in the NFL to washing out. Now, he is appearing in shopping malls to sign photos for money to make ends meet. [As USA Today notes, Manziel will make a Super Bowl appearance of sorts by appearing at a Houston shopping mall during Super Bowl week to sign autographs.  According to Crave Sports Company, the group that contracted with the troubled player for the signing, Manziel will sign any item for $99 a pop or will pose for a selfie for $50 during the   appearance. The   Heisman Trophy winner whose NFL career crashed after only a single season due to his   behavior will appear at the Woodlands Mall in Houston on February 2 and 3. Every NFL team passed Manziel over for the 2016 season, despite the league’s decision to reinstate him after Dallas County prosecutors dropped domestic violence charges against the quarterback last December. Along with the dismissal of the charges, Manziel agreed to attend counseling and will remain under court supervision.

671,Bob Dylan Accused of Lifting Parts of Nobel Prize Speech from SparkNotes,"Rock and folk legend Bob Dylan has been accused of lifting sections of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech from a SparkNotes. com summary of Moby Dick. [Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylan’s speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the “Blowin’ in the Wind” singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes  —   a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts  —   but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: “Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness” From SparkNotes: “someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness. ” Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylan’s lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel. The Nobel Foundation awarded Dylan the prestigious prize in October, which sparked considerable controversy over the very definition of literature, and and the enigmatic music legend didn’t acknowledge the honor for weeks. The musician declined to attend December’s Nobel ceremony in Stockholm, citing scheduling issues. The Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize, published Dylan’s speech on June 5, in the form of a   recording, and called it “extraordinary” and “eloquent” in a press release. The organization has not responded to the accusations. While Dylan has not responded to the accusations, however, he has been accused of borrowing phrases from other artists in the past. “It is nothing new that Mr. Dylan might take inspiration from a   work to prepare something else,” Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer and musician, told the Associated Press. “Songwriters, including Dylan, have been borrowing from other literary works to turn pop phrases for ages. Consider Led Zeppelin’s ample use of Tolkien’s classic works in many of their songs. ” The “surprise here is that rather than borrowing from classic literature, Mr. Dylan took his ‘inspiration’ this time from crib notes,” Weinberg said. “But that should not raise eyebrows either. Even John Lennon was known to use things as ordinary as a newspaper clipping or circus posters to embellish lyrics. ” Listen to the lecture in full below:   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudson",0

673,Public Employees and the Shadow World of American Carnage,"What might the American economy look like if   had not engaged in decades of brutal betrayal against American workers? [A new report from the Congressional Budget Office provides an   answer to the question by examining a sector of the labor market whose wages have been largely shielded from the effects of trade deals, immigration, and   regulation. These workers receive wages and benefits that are, on average, about 17 percent higher than workers with comparable skills and education in other parts of the economy.  The compensation gap is striking. The workers in the protected sector are better compensated than unprotected peers at every level of educational attainment aside from those with professional degrees or doctorates. The compensation gap is largest, in fact, for those workers who would otherwise be among the most vulnerable in the economy: workers with no more than a high school degree. According to the CBO study, the total compensation for protected workers with a high school diploma or less earned 53 percent more than their unprotected peers. So who are these protected workers? They are members of the federal government’s civilian workforce. The federal government employs about 1. 5 percent of the U. S. workforce, around 2. 2 million workers. They are spread across more than 100 agencies and over 650 occupations. In fiscal year 2016, the federal government spent around $215 billion to compensate these workers. On average, they tend to be older, more educated, and more concentrated in professional occupations than   workers. The CBO studied data from 2011 through 2015 to estimate the differences between the wages and benefits of federal employees and similar   employees. It sorted the data by level of education, years of work experience, occupation, size of employer, geographic location, veteran status, and demographic characteristics such as ages, sex, race, and marital status. What it found was that federal workers tend to earn far more than their private sector counterparts. Between 2010 and 2015, federal workers with a high school degree or less had wages that were 34 percent higher than private sector peers and benefits that were 93 percent greater, for a total compensation gap of 53 percent. For workers with a bachelor’s degree, the wage gap was 21 percent, composed of a 5 percent wage gap and a 52 percent benefit gap. Aside from those with the highest levels of education, the compensation gap has grown in recent years. Between 2005 and 2010, for example, the total compensation gap for workers with a high school diploma or less was 36 percent. The gap for those with a bachelor’s degree was 15 percent. An adjustment to whom is counted as a federal employee caused some of this difference. But the larger part of it was caused by the fact that wages grew more quickly among less educated federal workers than those in the private sector. This is even more striking because lawmakers froze    salary increases for federal workers between 2011 through 2013. Without this freeze, the gap would have grown even larger. Federal workers are shielded from a lot of the effects of globalization that have depressed private sector worker compensation. Their jobs are not easily or often subject to   the practice of replacing employees in the U. S. with employees located in foreign countries. Similarly, outsourcing does not weigh on federal workers the way it does private sector workers. Competition from immigrants is far less of a factor because the U. S. government has stringent rules against hiring illegal immigrants and does not directly seek workers from abroad to fill jobs. While the federal government hires immigrant workers, it does so from the pool that is already legally residing in the United States. Trade hardly impacts federal worker compensation at all. Civilian federal employees working in the Defense Department, the largest group of federal workers, are not in wage competition with defense workers in foreign lands. That is true for almost all federal workers, in fact. From the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior to the U. S. Treasury and the Justice Department, the wage competition faced by employees is purely domestic. Unlike the private sector, where employment and wages are depressed because of regulation, the federal government benefits from increased regulation. Each new regulation requires employees to enforce and monitor compliance. And most regulations impose few barriers to projects that the federal government pursues.  Look at it from the    of the agencies. They are confined to hiring, for the most part, American citizens and legal residents. They compete with other government agencies and the private sector for workers. While the private sector can turn abroad for workers, the federal agencies cannot. The result is higher wages and better benefits for federal workers. Importantly, many of the   sources of wage stagnation that impact the private sector also weigh on the federal sector. Communications technology, for example, has made many occupations once filled by workers in the federal government redundant. Robotics, improved computer processing, and the Great Recession —  recall that wage   wage freeze —  have all hit federal workers. Yet the compensation grew. That leaves the effects of trade and immigration policy as the most likely culprits. The absence of a wage gap for those with a doctorate or professional degree is telling. In the private sector, these are workers who have faired relatively well in the age of globalization. Many have seen the demand for their work —  and therefore their prosperity —  rise as lawyers, bankers, and other professions ply their trade internationally. So it is no surprise that the federal workers with advanced degrees earn 18 percent less than private sector counterparts. This fact also undermines a competing narrative explaining the wage gap —  that it is a result of a reckless federal government that spends   and cannot resist pressure for higher wages. If that were so, all federal workers would be expected to earn more. The compensation gap could also explain why so many federal workers do not look favorably on President Donald Trump. They just have not experienced the economic impact of globalization the way many of Donald Trump’s private sector supporters have. The CBO report is a glimpse into a shadow world, an alternate reality of an American economy absent the trade and immigration policy decisions that have dragged down all but the best educated and highest earning segments of the American workforce. It shows us an America where a worker without a high school diploma is far better paid and the rewards to the elites are far less grand. It is the world without the carnage that globalization has sown in the American economy. It is, more hopefully, a roadmap to making America great again.",0
674,The Syria conundrum - Press TV,"On The News Line ©AFP 
These are some of the headlines we are tracking for you in this episode of On the News Line: 
The Syria conundrum 
The crisis in Syria is getting more complicated. Many parties are participating in the war. The administration of US President Barack Obama has been talking about sending more sophisticated weapons to the so-called moderate rebels in Syria. But the White House is hesitant and the plan seems to have stalled. The Turks are after for their own agenda in Syria. It’s been almost two months since Turkey launched its offensive in northern Syria. According to Ankara, the mission is aimed at clearing its border area of ISIL militants and anti-Turkey Kurdish militants. And that has put Turkey on a collision course with the US, which has invested heavily on the Kurdish fighters. 
EU threat of disintegration 
Things seem to be falling apart in Europe which many believe is under strain from many factors ranging from the Brexit to the rise of the far-right across the European political spectrum to the refugee crisis, which is the worst to hit the continent. The prospect of the European Union seems so bleak that it has rung the alarm in Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned: ""The financial crisis, the refugee influx into Europe and the shock from the Brexit referendum in Great Britain have brought the European Union into violent turmoil.” Steinmeier warned that this might lead to the collapse of the EU. 
Saudis aim to starve Yemenis 
Reports have surfaced that Saudi Arabia is ""deliberately targeting impoverished Yemen’s farms and agricultural industry."" Increasing evidence suggests that the kingdom is not merely bombing civilians, but it is systematically targeting infrastructure survivors will need to avoid starvation when the war is over. That includes water infrastructures, and even farms. Loading ...",0

With that being said though, when you see Mark Sanchez secure a job, when you see Ryan Fitzpatrick   …     secure a job, you go, ‘All right, this is adding more and more fuel to this conversation about whether or not Colin Kaepernick is unfairly being blackballed’ because he has the courage to stand up for what he believes in. ” He continued, “I’m thinking the NFL, if they start this season with Colin Kaepernick out of it, I think every bit of criticism about him being blackballed has been justified because if Ryan Fitzpatrick has a job making $3 million, the way he played in New Jersey?” Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/prescription-painkiller-deaths-dropped.html In all states that have legalized medical marijuana, there has been a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers. There is still heated controversy in the United States about whether or not marijuana should be legalized for recreational use, let alone medicinal purposes. After reviewing a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2014, you’ll likely agree that it’s much safer for cannabis to be doled out than most prescription opioids.For the study , researchers analyzed all deaths caused by opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2010 in the U.S.Then, they determined the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic-related deaths using linear time-series regression models. The various models helped the researchers determine that in every state that legalized medical marijuana between the aforementioned years (a total of 13 states), there was a 25% reduction in deaths related to the overdose of legally prescribed painkillers.“ The difference is quite striking ,” said Colleen Barry, the study’s co-author and health policy researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, to Newsweek .It is hypothesized by the researchers that in states where medical marijuana is legal, patients are opting to smoke cannabis to alleviate their pain rather than consume prescription opiates, as the latter tend to cause side effects. In addition, marijuana accounts for 0 deaths per year, whereas overdose of opiates are responsible for over 14,000 deaths annually ( source ).While the statistics speak volumes, not everyone is in agreement with the findings. Dr. Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer at the national non-profit addiction treatment agency Phoenix House, says that the immediate reduction in overdose deaths is extremely unlikely to be a result of the herb being substituted. This, he says, is because physicians rarely prescribe marijuana for chronic pain. “You don’t have primary care doctors in these states [prescribing] marijuana instead of Vicodin,” he argues. The physician believes that the states that have legalized medical marijuana are more likely to actively treat and help prevent addiction. In his mind, this is a far more likely scenario for the decrease in overdose deaths.While more studies undoubtedly need to be carried out to pinpoint the cause of this phenomenon, this news is heartening at the very least.

677,We’re in a Low-Growth World. How Did We Get Here? - The New York Times,"One central fact about the global economy lurks just beneath the year’s remarkable headlines: Economic growth in advanced nations has been weaker for longer than it has been in the lifetime of most people on earth. The United States is adding jobs at a healthy clip, as a new report showed Friday, and the unemployment rate is relatively low. But that is happening despite a   trend of much lower growth, both in the United States and other advanced nations, than was evident for most of the   War II era. This trend helps explain why incomes have risen so slowly since the turn of the century, especially for those who are not top earners. It is behind the cheap gasoline you put in the car and the ultralow interest rates you earn on your savings. It is crucial to understanding the rise of Donald J. Trump, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, and the rise of populist movements across Europe. This slow growth is not some new phenomenon, but rather the way it has been for 15 years and counting. In the United States,   gross domestic product rose by an average of 2. 2 percent a year from 1947 through 2000  —   but starting in 2001 has averaged only 0. 9 percent. The economies of Western Europe and Japan have done worse than that. Over long periods, that shift implies a radically slower improvement in living standards. In the year 2000,   G. D. P.  —   which generally tracks with the average American’s income  —   was about $45, 000. But if growth in the second half of the 20th century had been as weak as it has been since then, that number would have been only about $20, 000. To make matters worse, fewer and fewer people are seeing the spoils of what growth there is. According to a new analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute, 81 percent of the United States population is in an income bracket with flat or declining income over the last decade. That number was 97 percent in Italy, 70 percent in Britain, and 63 percent in France. Like most things in economics, the slowdown boils down to supply and demand: the ability of the global economy to produce goods and services, and the desire of consumers and businesses to buy them. What’s worrisome is that weakness in global supply and demand seems to be pushing each other in a vicious circle. It increasingly looks as if something fundamental is broken in the global growth machine  —   and that the usual menu of policies, like interest rate cuts and modest fiscal stimulus, aren’t up to the task of fixing it (though some   policies could help). The underlying reality of low growth will haunt whoever wins the White House in November, as well as leaders in Europe and Japan. An entire way of thinking about the future  —   that children will inevitably live in a much richer country than their parents  —   is thrown into question the longer this lasts. The first step to trying to reverse the slowdown is to understand why it’s happening. A good way to do that is to   predictions from smart economists. In January 2005, as it does every year, the Congressional Budget Office released its forecast for the United States’ budget and economic outlook over the decade to come. If the C. B. O. ’s projections had come true, the United States would have had $3. 1 trillion more economic output in 2015 than it actually did  —   17 percent more. Even if the steep contraction of   hadn’t happened, the shortfall would have been $1. 7 trillion. As a matter of arithmetic, the slowdown in growth has two potential components: people working fewer hours, and less economic output being generated for each hour of labor. Both have contributed to the economy’s underperformance. In 2000, Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist, published a paper titled “Does the ‘New Economy’ Measure Up to the Great Inventions of the Past?” It argued that the internet would not have the same transformative impact on how much economic output would emerge from an hour of human labor as   innovations like electricity, air transport and indoor plumbing did. It was a distinctly minority view in that apex of technological optimism. “People said: ‘Productivity growth is exploding, Gordon. You’re wrong we’re in a new age,’ ” Mr. Gordon said. But as productivity growth slowed several years later, “people started to take my point of view more and more seriously. ” He offers the example of the    computer technology that airlines use. When introduced in the early 2000s, it really did mean greater productivity: Fewer airline clerks were needed for every passenger. But the gain was more a   bump than a continuing trend. Douglas   director of the C. B. O. at the time of the 2005 forecast and now president of the American Action Forum, said technology “just seems to be less special and more comparable to other forms of investments than it had seemed. ” The forecasters thought the average output for an hour of labor would rise 29 percent from 2005 to 2014. Instead it was 15 percent. But it’s not just that each hour of work is producing less than projected. Fewer people are working fewer hours than seemed likely not long ago. The unemployment rate is actually lower than the C. B. O. projected it to be a decade ago (it saw it as stable at 5. 2 percent it was 4. 9 percent in July). But the unemployment rate counts only those actively seeking a job. There were five million fewer Americans in the labor force  —   neither working nor looking  —   in 2015 than projected. An analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers last year estimated that about half of the decline in labor force participation since 2009 was caused by aging of the population (which was anticipated in the projection) and about 14 percent from the economic cycle. About a third of the decline was a mysterious “residual”: younger people leaving the work force, perhaps because they saw little opportunity or viewed the potential wages they could earn as inadequate. Weak productivity and fewer workers are hits to the “supply” side of the economy. But there is evidence that a shortage of demand is a major part of the problem, too. Think of the economy as a car if you try to accelerate far beyond the speed it’s capable of, a car won’t go any faster but the engine will overheat. Similarly, if the voluntary exit of people from the labor force and    gains from technological advances were the entire story behind the growth slowdown, there should be evidence the economy is overheating, resulting in inflation. That’s not what’s happening. Rather, global central banks are keeping their feet on the economic accelerator, and that is not resulting in any overheating at all. The distinction is important if there is to be any hope of solving the   problem. If the issue is a shortage of demand, then some more stimulus should help. If it is entirely on the supply side, then government stimulus is not much use, and policy makers should focus on trying to make companies more innovative and coax people back into the work force. But what if it’s both? Larry Summers, the Harvard economist and a former top official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, watched as growth stayed low and inflation invisible after the 2008 crisis, despite extraordinary stimulus from central banks. Even before the crisis, economic growth had been relatively tepid despite a housing bubble, war spending and low interest rates. In November 2013, he combined those observations into a   speech at an I. M. F. conference arguing that the global economy had, just maybe, settled into a state of “secular stagnation” in which there was insufficient demand, and resulting slow growth, low inflation and low interest rates. While the theory is anything but settled, the case has become stronger in the last three years. But it may not be as simple as supply versus demand. Perhaps people have dropped out of the labor force because their skills and connections have atrophied. Perhaps the productivity slump is caused in part by businesses not making capital investments because they don’t think there will be demand for their products. Mr. Summers, in an interview, frames it as an inversion of “Say’s Law,” the notion that supply creates its own demand: that economywide, people doing the work to create goods and services results in their having the income to then buy those goods and services. In this case, rather, as he has often put it: “Lack of demand creates lack of supply. ” His proposed solution is that the government sharply expand investment in infrastructure, which might provide a jolt of higher demand, which in turn could help the picture on supply  —   helping workers who build roads and bridges become reattached to the work force, for example. As it happens, increasing infrastructure spending is among the few economic policies advocated by both Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump. Economic history is full of unpredictable fits and starts. When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, the internet, a defining feature of his presidency, was rarely mentioned, and Japan seemed to be emerging as the   economic rival of the United States. In other words, there’s a lot we don’t know about the economic future. What we do know is that if something doesn’t change from the recent trend, the 21st century will be a gloomy one.",0
678,"Istanbul, Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu: Your Morning Briefing - The New York Times","Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The Turkish authorities are hunting for the gunman who opened fire at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year’s Day, killing at least 39 people from no fewer than 12 countries. The Islamic State claimed him as “a hero soldier of the caliphate” and appeared to refer to Turkey’s role in the Syrian war. In Iraq, the group claimed a suicide bombing in central Baghdad that killed dozens, even as it makes a brutal   effort to hang on to its only remaining Iraqi stronghold, Mosul. _____ • South Korea’s full Constitutional Court begins formal hearings on the impeachment of President Park  . Public outrage  —   initially aimed at influence by Choi   the daughter of a religious sect leader  —   has turned to broader concerns about the power of the presidency and the influence of   conglomerates like Samsung. The country is seeking the extradition of Ms. Choi’s daughter, who was arrested in Denmark after months of hiding. _____ • House Republicans surprised Washington by voting to hobble a congressional ethics office with no advance notice. The full House will consider the move today as the most powerful   Congress in 20 years goes into session, promising to roll back many of President Obama’s signature policies. Faced with North Korea’s threat to test an intercontinental ballistic missile,   Donald J. Trump took to Twitter to declare bluntly, “It won’t happen!” Over the weekend, Mr. Trump promised to reveal “things that other people don’t know,” possibly as soon as today, about assessments that Russia interfered in the U. S. election. _____ • “We need to fight black money, even though it is hurting little people like me. ” Many Indians agree with that sentiment, voiced by a Delhi taxi driver, saying they are more concerned about reining in corruption than the immediate hardships caused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ban on   bills. India’s Supreme Court ruled that candidates for political office may not run on   or   appeals. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections that will test the strength of Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. _____ • SpaceX traced the explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket in September to the unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum.

Setting speed limits had been the states’ responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors. The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption. And American car buyers sought out more   vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan. The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m. p. h. That’s the fastest in the country, though it’s slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany’s autobahn have no maximum limit. It’s a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour.

679,Hitler or Hillary?,"
A man reads various quotes to people on the street that are either from Adolf Hitler or Hillary Clinton, and the participants are expected to guess which one it is.
First quote:
“We’re going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good.”
The participants guessed Hitler. Nope. It was Hillary.

Second quote:
“I believe the primary role of the state is to teach, train and raise children. Parents have a secondary role.”
The participants guess Hitler. Nope! Wrong again! That was Hillary’s quote.
How telling it is that people have trouble distinguishing between the two. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

680,Dalian Wanda’s Hollywood Event Is Itself a Production - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —   The entire Hollywood press corps turned up. So did dozens of Chinese executives from the   Dalian Wanda Group, some of whom were introduced as “special dignitaries. ” Studio executives? Check. Leaders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Grinning from the front row. But why were there also four women in gold evening gowns serving as ushers and M. C.’s? And why was the “Star Wars” score used as part of the Monday affair, which was held to promote Wanda’s $5 billion studio complex in Qingdao as a home away from home for Hollywood? The answer seemed to be: because Wanda wanted it that way. And, at least for eager Hollywood executives hoping to tap into the   Chinese box office, that was answer enough. As the Motion Picture Association of America’s chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, said in a video infomercial for the Qingdao complex that played as part of the event, “Any time an audience grows, everyone benefits. ” The 5 p. m. presentation, held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began with remarks by Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the academy, an institution dedicated in part to celebrating artistic freedom. “We have so much in common,” Ms. Boone Isaacs said of the Chinese and American film industries. “Art. Creativity. Conscience. Conviction. Just telling your story. ” Hollywood, of course, has been frustrated that Chinese censors restrict the flow of American films into China only a few dozen foreign films are allowed to be exhibited annually. But Ms. Boone Isaacs kept it gauzy. “This art form, like an   carousel, is at its best when it takes us around the world,” she said of cinema. Next up: Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made bolstering the movie industry a priority of his administration. Specifically, he has criticized the practice of studios moving production to other states and countries to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates. That, of course, is exactly the kind of runaway production funding that Wanda announced at Monday’s event. Mr. Garcetti tried to have it both ways. After noting that efforts to bring back production have borne fruit, he said, “We also are not a place that closes in. ” He added, “We will be strong about promoting Los Angeles as a place to film, but we will also be proud to make those international links that are core to our businesses growing. ” With that, Mr. Garcetti introduced Wang Jianlin, Wanda’s chairman. For his part, Mr. Wang spent most of his speech (delivered in Mandarin, with translation provided to the audience via headphones) highlighting the spectacular growth of the Chinese box office. Within a decade, he noted, China will not only far surpass the United States as a movie marketplace, it will control more than 40 percent of global ticket sales. He got a round of applause when he said that American studios needed to “improve the quality” of their movies. “In the recent few years, perhaps because Hollywood movies are trying to minimize their risk, there are less original movies,” he said. After criticizing Hollywood’s   on special effects, he added, “Now that Chinese audiences are smarter, they do not so easily become happy. ” It was almost a wrap. But first came more details about the 40 percent rebate Wanda will offer studios for filming at its    “movie metropolis” in Qingdao. Invited to the stage were executives from studios that had already signed up, including Lionsgate,   Legendary Entertainment, Arclight Films and Kylin Pictures. As one of the women in gold gowns said in closing, “It’s very exciting!”",0

Dallas readers: Yves writes to say her plane is getting in early, and so, there having been no untoward events, the Meetup will be held as scheduled! 
TPP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: A week of pressure from four Belgian regions opposed to CETA, led by the courageous Walloons, produced a revised “joint interpretive instrument” and, importantly, a new list of conditions that must be met before Belgium can ratify the deal” [ Rabble.ca ]. “Unfortunately, the joint interpretive ‘instrument’ is mostly artful deception. To take just one example, the instrument’s affirmation of the right to regulate is meaningless. Of course, the parties have not entirely given up their right to regulate. But the fact is, even if the instrument had full legal force under international law, CETA would still threaten the ability of Canada or EU governments to regulate in the public interest, enhance public services, and hold multinational companies accountable for their actions. ‘The critical point missing,’ as we wrote previously, ‘is that while the parties retain the right to regulate, they must do so in conformity with their CETA obligations and commitments.'” So it will be interesting to see if Obama tries a similar deception on TPP. But wait! 
Wallonia’s principled stand did, however, produce some important results. While most of the media attention in Canada appears to have focused on the joint instrument, the more interesting and potentially significant development may be the accord between Belgian governments that spells out the grounds for Belgium’s federal government to sign CETA. 
For example, Belgium will now ask the European Court of Justice to give an opinion on the legality of CETA’s investment court system within the EU. Even more importantly, four of Belgium’s regional governments also state that they reject CETA (notably its investment chapter) as negotiated and that Belgium will refuse to ratify the treaty unless these concerns are addressed. In other words, while Belgium is now in a position to sign CETA, it will not be able to ratify the deal as it stands. 
This means that CETA’s investment chapter, at a minimum, must be revised or the investment court system scrapped, before CETA can be ratified by Belgium. The accord also includes assurances that if any Belgian regional government refuses to ratify CETA, the federal government must give notice to the EU that Belgium cannot ratify, an act that could potentially trigger the end of CETA’s provisional application in all European member states. 
The German constitutional court staked out a similar position in the event that Germany fails to ratify CETA. That decision, by the way, will not be made by the German government alone, but in conjunction with Germany’s second chamber, which is currently controlled by the anti-CETA Greens and Left parties. 
So while CETA proponents have undoubtedly cleared a big albeit unanticipated hurdle in getting the deal signed, their machinations may have made CETA’s full ratification even less likely. CETA’s passage in Europe is far from assured, despite the apparent breakthrough in Belgium. 
And then there is the voice of the Canadian establishment– 
CETA: “CETA puts Canada’s trade debate to rest once and for all” [ Globe and Mail ]. “The rationale for launching CETA in Canada was in large part to establish a measure of diversification from the country’s trade relations within the North American free-trade agreement. Given the tone around trade in the U.S. presidential election, this decision now looks especially prescient.” 
CETA: “What the Canada-EU Deal Means for the Future of Trade” [ Fortune ]. “All of the factors that drove Europe to conclude this agreement provide insights for current trade challenges in the U.S. President Obama is trying to get Congress to approve just after the presidential election the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement… Now is the time to resolve as many specific congressional objections to the deal as possible. It is impossible to renegotiate the TPP in the time available, so as with the last-minute negotiations between the EU and Belgium, both the administration and Congress will need to be pragmatic and come to an agreement quickly on outstanding issues.” 
TISA: “The 21st round of negotiations for the Trade in Services Agreement kicks off this morning in Geneva, and stakes are high for significant progress to be made this round in order for the deal to wrap up by its early December deadline. Significant issues remain, including data flows — where the European Union is still working to come up with a consolidated position — and new services, on which the EU and others are continuing to push for the right to apply different regulations to domestic and foreign constituents rather than afford the same treatment to all TISA partners. The round is scheduled to last through Nov. 10” [ Politico ]. 
2016 
Days until: 5. That’s not very many days! 
Debates 
“Presidential Candidates Dr. Jill Stein & Gov. Gary Johnson [Pt. 1]” [ Tavis Smiley ]. A forum-style “conversation” between the two. 
“‘I had a team of people who were relentless, totally in the head of what Trump might do,’ [Hillary Clinton] says” [ People ] “‘A lot of this comes down to who gets into whose head. It’s like an athletic contest or maybe a high-stakes entertainment performance.” 
War Drums 
“In the five and a half years since the uprising in Syria began, it has become the most catastrophic war of our young century” [Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker ]. I would have thought that our invasion of Iraq in 2003 set the baseline for “catastrophic”? What the heck was Filkins thinking when he wrote that sentence? And The New Yorker used to be famous for its fact-checking. When did that get crapified, anyhow? 
The Voters 
“[W]hile Trump and many of his supporters may fetishize a past that is deeply retrograde, liberals and progressives have also demonstrated a troubling tendency to fetishize a future that they presume is on their side. There’s something peculiarly telling about this kind of progress fetishism, which has been conscripted as ideology-of-first-resort for Clintonite New Democrats” [ The Baffer ]. “When our historical terrain has effectively focused most of our political energies to differentiating ourselves from the not-woke-enough opponents of progress, we can lose all critical introspection. We can uncritically pass over the fact that, say, liberal multiculturalism can end up being really racist , tolerance of queer sexualities can end up repackaging biologically determinist languages of eugenics, and so on. Moreover, as the rise of the New Democrats has made crystal clear (from Bill and Hillary to Obama), we will dependably base our biggest political choices on our future-focused need to have our place on the right side of history confirmed. So what if that means more drone strikes, deportations, mass incarceration of minorities, destructive free trade agreements, corporate concessions, and financial deregulation? It’s messy ‘maintaining’ history, after all.” 
“Early Voting a Poor Predictor of Final Results” [ RealClearPolitics ]. One of several reasons: “[W]e don’t know the effect to which campaign strategy is creating the appearance of a participation surge by merely cannibalizing Election Day voters by mobilizing voters who would have voted on Election Day anyway.” 
Downballot 
“The presidential race may be inducing whiplash, but the House battleground remains relatively stable in the final week. We rate only 40 House races in Lean or Toss Up, and Democrats would need to sweep 35 of them to win control, so Republicans remain overwhelming favorites to hold onto their majority. But there is still plenty of uncertainty about the size of that majority: Democrats could gain anywhere from 5 to 20 seats” [ Cook Political Report ]. ” Republican voters have begun coming home to Donald Trump amid the Comey news… Even if control is not at risk, the ultimate size of the GOP majority matters a great deal, especially to Speaker Paul Ryan. To the extent Republicans lose seats, almost all of the casualties will be swing-district moderates who are more loyal to Ryan than Trump. The narrower the majority, the less room for error Ryan will have in winning reelection to his position and navigating the 2017 legislative minefield.” 
Well done, DSCC: For Senate this year, Dems nominated two weed opponents (NV, NH), corp lobbyists (PA, IN), & a trust fund kid former Republican (FL)

The Trail 
“SEPTA strike halts transit service in Philadelphia” [ Progressive Railroading ]. Effect on voting? 
“[T]he race between [Clinton and Trump] is now a precise dead heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll, 46-46 percent. A majority, 55 percent, continues to expect Clinton to win, though that’s down 5 points from its peak last week” [ ABC ]. ” Among other results is a gradual collapse in support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson, from a peak of 9 percent support in September to just 3 percent now. Jill Stein of the Green Party has 2 percent and has held steady.” Amazingly, Trump now leads on honesty and trustworthiness. Of course, it’s madness to focus on individual polls; RCP’s 4-way average has Clinton up by 1.9, though falling. 
“With the fallout over the FBI email probe continuing to take up oxygen, Trump has stayed uncharacteristically on message. Campaigning near Philadelphia on Tuesday, the GOP nominee and his running mate focused on the projected 25 percent average increase in premiums for some Affordable Care Act plans, as open enrollment began. Trump let Mike Pence do most of the talking, and the Indiana governor closed his remarks on repealing the law by asking Republicans to “come home'” [ RealClearPolitics ]. Hitherto, Trump has been the anti-Napoleon, always interrupting his enemy when they are making a mistake. Not so this week (though there are 5 days to go). Kellyanne Conway must have gotten Trump’s attention somehow. Or Ivanka. 
“Donald Trump Voters, Just Hear Me Out” [The Moustache of Understanding, New York Times ]. Four paragraphs in, he turns to the topic of Trump: “Trump is not only a flawed politician, he’s an indecent human being.” Persuasive! I dunno. If a vote for Trump would finally force Friedman off the Times Op-Ed page, would it be worth it? Tough call. 
Realignment 
“Will this be the election that finally kills off the Democratic and Republican parties?” [ McClatchy ]. “Just days before Election Day, interviews with more than 40 independent voters in swing states underscores that the nomination of two deeply unpopular candidates for president is aggravating and reinforcing a growing trend in the country away from the Democratic and Republican parties, which more and more voters see as out of touch with their lives and out of date in a new century. The number of free agent voters registering as independent or unaffiliated is soaring, while Republican and Democratic numbers flatline. Independent registrations have jumped since 2008 by 22.3 percent in states that keep registration data by party. Democrats over that same time increased 2.7 percent and Republicans 3.6 percent…” 
“6 Reasons Why A New Civil War Is Possible And Terrifying” [ Cracked ]. “‘Trust’ isn’t just an intangible concept when we’re talking about the potential for civil warfare. Sinisa Malesevic is a professor who studies the sociology of civil wars and a survivor of the Yugoslavian civil war. He’s someone Marvel really should’ve reached out to for script advice, and he noted the breakdown of trust was one of the first traumatizing steps to war, ‘… in a very short period of time, there is a complete sense of fear, you do not know who is who, who is supporting which side … that fear spreads.'” And: “Colonel Couvillon also thought any conflict was likely to start in a rural area, ‘…people talk about, is it gonna be class warfare, race warfare … is it gonna be north versus south? Personally, I think it’s gonna be urban versus rural.'” Another interesting piece from Cracked, of all places. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
“Opinion: Hillary Clinton is irreparably damaged, even if she wins” [ MarketWatch ]. “[W]e are in for a fiasco in politics that will make even this fiasco of a campaign pale by comparison. There is hardly any scenario that is too far-fetched. Even if the polls are right and Clinton’s lead translates into an electoral victory, she will be so damaged going into office that her chances of getting anything done will be virtually nil. In this sense alone, Trump’s claim that this scandal is “worse than Watergate” could prove to be true. As an incumbent, Richard Nixon at least had an administration in place when he won re-election in 1972, though it took nearly another two years before he was forced to resign under threat of impeachment.” 
“U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday he believes Hillary Clinton’s actions with her private email server are impeachable offenses should she be elected president” [ Beloit Daily News ]. “Johnson cited 18 U.S. Code 793 (f) and 18 U.S. Code 2071, which have to do with the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to national defense. Johnson honed in on the latter of the two, which reads in part that anyone found to have concealed or removed records ‘shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.’‘I’m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,’ Johnson said. ‘I would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.'” In principle, I agree. If a high official can privatize their communications, and then decide what to destroy and what to retain before turning them over to law enforcement, the term “public records” becomes literally meaningless. Nixon, deep within his withered and wormy soul, retained a shred of conscience: He didn’t simply destroy the tapes . Clinton would have destroyed the tapes without hesitation; in fact, that’s exactly what she did with “her”— that is, the public’s — mail. 
“Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner told conservative radio host Charlie Sykes Tuesday that there would be a ‘constitutional crisis’ if Clinton was indicted, and when asked about impeachment, answered, ‘I think that is something that is speculative in nature. I’m speculating, what I can say is that I think Richard Nixon would have been indicted and he would have been impeached. He stopped the impeachment by resigning as a result of Watergate and he stopped the indictment by President Ford pardoning him” [ CNN ]. On pardons, see Jerri-Lynn’s post today . 
Stats Watch 
ADP Employment Report, October 2016: “ADP sees significant softening for Friday’s employment report, estimating October private payrolls will come in at 147,000” [ Econoday ]. “Though ADP’s revision does point to an upward revision to September’s data in Friday’s report, the October estimate is soft and could further lower expectations for a rate hike at today’s FOMC meeting.” And but: ” ADP is showing jobs growth equalling the rate of people entering the jobs market. The growth this month is as Econintersect forecasted based on economic potential” [ Econintersect ]. “ADP employment has not been a good predictor of BLS non-farm private job growth. 
Gallup U.S. Job Creation Index, October 2016: “American workers’ reports of hiring activity at their place of employment remained relatively strong in October, with many more saying their employer was adding rather than subtracting jobs” [ Econoday ]. “For nearly all of Gallup’s JCI trend since August 2008, net hiring in the private sector has far outpaced government net hiring. But the latest poll shows the narrowest gap between net hiring in the two sectors since April 2009, with nongovernment hiring (plus 32) essentially tied with government hiring (plus 31).” 
MBA Mortgage Applications, week of October 28, 2016: “Purchase applications for home mortgages fell a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent in the October 28 week, following a sharp 7 percent decline in the prior week to the lowest level since January” [ Econoday ]. 
Shipping: “US west coast employers and [ILWU and PMA] union leaders are to continue talks about extending the current employment contract covering dockworkers.The two sides met on Tuesday to discuss an extension beyond mid-2019 as part of an effort to restore confidence in ports along the Pacific seaboard” [ Lloyd’s List ]. 
Shipping: “Are conditions finally improving for the air cargo industry?” [ Air Cargo News ]. “September market round-up shows that air cargo volume demand increased by 5% year on year in September — a level of increase not seen for two years. ‘With such an increase in total weight transported, a further worldwide yield improvement over previous months, and industry sources claiming that October will be even better, one could be forgiven for thinking that the industry shows signs of improving health,’ the analyst said.” There’s a calendar effect that only accounts for a fraction of the increase. “At the recent Air Cargo Forum there was much speculation as to what had caused the improvements.” A sporty game! 
Shipping: “A majority of Splash readers fear container freight rates will only pick up later than 2020. With 10 days to go until voting closes in our quarterly online survey, called MarPoll, roughly one quarter of the more than 500 respondents to date feel container freight rates will pick up only after 2020” [ Splash 24/7 ]. “‘Shipping may have to accept the bubble has burst and what was will not be again. There is a new normal and companies need to plan as such,’ one respondent noted” 
Shipping: “[The Boston Consulting Group Inc.] said shipping capacity will outstrip demand by between 8.2% and 13.8% in 2020, compared with a 7% gap today. If borne out, that forecast would indicate this year’s plunging freight rates and shrinking profits for marine carriers will only grow worse, particularly on major trade lanes across the Pacific and between Asia and Europe” [ Wall Street Journal , “More Pain Ahead for Ocean Shipping”]. “The shipping industry hasn’t adjusted to a slowdown in global trade, with shipyards churning out giant container vessels and carriers holding onto excess capacity even as rates fall. Historically, container shipping demand grew over 5% annually, often outpacing global economic growth. Between 2015 and 2020, BCG estimates container demand will rise between 2.2% and 3.8% annually.” And we’re still building out warehouses… 
Shipping: “Cummins shipped just 16,400 engines in North America in the quarter, down 33% from a year ago. That’s in line with a downturn in orders for big rigs that’s triggered layoffs among truck makers and led Cummins to cut its spending on research and engineering more than 14% in the first nine months of the year” [ Wall Street Journal ]. 
Shipping: “Shipping finally emerging from 2009 downturn, Mitropoulos argues” [ Lloyd’s List ]. “Signs are finally materialising that the industry is emerging from its protracted downturn, according to a former secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization.Efthimios Mitropoulos was speaking on Tuesday morning at the Shipping and the Law Conference in Naples.” Great courage! 
Honey for the Bears: “Most of the leading indicators are based on factors which are known to have significant backward revisions – and one cannot take any of their trends to the bank. I continue to pose the question: “[W]hat good is a leading indicator where the data is continued to change after it is issued?'” [ Econintersect ]. “The only indicators with minimal backward revision are ECRI, RecessionALERT, and the Chemical Activity Barometer. Unfortunately, the Chemical Activity Barometer is targeted to the industrial sector of the economy – and at best seems to be a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator. Both ECRI and RecessionALERT were forecasting economic improvement beginning at mid-2016 – and is now forecasting flat (but relatively better) growth beginning 5 months from now. Econintersect sees NO dynamic which will deliver better growth anyone will feel in the foreseeable future. All economic growth will only be seen when one uses a calculator.” 
Infrastructure: “A pipeline explosion in Alabama is roiling U.S. fuel markets and putting a spotlight on tight domestic shipping capacity. The major Colonial pipeline fuel artery was severed for the second time in two months this week” [ Wall Street Journal ]. 
Fodder for the Bulls: “Update: The Endless Parade of Recession Calls” [ Calculated Risk ]. “Looking at the economic data, the odds of a recession in 2016 are very low (extremely unlikely in my view). [a recession in 2017 is very unlikely]. Someday I’ll make another recession call, but I’m not even on recession watch now.” 
Fodder for the Bulls: “Eurozone factories had their most active month for almost three years in October, and raised their prices for the first time in more than a year, according to a survey of purchasing managers released Wednesday” [ Wall Street Journal , “Eurozone Factory Survey Shows Expansion”]. 
Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 18 Fear (previous close: 22, Fear) [ CNN ]. One week ago: 43 (Fear). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 2 at 11:26am. Heading for single digits? 
Police State Watch 
“Raided but never charged, cannabis distributor seeks return of seized assets” [ San Diego Tribune (RF)]. “‘It’s the dirty little secret of the American justice system,’ [James] Slatic said in an interview. ‘They can come in and take all your money and property just on the say-so of a police officer. Once they do that, you have to go to court and prove why your money is not guilty.'” (Obama made noises about ending asset forfeiture, but resumed it . Of course, asset forfeiture will be a lot easier when digital cash arrives! 
Standing Rock and #NoDAPL 
“I used to think there was no rational argument for civilian possession of military-style weapons. But in light of the disparate treatment of the armed Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupiers (who were acquitted of all charges Friday) and the protesters in North Dakota supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in its fight against construction of an oil pipeline, it’s apparent that such weapons are now an effective component of the protester’s toolkit” [Letter to the Editor, Los Angeles Times ]. Well, the difference isn’t that the Malheur occupiers were white, given that the (sadly but mostly) white Occupy movement was treated to a 17-city coordinated paramilitary crackdown orchestrated by Obama’s DHS; the difference is that they were right wing (and white).

Here’s Where to Donate” [ Money (!!)]. “A GoFundMe set up by protester Ho Waste Wakiya Wicasa has raised more than $1 million, which will be used for the camp’s operating expenses. “The money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn’t have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,” Wicasa told Fox News. The funds raised have been used for groceries, yurts, toilets, a medical area, a generator, and bail for those arrested.”

This creates a more objective review process – reducing bias and the threat of lawsuits – and takes pressure off supervisors.

Of course, exercising, eating organic food, and pushing children to use their spare time usefully are not inherently bad things. However, they become markers of bourgeois values when they are marshaled to assert one class’s moral superiority over another and to justify social inequality.

682,Breakdown of the Clinton Money Machine,"Breakdown of the Clinton Money Machine November 12, 2016 
As troubling as Donald Trump’s election may be, it carries greater hope for some positive good than the alternative of Hillary Clinton, who represented a corrupt, money-churning machine, writes John Chuckman. 
By John Chuckman 
Brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election analysis, there are some observations, which deserve attention and which unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons (and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of democracy, enlightenment and progressivity). 
The election demonstrated perhaps better than ever, and better than has been generally recognized, that America is, indeed, a plutocracy. It took a genuine American oligarch, a self-proclaimed billionaire, a man with a lifetime’s economic empire-building, to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically well-connected, a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well ever-flowing with money for their ambitions. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo) 
It was the ever-flowing well of money, drilled by Bill Clinton with help from some extremely shady friends, such as Jeffrey Epstein, that made the Clintons keystone establishment figures in the Democratic Party. It was not personal charm or exceptional political generalship – although Bill, in his heyday, displayed some of both of those – that earned the Clintons their place, it was the money, the “mother’s milk of politics.” In what is euphemistically called “fund raising,” many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by Bill Clinton’s efforts. 
Hillary Clinton fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence. She lacked Bill’s superficial charm, but she certainly more than shared his ambition. On the charm front, when she was ready to move into running for office, she adopted, perhaps under Bill’s tutelage, a kind of forced set of expressions with arched eyebrows, bugged-out eyes, and a smile as big as her lips would allow. These expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various onlookers or waving helter-skelter whenever she campaigned. 
Her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a Christmas Parade or of the late Harpo Marx at his most exuberant. These were not natural for her. They were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive housewife, both in a governor’s mansion and later in the White House, bizarre because she indulged her husband’s non-stop predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more outgoing and successful politician-husband. 
Money Talks 
Anyway, Hillary knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in American politics. She determined to build a political war chest long ago, and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed view, as when running for the Senate, when sources of big money suggested another view would be more acceptable. She was anything but constant in the views that she embraced because when she ran for the Senate she spent record amounts of money, embarrassingly large amounts. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meets with Saudi King Abdullah in Riyadh on March 30, 2012. [State Department photo] In her years of speaking engagements, she aimed at special interests that could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees. Later, in the influential, appointed post of Secretary of State – coming, as it does, into personal contact with every head of government or moneyed, big-time international schemer – she unquestionably played an aggressive “pay for play” with them all. It appears that covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about.
A second big fact of the election is that both major American political parties are rather sick and fading. The Republican Party has been broken for a very long time. It hobbled along for some decades with the help of various gimmicks, hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like “family values,” public prayer in schools and catering to the Christian Right – along with anti-flag burning Constitutional amendments — and now it is truly out of gas. 
The Republican Party had been given a breather, some new life, by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. He had an extremely mixed record as President, but he was popular, held in some affection, and did have a clear vision, but his effect on the party was not lasting. Trump could be seen as another Reagan, but I think the comparison is superficial. Trump literally hijacked the party. He was not deliriously crowned by its establishment. 
The Republican Party itself was formed not long before Abraham Lincoln’s candidacy out of the remains of worn out and collapsed predecessors, including the Whigs and Free-Soil Democrats. Parties do not last forever, and here was Trump creating something of a minor political revolution inside a tired and fairly directionless old party, a phenomenon which I do not think was sufficiently noticed. 
In the Republican primaries, he was opposed by tired, boring men like Jeb Bush, seeking to secure an almost inherited presidency, and a dark, intensely unlikable, phony Christian fundamentalist like Ted Cruz, and it proved to be no contest. Trump’s capture of the GOP nomination was a remarkable political achievement, but I think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party. 
The press was too busy attacking Trump from the start to take notice or do any intelligent analysis, and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the Establishment that he represented. His most promising quality was his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the Neocon Wars that Hillary Clinton embraced and promised to expand. 
A Democratic Party in Trouble 
But the Democratic Party is in serious trouble, too. It has a great deal of internal rot, as the WikiLeaks material from the Democratic National Committee clearly shows us. Arrogance, lack of direction, ignorance of the people whom the party has always claimed to serve, bad decision-making, and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms. Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a Democratic presidential debate sponsored by CNN. 
It would have been impossible for the party to have so made up its mind and committed its resources to Hillary Clinton without serious rot. She has always had strong negatives in polling, always been (rightly) suspected concerning her honesty. 
The WikiLeaks material tells us about many internal conflicts, including harsh high-level judgments of Hillary’s decision-making, resentment over the backstabbing character of daughter Chelsea who is said to resemble Hillary in her behavior and attitudes, and the belief of some that Hillary just should not have run. 
And, frankly, Hillary Clinton had become for many a rather tiresome, used-up figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected. But they not only blindly supported her, they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable contender, Bernie Sanders. 
Sanders might well have been able to win the election for the Democrats, but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy out-of-hand. After all, there were Bill and Hillary beckoning toward their running well of money. 
In hindsight, it might be just as well that Sanders was cheated out of the nomination. He proved a weak individual in the end, giving in to just the forces that he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down. There he was, out on the hustings, supporting everything he ever opposed as personified in Hillary Clinton. Men of that nature do not stand up well to Generals and Admirals and the heads of massive corporations, a quality which I do think we have some right to expect Trump to display. 
Public Distrust 
Another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of Trump than the avoidance of Hillary that caused the defeat. The numbers are unmistakable. Yes, Trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial figure, but Hillary simply did badly, not approaching the support Obama achieved in key states, again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a well-liked figure and the Party blundered badly in running her. President-elect Donald Trump 
But again, money talks, and the Clintons, particularly Bill, are the biggest fundraisers they have had in our lifetime. No one was ready to say no to the source of all that money. 
Now, to many Americans, the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a revolution, although a revolution conducted through ballots, any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive military-security state. 
In a way, it does represent something of a revolutionary event, owing to the fact that Trump the Oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views. And, as in any revolution, even a small one, there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes. 
The historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come. Lyndon Johnson, life-long crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless Vietnam War, did more for the rights of black Americans than any other modern president. Franklin Roosevelt, son of wealthy establishment figures, provided remarkable leadership in the Great Depression, restoring hopes and dreams for millions. 
Change, important, change, never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties. It always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality. 
I have some limited but important hopes for Trump. I am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual person, and after the experience of Barack Obama, who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a crushing, bloody disappointment, I can never build up substantial hopes for any politician. And what was the choice anyway? Hillary Clinton was a bought-and-paid one-way ticket to hell. 
Trump offers two areas of some hope, and these both represent real change. The first is in reducing America’s close to out-of-control military aggressiveness abroad. This aggressiveness, reflecting momentum from what can only be called the Cheney-Rumsfeld Presidency, continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of Obama and was boosted and encouraged by Hillary as Secretary of State. 
Hillary did a lot of killing during her tenure inside the federal government, advocating and promoting military interventions as First Lady, U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. She along with Obama is responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of men, women and children, many of them literally torn apart by bombs. 
Welfare of Americans 
The other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary Americans who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades. George W. Bush’s lame reaction to Hurricane Katrina (before he was internationally shamed into some action) has become the normal pattern for America’s national government when it comes to ordinary Americans. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt at a press conference. 
Inside the Democratic Party, the truth is that the legacy of FDR has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role, and of course never did in the Republican Party. By welfare, I do not mean the kind of state assistance to the poor that Bill Clinton himself worked to end. Nothing can impress someone not familiar with America’s dark corners more than a visit to places like Detroit or Gary or Chicago’s South Side, parts of New Orleans, or Newark or dozens of other places where Americans live in conditions in every way comparable to Third World hellholes. 
No, I mean the people’s general well-being. Trump’s approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs. I don’t know whether he can succeed, but, just as he asked people in some of his speeches, “What do you have to lose?” Just having someone in power who pays any attention to the “deplorables” is a small gain. 
People should never think of the Clintons as liberal or progressive, and that was just as much true for Bill as it is for Hillary. His record as President – apart from his embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office with a young female intern and his recruitment of Secret Service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning runs – was actually pretty appalling. 
In his own words, he “ended welfare as we know it.” He signed legislation that would send large numbers of young black men to prison. He also signed legislation that contributed to the country’s later financial collapse under George W. Bush. He often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back off, leaving them dangling, when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming. 
His FBI conducted the assault on Waco, killing about 80 people needlessly. A pharmaceutical plant in Sudan was destroyed by cruise missiles for no good reason. There were a number of scandals that were never fully explained to the public. 
It was his Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who answered, unblinkingly, a television interviewer’s question about a half million Iraqi children who died owing to America’s embargo, “We think the price is worth it.” He committed the war crime of bombing Belgrade, including the intentional destruction of the Serb TV building. When news of the horrors of the Rwanda genocide were first detected by his government, the order secretly went out to shut up about it. No effort was made to intervene in that case. 
No, any real change in America could never come from people like the Clintons, either one of them.

684,"California, at Forefront of Climate Fight, Won’t Back Down to Trump - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   Foreign governments concerned about climate change may soon be spending more time dealing with Sacramento than Washington.   Donald J. Trump has packed his cabinet with nominees who dispute the science of global warming. He has signaled he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. He has belittled the notion of global warming and attacked policies intended to combat it. But California  —   a state that has for 50 years been a leader in environmental advocacy  —   is about to step unto the breach. In a show of defiance, Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, and legislative leaders said they would work directly with other nations and states to defend and strengthen what were already far and away the most aggressive policies to fight climate change in the nation. That includes a legislatively mandated target of reducing carbon emissions in California to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. “California can make a significant contribution to advancing the cause of dealing with climate change, irrespective of what goes on in Washington,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “I wouldn’t underestimate California’s resolve if everything moves in this extreme climate denial direction. Yes, we will take action. ” The prospect of California’s elevated role on climate change is the latest sign of how this state, where Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump by more than four million votes, is preparing to resist the policies of the incoming White House. State and city officials have already vowed to fight any attempt by Washington to crack down on undocumented immigrants Los Angeles officials last week set aside $10 million to help fund the legal costs of residents facing deportation. The environmental effort poses decided risks for this state. For one thing, Mr. Trump and Republicans have the power to undercut California’s climate policies. The Trump administration could reduce funds for the state’s vast research community  —   including two national laboratories  —   which has contributed a great deal to climate science and energy innovation, or effectively nullify state regulations on clean air emissions and automobile fuel standards. “They could basically stop enforcement of the Clean Air Act and CO2 emissions,” said Hal Harvey, president of Energy Innovation, a policy research group in San Francisco. “That would affect California because it would constrain markets. It would make them fight political and legal battles rather than scientific and technological ones. ” And some business leaders warned that California’s embrace of environmental regulations  —   from emission reductions to new regulations imposing mandatory energy efficiency standards on computers and monitors  —   could put it at a disadvantage, all the more so as conservatives elsewhere move to roll back environmental regulations. “If the other states pursue    policies, and we continue to go it on our own with our climate change policies, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage for either relocating companies or growing companies here, particularly manufacturing factories,” said Rob Lapsley, the president of the California Business Roundtable. When California enacted its climate reduction standards last year, it drew fierce criticism from state business leaders. The bills “impose very severe caps on the emission of greenhouse gases in California, without requiring the regulatory agencies to give any consideration to the impacts on our economy, disruptions in everyone’s daily lives or the fact that California’s population will grow almost 50 percent between 1990 and 2030,” the California Chamber of Commerce said. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment Democrats relish the prospect of challenging Mr. Trump on climate change, noting that other states have followed California in trying to curb emissions. And California has the weight to get into the ring: It is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, with a gross domestic product of approximately $2. 5 trillion. “California more than ever is strongly committed to moving forward on our climate leadership,” said Kevin de Leon, the leader of the State Senate. “We will not deviate from our leadership because of one election. ” The state has been at the forefront of climate and energy policy for more than half a century, beginning with setting appliance and vehicle emissions standards in the 1960s. Those policies will continue, analysts said, in no small part because they are overwhelmingly popular here: 69 percent of Californians said they supported the law requiring the state to roll back emissions in a July survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. “This is not something that’s going to be fueled by dislike of Donald Trump,” said Adrienne Alvord, the western states director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “This will be fueled by people liking these policies and wanting to see them continue. Our leadership and the people of California support the science. ” Ms. Alvord said that in the new political climate, the   industry may feel emboldened to take on some of the state’s energy and climate initiatives. “But they would be fighting a very uphill battle,” she said. “Politically, it’s going to be very difficult to really slow this train down. ” California’s economy is powered by a   industry and prominent research institutions that make it well placed to continue to lead on energy and climate. The state has already taken on an international role. Mr. Brown has spearheaded the Under 2 MOU initiative, backed by a coalition of state, local and regional governments in 33 countries  —   more than 160 jurisdictions with a total population of more than 1 billion  —   that have agreed to deep emissions cuts to try to keep global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3. 6 degrees Fahrenheit. California’s    program, which imposes a limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allows companies to buy and sell emissions credits, is linked with one in Quebec. The program has suffered recently from weak sales, and it is facing a legal challenge from the state Chamber of Commerce. Its future is likely to be the subject of debate by the Legislature. State officials have also had discussions with other countries, including Mexico and China, about joining forces on    policies. Domestically, California has long been a leader on vehicle emissions. The federal Environmental Protection Agency allowed it to have tougher standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act, and more than a dozen states have adopted its standards. The Trump administration could deny the state a new waiver, as the George W. Bush administration did, which would lead to a court fight. The   initiatives here have become an intricate part of the economy and a source of growth and jobs. Federal cutbacks would no doubt hurt the state to some extent, but analysts say the very   policies that may soon come under attack by the new administration have been a significant factor in California’s economic reversal. “If the   and his administration work to undermine our climate leadership, they will hurt our economy,” Mr. de Leon said. “They will kill jobs. And ultimately, they will hurt the economy of the United States. We are 13 percent of the overall G. D. P. ” Still, California officials and environmentalists said climate measures in place here will undoubtedly be undercut if the Trump administration rolls back environmental policies put in place by President Obama. “Our system works better  —   our    system and other ways of addressing climate change  —   if we have more company,” said Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the Assembly. “The more company we have, the better. ” Dan Jacobson, the state director of Environment California, said the state can “keep doing what we are doing, leading the way. ” “But will that be enough, soon enough? Not without the partnership of other cities, states, and nations. So that’s why it’s so dangerous for Trump to pull out of the accord,” he wrote in an email, referring to the Paris climate agreement. Mr. Brown will be a critical player in this fight. He has presented himself as an environmental advocate since he first served as governor in the 1970s. As he enters what will probably be his last two years in public life, he has seized on the prospect of leading an   environmental movement. “We’ve got the lawyers and we’ve got the scientists and are ready to fight,” Mr. Brown declared in a speech in San Francisco earlier this month to the American Geophysical Union. “We’re ready to win. ” Mr. Brown, in the interview, called Mr. Trump’s election a setback for the climate movement, but predicted that it would be fleeting. “In a paradoxical way, it could speed up the efforts of leaders in the world to take climate change seriously,” he said. “The shock of official congressional and presidential denial will reverberate through the world. ”",0

Facebook submarines , russian navy , black sea fleet 
The fifth non-nuclear submarine of project 636.3, The Veliki Novgorod, has joined the Russian Navy, a TASS correspondent reports from the flag-hoisting ceremony at the Admiralty Shipyards in St. Petersburg, attended by the Russian Navy’s Deputy commander, Vice-Admiral Alexander Fedotenkov and the shipyards’ CEO Alexander Buzakov. 
""The Veliki Novgorod submarine has been through all government certification tests. All of the previous submarines in that series built for the Black Sea Fleet have confirmed the expected parameters, too,"" Buzakov said. 
The Veliki Novgorod is the fifth in the group of six submarines of project 636.3 (Varshavyanka) built for the Black Sea Fleet. The first two - The Novorossiysk and The Rostov-on-Don were delivered in 2014, and another two, The Stary Oskol and The Krasnodar, in 2015. By the end of this year the Russian Navy will have the sixth submarine in the series, The Kolpino. The flag-hoisting ceremony is due November 25. 
Another six Varshavyanka subs will be built at the Admiralty shipyards for the Pacific Fleet. The contract was signed at the Army-2016 forum near Moscow. The last submarine in the second group is to be delivered in 2021.

687,"G.E., the 124-Year-Old Software Start-Up - The New York Times","It may not qualify as a   eureka moment, but Jeffrey R. Immelt, chief executive of General Electric, recalls the June day in 2009 that got him thinking. He was speaking with G. E. scientists about new jet engines they were building, laden with sensors to generate a trove of data from every flight  —   but to what end? That data could someday be as valuable as the machinery itself, if not more so. But G. E. couldn’t make use of it. “We had to be more capable in software,” Mr. Immelt said he decided. Maybe G. E.  —   a maker of power turbines, jet engines, locomotives and   equipment  —   needed to think of its competitors as Amazon and IBM. Back then, G. E. was returning to its   roots and navigating the global financial crisis, shedding much of its bloated finance arm, GE Capital. That winnowing went on for years as billions of dollars in assets were sold, passing a milestone this summer when GE Capital was removed from the government’s short list of financial institutions deemed “too big to fail. ” But in 2011, G. E. also quietly opened a software center in San Ramon, Calif. 24 miles east of San Francisco, across the bay. Today one of San Ramon’s most important projects is to build a computer operating system, but on an industrial scale  —   a Microsoft Windows or Google Android for factories and industrial equipment. The project is central to G. E.’s drive to become what Mr. Immelt says will be a “top 10 software company” by 2020. Silicon Valley veterans are skeptical. “G. E. is trying to do this the way a big company does, by throwing thousands of people and billions of dollars at it,” said Thomas M. Siebel, a technology entrepreneur who is now chief executive of C3 IoT, a   that has done work for G. E. “But they’re not software people. ” The San Ramon complex, home to GE Digital, now employs 1, 400 people. The buildings are designed to suit the   working ways of software developers:   floors, bench seating, whiteboards, couches for impromptu meetings, balconies overlooking the grounds and kitchen areas with snacks. Many industries see digital threats, of course. Yet the scope of the challenge is magnified at G. E. a    company and the nation’s largest manufacturer, with more than 300, 000 employees worldwide. Employees companywide have been making pilgrimages to San Ramon for technology briefings, but also to soak in the culture. Their marching orders are to try to adapt the digital wizardry and   habits of Silicon Valley to G. E.’s world of industrial manufacturing. G. E.’s success or failure over the next decade, Mr. Immelt says, depends on this transformation. He calls it “probably the most important thing I’ve worked on in my career. ” Apparently, there is no Plan B. “It’s this or bust,” he said. The march of digital technology  —   mainly inexpensive sensors, powerful computing and clever software  —   into the industrial world has been underway for years under the guise of “the internet of things” or “the industrial internet. ” It is the next battlefield as companies fight to develop the dominant software layer that connects the machines. It promises to be a huge market for new products, improved service and efficiency gains in industries like energy, transportation and health care. By 2020, the industrial internet market will reach $225 billion, G. E. executives predicted in a recent meeting with analysts. So far, a major application has been predictive maintenance. Software analyzes the data generated by a machine to identify early warning signals that it needs repair, before it breaks down. The data volumes are exploding as machines new and old spawn sensors. By 2020, G. E. estimates that the data flowing off its machines in use will jump a hundredfold. That should enable far more detailed analysis, giving G. E. a chance to sell its customers not machines but “business outcomes,” like fuel savings. Mr. Immelt sees this as a move up the industrial food chain. Yet all of this exposes G. E. to new competition beyond its traditional rivals like Rockwell Automation, Siemens and United Technologies. Tech giants, including Amazon, Cisco, Google, IBM and Microsoft also have their eye on the industrial internet market, as do a bevy of  . There is precedent for trouble in other industries, of course. Google and Facebook transformed media and advertising, Amazon redefined retailing, and Uber applied an entirely new business model to taxis, which hadn’t changed much in generations. “The real danger is that the data and analysis becomes worth more than the installed equipment itself,” said Karim R. Lakhani, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “G. E. has no choice but to try to do that itself. ” Recently, G. E. has lured software engineers and data scientists from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. Early on, though, it struggled simply to hire. Last year it began running   television ads, featuring young hires, aimed at closing the company’s image gap of industrial giant but digital midget. (Applications at GE Digital jumped eightfold, the company says.) Until this year, Darren Haas hadn’t thought about G. E. certainly not working there. To him, G. E. meant little more than than kitchen appliances and light bulbs. “I had no idea,” Mr. Haas said. But he was intrigued after he met with Harel Kodesh, an expert in mobile and cloud computing who led teams at Microsoft and VMware, a maker of   software. Less than two years ago, Mr. Kodesh joined G. E. and he is now chief technology officer of GE Digital. That someone of Mr. Kodesh’s caliber was a G. E. convert got Mr. Haas’s attention. Then, Mr. Haas started grasping the role that G. E. equipment plays across the economy  —   in transportation, in hospitals  —   “a whole world,” he said. “I found that really, really compelling. ” The other thing Mr. Haas, 41, found appealing was the big computing challenge that lies ahead for the company. In May, he joined G. E. from Apple, where he was a member of the founding team at Siri, the   digital assistant   Apple acquired in 2010. When he left Apple, Mr. Haas was head of cloud engineering, managing the computing engine behind Siri, iTunes and iCloud. At GE Digital, Mr. Haas has a similar title, head of platform cloud engineering, but in a different setting. He describes his job as applying modern software technology  —   machine learning, artificial intelligence and cloud computing  —   to the industrial arena. “I’ve got my work cut out for me,” he said. Mr. Haas is working on the centerpiece of G. E.’s software strategy, a product called Predix. Its evolution mirrors G. E.’s software ambitions. Predix began as little more than a brand of software used by G. E. to service the gear it sells. One showcase use was in jet engines to do predictive maintenance, saving downtime. Around 2013, William Ruh, a former Cisco Systems executive brought in to put together the San Ramon software center, started expanding Predix to other G. E. industrial businesses. But that soon felt too small. The issue was “outside disrupters,” Mr. Ruh said, citing the online lodging   Airbnb as an example of rivals that can appear seemingly out of nowhere and that “bring greater productivity  —   but don’t own the assets they sell. ” G. E. Mr. Ruh notes, is the ultimate   company. The other threat was rising interest among tech companies to take their internet connectivity expertise and try to apply it to industrial businesses. To get ahead of all this, G. E. reimagined Predix as a   operating system for industrial applications. Mr. Kodesh leads that effort. He ticks off the looming competitors: Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and others. “Those companies are going to encroach on the territory,” Mr. Kodesh said. “Are we going to capitulate, or build something like Predix?” The basic idea is that G. E. and outside software developers will write programs to run on Predix. This software might, for instance, monitor the health and   the operation of equipment like   rigs and   turbines, improving performance, reducing wear and adapting to changing environmental conditions. It amounts to software delivering the equivalent of personalized medicine for machines. Like any other computer operating system, Predix aims to take the complexity out of writing programs, so more people can create them. And while the instincts of the industrial world are proprietary, G. E. is following an   model with Predix, providing a basic design, but one open to outside contributors  —   more like Android from Google than Windows from Microsoft. Predix, Mr. Kodesh said, will be improved using the software equivalent of Lego blocks. “Some will be G. E.’s, and some will be made by   developers,” he said. G. E. is betting that its deep knowledge of industry will give it an edge in this software arms race. The stakes for this kind of programming can be high. For a regular consumer using the internet, a misfiring algorithm in the software  —   “a false positive”  —   might mean a person sees an irrelevant online ad, or a bad Amazon book suggestion or Netflix movie recommendation, Mr. Kodesh said. Useless, perhaps, but not necessarily costly. But a false positive that prompts an airline to take a jet engine off the wing, Mr. Kodesh said, is a $100, 000 mistake. “We really do need to have different technology, different algorithms and a different cloud, than in the consumer internet,” he said. G. E. has set an ambitious target for Predix. It hopes to attract $100 million in orders this year, on its way to $4 billion in revenue by 2020. By then, the company forecasts that its total digital business  —   more than 90 percent of it software  —   may reach as much as $15 billion, up from $6 billion now. For Predix to reach its potential, though, G. E. needs outside programmers to write software for it. The company, with its deep pockets, can start the   parade, but will others follow? This will be a major test. And G. E.’s campaign to build an industrial operating system and create a flourishing ecosystem of software for it is just getting underway in earnest. In late July, G. E. hosted a Predix conference in Las Vegas, which attracted 1, 200 software developers. Such developer gatherings are part of the playbook of every major software company but unusual for an industrial corporation. G. E. has some   advantages. Its installed base is huge. For example, the company says more than a third of the world’s electricity is generated on G. E. equipment. It can make progress simply by winning over the aircraft makers, oil companies, hospitals and utilities that now depend on G. E. machinery. G. E. is starting to attract a developer following. Tata Consultancy Services, for one, says it now has 500 programmers designing and developing Predix applications for customers in the   aviation and health care industries. G. E. also promotes partnerships with Infosys, Wipro and Capgemini to help business write Predix software. When he joined in 2011, Mr. Ruh had no illusions that making software a strength at a   company would be easy. At the time, he told Mr. Immelt that would be “a   journey,” he said. “We’re in the middle of that journey. ” Part of that is an effort to change an engineering culture that stretches back generations. “If G. E. is truly going to be a   company, we can’t be separate here,” Mr. Ruh said of his software division. Digital “tools and habits” need to be embedded “in how people do their jobs,” he said. In its factory in Greenville, S. C. G. E. produces both giant power generators and evidence that this metamorphosis might work. The   building is crowded with immense cranes and milling, grinding and welding machines, overseen by manufacturing engineers and technicians. The finishing touches are being put on one of G. E.’s new gas turbines. It looks like the business end of a rocket ship lying on its side, a gleaming steel dynamo at rest. It weighs 950, 000 pounds. It fires up at nearly 2, 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and it can generate enough electricity to supply more than 500, 000 households. The gas turbine was brought to market in half the typical five years. That kind of accelerated product development is a performance that G. E. hopes to replicate across its industrial businesses. And it is a story of changes in design and manufacturing practices made possible by digital technology. John Lammas, the    vice president for power generation engineering, started his working career 40 years ago, on the shop floor of a   jet engine factory in Birmingham, England. He has been with G. E. for 31 years, moving up the ranks of the company’s jet engine and power turbine divisions. “I’m an old mechanical guy,” he said. But a couple of years ago, he issued an edict: no more paper drawings. In the past, a model of a new part would be made and then converted to detailed blueprints running to 70 pages or more. These would then be physically sent to G. E. manufacturing engineers and outside suppliers to begin setting up the tooling, casting and cutting for the part. This    routine took up to eight weeks. Now, engineers use   computer models, skip the prototype step and instantly send the models electronically. This goes a step beyond   design, which is commonplace. In Greenville, the designers are for the first time linked directly with manufacturers and suppliers in real time, in what G. E. calls a “digital thread. ” This means they can collaborate in ways that have changed the work process while making it more likely that problems or defects are spotted sooner. Traditionally, one set of engineers designed a part, and only then passed it on to manufacturing. If a problem arose on the supplier side, the design was kicked back and the process started over. “Jobs are combining in this digital world,” Mr. Lammas said. Greenville’s own equipment has been a Predix guinea pig. The machinery and factory were retrofitted with   sensors and the software. Matt Krause, the plant manager, said that last winter, when a snowstorm shut the factory for a day, the sensor network detected that the plant had consumed 1, 000 pounds of argon, an inert gas used in coatings for parts. The leak was fixed, saving $350, 000 a year. “We can see things we never did before,” Mr. Krause said. Over all, 60 of 200 steps in design and production have been automated or eliminated, reducing work time by 530, 000 hours over three years, G. E. estimates. Not all the   ideas that G. E. is trying to breed translate comfortably to heavy industry. Lean proponents urge companies to come up with “minimum viable products,” particularly test versions of software programs. But no one wants a minimum viable jet engine or power generator. Yet in Greenville, engineers in the design stages are encouraged to move faster in smaller steps, conduct more experiments, and be willing to fail and try again. It amounts to a sea change in the engineering culture of heavy industry. “As an engineer, not getting it right the first time, I find painful,” said Bill Byrne, an engineering manager. “It’s uncomfortable. But it’s been incredibly liberating. ” The old ways, said Mr. Lammas, the engineering chief, had merit. Each step and rule was logical on its own. But the emphasis on flawless execution and perfection fostered a fear of failure. “Overcoming that culture was probably the biggest challenge,” he said.",0
688,"$2,700 for Hillary Clinton at ‘Hamilton’? That Would Be Enough - The New York Times","How does a former senator . .. stateswoman . .. hoping to build a financial stockpile . .. find a way to make it worth her donors’ while? “Hamilton” tickets. At a special Tuesday matinee,   supporters of Hillary Clinton filed into the Richard Rodgers Theater for a special performance that was, in a rare turn, a touch more expensive than a typical show. But with seats available for $2, 700  —   and status as “event chair” on offer for $100, 000  —   the gathering, held for the Hillary Victory Fund, did include an uncommon guest: Mrs. Clinton, who took the stage after the final bows of a show she has now seen three times. “I cry every time,” she said, after embracing the show’s creator,   Miranda, who left his role as the title character over the weekend but returned on Tuesday to introduce her. Mrs. Clinton, who first attended last year off Broadway, at the Public Theater, took care to establish her “Hamilton” bona fides, to a point. She neither rapped nor rhymed, but she alluded often to some of the show’s signature numbers. “As Washington tells us, history’s eyes are on us,” she said at one point, invoking “History Has Its Eyes On You. ” “Let’s not throw away our shot,” she urged later, nodding to perhaps the show’s most famous song. The musical has become something of a bipartisan cause  —   “the only thing,” President Obama has joked, “that Dick Cheney and I agree on. ” The president headlined a Democratic   last year at the theater. Mr. Miranda has his own political roots: His father, Luis A. Miranda Jr. is a longtime Democratic strategist in New York. The younger Mr. Miranda has, in recent months, urged Congress to assist Puerto Rico in its financial crisis. In his remarks, Mr. Miranda, his   Hamiltonian mane now shorn, made clear his preference for the November election, criticizing Donald J. Trump without saying his name. “Are you going to vote for the guy who wants to build a wall or for someone who’s building bridges?” asked Mr. Miranda, whose Tony   show is, after all, about an immigrant. He observed that the show had featured, or at least alluded to, the first four presidents. “Right now,” he said, “you’re going to hear from the 45th president. ” Mrs. Clinton, taking the stage to raucous cheers, hugged Mr. Miranda and thanked him for advocating on behalf of Puerto Rico and the families of victims of the massacre last month in Orlando. Speaking for about four minutes, Mrs. Clinton lingered on the message of the show’s final number, “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,” and the meaning of legacy. “It really is true that it matters whose stories are told,” she said, “and heard. ”",0

690,Trump the Great — Paul Craig Roberts,"Trump the Great
Paul Craig Roberts
Liberals, progressives, and the left-wing (to the extent that one still exists) are aligning with the corrupt oligarchy against president-elect Trump and the American people. 
They are busy at work trying to generate hysteria over Trump’s “authoritarian personality and followers.” In other words, the message is: here come the fascists.
Liberals and progressives wailed and whined about “an all white male cabinet,” only to be made fools by Trump’s appointment of a black male and two women, one a minority and one a Trump critic.
The oligarchs are organizing their liberal progressive front groups to disrupt Trump’s inauguration in an effort to continue the attempt to delegitimize Trump the way the paid Maidan protesters were used in Kiev to delegitimize the elected Ukrainian government.
To the extent any of the Trump protesters are sincere and not merely paid tools of oligarchs, such as George Soros, military and financial interests, and global capitalists, they should consider that false claims and unjustified criticism can cause Trump and his supporters to close their ears to all criticism and make it easier for neoconservatives to influence Trump by offering support.
At this point we don’t know what a Trump government is going to do. If he sells out the people, he won’t be reelected. If he is defeated by the oligarchy, the people will become more radical. 
We do not know how Washington insiders appointed to the government will behave inside a Trump presidency. Unless they are ideologues like the neoconservatives or agents of powerful interests, insiders survive by going along with the current. If the current changes under Trump, so will the insiders. 
Trump got elected because flyover America has had all it can take from the self-dealing oligarchy. The vast bullk of America has seen its economic prospects and that of children and grandchildren decline for a quarter century. The states Hillary carried are limited to the liberal enclaves and oligarchy’s stomping grounds on the NE and West coasts and in Colorado and New Mexico, where effete wealthy liberals have located because of the scenary. If you look at the red/blue electoral map, geographically speaking Hillary’s support is very limited.
We know that Hillary is an agent for the One Percent. The Clintons $120 million personal wealth and $1.6 billion personal foundation are proof that the Clintons are bought-and-paid-for. We know that Hillary is responsible for the destruction of Libya and of much of Syria and for the overthrow of the democratically elected government in Ukraine. We know that the Clinton regime’s sanctions on Iraq resulted in the deaths of 500,000 children. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity. We know Hillary used government office for private gain. We know she violated national security laws without being held accountable. What we don’t know is why groups that allegedly are liberal-progressive-leftwing are such fervent supporters of Hillary.
One possible answer is that these groups are mere fronts for vested interests and are devoid of any sincere motives.
Another possible answer is that these groups believe that the important issues are not jobs for Americans and avoiding war with nuclear powers, but transgender, homosexual and illegal alien rights.
Another possible answer is that these groups are uninformed and stupid.
What these protesters see as a threat in Trump’s strong and willful personality is actually a virtue. A cipher like Obama has no more ability to stand up to the oligarchy than a disengaged George W. Bush so easily stage-managed by Dick Cheney. Nothing less than an authoritarian style and personality is a match for the well-entrenched ruling oligarchy and willful neoconservatives. If Trump were a shrinking violet, the electorate would have ignored him.
Trump did not purchase his presidency with the offer of handouts to blacks, the poor generally, teachers unions, farmers, abortion rights for women, etc. Trump was elected because he said: “Those who control the levers of power in Washington and the global special interests they partner with, don’t have your good in mind. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you.”
It has been a long time since the electorate heard this kind of talk from someone seeking public office. Trump’s words are what Americans were waiting to hear.
As willful as Trump is, he is only one person. The oligarchy are many.
As impressive as Trump’s billion dollars is, the oligarchs have trillions.
Congress being in Republican hands will spare Trump partisan obstruction, but Congress remains in the hands of interest groups. 
As powerful as the office of the president can be, without unity in government changes from the top don’t occur, especially if the president is at odds with the military with regard to the alleged threat posed by Russia and China. Trump says he wants peace with the nuclear powers. The military/security complex needs an enemy for its budget.
It is absolutely necessary that a lid be put on tensions between nuclear powers and that economic opportunity reappears for the American people. Trump is not positioned to benefit from war and jobs offshoring. The only sensible strategy is to support him on these issues and to hold his feet to the fire.
As for the immigration issue, the Obama Justice (sic) Department has just worsened the picture with its ruling that American police departments cannot discriminate against non-citizens by only hiring citizens as officers. Now that US citizens face arrest in their own country by non-citizens, the resentment of immigrants will increase. Clearly it is nonsensical to devalue American citizenship in this way. Clearly it is sensible to put a lid on immigration until the US economy is again able to create jobs capable of sustaining an independent existence. 
If Trump can defeat the oligarchy and save America, he can go down in history as Trump the Great. I think that this prospect appeals to Trump more than more wealth. Instead of trying to tear him down in advance, he should be supported. With Trump’s determination and the people’s support, change from the top down is possible. Otherwise, change has to come from the bottom up, and that means an awful lot of blood in the streets.

691,"Hillary FRANTIC As Dirty Secret Implodes, Gets Worse With Prison Bombshell","Share This 
Hillary Clinton thought her email scandal was in the rearview mirror, but it just blew up in her face days before the election. Unfortunately for her, everything just got worse as a bombshell just exploded – and seeing how the topic is about prison, it looks like things are about to get juicy. 
There’s no doubt that Hillary is as crooked as they come. Although the left would have you believe otherwise, with the presidential hopeful all but admitting her criminal acts, not too many people believe them. 
However, things just got a lot worse for Hillary, but his time, it’s not only her presidential campaign that’s in jeopardy. According to The Economic Collapse , Hillary Clinton is looking at a whopping 20 years behind bars if she’s convicted of “obstruction of justice” – a term that could very well be a life sentence for a woman of her age. A sight we may get to see soon, and one that Hillary Clinton rightfully deserves 
As of this point, no one is mentioning the phrase “obstruction of justice,” but that doesn’t mean the idea isn’t floating out there. In fact, when you look at the actual definition of the term in regards to the Federal statute, you start to get a better idea of just how guilty Hillary is: 
Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsified, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under Title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. 
We already know that Hillary is guilty of trying to cover this up. Not only did she delete and “bleachbit” her server in a desperate attempt to block the FBI from finding out her dirty little secret, but then she said she didn’t have the emails they were looking for. 
Of course, when others stumbled across the mythical 33,000 emails, things started to take a turn – and it all just got worse. According to The Wall Street Journal , the FBI now has another 650,000 emails to sort through with about 10,000 pertinent to Hillary’s case. Things aren’t looking so good for Hillary Clinton 
Why did FBI Director James Comey find the need to come forward with this information so close to the election? Well, as it turns out, the answer is rather simple – redemption. 
According to a Daily Mail article written by Ed Klein, the author of a bestseller about the Clintons entitled Guilty As Sin , it seems as though Comey was suffering for letting off Hillary so easy. As explained by Klein: 
“Some people, including department heads, stopped talking to Jim, and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall,” said the source. ‘They felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting Hillary off with a slap on the wrist. He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents. The letters reminded him every day that morale in the FBI had hit rock bottom.” 
Further speculation pertaining to Comey’s reasoning seems to indicate that the urgency here stems from the information actually found. Knowing just how much the release would impact the election, one can only assume that Comey was only comfortable in doing so as someone had already found something really big. 
The fact of the matter is, people had lost faith in justice after Comey’s dismissal of Hillary’s charges. After proving that power meant exclusion from the law, it seems as though the FBI Director is trying to right that wrong today. Furthermore, as there seems to be something of substantive nature, Hillary can expect to be facing 20 years behind bars – a sentence a great many people would feel is justified.",0
692,Renting a Car? Know the Rules of the Road - The New York Times,"Having booked their flights and secured their hotels, travelers often consider rental cars among the last of their   tasks, making the unprepared more vulnerable to the    of industry fees. “Our number one advice for renters is to do their homework,” said David Solomito, vice president of marketing for North America at Kayak. “For most people, rental cars are the least considered part of trip. ” As technology has changed travel  —   consider toll roads, which often do not have manned tollbooths any longer  —   so it has the rules of the road when it comes to renting cars. “It’s not dramatic in terms of what companies are charging in fees, it’s just that there’s more of them,” said Rick Garlick, who leads the global travel and hospitality practice at J. D. Power, which conducts consumer surveys, including an annual survey on car rental satisfaction (for the third year running, Enterprise has ranked highest). “Ancillary fees, as with airlines, are how the companies retain profitability,” he said. There are a number of ways to save money on rental cars, including renting from a location that’s not at an airport, which Kayak says will save you an average of 11 percent. But there are several charges that tend to nip renters’ wallets after they return their cars that can be avoided or reduced with a little forethought. Assuming you haven’t purchased any refueling options when you signed the contract, rental car agencies require renters to return the car with the same amount of gas as when they departed, which usually means full. But the mileage range between topping off the tank and reaching the return facility is a gray area. “At Hertz, we do not have a mileage restriction. We simply ask that customers refuel to the same level they started with,” wrote Lauren Luster, communications manager with Hertz, in an email. This lack of definition is open to exploitation both from drivers who refuel miles away and from agencies. I recently returned a car to Avis in Miami after refueling a block from the airport return terminal, only to find a “fuel service” charge of $16. 07 on my bill. An Avis employee redacted it when I objected. A spokeswoman for Avis said the company has about 40, 000 “connected” cars, which measure fuel levels when exiting and   the rental facility. “We carefully monitor the system and work closely with car manufacturers, so the likelihood that the technology in the vehicle malfunctioned is slim,” wrote Alice Pereira, an Avis spokeswoman, in an email. Industry experts advise making a mental note of the closest gas station when you drive away from the rental facility. “Cars aren’t getting smarter, we need to be,” said Lauren Fix, an author and automotive writer also known as the Car Coach. “If you have a receipt to prove you refilled, they will usually refund the fee. Any pushback, I ask for a manager. ” Drivers are responsible for paying their own tolls, but a shift to electronic tolling has made it harder for renters to avoid the fees charged by agencies as manned booths have disappeared from many routes. Most agencies provide electronic transponders that allow convenient access to toll roads. But once they are triggered by a tollgate, the devices initiate a daily rental fee, often regardless of whether it is used each day. These fees are in addition to the actual tolls, so that while you may only incur a few dollars in tolls driving from Miami to Key West, you will pay somewhere between $2. 95 a day for the device at Payless Car Rental to $4. 95 a day with Hertz. These fees are usually capped. Avis charges a maximum of $19. 75 per rental month Hertz charges $24. 75 maximum per rental agreement and Payless charges $14. 75 maximum for each rental period. Enterprise, National and Alamo car rentals offer the use of automatic tolling for $3. 95 per day it is used, with a maximum charge of $19. 75 for the rental term. Car rental companies stress that drivers can pay cash (when the option exists) avoid toll roads or bring their own electronic transponders from home. Not all electronic passes are linked, however. The   can be used in most Northeastern and   states and a few in the Midwest, extending from Maine down to North Carolina and west to Illinois. An   may be used in various vehicles as long as they are in the same class as your car, so forget using it if you rent a  . Some toll roads in California will allow drivers to register a credit card to the rental car license plate and have the tolls charged automatically. Many consumers assume that an early rental return will spare them the fee remaining for the balance of the contract. That doesn’t take into account the lost revenue that the rental car company incurs. “It messes with their inventory and planning,” said Mr. Solomito of Kayak. “Returning a car early is considered breaking the contract. ” How early is early depends on the company, but generally anything less than 24 hours before the return date requires payment of the full amount. If earlier, Dollar Rent A Car, for example, will only charge for the days used and add a $25 charge, according to the company website, “to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time we have reserved for your use. ” Late returns generally trigger fees. And like airline rebooking, any changes may result in a different rate than the one originally agreed to. Hertz encourages customers to call its Rental Extensions department. They may be subject to a $10   fee, through renters can avoid the fee if they change a return date when they pick up the car. If they don’t call, however, they can be subject to a fee of $12 a day, up to a maximum of $60, in addition to daily rental charges. Parking or traffic tickets are the driver’s responsibility. But if ever there were a financial incentive to driving carefully, it’s in a rental car, where ticket fees may come with a service charge from the rental company. These penalties are usually detailed in the terms and conditions of the rental contract. Avis’s contract says offenses will be charged back to the renter’s credit card, and the company may impose a $30 administration fee to cover the cost of notifying the renter of the infraction by sending copies of the notices. Payless charges a $50 fee per violation. “What the big print giveth, the little print taketh away,” Ms. Fix said. “You have to be aware. ”",0
693,All Impeachments Are Political. But Was Brazil’s Something More Sinister? - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Was the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff as the president of Brazil on Wednesday a coup? Technically, the answer is no. Although there is no single definition of what constitutes a coup, it is at its core an illegal seizure of power. The Brazilian Senate’s    vote to remove Ms. Rousseff was the culmination of a legal process set forth in the Brazilian Constitution, and it simply does not meet that standard. But Ms. Rousseff and her supporters have argued for months that the effort to oust her was in fact a coup engineered by a small group of elites. They are not bothered by strict legal definitions. Rather, “coup” has become shorthand for accusing Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents of exploiting the law to subvert democracy. There is truth to that. But it is rooted in problems that afflict Brazil’s entire political system, not just its right or its left. Any opposition party anywhere stands to gain from the downfall of the governing party’s leader. In Brazil, that was heightened by the fact that members of the opposition had been caught up in a major corruption scandal. Romero Jucá, an influential opposition legislator who had been implicated in the scandal, was recorded in March saying of the investigation, “We have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding. ” Ms. Rousseff was impeached on what analysts near universally described as minor charges: concealing a budget deficit by borrowing from a   bank  —   illegal, but not a criminal offense. Amy Erica Smith, an assistant political science professor at Iowa State University who studies Brazil, said these charges “don’t rise to the level of the kind of accusations that would merit impeachment,” adding: “It’s not a legitimate use of the impeachment proceedings. ” This is why Ms. Rousseff and her allies argued that the politicians pushing impeachment were not trying to protect the integrity of Brazilian democracy, but, rather, to manipulate it to serve their own ends. Calling the impeachment a coup became a way to question the motives of opposition leaders and to argue that impeaching Ms. Rousseff would be contrary to democracy. Normally, following the law  —   which the impeachers were indeed doing  —   by design serves democracy. But, in Brazil, there is currently just enough corruption and just enough rule of law for political elites to play the two against each other. Corruption, Professor Smith explained, is so endemic in Brazilian politics that it most likely implicates the entire governing class. The country also has a powerful judiciary that is actively working to investigate and prosecute corruption  —   an unstable combination. This gives political elites both a means and an incentive to expose their rivals, knowing it will probably ruin them. After all, if everyone is corrupt, everyone is vulnerable. But while that serves individual politicians, it weakens the wider political system by introducing instability. And because Brazil’s economy is doing so poorly, the public is, understandably, angry at the government and eager to see corruption punished. So while Ms. Rousseff’s supporters might see this impeachment as a cynical ploy, her opponents see a symbolic blow against a corrupt system  —   even if that corruption extends across party lines. There is also an important class dimension playing out. Ms. Rousseff led the   Workers Party, which positions itself as a champion of the poor. The opposition Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, which pushed for Ms. Rousseff’s ouster and took power after she was suspended from office in May, is seen as a champion of business interests. In the eyes of Workers Party devotees, the impeachment proceedings had an element of class warfare, with the elite seizing power to protect their interests  —   which, to the other side, looks and feels like a coup even if it does not meet the formal definition. That perception was captured by a photograph, which went viral on social media, of a   couple in a wealthy neighborhood walking to a protest against President Rousseff in March while their maid pushed their children in a stroller alongside them. “When people talk about ‘coup mongers,’ ” said Professor Smith, “they’re often implicitly thinking about, you know, a rich white woman who is upset that her maid now is entitled to labor protections that limit what this rich white woman can ask her maid to do. ” But this view, promoted by Ms. Rousseff’s staunchest supports, is something of a caricature. An April poll by the firm Datafolha found that 61 percent of Brazilians supported holding impeachment proceedings against Ms. Rousseff, and that her approval rating was a scant 13 percent. . So it is not the case, as some have argued, that Ms. Rousseff’s impeachment was a coup in the sense that a handful of elites subverted the popular will. Nor have they, in these proceedings, gone outside the law. Rather, Ms. Rousseff’s political opponents have done something subtler: They exploited the popular will and the letter of the law to serve their own interests, rather than the interests of democracy. Of course, in all countries, politicians act out of  . And impeachment proceedings are always political  —   something that any American who lived through President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings can tell you. But the particular nature of Brazil’s system at this moment makes its politics particularly unstable, and gives individual politicians greater power to leverage democracy toward ends that are not so democratic.",0
694,"Trump, in Interview, Moderates Views but Defies Conventions - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump on Tuesday tempered some of his most extreme campaign promises, dropping his vow to jail Hillary Clinton, expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change. But in a   hourlong interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times  —   which was scheduled, canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules  —   Mr. Trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the American presidency. He said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his White House, conceding that the Trump brand “is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. ” Still, he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his businesses, which would be run by his children. He defended Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, against charges of racism, calling him a “decent guy. ” And he mocked Republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign. In the midday meeting in the   boardroom of The Times’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr. Mr. Trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job. “It is a very overwhelming job, but I’m not overwhelmed by it,” he said. He displayed a jumble of impulses, many of them conflicting. He was magnanimous toward Mrs. Clinton, but boastful about his victory. He was   about some of his positions, uncompromising about others. The interview demonstrated the volatility in Mr. Trump’s positions. He said he had no interest in pressing for Mrs. Clinton’s prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the Clinton Foundation. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” he said. On the issue of torture, Mr. Trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of waterboarding after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. “He said, ‘I’ve never found it to be useful,’” Mr. Trump said. He added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism suspects: “‘Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers, and I’ll do better. ’” “I was very impressed by that answer,” Mr. Trump said. Torture, he said, is “not going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking. ” Mr. Trump repeated that Mr. Mattis was being “seriously, seriously considered” to be secretary of defense. “I think it’s time, maybe, for a general,” he said. On climate change, Mr. Trump refused to repeat his promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying, “I’m looking at it very closely. ” Despite the recent appointment to his transition team of a fierce critic of the Paris accords, Mr. Trump said that “I have an open mind to it” and that clean air and “crystal clear water” were vitally important. He held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas. He vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in Washington, where attendees gave the Nazi salute and criticized Jews. Asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel laws, Mr. Trump offered no specifics but told the group, “I think you’ll be happy. ” Despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the “failing New York Times,” Mr. Trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the institution, which he called “a great, great American jewel, world jewel. ” He did, however, say he believed The Times had been too tough on him during the campaign. Pressed to respond to criticism in other areas, he was defiant. He declared that “the law’s totally on my side” when it comes to questions about conflict of interest and ethics laws. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he said. He said it would be extremely difficult to sell off his businesses because they are real estate holdings. He said that he would “like to do something” and create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government. He noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his children, which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. He insisted that he could still invite business partners into the White House for    photographs. He said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to do, including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses. “If it were up to some people,” he said, “I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again. ” Mr. Trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with Nigel Farage, the U. K. Independence Party leader, to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms. Mr. Trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. “I might have brought it up,” Mr. Trump said, then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest. Mr. Trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal antinepotism laws from installing his    Jared Kushner, in a White House job. But he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make Mr. Kushner a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the Middle East. “The president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she wants, but I don’t want to do that,” Mr. Trump said. But he said that Mr. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, “could be very helpful” in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians. “I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with Israel and the Palestinians,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Kushner “would be very good at it” and that “he knows the region. ” “A lot of people tell me, really great people tell me, that it’s impossible  —   you can’t do it,” Mr. Trump added. “I disagree. I think you can make peace. ” “I have reason to believe I can do it,” he added. Mr. Trump spoke only in general terms about foreign policy. He said the United States should not “be a nation builder,” repeated his line from the campaign that fighting the war in Iraq was “one of the great mistakes in the history of our country,” and said he has some “very definitive” and “strong ideas” about how to deal with the violent civil war raging in Syria. He declined to say what those ideas are despite several requests to do so. “We have to end that craziness that’s going on in Syria,” he said. The   said that he had talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the election, but he did not elaborate. He said it would be “nice” if he and Mr. Putin could get along, but he rejected the idea that any warming of relations would be called a “reset,” noting the criticism that Mrs. Clinton received after her attempts at bettering relations between the countries failed. “I wouldn’t use that term after what happened,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump made a forceful defense of Mr. Bannon, whom he named as his chief strategist and who has drawn charges of racism and  . This summer, Mr. Bannon called Breitbart News, the website he led, “the platform for the ” a white nationalist movement. Mr. Trump said Mr. Bannon had been dismayed at the reaction to his hiring. “I’ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist or ” he said, “I wouldn’t even think about hiring him. ” Mr. Trump added: “I think he’s having a hard time with it because it’s not him. I think he’s been treated very unfairly. ” He also defended Breitbart, which has carried racist and   content, saying it was no different from The Times, only “much more conservative. ” Mr. Trump said he hoped to develop a “great   relationship” with President Obama, with whom he said he had an unexpected rapport. “I really liked him a lot, and I am a little bit surprised that I am telling you that I really liked him a lot,” he said. And Mr. Trump gloated about defying the polls and the expectations of his own party to win the presidency, and boasted of how he had taken his revenge on Republicans who kept him at a distance and then lost their own races. He said that one of them, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, would “love to have a job in the administration. ” “I said, ‘No, thank you,’” Mr. Trump said of Ms. Ayotte, who lost her Senate seat to Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. “She refused to vote for me. ” He also criticized Representative Joe Heck of Nevada, who vacillated over supporting Mr. Trump after an    recording surfaced in which Mr. Trump bragged in lewd terms about grabbing women without their consent. “He went down like a lead balloon,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Heck. “I said, ‘Off the record, I hope you lose. ’” He said Republican leaders felt indebted to him for his surprise victory. “Right now,” Mr. Trump said, “they’re in love with me. ”",0
695,"Review: ‘Sweetbitter,’ a ‘Bright Lights, Big City’ for the Restaurant Set - The New York Times","Stephanie Danler’s first novel, “Sweetbitter,” about a young woman in New York City’s restaurant world, is going to make a lot of people hungry. It did me, at any rate. My copy, I notice, has some grease stains in it, a few red pepper flakes, a stubby bit of mint. “Sweetbitter” will be consumed with special avidity by young food people  —   sommeliers, cheesemakers, sous chefs, managers, pastry wizards  —   who dream of making it in the big city, or at least of making it by   standards. It’s an unpretentious,     novel  —   bought by Knopf  in an     deal  —   that reads like a letter home from a   friend. In this case, that friend is named Tess, like Thomas Hardy’s heroine and Melanie Griffith’s striving secretary in “Working Girl. ” This Tess is 22 when she escapes her unnamed hometown and its “twin pillars of football and church” and drives into Manhattan. “Let’s say I was born in late June of 2006 when I came over the George Washington Bridge at 7 a. m.,” she says, “with the sun circulating and dawning, the sky full of sharp corners of light, before the exhaust rose, before the heat gridlocked in, windows unrolled, radio turned up to some impossibly hopeful pop song, open, open, open. ” Thanks to her poise and friendly good looks, Tess finds a job as an apprentice server at a restaurant that’s clearly modeled after Union Square Cafe, one of Manhattan’s best. (The author has worked at Union Square Cafe and at another cheerful restaurant, Buvette.) She finds a scuzzy apartment in a cheap section of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Tess falls deeply into her work and feels the city begin to unfold for her. Ms. Danler is a sensitive observer of the almost wartime camaraderie among workers at a restaurant that’s humming at full capacity, of the exhaustion, of the postshift drinking in dive bars until dawn, of the sex and other stimulants  —   the biggest one simply being young and alive and open to the animal and intellectual possibilities that New York offers. Once upon a time, this sort of aspirational, young person’s novel was written about writers and artists. Food workers are climbing the status ladder. Now these novels are about chefs or even, in this case, servers. This book has an onrushing “Bright Lights, Big City” vibe and falls into an emerging genre you might call Bright Lights, Small Plates. A restaurant, like a platoon in a war novel, allows a writer to deploy a large cast with relative ease. In “Sweetbitter” we meet a handsome if   young bartender (“He drank like he was the only person who understood beer”) an enigmatic female head server who is Tess’s mentor and tormentor a harried chef a manager who does more than ogle his favorite female employees. None feel like stereotypes. A subtle sense of melancholy hangs over these men and women. They’re happy to be where they are in fact, they feel chosen. But they’re nearly all here because of other dreams that were thwarted. They’re failed poets or academics. Tess had hoped to be a photographer. “Sweetbitter” is the story of Tess’s sentimental education. We don’t learn much about her past. But in Manhattan we watch her  —   she is vulnerable but rarely weak  —   pour herself full with books and art and music, and blossom like a daisy. Mostly she fills herself with lovely things to eat and drink. Tess isn’t a hipster (“I cared too much about the wrong things”). And Ms. Danler isn’t another Anthony Bourdain manqué, delivering a caustic exposé. She takes the reader by the hand as Tess learns dozens of lessons, from distinguishing among varieties of oysters, types of winter lettuce and appellations of Burgundy to opening wine properly to appreciating a pig’s head terrine. Tess knows she will, at some point, want more than this. But for now this punishing life feels like ravishment. When a college acquaintance comes into the restaurant one night and condescends to her, only politeness prevents her from speaking aloud: “I chose this life because it’s a constant assault of color and taste and light and it’s raw and ugly and fast and it’s mine. And you’ll never understand. Until you live it, you don’t know. ” This novel, which reads a bit like a food world version of Curtis Sittenfeld’s “Prep,” gets off to a bad start. You notice that its four sections are named after the seasons, as if they were George Winston albums. At the beginning there are gimmicky interpolated sections about things like the nature of sweet versus sour. You fear you may be headed into a genre fiction tunnel of love. Those fears are quickly dispelled. Ms. Danler is a gifted commenter (chilly autumn air in Manhattan “tasted of steel knives and filtered water”) on many things, class especially. An awareness of privilege runs through this novel like a tendon. “If you’re good at this job,” she asks, “what exactly are you good at?” “Sweetbitter” grows darker than you might expect, in terms of where Tess’s desires lead her. It’s a book about hunger of every variety, even the sort that can disturb you and make you sometimes ask yourself, as does Tess, “Was I a monster or was this what it felt like to be a person?”",0
696,Gonzaga Beats South Carolina in Final Four for Shot at Another First - The New York Times,"GLENDALE, Ariz.  —   Mark Few wrote the introduction for a book by his college roommate about the power of perseverance. On Saturday night, the Gonzaga men’s basketball team, which Few has built from a midmajor curiosity into a championship contender, provided him with material for a postscript. Gonzaga, making its 19th consecutive N. C. A. A. tournament appearance but its first trip to the Final Four, advanced to the national championship game with a   victory over South Carolina at University of Phoenix Stadium. In the final on Monday night, the Bulldogs will face a fellow No. 1 seed, North Carolina, which beat Oregon by   later on Saturday. Nigel   a junior guard, contributed 23 points, 6 assists and 5 rebounds, and his freshman roommate, Zach Collins, added 14 points and 13 rebounds for Gonzaga, a program that thrust itself into the national consciousness by reaching the round of 8 in 1999  —   but until this season had never gotten any further. This season, the Bulldogs ( ) spent four weeks at No. 1 in the national polls before being dealt their only loss, to Brigham Young, in their final game of the regular season. On Saturday night, they could barely contain their excitement at the opportunity they had given themselves to be unequivocally known as college basketball’s best. Few, who is known for his   demeanor, was so overcome with emotion that he executed a handstand in the locker room. “I felt like I stuck it,” he said with a laugh, adding: “Sometimes I worry that my guys get like, it’s a job. And we’ve been on them to show emotion. So that’s my fairly weak effort of showing emotion. ” South Carolina ( ) a seventh seed that had defied all expectation to get so far, was also making its first trip to the Final Four. The Gamecocks were led by Chris Silva, who had 13 points and 13 rebounds. Sindarius Thornwell, a senior guard who had not scored fewer than 24 points in a tournament game this year, was held to a relatively quiet 15. “We played our hearts out the way we did all year,” the senior Justin McKie said, “and Gonzaga played a great game. ” It was just a matter of patience. In his book, “Water the Bamboo,” Few’s college roommate, Greg Bell, used the plant as a metaphor for success. Even with regular watering, giant timber bamboo does not appear to make any gains for the first three years of its life. But then, suddenly, it will sprout 90 feet in just two months. It took the Bulldogs considerably longer to reach their newfound height, but that only made Saturday’s result all the sweeter. Few’s South Carolina counterpart, Frank Martin, overcame a hardscrabble childhood to build a successful career in coaching, and his tailored suits cannot hide his rough edges. His intensity, embodied by his icy sideline stare, has rubbed off on his players. After   the Gonzaga players gathered in a circle, and as they were breaking apart, a few South Carolina players sauntered through the huddle, bumping a few of the Bulldogs as they passed. Then, before the opening tip, Gonzaga center Przemek Karnowski approached Thornwell, one senior to another, and extended his hand. Thornwell, the Gamecocks’ leading scorer, brushed past him, leaving Karnowski to stare quizzically at Thornwell’s back and shrug. “Maybe that’s how he is,” Karnowski said after the game. “I don’t really know him personally. ” Karnowski was happy to be on the floor at all. He missed most of last season with a   injury that required surgery. At 7 feet 1 inch and 300 pounds, Karnowski had four inches and more than 70 pounds on Silva, the sophomore forward from Gabon who was given the gargantuan task of guarding him under the basket. Fourteen minutes into the game, Silva rose to block Karnowski’s shot and made contact with Karnowski, who fell to the floor like a   Douglas fir. No foul was called, and while he writhed in pain, the Gamecocks pushed the ball up the court, with P. J. Dozier feeding McKie for a   that tied the score at  . Karnowski was helped to the sideline with a sore right elbow and a poked right eye, leaving Gonzaga, which had by then gotten 6 points and 4 rebounds from him, with a hole in the middle. Collins, a   freshman forward, filled it immediately. He contributed three rebounds, including two on the defensive end, to go with 2 points and a blocked shot in a frenetic stretch over the next 2 minutes 30 seconds to help Gonzaga to a   halftime lead. By then, Karnowski was already in the locker room. He could not open his right eye. But those missed games from last season were enough for him. He was back in the lineup at the start of the second half. “The doctor said I’m good to go, so I was just real happy about it,” he said. Twice in the tournament, South Carolina had stormed back from halftime deficits, and it would be no different against Gonzaga. The first two times, Thornwell was the spark. This time it was Silva who led the charge as the Gamecocks tied the game at   and then took the lead on two free throws by Rakym Felder. “That just showed the heart of a lion,” Few said, adding, “It took everything we had to hold on and come back. ” Cultivated though it has been, Gonzaga’s offense did have to deal with a dry spell. The Bulldogs stalled when Karnowski’s teammates tried too often to force the ball inside to him, leading to turnovers that the Gamecocks turned into points at the other end. But it was a storm the Bulldogs could weather. Karnowski had 7 points in the second half to finish with 13. His understudy, Collins, had a sensational second half, with 6 points, 7 rebounds and 5 blocked shots. “We did a really good job, I thought, of just sticking together,” Karnowski said. “That’s what we did the entire season. We don’t have 37 wins for nothing. ” As Few and a handful of his players made their way up the steps to the   dais, the moderator announced, “Gonzaga has arrived. ” It just took longer than perhaps Few would have expected. “To be playing the last game of the year is crazy cool,” he said.",0

698,Re: Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor,"  Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor   31st, 2016 
Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had   and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds   
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US   told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.",0
699,"Race, Not Class, Dictates Republican Future","Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg, November 1, 2016 
The class compositions of the Republican and Democratic parties keep evolving. {snip} 
A Pew Research Center report last month detailed the shift. 
Since 1992, the share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters with at least a college degree has increased sharply, from 21 percent to 37 percent. Among Republicans, 31 percent have at least a college degree, up only slightly from 28 percent in 1992. As a consequence, a greater proportion of Democrats than Republicans now have a college degree or more education. 
In the New York Times last week, political sage Thomas Edsall called this process the “Great Democratic Inversion.” 
What these figures suggest is that the 2016 election will represent a complete inversion of the New Deal order among white voters. From the 1930s into the 1980s and early 1990s, majorities of downscale whites voted Democratic and upscale whites voted Republican. Now, looking at combined male and female vote totals, the opposite is true. 
A key word in Edsall’s analysis is “white.” Stories about the disaffected working-class supporters of Donald Trump apply almost exclusively to white voters. Other working-class voters–blacks and Hispanics –are poised to provide lopsided support to Hillary Clinton. 
{snip} 
There is no expansive, working-class rage in the U.S. There is white conservative rage (along with a more modest left-wing version). While it may burn brightest in deindustrialized America, conservative rage extends across class and educational demarcations, from blue collars to billionaires . 
This complicates the story of the parties switching class allegiances. For Democrats, it leaves them managing an increasingly unwieldy coalition extending from white cosmopolitan millionaires who send their kids to private schools to low-paid Hispanic service workers and black factory and office workers facing economic dislocation. {snip} 
Keeping that coalition pointed in the same general direction might be impossible without the dedicated efforts of the Republican Party. The GOP has proved incapable of breaking out of its racial straitjacket. So it has opted instead to tighten the straps around its torso. 
{snip} 
Republicans’ constant struggle with racism in their ranks, and their recurring failure to resist the temptation to exploit it, eases pressure on the Democrats’ sprawling coalition. The parties won’t fully exchange their class identities for the simple reason that working-class blacks and Hispanics can’t trust the GOP to represent them. 
If it doesn’t diversify and become more accommodating to nonwhites, the GOP will only grow crazier and scarier , and its effort to wield power with the support of a shrinking white base will become even more extreme. {snip}

It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ”  Gorsuch said, “I pledge that if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country. ” Gorsuch then talked about his experience on the bench, saying that he’s been inspired by the judges he worked with who he has watched “fearlessly tending to the rule of law, enforcing the promises of our Constitution, and living out daily their judicial oaths to administer justice equally to rich and poor alike, following the law as they find it and without respect to their personal political beliefs. I think of them tonight. Of course, the Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of people’s liberties under law, and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known. ” He further said former Justices Antonin Scalia and Robert Jackson were “towering judges” and Scalia was “a lion of the law. ” He also praised Justice Byron White, who he worked for, as “one of the smartest and most courageous men I’ve ever known. ” Gorsuch also praised Justice Kennedy, who he clerked for, as a man who taught him “so much. ” Gorsuch further stated, “[W]hen we judges don our robes, it doesn’t make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what’s expected of us: impartiality and independence, collegiality, and courage. As this process now moves to the Senate, I look forward [to] speaking with members from both sides of the aisle, to answering their questions, and to hearing their concerns. I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges. I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order, it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0

703,"Pregnant Women Turn to Marijuana, Perhaps Harming Infants - The New York Times","During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana. With her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her   shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break. “I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a    mother in Deltona, Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because   marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O. K. ” Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers  —   another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health. Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient  —   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  —   can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk. “There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in   pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use. In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of    said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2. 4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.) Young    were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7. 5 percent of   to    said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44. Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb. In Pittsburgh,    born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention. Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers. “Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. “Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition. ” It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I. Q. “The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ” “You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic. Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing. “I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk. ’” In a statement, C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero. “While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said. Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes. ” Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted. ” Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now. ” There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women  —   instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord  —   and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself. Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit. To find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an   at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients. Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When    admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all. Pregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture. Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of   mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant. “Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy. “If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it. ” Stacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and   and she isn’t worried about his development. She still smokes pot  —   indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now. “I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said.",0

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/biggest-winners-and-losers-of-2016-us.html The biggest collective losers of the campaign were the mainstream media. Some of course were worse than others, but all of the old fashioned mainstream outlets were terrible. They operated on a basis of contempt for the honest concerns of ordinary people.They hid Hillary Clinton’s scandals from public view as though oblivious to the fact that in the internet age, the truth cannot be hidden nor suppressed by the failing media-industrial complex.Long before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, the systematic problems of mainstream media in the west were well known.The total deceit with which they cover international affairs, slandering countries which do not actively pursue neoliberal policies, was in full view. Their job is to report the facts and collect information. Instead they have acted like mad agitators for their pet geopolitical projects.As the mainstream media begins to collapse, so too are common misconceptions about war and peace. In 2003 when mainstream media still had a fairly stern grip on public consciousness, many were duped into believing Bush and Blair’s lies about Iraq. Thanks to new media, people in the west have a far better understanding of the realities in the Middle East than they did thirteen years ago. It explains why popular support for war in Syria and by extrapolation on Russia, something that the likes of Hillary Clinton have wildly campaigned for, remains deeply unpopular with ordinary people. The Biggest Winner After Donald Trump , the biggest winners were Julian Assange and Wikileaks . Wikileaks did what honest journalists ought to do, they publish information that is vital to the public interest without having a hidden agenda. Assange expressed his personal disdain for both Trump and Clinton and recently explained the scientific reasons why Wikileaks released damning information on Clinton and not Trump. In all he said he was fair minded and open minded.This remained the case despite Hillary and her supporters making death threats to Assange and Assange having his internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in which he remains captive, cut off after the US State Department put pressure on the Government of Ecuador. But Assange persisted and leak after leak showed American voters and the wider world who Hillary Clinton actually is. It is a very different image from the sugar coated picture painted by the mainstream media. [Her allegiance to the Rothschilds and NWO master manipulator George Soros has also been confirmed , as well as her strong ties to Monsanto .]Wikileaks exposed how Hillary says one thing in public and other to her friends in Wall Street. Wikileaks exposed lie after lie, cover-up after cover-up. Julian Assange’s place in history as someone who has exposed the lies of politicians like Hillary Clinton is now assured. He is owed a debt of gratitude by all those who value truth and justice. By Adam Garrie (excerpt) Dear Friends, HumansAreFree is and will always be free to access and use.

706,"Is Trump Psychic? Listen To His Words One Year Ago, Look At What JUST HAPPENED!","This is unbelievable! Donald Trump must be the next Nostradamus! One year ago, Donald Trump said something so profound that it is almost unbelievable. Take a look: #TRUMP was right again! 
— Trump Super PAC (@TrumpSuperPAC) October 28, 2016 
On August 29th, 2015, just after news broke that Huma Abedin’s husband, Anthony Weiner, had been sexting young women, again, Trump said something that has turned out to be both profound and prophetic. 
“I only worry in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have close proximity to highly classified information.” 
He has also said: 
“Her No. 1 person, Huma Abedin, is married to Anthony Weiner, who’s a sleazeball and pervert,” Trump said, referring to the former New York congressman’s repeated scandals over lewd texts and direct Twitter messages he sent to other women. “I’m not saying that, that’s recorded history,” Trump continued. “I don’t like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets.” 
Trump intuitively knew that Hillary’s top aide, Huma Abedin, was a massive liability. 
Now look at what just happened today! 
The New York Times reports: 
The FBI is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The Bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case – one federal official said they numbered in the thousands – potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the Presidential Campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the Election.” 
Let that sink in. 
The FBI had closed the Hillary Clinton email investigation, and now has reopened it after finding emails on Anthony Wieners devices as part of a sexting scandal and investigation. 
Trump was right about Huma and Wiener! 
There are other scandals that intersect with this one, as well. 
The pay-for-play questions that have been raised about the Clinton Foundation are in play, as Huma Abedin worked daily with the Clintons on countless issues. 
Is this the issue that will take Hillary down for good?

708,JUDGMENT DAY: The One Reason Why Every Christian And Jew In America Should Vote For Donald Trump,"  JUDGMENT DAY: The One Reason Why Every Christian And Jew In America Should Vote For Donald Trump The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   8, 2016 Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. 
“The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.” Proverbs 16:33 (KJV) 
As Americans who love this country, it is absolutely crystal-clear who we should vote for. Only one candidate’s campaign slogan is Make America Great Again, only one candidate says that they will # DrainThe Swamp . I think you get the idea. But you can be a patriotic America and not be a Christian, right? Trump: It’s Time To Drain The Swamp In Washington, D.C – Five-Point Plan For Ethics Reform So is the a compelling, overarching reason why a Bible believing Christian should vote for Donald Trump? Yes, there is 
Donald Trump has made as part of his platform a promise to move the American Embassy from its current location in Tel Aviv to its new location in Jerusalem. In fact, it was signed into law in 1995, read this: 
The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 is a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995. It was passed for the purposes of initiating and funding the relocation of the Embassy of the United States in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem , no later than May 31, 1999, and attempted to withhold 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for “Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad” as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened. The act also called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. Israel’s declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict . The United States has withheld recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. The proposed law was adopted by the Senate (93–5),and the House (374–37). 
Contained in the Jerusalem Embassy Act is a prophecy bombshell , perhaps when you skimmed through it just now you missed so let me break it out for you, ready? 
“…called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city and for it to be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel. 
Now please pause at this juncture and think about what that means for a Bible believer. Do you know why the Palestinians have, for 20 years, refused to accept the so-called Two State Solution ? Because the Two State Solution does not give Jerusalem to Palestine, it gives it to its rightful owner, Israel. The Battle of Armageddon will be fought over who will gain control of, not just Israel in general, but the rights to Jerusalem in particular! The word “Jerusalem” appears 811 times in your King James Bible, think that God places a lot of importance on it? 
“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem.” Zechariah 12:2 (KJV) 
God says if you go against His city of Jerusalem that it will mean “lights out” for you. Jerusalem will be the portal through which God administers His Justice to a depraved world. Jerusalem will be His “burdensome stone” with which He judges the world. 
“And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” Zechariah 12:3 (KJV) NTEB PRESENTS: Donald Trump, Jerusalem and Bible Prophecy 
We just launched a YouTube channel for Bible teaching and prophecy, and here is our very first video of our radio show on Donald Trump and Jerusalem. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel by clicking here , thank you! 
Bible believers, let’s be honest. God is not really so much concerned with any election in any nation so much as He is with His nation of Israel and its capital city of Jerusalem. That’s where God’s passion is, that’s where His heart is. Genesis says that if you want God’s blessing, then bless His nation of Israel and bless His chosen people, the Jews. 
“And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Genesis 12:3 (KJV) Christian, do you need a reason from the Bible to vote for Donald Trump? 
I just gave you two, very powerful and very Biblical reasons to vote for Donald Trump. He will move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, and he will love Israel and God will bless us for that. Now, get up, put your “big boy” and “big girl” pants on, and go out and vote . 
Not for the “lesser of two evils” as some erroneously assert, but for the only candidate that will fulfill Bible prophecy

709,The Only Coup Is a Stolen Election,"

Wars and rumor of wars. There is no coup. What you are watching is a media distraction. Â The MSM is actually covering Hillary’s criminality for the very first time. Are you naive enough to believe the media has had a change of heart? Â Look at the timing. Most of the early balloting is done. The George Soros’ voting machines have been placed into 16 key states. Â Dead people have already early-voted. But the media would have you believe that Hillary cannot win. When the fake polls at ABC show Trump is now leading, you have to question your common sense if you think you are not being played. Â And getting the people to believe that Hillary cannot win because of the late exposure of her criminality, will keep the people from working hard to prevent it.
How can America be so stupid as to believe that the main stream media has had a change of heart? Chris Matthews endorsing Trump along with other main stream media outlets? Really? Was Santa Claus standing in the background laughing?
The criminal elite and their media pawns Â have spent the entire election campaign vilifying Trump and now we are to believe that they have found Jesus and are suddenly supporting Trump? Â For you farm boys, this is called playing possum.
If you don’t want to live under the biggest criminal to ever run for President, you must block out the media and their minions because if you don’t and Hillary steals this election, I will be saying I told you so. Â The only way Trump wins the election, is if the people vote in overwhelming numbers for him and no amount of election fraud can overcome a super majority. For the record, voting machine fraud is designed to flip a percentage of the vote. Â An overwhelming victory cannot be negated without it being painfully obvious to everyone. So, don’t get lulled into complacency. Keep working for Trump!!!!
Believe who you want America, but in 5 days, if you lose your focus in supporting Trump and start assuming a victory, you are going to hand the election to Soros and Clinton.

711,5 Things You Need to Know About the Blacked Out Dakota Access Pipeline Protests,"
by Nick Bernabe
A small Standing Rock Sioux site in North Dakota called the Sacred Stone Camp has been propelled into the national news narrative following their stand against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Due in part to independent media coverage of the ongoing standoff, the Sacred Stone camp has grown into a formidable opposition against the $3.8 billion, 1,200-mile long pipeline.
Due to misinformation coming from law-enforcement, political favoritism toward the pipeline builders, and the media’s blatant reluctance to report on the pipeline, it’s hard to tell truth from fiction. Anti-Media , along with our partners in the independent media and our embedded journalist at the opposition encampment, have been covering the unfolding standoff continuously. Here are five things you need to know.
1. Who is opposing the pipeline — and why 
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is leading the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have been joined by the largest tribal coalition in over 100 years in their stand against the pipeline. The coalition is also comprised of activists, allies, and environmentalists, collectively known as “water protectors,” at the Sacred Stone Camp, an encampment close to the location where the pipeline is planned to cross the Missouri River in North Dakota. According to the Sacred Stone camp website , they are opposing the pipeline because “[t]he Dakota Access threatens everything from farming and drinking water to entire ecosystems, wildlife and food sources surrounding the Missouri.” 
The Standing Rock Sioux also say the pipeline is violating treaty land , Sioux territory that was established many years ago by the federal government. “We will not allow Dakota Access to trespass on our treaty territory and destroy our medicines and our culture.” 
The opposition to the pipeline spreads across several states and is not opposed solely by Native Americans. Farmers, ranchers, and landowners are also opposed to the pipeline. Many of them have had their land taken from them against their will and given to the pipeline via eminent domain.
2. The U.S. government and the pipeline corporation are continuing a long tradition of disrespecting Native Americans 
The United States has a very bad reputation for treating Native Americans, the original inhabitants of this land, as less than human. In many instances in the past, the land where Native Americans lived was deemed to be of higher value than the Natives’ lives.
Such has been the case in North Dakota — not only now, but in the past as well. According to The Atlantic :
“The land beneath the pipeline was accorded to Sioux peoples by the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. Eleven years later, the U.S. government incited and won the Great Sioux War, and ‘renegotiated’ a new treaty with the Sioux under threat of starvation. In that document, the tribe ceded much of the Laramie land, including the Black Hills of South Dakota, where many whites believed there to be gold.”
After the federal government relegated the Sioux people to the “Great Sioux Reservation” in 1851 , the treaty was re-written and “renegotiated” by force whenever resources were discovered or when the U.S. government wanted land. Essentially, the Sioux people were victims of U.S.-sanctioned murder, and their land was stolen because gold was discovered on it.
Fast forward to 2016 and the Sioux people are once again making a stand on land that was once — and still is , according to the tribe — theirs. How is the government reacting to this stand? By brutally arresting the Native American water protectors for trespassing . If that is not a miscarriage of justice, I don’t know what is.
Further, Energy Transfer Partners, the company pulling the strings behind the DAPL, has deep pockets, and its lobbyists have cozied up to federal, state, and local governments with jurisdiction over the pipeline route. This could explain why the company began its construction of the pipeline on Army Corps of Engineers land without even securing an easement , which is required by law. Dakota Access LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, has also used the strong-arm of government to force farmers and landowners to hand over their land to the pipeline against their will.
3. Violent acts are being carried out in North Dakota, but not by the water protectors 

Violence is breaking out at the Dakota Access Protest site, but the protesters have nothing to do with it. Pipeline police, bolstered by the North Dakota National Guard and sheriffs imported from around the country, have turned the standoff into a war zone. Water protectors are regularly pepper sprayed, tear gassed, and violently arrested. Over the weekend, 127 people were detained in the biggest mass arrest to date.
Militarized police at the Dakota Access Pipeline site are decked out in riot gear, armed with military grade weapons, use armored cars or MRAPs with snipers on top of them, and have regularly used LRADs, a type of mass crowd dispersal weapon that uses a high pitched noise to hurt people’s ears — sometimes permanently .
Early reports of protesters being armed and violent have proven to be instances of misinformation spread by law enforcement apparently seeking to demonize the opposition. No credible reports of violence by the protesters have been confirmed or prosecuted. Nearly all arrests stem from trespassing charges or crimes of journalism.
When protesters initially began using civil disobedience to physically shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline site, they were confronted violently by security guards from British mercenary firm G4S. The mercs sicced dogs and used pepper spray on the protesters in an assault that went viral and helped catalyze even more support for the water protectors.
4. Independent media is under attack at the Dakota Access Pipeline — and the corporate media is ignoring it 
Independent media’s broadcasts over the Internet are basically the only reason people around the country and the world now know about the struggle at Standing Rock. Unfortunately, journalists are not immune to the police crackdowns in North Dakota. Dozens of journalists have now been arrested, and an arrest warrant was issued for high-profile journalist Amy Goodman. One independent media outlet, Unicorn Riot , saw four of their journalists arrested in one day in North Dakota. One filmmaker is facing up to 45 years in prison for filming acts of civil disobedience against the pipeline.
Anti-Media ’s journalist on the ground, Derrick Broze, was tased by law enforcement while covering the protests on Thursday as this article was being written.
Meanwhile, the national corporate media ignored the battle against the Dakota Access Pipeline as long as they could. For months, despite the DAPL emergence into the national narrative, ABC and NBC refused to air any coverage about it. A woman was arrested for protesting the pipeline on her own farm after Dakota Access LLC gained access to it against her will via eminent domain — yet there was still no corporate media coverage on the incident.

713,Teenage Boy KNOCKS OUT His Classmate For Assaulting Their Female Teacher In The FACE- And It’s EPIC!,"0 comments 
Not a lot of teenage boys would go out of their selfish ways to stand up for a teacher like this. He stood up for his teacher when his peer punched her in the face. This young man is certainly respectable! 
A shocking video has emerged showing the moment a protective student knocked out a classmate who had just attacked their female teacher. The footage shows that the teacher was trying to break up a fight between two students – one in a red hoodie and one in a black hoodie – when the boy in the red turns around and hits her in the face. The teacher, dressed in white and wearing glasses, appears to fall to the ground after being hit, and then leaves the classroom. 
Then, a third student comes in and punches the boy in head, sending him straight down to the ground. The third student is heard saying: ‘Watch the f— out, you just hit the fucking teacher.’ He then adds: ‘Chill your s—, you just hit the f—ing teacher, you don’t f—ing do that. Who the f— do you think you are?’ 
The teacher then reappears in the room, and appears relatively unscathed. She tells the group to stop fighting and separate.‘He just f—ing hit you, that’s not cool,’ says the boy that came to her defense.‘It’s not cool,’ the teacher replies. It is unclear where the video was filmed or what school was involved, however the clip was spreading quickly on social media on Wednesday after appearing on the website LiveLeak. Some viewers questioned whether the boy in red may have mistakenly hit the teacher, believing she were the other one of the students. However others said he clearly meant to hit the woman. 
Shout out to the boy for standing up for what is right! Related Items",0
714,What Does it Take to Bring Hillary Clinton to Justice?," What Does it Take to Bring Hillary Clinton to Justice?
By Pepe Escobar
 RT "" - Virtually the whole planet holds its collective breath at the prospect of Hillary Clinton possibly becoming the next President of the United States (POTUS).
Hows that humanly possible, as the (daily) Bonfire of The Scandals  relentlessly fed by WikiLeaks revelations and now converging FBI investigations - can now be seen from interstellar space? Its possible because Hillary Clinton, slouching through a paroxysm of manufactured hysteria, is supported by virtually the whole US establishment, a consensual neocon/neoliberalcon War Party/Wall Street/corporate media axis.
But History has a tendency to show us theres always a straw that breaks the camels back.
This could be it  as revealed by WikiLeaks ; March 2, 2015, the day when John Podesta wrote, we are going to have to dump all those emails.
That happened to be the exact same day it was revealed Hillary Clinton had used a personal email server as Secretary of State.
Yet this reveals only part of the puzzle. Theres got to be a response to Podestas email  which WikiLeaks may, or may not, leak in the next few days before the election. If the back and forth clearly shows intent (to mislead), then weve got a 100 percent smoking gun: the whole Clinton (cash) machine narrative  according to which Hillary just deleted ""personal"" emails  crumbles like the ultimate House of Cards.
Moreover, that would unveil what was from the start the privileged Clinton machine strategy: to thwart the subsequent internal State Dept. and FBI investigations.
As far as the Clinton machine is concerned, an interlocking influence peddling pile up is the norm. John Podesta also happens to be the founder of the Center for American Progress  a George Soros operation and prime recruiting ground for Obama administration officials, including US Treasury operatives who decided which elite Too Big To Fail (TBTF) financial giants would be spared after the 2008 crisis. DCLeaks.com , for its part, has connected Soros Open Society foundations to global funding rackets directly leading to subversion of governments and outright regime change (obviously sparing Clinton Foundation donors.)
Exceptional bananas, anyone? The perfectly timed slow drip of WikiLeaks revelations, for the Clinton machine, feels like a sophisticated form of Chinese torture. To alleviate the pain, the relentless standard spin has been to change the subject, blame the messenger, and attribute it all to evil Russian hacking when the real source for the leaks might have come straight from the belly of the (Washington) beast.
At the Valdai discussion club last week, it took President Putin only a few sentences to debunk the whole Clinton machine narrative with a bang:
Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police.You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth.
I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American peoples choice? America is not some kind of banana republic, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong.
Reality, though, continues to insist on offering multiple, overlapping banana republic instances, configuring a giant black hole of transparency.
Anthropologist Janine Wedel has been one of the few in Clinton-linked US mainstream media acknowledging how Bill Clinton, while Hillary was Secretary of State, perfected his version of philantro-capitalism (actually a money laundering pay to play racket), a practice by no means confined to the Clintons.
And the racket prospered with inbuilt nuggets, such as Hillary being perfectly aware that prime Clinton Foundation donors Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also financing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh.
Huma, the Fall Princess Now, less than a week before the election, we have come to the crucial juncture where the WikiLeaks revelations are merging with the FBI investigations - all three of them.
Exhibit A is this WikiLeaks bombshell ; Peter Kadzik, whos now in charge of the Department of Justice (DOJ) probe into the 650,000 emails found on the laptop shared by Clintons right-hand woman Huma Abedin and her estranged, pervert husband Anthony Wiener, is a Clinton asset.
Not only Kadzik was an attorney for Marc Rich when he was pardoned by Bill Clinton; Podesta  as also revealed by WikiLeaks - thanked Kadzik for keeping him out of jail ; and it was Kadzik who gave Podesta a secret heads up on the Clinton email investigation.
The Clinton machine, starring a self-described virtuous Madonna, is actually a pretty nasty business. Huma and her familys close connections to Saudi Arabia  and the Muslim Brotherhood  are legendary (that includes her brother Hassan, who works for Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi). Podesta, by the way, is a handsomely remunerated lobbyist for Saudi Arabia in Washington; thats part of the Clinton Foundation connection.
Yet now, with Huma in the spotlight  still maintaining she didnt know all those emails were in her and Wieners laptop - its no wonder Hillary has instantly downgraded her, publicly, to one of my aides . She used to be Hillarys ersatz daughter ; now shes being framed as The Fall Princess.
And that brings us to the intersection of those three FBI investigations; on Hillarys Subterranean Email Server (in theory closed by FBIs Comey last summer); on the Clinton Foundation; and on Wieners sexting of minors. The FBI has been investigating the Clinton Foundation for over a year now. Lets try to cut a long story short.
Follow the evidence Last July, the DOJ  under Clinton/Obama asset Loretta Lynch - decided not to prosecute anyone on Emailgate. And yet FBI director Comey  who nonetheless stressed Hillarys extreme carelessness  turbo-charged his no-denial mode on another investigation, as in the FBI sought to refocus the Clinton Foundation probe.
Soon we had Clinton Foundation FBI investigators trying to get access to all the emails turned over in the Emailgate investigation. The East District of New York refused it. Very important point; up to 2015, guess who was the US attorney at the East District; Clinton/Obama asset Lynch.
Enter an extra layer of legalese. Less than two months ago, the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators discovered they could not have access to any Emailgate material that was connected to immunity agreements.
But then, roughly a month ago, another FBI team captured the by now famous laptop shared by Huma and Wiener - using a warrant allowing only a probe on Weiners sexting of a 15-year-old girl. Subsequently they found Huma Abedin emails at all her accounts  from Humaabedin@yahoo.com to the crucial huma@clintonemail.com . This meant not only that Huma was forwarding State Dept. emails to her private accounts, but also that Hillary was sending emails from the secret clintonemail.com to Huma at yahoo.com.
No one knew for sure, but some of these emails might be duplicates of those the Clinton Foundation FBI investigators could not access because of the pesky immunity agreements.
Whats established by now is that the metadata in the Huma/Wiener laptop was duly examined. Now picture both teams of FBI investigators  Clinton Foundation and pervert Wiener  comparing notes. And then they decide Humas emails are relevant.
Key questions apply; and the most pressing is how the emails were deemed relevant if the investigators could only examine the metadata. What matters is that Comey certainly was made aware of the content of the emails  a potential game-changer. Thats why one of my sources insists his decision to go public came from above.
The other key question now is whether the DOJ  via Kadzik? - will once again thwart another investigation, this time on the Clinton Foundation. Senior, serious FBI agents wont take that  massive euphemism  kindly.
The FBI has been on the Clinton Foundation for over a year. Now, arguably, they are loaded with evidence  and they wont quit. Winning the presidency now seems to be the least of Hillary Clintons Bonfire of Scandals problems.

715,ICE Rounds Up 44 Criminal Aliens in Texas Capital,"AUSTIN, Texas  —   Enforcement actions underway in Texas as part of the nationwide Operation Cross Check have landed 44 criminal aliens in federal detention this week. [Following news about criminal aliens being arrested in Austin, Texas, by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, Breitbart Texas reached out to the local ICE spokesperson to learn if the arrests were part of an ongoing operation. While the ICE spokesperson would not confirm or deny the operation, U. S. Representative Joaquin Castro confirmed the arrests underway in Austin and throughout South and Central Texas are part of Operation Crosscheck.  “I have been informed by ICE that the agency’s San Antonio field office has launched a targeted operation in South and Central Texas as part of Operation Cross Check,” Castro said in a written statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “I am asking ICE to clarify whether these individuals are in fact dangerous, violent threats to our communities, and not people who are here peacefully raising families and contributing to our state. I will continue to monitor this situation. ” ICE Spokesperson Adelina Pruneda would not release any details about the criminal aliens being arrested, or any possible operation in progress when contacted by Breitbart Texas. She did confirm that one ICE officer was injured in Austin while attempting to take a criminal alien into custody. The alien’s family allegedly attempted to intervene in the arrest. The officer received minor injuries in the scuffle. He was transported to a local emergency clinic where he was treated and released. The roundup of criminal aliens has sparked protests in the Capital City. One twitter user posted a video from an overnight protest march: Happening now downtown #Austin activists march and protest against #ICE raids that surged heading into the weekend pic. twitter.   —   FIELHOUSTON (@FIELHouston) February 11, 2017,  More than 2, 000 criminal aliens were rounded up during Operation Crosscheck in 2015. 1, 000 of the captured criminal aliens were targeted because they had felony convictions. Those range from voluntary manslaughter, child pornography, robbery, kidnapping and rape.   of those captured were known gang members, while   were convicted sex offenders. President Donald Trump stated, during his campaign for president, that he would prioritize the arrest and deportation of criminal aliens. However, ICE roundup operations of this nature are regularly scheduled during the first part of the year. The Mexican consul general in San Antonio claimed that Operation Crosscheck is underway in six different states, the Austin   reported. ICE agents have arrested 44 criminal aliens in the past two days. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

716,"The Election: Of Hate, Grief, and a New Story","Waking Times 
Normal is coming unhinged. For the last eight years it has been possible for most people (at least in the relatively privileged classes) to believe that society is sound, that the system, though creaky, basically works, and that the progressive deterioration of everything from ecology to economy is a temporary deviation from the evolutionary imperative of progress. 
A Clinton Presidency would have offered four more years of that pretense. A woman President following a black President would have meant to many that things are getting better. It would have obscured the reality of continued neoliberal economics, imperial wars, and resource extraction behind a veil of faux-progressive feminism. Now that we have, in the words of my friend Kelly Brogan , rejected a wolf in sheep’s clothing in favor of a wolf in wolf’s clothing, that illusion will be impossible to maintain. 
The wolf, Donald Trump (and I’m not sure he’d be offended by that moniker) will not provide the usual sugarcoating on the poison pills the policy elites have foisted on us for the last forty years. The prison-industrial complex, the endless wars, the surveillance state, the pipelines, the nuclear weapons expansion were easier for liberals to swallow when they came with a dose, albeit grudging, of LGBTQ rights under an African-American President. 
I am willing to suspend my judgement of Trump and (very skeptically) hold the possibility that he will disrupt the elite policy consensus of free trade and military confrontation – major themes of his campaign. One might always hope for miracles. However, because he apparently lacks any robust political ideology of his own, it is more likely that he will fill his cabinet with neocon war hawks, Wall Street insiders, and corporate reavers, trampling the wellbeing of the working class whites who elected him while providing them their own sugar-coating of social conservatism. 
The social and environmental horrors likely to be committed under President Trump are likely to incite massive civil disobedience and possibly disorder. For Clinton supporters, many of whom were halfhearted to begin with, the Trump administration could mark the end of their loyalty to our present institutions of government. For Trump supporters, the initial celebration will collide with gritty reality when Trump proves as unable or unwilling as his predecessors to challenge the entrenched systems that continually degrade their lives: global finance capital, the deep state, and their programming ideologies. Add to this the likelihood of a major economic crisis, and the public’s frayed loyalty to the existing system could snap. 
We are entering a time of great uncertainty. Institutions so enduring as to seem identical to reality itself may lose their legitimacy and dissolve. It may seem that the world is falling apart. For many, that process started on election night, when Trump’s victory provoked incredulity, shock, even vertigo. “I can’t believe this is happening!” 
At such moments, it is a normal response to find someone to blame, as if identifying fault could restore the lost normality, and to lash out in anger. Hate and blame are convenient ways of making meaning out of a bewildering situation. Anyone who disputes the blame narrative may receive more hostility than the opponents themselves, as in wartime when pacifists are more reviled than the enemy. 
Racism and misogyny are devastatingly real in this country, but to blame bigotry and sexism for voters’ repudiation of the Establishment is to deny the validity of their deep sense of betrayal and alienation. The vast majority of Trump voters were expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the system in the way most readily available to them. (See here , here , here , here ) Millions of Obama voters voted for Trump (six states who went for Obama twice switched to Trump). Did they suddenly become racists in the last four years? The blame-the-racists (the fools, the yokels…) narrative generates a clear demarcation between good (us) and evil (them), but it does violence to the truth. It also obscures an important root of racism – anger displaced away from an oppressive system and its elites and onto other victims of that system. Finally, it employs the same dehumanization of the other that is the essence of racism and the precondition for war. Such is the cost of preserving a dying story. That is one reason why paroxysms of violence so often accompany a culture-defining story’s demise. 
The dissolution of the old order that is now officially in progress is going to intensify. That presents a tremendous opportunity and danger, because when normal falls apart the ensuing vacuum draws in formerly unthinkable ideas from the margins. Unthinkable ideas range from rounding up the Muslims in concentration camps, to dismantling the military-industrial complex and closing down overseas military bases. They range from nationwide stop-and-frisk to replacing criminal punishment with restorative justice. Anything becomes possible with the collapse of dominant institutions. When the animating force behind these new ideas is hate or fear, all manner of fascistic and totalitarian nightmares can ensue, whether enacted by existing powers or those that arise in revolution against them. 
That is why, as we enter a period of intensifying disorder, it is important to introduce a different kind of force to animate the structures that might appear after the old ones crumble. I would call it love if it weren’t for the risk of triggering your New Age bullshit detector, and besides, how does one practically bring love into the world in the realm of politics? So let’s start with empathy. Politically, empathy is akin to solidarity, born of the understanding that we are all in this together. In what together? For starters, we are in the uncertainty together. 
We are exiting an old story that explained to us the way of the world and our place in it. Some may cling to it all the more desperately as it dissolves, looking perhaps to Donald Trump to restore it, but their savior has not the power to bring back the dead. Neither would Clinton have been able to preserve America as we’d known it for too much longer. We as a society are entering a space between stories, in which everything that had seemed so real, true, right, and permanent comes into doubt. For a while, segments of society have remained insulated from this breakdown (whether by fortune, talent, or privilege), living in a bubble as the containing economic and ecological systems deteriorate. But not for much longer. Not even the elites are immune to this doubt. They grasp at straws of past glories and obsolete strategies; they create perfunctory and unconvincing shibboleths (Putin!), wandering aimlessly from “doctrine” to “doctrine” – and they have no idea what to do. Their haplessness and half-heartedness was plain to see in this election, their disbelief in their own propaganda, their cynicism. When even the custodians of the story no longer believe the story, you know its days are numbered. It is a shell with no engine, running on habit and momentum. 
We are entering a space between stories. After various retrograde versions of a new story rise and fall and we enter a period of true unknowing, an authentic next story will emerge. What would it take for it to embody love, compassion, and interbeing? I see its lineaments in those marginal structures and practices that we call holistic, alternative, regenerative, and restorative. All of them source from empathy, the result of the compassionate inquiry: What is it like to be you? 
It is time now to bring this question and the empathy it arouses into our political discourse as a new animating force. If you are appalled at the election outcome and feel the call of hate, perhaps try asking yourself, “What is it like to be a Trump supporter?” Ask it not with a patronizing condescension, but for real, looking underneath the caricature of misogynist and bigot to find the real person. 
Even if the person you face IS a misogynist or bigot, ask, “Is this who they are, really?” Ask what confluence of circumstances, social, economic, and biographical, may have brought them there. You may still not know how to engage them, but at least you will not be on the warpath automatically. We hate what we fear, and we fear what we do not know. So let’s stop making our opponents invisible behind a caricature of evil. 
We’ve got to stop acting out hate. I see no less of it in the liberal media than I do in the right-wing. It is just better disguised, hiding beneath pseudo-psychological epithets and dehumanizing ideological labels. Exercising it, we create more of it. What is beneath the hate? My acupuncturist Sarah Fields wrote to me, “Hate is just a bodyguard for grief. When people lose the hate, they are forced to deal with the pain beneath.” 
I think the pain beneath is fundamentally the same pain that animates misogyny and racism – hate in a different form. Please stop thinking you are better than these people! We are all victims of the same world-dominating machine, suffering different mutations of the same wound of separation. Something hurts in there. We live in a civilization that has robbed nearly all of us of deep community, intimate connection with nature, unconditional love, freedom to explore the kingdom of childhood, and so much more. The acute trauma endured by the incarcerated, the abused, the raped, the trafficked, the starved, the murdered, and the dispossessed does not exempt the perpetrators. They feel it in mirror image, adding damage to their souls atop the damage that compels them to violence. Thus it is that suicide is the leading cause of death in the U.S. military. Thus it is that addiction is rampant among the police. Thus it is that depression is epidemic in the upper middle class. We are all in this together. 
Something hurts in there. Can you feel it? We are all in this together. One earth, one tribe, one people. 
We have entertained teachings like these long enough in our spiritual retreats, meditations, and prayers. Can we take them now into the political world and create an eye of compassion inside the political hate vortex? It is time to do it, time to up our game. It is time to stop feeding hate. Next time you post on line, check your words to see if they smuggle in some form of hate: dehumanization, snark, belittling, derision.., some invitation to us versus them. Notice how it feels kind of good to do that, like getting a fix. And notice what hurts underneath, and how it doesn’t feel good, not really. Maybe it is time to stop. 
This does not mean to withdraw from political conversation, but to rewrite its vocabulary. It is to speak hard truths with love. It is to offer acute political analysis that doesn’t carry the implicit message of “Aren’t those people horrible?” Such analysis is rare. Usually, those evangelizing compassion do not write about politics, and sometimes they veer into passivity. We need to confront an unjust, ecocidal system. Each time we do we will receive an invitation to give in to the dark side and hate “the deplorables.” We must not shy away from those confrontations. Instead, we can engage them empowered by the inner mantra that my friend Pancho Ramos-Stierle uses in confrontations with his jailers: “Brother, your soul is too beautiful to be doing this work.” If we can stare hate in the face and never waver from that knowledge, we will access inexhaustible tools of creative engagement, and hold a compelling invitation to the haters to fulfill their beauty.

718,"Keith Vaz, British Lawmaker, Quits Senior Post Amid Sex and Drug Scandal - The New York Times","LONDON  —   Caught in what appeared to be a classic British newspaper exposé, an opposition lawmaker on Tuesday relinquished leadership of an influential parliamentary committee over allegations that he paid for the services of prostitutes and offered to buy drugs for them. Two days after The Sunday Mirror published a report about the encounter involving the lawmaker, Keith Vaz, a prominent member of the Labour Party and a former minister for Europe, Mr. Vaz said it was “in the best interest” of the Home Affairs Select Committee, which he led, for its work to be “conducted without any distractions whatsoever. ” “I am genuinely sorry that recent events make it impossible for this to happen if I remain chair,” Mr. Vaz said in a statement. After the allegations were published on Sunday, Mr. Vaz argued that it was “deeply disturbing that a national newspaper should have paid individuals to have acted in this way,” adding that he would refer the report to his lawyers. Britain’s freewheeling tabloid press has been more restrained in recent times, after scandals over telephone hacking that led to an inquiry into ethical standards at the country’s newspapers. The Sunday Mirror sought to justify its report by pointing to the political responsibilities of Mr. Vaz, suggesting that his conduct had compromised his ability to fulfill his duties. As chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons, he enjoyed a prominent role in oversight of the Home Office, the department that controls Britain’s policy on, among other things, drugs and prostitution. Even before his announcement on Tuesday, some politicians had suggested that his resignation was inevitable. John Whittingdale, who served as culture secretary under former Prime Minister David Cameron, said on Sunday that he understood that Mr. Vaz would relinquish his leadership of the committee. “Given the areas of which the committee is responsible, that does seem to me to be a sensible course of action,” Mr. Whittingdale told Sky News. According to The Sunday Mirror, Mr. Vaz, who is a married father of two, met with two men, identified by the tabloid as prostitutes, on Aug. 27 at an apartment in London. Before meeting with them, Mr. Vaz texted one of the men and asked him to bring poppers, a class of chemicals called alkyl nitrites that can be inhaled for a quick high or to enhance sexual pleasure, although the paper reported that Mr. Vaz had said that he did not use the drug himself. Mr. Vaz also discussed paying for cocaine but said he would not consume it, the paper reported. In Parliament, Mr. Vaz has argued against including poppers in a list of banned substances. During the encounter, Mr. Vaz told the men that his name was Jim and that he was a salesman for industrial washing machines, The Sunday Mirror reported, but one of the escorts recognized the lawmaker from his television appearances.",0

Here’s a video on 3,000 scientists and professors with Ph.D.s who became believers of Creation, based on evidence, not faith. Some examples are Duane Gish, Cornell U. researcher with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from U.C. Berkeley; Henry Morris, Ph.D., professor of Hydraulic Engineering at Virginia Tech. 
Pull quotes from the video, spoken by Dr. Jerry Bergman, co-author of the book Persuaded by the Evidence : 
1:09 mark: “The book basically summarizes accounts of why people became creationists . . . . So many people believe that creationists are . . . just born that way or raised that way . . . . We want to show that many people became creationists because of the scientific evidence. In fact, many people in the book, including myself, became creationists by the evidence, not because we were raised this way.” 
6:55 mark: “In fact, when I was an atheist, we used to often call these, what they call theistic evolutionists, ‘useful idiots’ . . . and that term was heard over and over again. They felt they’re [theistic evolutionists] useful for now. Once we convince the world of Darwinism . . . then there’ll be no need for religion, and they [theistic evolutionists] in essence are digging their own grave.” 
8:07 mark: “Many [of the 3,000 scientists and professors in the book] stress very strongly that I would not be a Christian today if it was not for my study of evolution and my realization that evolution is not supportable by the science. And therefore they became creationists, and then they became Christians.” 
8:54 mark: “I began to question atheism for a number of reasons. One reason was a lot of the scholarship that atheists did, I realized due to a lot of reading, was just not valid. Like the claims about Galileo and Bruno, and the claims that the Church executed many, many scientists because of their science. I realized that these claims are just not true, they’re just false. So I became disillusioned with atheist scholarship. And the next step was, indeed, is there any evidence for evolution because a major reason why many people are atheists is because they are convinced we do not need a Creator to account for the origin of life and the Universe. This is a foundational doctrine of atheism. So I decided, ‘Well, if this is not true, if evolution is not valid, then that negates the reason why many people are atheists.'” 
11:28 mark: The evolutionary progression from ape to man that’s “commonly presented” is “either faked or they are distorted or the evidence is very unpersuasive for what they call a monkey or primate into man.” 
11:48 mark: “Dogmatic evolution, I find, is interfering with science . . . because you are looking at the world with very distorted glasses. You’re not looking at what’s there; you’re looking at what you want to see there . . . . You must not force the facts into an evolutionary interpretation, and this all too often is done.” 
An example of science forcing the facts into an evolutionary interpretation is pseudogenes and junk DNA. 12:33 mark: “It was said for a long time that . . . 95% of the DNA is junk, it has no function . . . . I said all we can say now is we don’t know that it has a function . . . . Over and over I argued with colleagues about this. Now it’s widely recognized that much, if not most, possibly almost all of this so-called junk DNA now we know has a function. Much of it has a regulatory function.” Helix Nebula , dubbed “Eye of God,” in the constellation Aquarius, 700 light years from Earth.

721,HELL HAS FROZEN OVER! Michelle Obama Just Made A Hillary-Destroying Move On Twitter,"0 comments Can this really be happening? Michelle Obama has been campaigning for Hillary Clinton for some time. She touts Hillary’s accomplishments while denouncing Donald Trump as a misogynist and all-around scumbag. Just five days ago, the First Lady Of The United States and Hillary Clinton appeared together on stage in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. They held hands, they worked the crowd. Michelle presented a rousing statement: âThere are some folks out there who are commenting that it is unprecedented for a sitting first lady to be so actively engaged in a presidential campaign, and that may be true,â said Mrs. Obama, a reluctant campaigner who has nevertheless emerged in recent weeks as Mrs. Clintonâs most compelling surrogate. âBut what is also true is that this is truly an unprecedented election, and thatâs why Iâm out here,â Mrs. Obama added, arguing that Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, was working to discourage people in the crowd from voting by making âthis election so dirty and ugly that we donât want any part of it.â What a difference a few days makes. Only a few moments ago, Michelle Obama made an earth shattering move on Twitter. Multiple outlets are reporting that Michelle deleted all references of Hillary from her Twitter feed, and all Tweets from the last three years. Yesterday @donnabrazile removed picture of Hilary from her profile. Today @FLOTUS and @MichelleObama removed all tweets mentioning Hillary. pic.twitter.com/e8Ebc53tlu

5.5 million followers and no longer a mention of Hillary Clinton? 
Are Michelle Obama and the Democrats distancing themselves from the embattled Democrat nominee? 
It sure looks like it. 
Remaining close to Hillary Clinton, with 650,000 insider emails reported to be exposed seems to be risky business. 
Let’s not forget: WikiLeaks and Anonymous have not weighed in yet in they blockbuster ways that they have promised. 
Of course, it could be a technical error or coincidence. 
After all, Democrats are good at deleting things.",0
722,FLYNN: Critics Call Nuclear Scientist Miss USA ’Dumb’ After She Disses Feminism and Calls Health Care a ’Privilege’ - Breitbart,"Kara McCullough made the Miss USA pageant great again —  just not in the way the contest’s organizers intended. [Twenty months after Donald Trump sold the contest to   the pageant made every effort to separate itself from its former owner —  a move not lost on the media covering the event. The Associated Press, for instance, reported: “The pageant included a field of five new immigrants who spoke on air about the importance of diversity  —   as if to refute US President Donald Trump’s less than welcoming stand toward some immigrants and refugees. ”  McCullough, an   born in Italy, looked the part but refused to play it this weekend. Miss D. C. rejected feminism for equality. “So as a woman scientist in the government, I’d like to lately transpose the word ‘feminism’ to ‘equalism,’” she explained. “I don’t really want to consider myself  —   try not to consider myself like this   you know, like, ‘Oh, I don’t really care about men.’ But one thing I’m going to say, though, is women, we are just as equal as men when it comes to opportunity in the workplace. ” She further ran afoul of the politically correct when she described health care as an earned “privilege” rather than an awarded “right. ” She told her questioners, “I’m definitely going to say it’s a privilege. As a government employee, I am granted health care. And I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs. ” She won the judges but lost the judgmental. Calling the   Miss USA’s answers “dumb” and “ill informed,” the appropriately named Linda Stasi of the New York Daily News charged that “McCullough did all women a disservice with her remarks on healthcare, but she did more damage with her dismissal of feminism. ” Other cultural commissars carped. It’s incredibly sad that in 2017, a woman is striving to occupy a position of influence   no understanding of what feminism is. #MissUSA,  —   courtney (@seecourttweet) May 15, 2017,  Dear #kara mccullough You are sadly mistaken. Everyone has a right to healthcare. Maybe you should be stripped of yours.

723,"Hampshire College Student Accused of Assaulting Basketball Player for Wearing Hair Braids, Claims ’Cultural Appropriation’ - Breitbart","A Hampshire College student allegedly assaulted a member of the Central Maine Community College girl’s basketball team over concerns that one of their players had “culturally appropriated” a hairstyle. [Hampshire College student Carmen Figueroa ordered members of the Central Maine Community College girls basketball team to remove braids from their hair, claiming that their use of the hairstyle is “cultural appropriation. ”  According to The Daily Hampshire Gazette, Figueroa allegedly assaulted the girls after they refused to comply with her demand that they remove their braids: When the players did not comply and began to leave the building, Figueroa allegedly initiated a fight towards one of the players. At the same time, another unknown Hampshire College student pulled the hair of a visiting women’s basketball player causing her to fall to the ground, according to court documents. Figueroa was charged with disorderly conduct, assault and battery, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after an altercation that erupted over her concerns about the hairstyle sported by some members of the basketball team. Figueroa denies all charges. Oxford Reference defines cultural appropriation as the “taking over of creative or artistic forms, themes, or practices by one cultural group from another. It is in general used to describe Western appropriations of non‐Western or non‐white forms, and carries connotations of exploitation and dominance. ” “Overall, the topic of dispute on whether or not a white woman can wear braids is a very tricky blurred line  —   since cultural appropriation (CA) changes as our cultures blend and mesh it’s difficult to make a contention on whether or not braids are CA,” Madison Campbell, the Young Americans for Liberty President at Hampshire College, told the online campus watchdog site Campus Reform. “However, regardless of whether or not the hairstyle worn by the plaintiff is CA, it is completely wrong to victimize and brutally attack another individual for their hair. ” “I do not condone the violence brought on from this Hampshire student, and believe if the defendant had problems with the hairstyle that they should have expressed their opinion verbally rather than abusively,” Campbell added. This incident is similar an incident caught on video at San Francisco State University in which a white student with dreadlocks was confronted by a black student in March last year.

724,The Obamamometer’s Toxic Legacy: The Rule of Lawlessness,"  
By Jerri-Lynn Scofield, who has worked as a securities lawyer and a derivatives trader. She now spends most of her time in India and other parts of Asia researching a book about textile artisans. She also writes regularly about legal, political economy, and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications, as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National . 
All right, all right. I can’t take it any more. Yesterday I read a Facebook post that blamed the current US electoral predicament on the “pointless” 22nd Amendment. For those of you without a US Constitution handy, the 22nd Amendment is the one that limits US presidents to serving two terms. 
That Facebook post implies that without the 22nd Amendment we’d get to see a third term for the Obamamometer . That risible suggestion, combined with the incessant legacy-burnishing that he’s indulged in– at least until he realized that HRC might be in trouble and started to hit the campaign trail in earnest– made me realize the time for shredding aspects of that legacy is way overdue. 
When the Obamamometer finally settles on what he’ll do next– whether that would be run a sports team, become a venture capitalist, found a new religion, cure cancer, or merely hob nob with the global elite and play lots of golf, I’m sure he’ll make a fine job job of it– just as he’s done with his Presidency. Over the next couple of months, I intend to post occasionally on this legacy: but rather than burnishing that record, I’ll indulge in a bit of legacy busting. 
First up, the rule of law and corporate crime. 
The Holder Doctrine 
Federal prosecutors, and regulatory agencies, have turned into toothless tigers when it comes to prosecuting C-suite types, and pursuing corporations seriously, for economic crimes. Both financial institutions and their management got virtually a free pass for their activities that led to the Great Recession. And not only for those, but for subsequent foreclosure abuses, LIBOR and other market manipulations, money laundering, tax scams, and doing business contrary to US sanctions policy. Yet to date, not a single C-suite type has been indicted. 
It’s not just financial institutions that’ve received a free pass. Big Pharma, for example, has also been lucky, as have companies that have engaged in creative tax minimization strategies (Apple, anyone?). And if looked at from the perspective of legal topics, rather than corporate actors, entire areas of law– antitrust, for example– are not really relevant anymore. 
You don’t have to take my word for it. No less a source than the NY Times’ DealBook column– not a venue, incidentally, renowned for its trenchant, timely critiques of either Wall Street or other corporate behavior– in September lamented, Law Enforcement ‘Not Winning’ War on White Collar Crime . I wrote about this article in a September post and so won’t rehash all the arguments I made then here. But a few points are in order. 
The lack of enforcement not only means that the guilty don’t pay. It also determines what corporate strategies get pursued, which business models are developed or rejected, what attitudes corporations take to risk, and how resources get allocated to name just a few consequences. And as I’ll discuss below, it also shapes how attorneys practice law, and the impact their advice carries in deterring certain types of corporate behavior. 
I never thought I’d be nostalgic for President George W. Bush’s Department of Justice (DoJ). Now, I’m well aware of the scandal that ensued over Attorney General Alfred Gonzales imposing ideological litmus tests on assistant US attornies. Nonetheless, in the wake of the collapse of the dotcom bubble, the Bush DoJ actually enforced the law. It prosecuted cases and claimed scalps. Companies such as Adelphi, Enron and WorldCom all saw top-level management prosecuted, and malefactors sent to jail. 
Change We Can’t Believe In 
Those who voted for Hope and Change in 2008 certainly got the change part– at least with respect to the DoJ. But when we look at the DoJ’s enforcement priorities and the track record that followed, it’s perhaps not the change they were hoping for. The Obamamometer’s first Attorney General, Eric Holder, outlined and followed what came to be known as the Holder doctrine. 
Allow me to quote from my September post: 
[Under the Holder doctrine the DoJ eschewed corporate charges against companies and executives, instead opting for negotiated settlements (often imposing de minimis, slap-on-the wrist penalties that were significantly undersized compared to the magnitude of damage done, especially by TBTF banks and other financial predators, to name just a few). 
The DoJ under Obama’s second AG, Loretta Lynch, originally followed the Holder doctrine, until that was superseded when Deputy Attorney General Sally Quillian Yates authored a memo outlining a new approach in September 2015. Under this approach, the DoJ intended to increase accountability for corporate wrongdoing, and this included an increased focus on pursuing criminal charges against responsible individuals. The DoJ sought to drive a legal wedge between individuals and the corporations for whom they worked by only allowing corporations to receive “cooperation credit” that would reduce their potential exposure (including penalties) if the corporation cooperates in surrendering as early as possible comprehensive detailed information concerning the individual misconduct. 
There’s much more in a similar vein in that earlier post, for those with an interest. But the bottom line for purposes of this post is what has this supposed policy shift, from Holder’s doctrine to Yates’s memo, meant in practice. The short answer: bupkis. We’re still waiting for the more robust enforcement approach the Yates memo supposedly heralded to kick in. As an attorney I know who specializes in white collar defense work summed it up to me, “The DoJ’s walking a new walk, and talking a new talk, but nothing’s really changed.” 
In fact, in only two areas have we seen the DoJ take a muscular approach toward enforcement during the Obamamometer’s administration, insider trading, and offenses under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). 
Insider Trading 
US Attorney for the southern district of New York Preet Bharara has compiled an undefeated string of convictions for insider trading (some of which may be at risk of being overturned due to some appellate decisions, which are beyond the scope of this post). But as I wrote last month in The SEC Fiddles While the System Burns: Insider Trading Enforcement As Securities Law Theater , focusing on insider trading as an enforcement priority constitutes a form of securities law theater. Scare prosecutorial resources are expended on insider trading abuses, rather than being deployed to investigate, punish, and (hopefully) deter, far more serious systemic problems. 
The insider trading focus provides the illusion that the DoJ is doing something about high-level cheating. Yet it has little broader deterrent effect on stymieing the wider corporate scams that misallocate resources and erode confidence in the integrity of the system. Insider trading enforcement is usually directed at individuals, and doesn’t implicate wider considerations of corporate strategy or policy. Prosecuting insider traders maintains the myth that the greatest threats to US capitalism are individual bad corporate actors, rather than anything more sweeping or systemic. Catch the bad actors, fine them or throw them in jail, and never think about any deeper problems. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
Another area highlighted as an enforcement priority is bribery and foreign corruption, with prosecutions undertaken under authority of the FCPA. Allow me to quote from a speech made by assistant attorney general Leslie R. Caldwell last week: 
The effects of foreign corruption are not just felt overseas. In today’s global economy, the negative effects of foreign corruption flow back to the United States. American companies are harmed by global corruption when they are denied the ability to compete in a fair and transparent marketplace. Instead of being rewarded for their efficiency, innovation and honest business practices, U.S. companies suffer at the hands of corrupt governments and lose out to corrupt competitors. 
…. 
This is why the fight against international corruption has been, and continues to be, a core priority of the Department of Justice. It has been a core priority for the Criminal Division, and our commitment to the fight against foreign bribery is reflected in our robust enforcement record in this area, which includes charges against corporations and individuals alike from all over the world. Since 2009, the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section has convicted more than 65 individuals in [FCPA] and FCPA-related cases, and resolved criminal cases against more than 65 companies with penalties and forfeiture of approximately $4.5 billion. 
Sounds reasonable, right? I mean, after all, no one would come right out in favor of more international corruption? 
But when we unpack it, we butt up against a few problems. First, to quote my contact the white collar defence specialist again. The lack of an effective DoJ deterrent has enormously complicated his practice and his ability to get his clients to understand and act on prudent legal advice. “What I’ve seen happening more and more in the last couple of years is the chairs of audit committees of major companies openly mocking the DoJ’s enforcement capability.” This leads the companies to pursue courses of action that they wouldn’t dare to undertake if they worried that the DoJ would aggressively pursue securities law violations. 
Where does this leave their lawyers? Well, it often means that they must either moderate their advice, or risk losing their clients. Clients who want to do something will resist their impulses and continue to listen to what they hear as their lawyers crying wolf only for so long. Eventually, the less scrupulous among them are going to ignore the contrary advice, or get another lawyer. The lack of effective enforcement at the DoJ hinders the efforts of the best, most prudent, and most ethical members of the legal profession to practice law as we would want them to. 
So, what happens instead? Well, the most scrupulous of them will continue to give what they regard as sound legal advice (even if what some privately call the Department of Jokes does not enforce the law in a way that lends credence to that approach). But that means they often have to develop new areas of expertise when their clients beat a path away from their doors. “We have to act sometimes as shoe salesmen, flogging competence in FCPA violations, that occur in subsidiaries or with foreign suppliers,” says my white collar defense specialist contact. “This work leads us to countries and legal systems we don’t know well, to uncover chickenshit violations that occur far from home.” Far better, he believes, would be for the DoJ to focus on law-breaking that occurs in the United States, as that could be effectively deterred by the agency refocusing its enforcement priorities. Now that would be a legacy we could all believe in. 
Bottom Line 
On the contrary, one persistent legacy of the Obamamometer is to say one thing and then do another. The DoJ has recently signalled its intention to get tougher on white collar crime. But so far, there’s been no follow through on the rhetoric. Instead, we see federal prosecutors either turning a blind eye to major problems, or conducting various forms of enforcement theater– much sound and fury, but in the end, signifying nothing.

726,"For Simone Manuel, Gold Ripples Beyond the Pool - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Simone Manuel woke up Friday morning to confirmation that her victory in the   freestyle a few hours earlier had not been a dream. The proof was perhaps more surreal than Thursday night’s payoff: Instagram posts from LeBron James and Serena Williams. Manuel’s friend and fellow trailblazer Lia Neal had forwarded the messages after stumbling across them on Twitter. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, I wish I could see her reaction right now,’” Neal said. “She doesn’t need to hear from anyone else. Those are like her two favorite athletes. ” Manuel’s popularity got an emphatic spike after she became the first   woman to win an individual swimming event at the Olympics. Manuel, a    Texan, shared the gold medal with    Penny Oleksiak, who also made history, becoming the youngest gold medalist from Canada. James wrote that he watched the race with his daughter. Williams posted a picture of Manuel and Simone Biles, who won the gymnastics   gold medal, and called them  “amazing. ” One mother posted a photograph on Twitter of her exuberant young black daughter posing in front of a television screen that showed Manuel being interviewed. By early Friday evening, it had more than 12, 000 likes. “I saw that picture,” Neal said. “I retweeted it. I was tearing up again. ” The top of the medals podium at Olympic Aquatics Stadium was crowded Thursday night, and not because there were   medalists for the first time in the Olympics since 2000, when Anthony Ervin, whose father is   and American Indian, tied his teammate Gary Hall Jr. in the 50 freestyle. Standing on the podium with her, Manuel said, were Neal, Ervin, Maritza Correira, Cullen Jones and all the black swimmers whose success shaped Manuel’s dreams. “This medal is not just for me, it’s for some of the   that have come before me, have been inspirations and mentors to me,” Manuel said. In 2012, Neal became the second   woman to make a United States Olympic swim team, after Correia in 2004. Neal was 17 and a rising senior in high school. Neal and Correia earned medals as members of 4x100 freestyle relays in their first Olympics. Correia won a silver, Neal a bronze. On Saturday, Neal raced in the morning heat for the American 4x100 relay team, which later took the silver. Neal, a rising senior at Stanford who grew up in Brooklyn, was asked which medal she considers more precious, her silver or the gold that Manuel earned in an upset. “I think Simone’s gold,” Neal said. “I just felt more when she touched the wall and saw that she won. I knew exactly what went into winning that gold medal. ” Neal feels a sisterly bond to Manuel, who is one year behind her at Stanford. In the   to the Olympics, they often felt as if people saw their stories as being only skin deep. On the way to becoming the first two black women to grace the same United States Olympic swimming team, Neal and Manuel often compared notes after news media interviews. To their growing frustration, race was often discussed more than their races. “We talk about it and acknowledge that other people talk about it,” Neal said, “but we’re like ‘O. K. we’re here, like everyone else here we’re training toward winning, toward representing their country in the best way possible. History comes along with that. ” She added, “It’s cool because we’re not seeking to make history or change lives, we’re just doing what we love. ” Neal sat with Manuel roughly two hours before Thursday’s final. They listened to music, including the song “1, 2 Step” by Ciara and Missy Elliott. Neal’s parting words were “Pipe It Up,” from Migos. Neal said she was shaking before Manuel’s race and started crying during the last 10 meters when it dawned on her that Manuel might win. The prerace favorites were Cate Campbell of Australia, who lowered the world record to 52. 08 in July, and her sister, Bronte, who had clocked a 52. 58 in April. Manuel posted a 53. 32 in the heats, a 53. 11 in the semifinals and a 52. 70 in the final. “I was super surprised,” Manuel said after the race. “I don’t think there was a definitive point where I thought I had the race. ” How shocking was the outcome? Sarah Sjostrom, the Swede who finished third, said, “Penny and the American girl winning, I think that was the biggest surprise of the meet. ” (Never mind that “the American girl” had finished sixth, four places behind Sjostrom, in the   freestyle final at last summer’s World Championships in Kazan, Russia). After Manuel finished giving interviews in the mixed zone, she fell into the arms of Neal and another Stanford teammate, Maya DiRado. “She was just bawling,” Neal said. “She was like: ‘I’m so happy you guys are my teammates. I couldn’t have done this without you guys. I love you. ’” Manuel’s sentiments meant the world to Neal, who was disappointed when she did not qualify for these Games in an individual event. “Why I broke down in tears and why I felt so much emotion when she won was because I was there with her every step of the way,” Neal said. “I knew exactly what it took to get to that point and win a gold medal firsthand. ” How long will it take for swimming in the United States to become colorblind? Is one gold enough to change the questions Manuel and Neal face? “I think this definitely catapults us many steps forward,” Neal said, adding, “I think just that one medal will bring so many different people into the sport and inspire so many different people. ” Manuel, who on Friday qualified for Saturday’s   freestyle final, said she looked forward to the day when she is known simply as a champion. After the 100 final, she said, “I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it’s not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title ‘black swimmer’ makes it seem like I’m not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I’m not supposed to be able to break records. ”",0
727,Rand Paul: Polls Showing Hillary Ahead Are ‘Designed To Suppress Turnout’,"Email 

Wednesday on 800 WVHU radio’s “The Tom Roten Morning Show,” Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said polls showing Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton with a lead over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump were “designed to suppress turnout.” 
Paul said “You know, I think sometimes polling is done to dampen election turnout. So when Trump says the thing’s rigged, I’m not sure exactly what he means and I’m not sure I always agree with him. But I do think that when we say over and over someone can’t win, that is a form of rigging in the sense that it is designed to suppress turnout.” 
He added, “The polls are put out, you know to make it either look closer than it is or to make it look like Democrats have a better chance. And I think it’s done by design to try to dampen turnout.”",0

Americans are being told by “experts” (read “Hillary supporters”) that election fraud in the US is rare. They are also being misinformed that voting fraud would be detected. The fact of the matter is, as has now been proven, that no vast conspiracy is required. One person suffices to have the machine count the votes as desired. Once the vote is recorded the code erases the elements that would reveal the fraud. 
The entire purpose of the presstitutes reporting a non-existent Hillary lead is to create in advance acceptance that she won, thereby discrediting in advance any challenge to the rigged outcome.

Green wedges are groups that have not been genomically sampled at the Rifle site –everything else has. Black wedges are previously identified bacteria groups that have also been found at Rifle. Purple wedges are groups discovered at Rifle and announced last year. Red wedges are new groups discovered in this study. Colored dots represent important metabolic processes the new groups help mediate. 
One of the most detailed genomic studies of any ecosystem to date has revealed an underground world of stunning microbial diversity, and added dozens of new branches to the tree of life. 
The bacterial bonanza comes from scientists who reconstructed the genomes of more than 2,500 microbes from sediment and groundwater samples collected at an aquifer in Colorado. The effort was led by researchers from the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley. DNA sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. 
As reported online October 24 in the journal Nature Communications , the scientists netted genomes from 80 percent of all known bacterial phyla, a remarkable degree of biological diversity at one location. They also discovered 47 new phylum-level bacterial groups , naming many of them after influential microbiologists and other scientists. And they learned new insights about how microbial communities work together to drive processes that are critical to the planet’s climate and life everywhere, such as the carbon and nitrogen cycles. 
These findings shed light on one of Earth’s most important and least understood realms of life. The subterranean world hosts up to one-fifth of all biomass, but it remains a mystery. 
“We didn’t expect to find this incredible microbial diversity. But then again, we know little about the roles of subsurface microbes in biogeochemical processes, and more broadly, we don’t really know what’s down there,” says Jill Banfield, a Senior Faculty Scientist in Berkeley Lab’s Climate & Ecosystem Sciences Division and a UC Berkeley professor in the departments of Earth and Planetary Science, and Environmental Science, Policy, and Management. 
UC Berkeley’s Karthik Anantharaman, the first author of the paper, adds, “To better understand what subsurface microbes are up to, our approach is to access their entire genomes. This enabled us to discover a greater interdependency among microbes than we’ve seen before.” 
The research is part of a Berkeley Lab-led project called Sustainable Systems Scientific Focus Area 2.0, which is developing a predictive understanding of terrestrial environments from the genome to the watershed scale. The project’s field research takes place at a research site near the town of Rifle, Colorado, where for the past several years scientists have conducted experiments designed to stimulate populations of subterranean microbes that are naturally present in very low numbers. 
The scientists sent soil and water samples from these experiments to the Joint Genome Institute for terabase-scale metagenomic sequencing. This high-throughput method isolates and purifies DNA from environmental samples, and then sequences one trillion base pairs of DNA at a time. Next, the scientists used bioinformatics tools developed in Banfield’s lab to analyze the data. 
Their approach has redrawn the tree of life. Between the 47 new bacterial groups reported in this work, and 35 new groups published last year (also found at the Rifle site), Banfield’s team has doubled the number of known bacterial groups. 
With discovery comes naming rights. The scientists named many of the new bacteria groups after Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley researchers. For example, there’s Candidatus Andersenbacteria, after phylochip inventor Gary Andersen, and there’s Candidatus Doudnabacteria, after CRISPR genome-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna. “Berkeley now dominates the tree of life as it does the periodic table,” Banfield says, in a nod to the sixteen elements discovered at Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley. 
Another big outcome is a deeper understanding of the roles subsurface microbes play in globally important carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles . This information will help to better represent these cycles in predictive models such as climate simulations. 
The scientists conducted metabolic analyses of 36 percent of the organisms detected in the aquifer system. They focused on a phenomenon called metabolic handoff, which essentially means one microbe’s waste is another microbe’s food. It’s known from lab studies that handoffs are needed in certain reactions, but these interconnected networks are widespread and vastly more complex in the real world. 
To understand why it’s important to represent metabolic handoffs as accurately as possible in models, consider nitrate, a groundwater contaminant from fertilizers. Subsurface microbes are the primary driver in reducing nitrate to harmless nitrogen gas. There are four steps in this denitrification process, and the third step creates nitrous oxide—one of the most potent greenhouse gases. The process breaks down if microbes that carry out the fourth step are inactive when a pulse of nitrate enters the system. 
“If microbes aren’t there to accept the nitrous oxide handoff, then the greenhouse gas escapes into the atmosphere,” says Anantharaman. 
The scientists found the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles are all driven by metabolic handoffs that require an unexpectedly high degree of interdependence among microbes. The vast majority of microorganisms can’t fully reduce a compound on their own. It takes a team. There are also backup microbes ready to perform a handoff if first-string microbes are unavailable. 
“The combination of high microbial diversity and interconnections through metabolic handoffs likely results in high ecosystem resilience ,” says Banfield.",0
730,Trump And Putin: 'We Will Destroy ISIS Once And For All!',"Over the past few months, relations between the United States and the Russian Federation have sunk to their lowest levels since the Cold War with bitter insults and threats being thrown around on both sides of the divide. However, the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States seems to have brought some change to this dangerous situation.


Trump and Putin vow to fight Islamic State together 

The president -elect and the Russian President Vladimir Putin have confirmed that they have had a healthy and productive conversation regarding relations between the countries and their shared purpose in tackling global terrorism. The telephone call was instigated by Putin who wanted to express his congratulations to Trump after he took the top job in American politics. During the conversation, Putin is reported to have said that he is ready to pick up a dialogue with officials from the United States “by mutual respect, non-intervention into each other’s internal affairs”.

The two men agreed during their brief telephone call that they would lay the groundwork to bring in a new era of Russia-American cooperation. According to a source, Putin and Trump have agreed to “work to channel bilateral relationships into constructive cooperation, to combine efforts to tackle international terrorism and extremism, and to continue contact by telephone and to work towards meeting in person” . 


Trump’s office continued with this optimism and placatory stance saying: ""President-elect Trump noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.""

In a follow-up statement, a Kremlin spokesperson said that the United States and Russia were planning to work together in both trade and economics as well as the threat posed by international terrorist organizations such as Islamic State. The fight against Islamic State may prove to be of essential importance in the coming months as top Islamic State commanders have already expressed their intention to exploit Donald Trump’s outspoken opinions on ordinary Muslims. Islamic commander Abu Omar Khorasani has said that Trump’s words have played directly into the hands of the terrorist organization. He said; ""This guy is a complete maniac. His utter hate towards Muslims will make our job much easier because we can recruit thousands.""

The bombing continued for an hour. Up to 80 Syrian military men were killed, and many more were injured. Of course, one could not talk about any agreements afterwards. ""Moreover, when Russia raised the issue at the UN Security Council, US Representative Samantha Power reacted very sharply, and, indeed, in a rude way.

""It was clear that Pentagon chief Ashton Carter, a number of American generals and the CIA were not interested in a joint struggle against the terrorist threat in Syria. Jabhat en-Nusra serves as a reserve of the United States that the country uses when necessary to topple Syrian President Assad.

733,Turkey’s Relations With Europe Sink Amid Quarrel With Netherlands - The New York Times,"ISTANBUL  —   Turkey’s quarrel with Europe worsened over the weekend after the Turkish president accused the Dutch government of Nazism, and Turkish politicians were barred or disinvited from events in two European countries, amid tensions ahead of a tight referendum on a new Turkish Constitution. Having criticized German officials for barring their Turkish counterparts from campaign events this month, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan turned his ire on the Netherlands after the Dutch stopped the Turkish foreign minister from landing there for a rally on Saturday, and then escorted the Turkish family minister out of the country early on Sunday, citing risks to public order and security. It was an unusually strong reaction from the Dutch, who have generally taken an open stance toward diverse points of view, but who are in the midst of an election campaign in which immigration and integration are major topics. “When those incidents began, I said those are fascistic measures,” Mr. Erdogan said in a speech on Sunday afternoon. “I said Nazism had risen from the dead. And then I added: I thought Nazism was over, but I was wrong. ” The   remarks from Turkey inflamed tensions among the Turkish community in the Netherlands, who protested in Rotterdam until the early hours of Sunday, when they were dispersed by police officers wielding batons and water cannons. The police arrested 12 people, and seven were injured, including a policeman, whose hand was broken. Though Turkish law technically bars the practice, Turkish ministers are touring Europe to persuade the Continent’s sizable Turkish diaspora to vote yes to an expansion of Mr. Erdogan’s powers, amid fears that the “no” campaign may hold the edge in the April referendum. But this campaign has collided with closely fought local elections in the Netherlands and France, where   politicians have sought political capital from stoking tensions with the Turks. The push for votes also comes at a time of increased European alarm over Turkey’s democratic backslide and rising concerns over immigration and integration. The Dutch government said it refused to allow the Turkish foreign minister’s plane to land after the Turkish government publicly called on “Dutch nationals of Turkish origin to turn out in great numbers. ” The two countries were negotiating over finding a smaller venue like the Turkish Consulate to hold the meeting, but “before these talks had been concluded,” Turkey “publicly threatened the Netherlands with sanctions” making a “reasonable compromise” impossible, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said. Elsewhere in Europe, the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, canceled a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Binali Yildirim, in protest of Turkey’s “rhetorical attacks. ” In Sweden, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan’s party, Mehdi Eker, rearranged a campaign event after the meeting’s initial hosts backed out for safety reasons. In France, two   candidates, François Fillon and Marine Le Pen, criticized the decision to allow the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to proceed with a rally in France. Switzerland and Austria have previously made it clear that Mr. Erdogan’s campaign is unwelcome there. In the Netherlands, both the conservative prime minister, Mark Rutte, and his   opponent, Geert Wilders, hoped to benefit from the dispute, though it was not immediately clear if either would see appreciable gains. The election is on Wednesday, and while it was Mr. Wilders who first elevated the issue publicly, Mr. Rutte could get credit for barring the Turkish ministers. “Rutte now has premier bonus,” said Bianca Pander, a political strategist at BKB, which works on campaign strategy, referring to his status as prime minister. “He can now show what leadership means. ” He is also benefiting from nearly constant news media coverage on the issue. “Rutte is in the picture now: He’s on every TV show, and on every newspaper,” Ms. Pander said. Mr. Rutte said the pejoratives leveled at the Dutch were “bizarre” and that the “Turkish republic is moving in the wrong direction for a democracy. ” In response, Mr. Erdogan accused the   Dutch government of playing to a domestic audience by blocking his ministers. “Holland, if you are sacrificing   relations because of the election on Wednesday, you will pay the price,” Mr. Erdogan said Sunday. Inside Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, too, was accused of trying to curry favor with the country’s voters. With the referendum result in doubt, some of the president’s critics argued that he was manufacturing fights with Europe to win the support of nationalists in Turkey who were undecided about whether to back the expansion of his mandate. “Turkish foreign policy today  —   whatever it is, wherever it is, from Syria all the way to the Netherlands and Germany  —   is related to the domestic political agenda,” said Cengiz Candar, a veteran Turkish columnist and academic. “There is no Turkish foreign policy now,” Mr. Candar added in a telephone interview. “Turkish foreign policy is related to Mr. Erdogan’s referendum campaign. ” But others supported Mr. Erdogan’s stance. The leader of the main Turkish opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who is against the proposed Constitution, called on Mr. Erdogan to suspend relations with the Netherlands. A small crowd of   protesters gathered outside the Dutch Consulate in Istanbul, while an unknown intruder briefly managed to replace the consulate’s Dutch flag with a Turkish one. In a province west of the city, another crowd of protesters squeezed a series of oranges, in a theatrical gesture apparently intended to insult the Dutch, whose national color is orange. Arriving back in Turkey after her deportation, the Turkish family minister, Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, accused the Netherlands of hypocrisy for claiming to stand up for human rights while restricting her own. “We faced a very inhumane, unethical treatment,” she said at Istanbul’s main airport, according to Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. “We had a really very painful night in Holland, which talks about democracy, freedoms, freedom of speech. ” In addition to targeting wavering members of Mr. Erdogan’s own party, some analysts said the Turkish government’s movements in Europe were particularly aimed at supporters of the country’s largest nationalist movement, the Nationalist Movement Party, which is known in Turkey as the M. H. P. The M. H. P. has traditionally been wary of Mr. Erdogan, but its leadership now supports giving him more power, in the private expectation that its own cadres will subsequently be rewarded with more influence. While an estimated three million German residents are of Turkish origin, as well as about 400, 000 Dutch residents, the number of people in Germany and the Netherlands who are eligible to vote in the Turkish elections is far lower, said Alexander Clarkson, a specialist on the Turkish diaspora at King’s College London. Mr. Erdogan’s recent gestures were therefore primarily targeted at the M. H. P. ’s rank and file in Turkey, many of whom are skeptical of their leadership’s alliance with Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Clarkson said. “The audience isn’t really the diaspora the audience is at home,” Mr. Clarkson said of the government’s stance toward the Netherlands and Germany. The heated language helps achieve this goal, Mr. Clarkson said, since “it enables Erdogan and the A. K. P. to say: We are out there protecting the rights of Turks abroad. ” The A. K. P. is an acronym for Mr. Erdogan’s group, the Justice and Development Party. Mr. Erdogan was accused of hypocrisy for criticizing Europe’s perceived authoritarianism while overseeing a sweeping crackdown on dissent in his country. Since a failed coup in July, Mr. Erdogan’s government has ruled mostly by decree, allowing it to suspend or fire more than 120, 000 government employees, and arrest an estimated 45, 000 people suspected of being dissidents or rebels. The detainees come from a broad section of public life and include soldiers, police officers, teachers, judges, academics, journalists and lawmakers. “He is the president of a country,” Mr. Candar said of Mr. Erdogan, “where more than 150 journalists,   writers, columnists, opinion makers are in prison. And the leaders of the   caucus in the Turkish Parliament”  —   as well as 12 other members of Parliament who belong to it  —   “are also in prison. ” Turkey, Mr. Candar argued, “has transformed into a republic of fear. ”",0

735,Blue State Blues: The Deliberate Politicization of Intimacy,"One of the more interesting lessons Democrats may learn in their newfound enthusiasm for George Orwell’s Nineteen    —   which is a critique of socialism, but never mind  —   is the way that totalitarian societies destroy intimate relationships. [In the dystopian future envisioned by Orwell, children betray their parents to the Thought Police, and sex is discouraged because it creates relationships outside the state. A secret love is the most revolutionary act  —   and, ultimately, a futile one.  Today, in the United States, we are witnesses to  —   and participants in  —   the destruction of friendships and relationships over political disputes that rage uncontrollably on social media, carry over into the workplace, and even continue into the home. A few weeks ago, a   poll revealed that 39% of Americans had argued about politics with friends and family, and   had “stopped talking to a family member or friend because of the election. ” True, 40% of respondents said they had not had those kinds of arguments, but that may also be because Americans are increasingly withdrawing into political camps. It is fashionable, especially in Washington, to blame these divisions on an increasingly partisan media. And that is partly true. Orwell observed  —   separately, in 1944  —   that modern innovations in communication and travel had inspired new ways to divide people, rather than bringing the world together. Of radio, for example, he observed: “It is nonsense to say that the radio puts people in touch with foreign countries   …     each national radio is a sort of totalitarian world of its own, braying propaganda night and day to people who can listen to nothing else. ” The same is true of social media and domestic politics today. Theoretically, Facebook and Twitter ought to make it easier for us to communicate with, and understand, people with different views. In practice, they encourage us to huddle with   people and sever relations with the other side. Twitter is the most brutal of social media platforms, because it allows people to bash each other from behind pseudonyms and avatars. But Facebook is even more damaging, because it takes   associations  —   families, schools, towns  —   and exposes them to the ravages of intense political debate. On Twitter, we form alliances with strangers who agree with us on Facebook, we discover the opposing political views of people with whom we may have shared close lifelong connections. Social media platforms are increasingly important sources of news. And so the new political divisions in the world of journalism are filtering into our social media, which in turn exacerbates those media divisions in a seemingly endless feedback loop. But the media are not solely responsible. The deliberate politicization of intimacy began with a specific campaign  —   namely, President Barack Obama’s 2008 run, which used social media technology to drive a political message. Obama told his supporters explicitly to approach their neighbors and “argue with them, and get in their face. ” His surrogates took that approach even further. Hollywood celebrity Sarah Silverman encouraged Obama’s Jewish supporters to travel to Florida and tell their ostensibly racist grandparents to vote for him. Later, once Obama was in office, the supposedly   Rock the Vote organization told young people to withhold sex from partners who refused to support Obamacare. The politicization of intimacy has been a Democratic campaign strategy ever since. And after the 2016 election, it has only continued. Anecdotally, conservative acquantances report that their (understandably) frustrated and (irrationally) fearful liberal Facebook friends have tried to hold them personally responsible for every perceived misstep by President Donald Trump. As much as conservatives disliked Barack Obama and his policies, that kind of behavior seemed far less common. Just recently, a friend posted on Facebook: “I got blocked by a liberal tonight. My brother. ” This quiet dissolution of American social life should worry us, for the simple reason that the intimate connections among neighbors, family, and friends are the glue that holds our otherwise individualistic society together. Alexis de Tocqueville noted in Democracy in America, nearly 200 years ago, that our system functions because of the overlapping associations we form with one another. Those are at risk. Fifteen years ago, Americans were deeply divided over the results of the 2000 presidential election and the Florida recount. It took the horrific events of September 11th, 2001 to bring the nation together. One hopes it does not take a similar event this time. This week, in addressing Congress, President Trump united the nation in applauding and comforting the widow of a fallen Navy SEAL. It was a rare moment of unity, a reminder that we can  —   and must  —   renew what we still hold in common. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

736,"Clare Hollingworth, Reporter Who Broke News of World War II, Dies at 105 - The New York Times","From a single gust of wind, Clare Hollingworth reaped the journalistic scoop of the century. Ms. Hollingworth, the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, who died on Tuesday in Hong Kong at 105, was less than a week into her first job, as a reporter for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, on that windy day in 1939. Driving alone on the road from Gleiwitz, then in Germany, to Katowice, in Poland  —   a distance of less than 20 miles  —   she watched as the wind lifted a piece of the tarpaulin that had been erected on the German side to screen the valley below from view. Through the opening, Ms. Hollingworth saw, she later wrote, “large numbers of troops, literally hundreds of tanks, armored cars and field guns” concealed in the valley. She knew then that Germany was poised for a major military incursion. Hastening back across the border to the Polish side, she telephoned her editor with the news, a world exclusive. The date was Aug. 28, 1939, and her article, published the next day, would become, as the British paper The Guardian wrote in 2015, “probably the greatest scoop of modern times. ” On Sept. 1, Hitler’s forces invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II. For the next four decades, Ms. Hollingworth (who over the years contributed articles to The Telegraph, The Guardian, The International Herald Tribune and The Wall Street Journal) covered World War II from Eastern Europe, the Balkans and North Africa the Greek and Algerian civil wars hostilities between Arabs and Jews in the waning days of the British mandate in Palestine and the Vietnam War, among other conflicts. Often under fire, occasionally arrested and possessed of such a keen nose for covert information that from time to time she was accused of being a spy  —   both by local governments and by the British  —   Ms. Hollingworth was friend, or foe, to seemingly everyone in a position of power in the world at midcentury. She obtained the first interview with Mohammed Reza Pahlavi after he became the shah of Iran in 1941, and what was very likely among the last, after he was deposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. In 1965, wanting to cover hostilities between India and Pakistan but discovering that reporters were barred from the front, she simply secured permission from an old acquaintance, Indira Gandhi, who was then India’s minister of information and broadcasting. Ms. Hollingworth was also one of the first Western journalists to report regularly from China, opening The Telegraph’s Beijing bureau in 1973. Her other major scoops included a 1963 article for The Guardian in which she cautiously identified the British intelligence agent Kim Philby as the   “third man” in the ring of Soviet spies then known to include the Englishmen Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess. Another was a 1968 article for The Telegraph in which she reported the United States’ incipient plans for peace talks with Vietnam. (The talks opened in Paris later that year and were concluded in 1973.) Ms. Hollingworth was never so happy, she often said, as when she was roaming the world equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver. Embedded long before the term was applied to journalists, she slept in trucks and in trenches, at times buried up to her neck in sand for warmth on cold desert nights. She once held off an armed Algerian policeman by threatening to hit him about the head with a shoe. Had her eyesight not begun to fail some 20 years ago, it was a life, Ms. Hollingworth made clear, that she would gladly have continued to the end of her days. “I must admit that I enjoy being in a war,” she told The Telegraph in 2011, on the eve of her 100th birthday. In 1989, though nearly 80 and nominally retired, Ms. Hollingworth, attired in a safari suit, her working uniform of choice for 60 years, was spotted in Tiananmen Square shinnying up a lamppost for a bird’  view of the government’s violent crackdown against civilian protesters. She periodically slept on the floor of her home in Hong Kong well into her 90s, just to keep from going soft. Through all her travels, with all their attendant rigors, there was only one thing, Ms. Hollingworth said, that she truly could not abide. “I do not mind not washing for a week or more,” she wrote, “but I do hate getting fleas in my hair. ” Her Graham Greene existence, with its typewriter, revolver and most particularly its fleas, was a far cry from the life her conventional,   British parents had envisioned for her  —   one of quiet propriety, dutiful wifehood, charity balls and hunting. Clare Hollingworth was born on Oct. 10, 1911, in Knighton in central England, outside Leicester. As a child, she enjoyed touring the historic battlefields of England and France with her father, who ran the family’s boot and shoe factory. At her parents’ insistence, the young Ms. Hollingworth attended domestic science college in Leicester, an experience that did nothing to make the prospect of hearth and home attractive. (“Although it is useful to be able to make an omelet,” she later wrote, “my domestic science training caused me to hate having anything to do with housework. ”) Partly in deference to her upbringing, she became engaged “to a suitable young man,” though she soon broke off the engagement and further scandalized her parents by announcing her intention to become a journalist. “My mother thought journalism frightfully low, like a trade,” Ms. Hollingworth said in the 2011 interview with The Telegraph. “She didn’t believe anything journalists wrote and thought they were only fit for the tradesmen’s entrance. ” In the 1930s, Ms. Hollingworth attended the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London and afterward studied at the University of Zagreb, then in Yugoslavia. Working for the League of Nations Union, a peace and social justice group established in Britain in 1918, she was dispatched to Warsaw. There, in early 1939, she aided thousands of refugees from the Sudetenland  —   the region of Czechoslovakia that had been annexed by the Nazis in October 1938  —   arranging travel documents that would let them cross into Poland. She wrote about their plight for small publications in Britain. The Telegraph learned of Ms. Hollingworth’s work in Poland, and on Aug. 25, 1939, while she was visiting London, it hired her as a correspondent. Assigned to cover the prelude to war in the region, she flew to Warsaw the next day. From Warsaw she traveled to Katowice, commandeering an official car from the British consul general there. It was in that car, Union Jack boldly flying, that she drove over the border, past astonished Nazi guards and into Germany on Aug. 28. Ms. Hollingworth’s scoop comprised two parts. The first was her story of Aug. 29, about the advent of war. The second was her report on the start of the war itself. Awakened by explosions at dawn on Sept. 1, Ms. Hollingworth, from her quarters in Katowice, saw German bombers overhead and the flash of artillery fire in the distance. She telephoned a friend at the British Embassy in Warsaw. “The war has begun!” she cried. “Are you sure, old girl?” he said. Her published article notwithstanding, Ms. Hollingworth later wrote, British officialdom persisted in thinking that war remained weeks away. She held the receiver out the window as German tanks roared outside. The embassy was persuaded and soon, too, was her editor. Ms. Hollingworth’s article on the start of hostilities appeared in The Telegraph the next day. Her work from this period is unbylined  —   few reporters were accorded bylines then  —   a state of affairs she pronounced as being for the best: It simultaneously spared her parents familial anxiety and social indignity. What followed was more than 40 years of chasing danger, for it was in the most dangerous places, Ms. Hollingworth often said, that the best stories lay. Traveling with British troops in North Africa, she was buried in the sands for the night when she awoke to the sounds of a German reconnaissance party. “A sneeze would have brought death to us all,” she later wrote. She held her breath in the darkness, and the party passed unseeing. In Vietnam, a sniper’s bullet narrowly missed her head. Ms. Hollingworth’s first husband, Vandeleur Robinson, whom she married in 1936, divorced her for desertion 15 years later. (“When I’m on a story, I’m on a story  —   to hell with husband, family, anyone else,” she told The Guardian in 2004.) Her second husband, Geoffrey Hoare, a journalist whom she married in the early 1950s, died in 1965. Her death was confirmed by Patrick Garrett, her grandnephew and her biographer. Her survivors include a stepdaughter, Hilary Sandre. Over time, some members of the British press grew alienated by what they saw as Ms. Hollingworth’s imperious manner. “Ms. Hollingworth’s snobberies are very tiring, her cozy relations with British embassies irritating,” the English journalist Robert Fisk wrote, reviewing her 1990 memoir, “Front Line. ” But she remained a widely admired, even venerated, figure, a recipient of the Order of the British Empire in 1982 and a perennial fixture at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong, where she had made her home since the early 1980s. Her other books include “The Three Weeks’ War in Poland” (1940) “There’s a German Just Behind Me” (1942) “The Arabs and the West” (1952) and “Mao and the Men Against Him” (1985). As Ms. Hollingworth made clear in later interviews, though there was no dearth of wars to accompany her old age, she did not truly expect to be called upon to cover them. Yet to the end of her life she slept with her passport and a pair of shoes within easy reach, just in case.",0
737,North Miami Police Officers Shoot Man Aiding Patient With Autism - The New York Times,"A black man said the police in North Miami, Fla. shot him on Monday as he tried to help a patient with autism who had run away from the group home where he works. The man, Charles Kinsey, 47, who identified himself as a caretaker of the patient, was on a city street with the patient when officers arrived, a lawyer for Mr. Kinsey said. When the officers drew their weapons, Mr. Kinsey told them there was no need for firearms, lay down in the middle of the street and tried to explain what had happened, the lawyer said. The video shows him trying to calm the patient, urging him to sit and to lie down. “All he has is a toy truck  —   a toy truck,” Mr. Kinsey said, according to video obtained by the Miami television station WSVN. “I am a behavior therapist at a group home,” he added. But then an officer opened fire, striking Mr. Kinsey in the leg. The North Miami police did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment on Thursday. The North Miami police chief, Gary Eugene, who held a news conference on Thursday, said an investigation would be led by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Chief Eugene said, “The law requires us to gather every fact and resolve every question. ” No gun was recovered at the scene, he added. On Friday, North Miami leaders identified the officer as Jonathan Aledda, a member of the SWAT team, and said he had been placed on administrative leave without pay, according to The Miami Herald. Another officer was also placed on leave for allegedly giving misleading statements during the inquiry. In a preliminary statement Tuesday, the North Miami Police Department said officers had responded to a call about “an armed male suspect threatening suicide. ” “Arriving officers attempted to negotiate with the two men on the scene, one of whom was later identified as suffering from autism,” the statement said. “At some point during the   negotiation, one of the responding officers discharged his weapon. The video shows Mr. Kinsey in a   and shorts with his back on the ground and his hands in the air. Seated next to him on a street is another man, who Mr. Kinsey says is the patient he was trying to help. Mr. Kinsey tried to defuse the situation, his lawyer, Hilton Napoleon, said. “He asked the police officer, ‘Why did you shoot me?’ He told my client, ‘I don’t know,’” Mr. Napoleon said. Clint Bower, the president and chief executive of MACtown Inc. where Mr. Kinsey works, expressed frustration at how the police responded, but praised Mr. Kinsey for his actions. “Needless to say, after viewing the video, my employee Charles Kinsey, behavioral support professional, is a hero. He saved the    young man with autism from being shot,” Mr. Bower said in an email on Wednesday. “He put his own life at risk, which is evident in the video. ” Mr. Napoleon said he met with city officials on Wednesday and had discussed the possibility of a settlement. Whatever the resolution, he said, the city should start by censuring the officer. “The best thing that the City of North Miami can do is come out and condemn the officer,” he said. . In a statement on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said: “We have to stem the tide of violence, both nationwide and here in Florida. It starts with holding people accountable for their actions. There must be a thorough and independent investigation into this shooting that covers both whether officers violated internal use of deadly force policies and whether criminal charges should be brought. ”",0
738,The Path to Total Dictatorship: America's Shadow Government and Its Silent Coup," The Path to Total Dictatorship: America's Shadow Government and Its Silent Coup
By John W. Whitehead Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means, unseen and unheard by Congress, the President, or the people . Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within our government and political system a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state . The important point to remember about this group is not its ideology but its organization It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government . This group is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.
 Senator William Jenner, 1954 speech
 Unaffected by elections. Unaltered by populist movements. Beyond the reach of the law.
Say hello to Americas shadow government.
A corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country, this shadow government represents the hidden face of a government that has no respect for the freedom of its citizenry.
No matter which candidate wins the presidential election, this shadow government is here to stay. Indeed, as recent documents by the FBI reveal, this shadow government also referred to as The 7th Floor Group may well have played a part in who will win the White House this year.
To be precise, however, the future president will actually inherit not one but two shadow governments.
The first shadow government, referred to as COG or Continuity of Government, is made up of unelected individuals who have been appointed to run the government in the event of a catastrophe. COG is a phantom menace waiting for the right circumstancesa terrorist attack, a natural disaster, an economic meltdownto bring it out of the shadows, where it operates even now. When and if COG takes over, the police state will transition to martial law.
Yet it is the second shadow government also referred to as the Deep Statethat poses the greater threat to freedom right now. Comprised of unelected government bureaucrats, corporations, contractors, paper-pushers, and button-pushers who are actually calling the shots behind the scenes, this government within a government is the real reason we the people have no real control over our government.
The Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power, makes a mockery of elections and the entire concept of a representative government.
So who or what is the Deep State?
Its the militarized police, which have joined forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies in order to establish themselves as a standing army. Its the fusion centers and spy agencies that have created a surveillance state and turned all of us into suspects. Its the courthouses and prisons that have allowed corporate profits to take precedence over due process and justice. Its the military empire with its private contractors and defense industry that is bankrupting the nation. Its the private sector with its 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances, a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. Its what former congressional staffer Mike Lofgren refers to as  a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies : the Department of Defense, the State Department, Homeland Security, the CIA, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a handful of vital federal trial courts, and members of the defense and intelligence committees.
Its every facet of a government that is no longer friendly to freedom and is working overtime to trample the Constitution underfoot and render the citizenry powerless in the face of the governments power grabs, corruption and abusive tactics.
These are the key players that drive the shadow government.
This is the hidden face of the American police state that will continue long past Election Day.
Just consider some of the key programs and policies advanced by the shadow government that will continue no matter who occupies the Oval Office.
Domestic surveillance.
No matter who wins the presidential popularity contest, the National Security Agency (NSA), with its $10.8 billion black ops annual budget, will continue to spy on every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone. Thus, on any given day, whether youre walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. Local police have been outfitted with a litany of surveillance gear, from license plate readers and cell phone tracking devices to biometric data recorders. Technology now makes it possible for the police to scan passersby in order to detect the contents of their pockets, purses, briefcases, etc. Full-body scanners, which perform virtual strip-searches of Americans traveling by plane, have gone mobile, with roving police vans that peer into vehicles and buildings alikeincluding homes. Coupled with the nations growing network of real-time surveillance cameras and facial recognition software, soon there really will be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.
Global spying.
The NSAs massive surveillance network, what the Washington Post refers to as a $500 billion  espionage empire , will continue to span the globe and target every single person on the planet who uses a phone or a computer. The NSAs Echelon program intercepts and analyzes virtually every phone call, fax and email message sent anywhere in the world. In addition to carrying out domestic surveillance on peaceful political groups such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace and several religious groups, Echelon has also been a keystone in the governments attempts at political and corporate espionage .
Roving TSA searches.
The American taxpayer will continue to get ripped off by government agencies in the dubious name of national security. One of the greatest culprits when it comes to swindling taxpayers has been the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), with its questionable deployment of and complete mismanagement of millions of dollars worth of airport full-body X-ray scanners, punitive patdowns by TSA agents and thefts of travelers valuables. Considered essential to national security, TSA programs will continue in airports and at transportation hubs around the country.
USA Patriot Act, NDAA.
Americas so-called war on terror, which it has relentlessly pursued since 9/11, will continue to chip away at our freedoms, unravel our Constitution and transform our nation into a battlefield, thanks in large part to such subversive legislation as the USA Patriot Act and National Defense Authorization Act. These laws completely circumvent the rule of law and the rights of American citizens. In so doing, they re-orient our legal landscape in such a way as to ensure that martial law, rather than the U.S. Constitution, is the map by which we navigate life in the United States. These laws will continue to be enforced no matter who gets elected.
Militarized police state.
Thanks to federal grant programs allowing the Pentagon to transfer surplus military supplies and weapons to local law enforcement agencies without charge, police forces will continue to be transformed from peace officers into heavily armed extensions of the military, complete with jackboots, helmets, shields, batons, pepper-spray, stun guns, assault rifles, body armor, miniature tanks and weaponized drones. Having been given the green light to probe, poke, pinch, taser, search, seize, strip and generally manhandle anyone they see fit in almost any circumstance, all with the general blessing of the courts, Americas law enforcement officials, no longer mere servants of the people entrusted with keeping the peace, will continue to keep the masses corralled, controlled, and treated like suspects and enemies rather than citizens.
SWAT team raids.
With more than 80,000 SWAT team raids carried out every year on unsuspecting Americans by local police for relatively routine police matters and federal agencies laying claim to their own law enforcement divisions, the incidence of botched raids and related casualties will continue to rise. Nationwide, SWAT teams will continue to be employed to address an astonishingly trivial array of criminal activity or mere community nuisances including angry dogs, domestic disputes, improper paperwork filed by an orchid farmer, and misdemeanor marijuana possession.
Domestic drones. The domestic use of drones will continue unabated. As mandated by Congress, there will be 30,000 drones crisscrossing the skies of America by 2020, all part of an industry that could be worth as much as $30 billion per year. These machines, which will be equipped with weapons, will be able to record all activities, using video feeds, heat sensors and radar. An Inspector General report revealed that the Dept. of Justice has already spent nearly $4 million on drones domestically, largely for use by the FBI , with grants for another $1.26 million so police departments and nonprofits can acquire their own drones.
School-to-prison pipeline.
The paradigm of abject compliance to the state will continue to be taught by example in the schools, through school lockdowns where police and drug-sniffing dogs enter the classroom, and zero tolerance policies that punish all offenses equally and result in young people being expelled for childish behavior. School districts will continue to team up with law enforcement to create a schoolhouse to jailhouse track by imposing a double dose of punishment: suspension or expulsion from school, accompanied by an arrest by the police and a trip to juvenile court.
Overcriminalization.
The government bureaucracy will continue to churn out laws, statutes, codes and regulations that reinforce its powers and value systems and those of the police state and its corporate allies, rendering the rest of us petty criminals. The average American now unknowingly commits three felonies a day, thanks to this overabundance of vague laws that render otherwise innocent activity illegal. Consequently, small farmers who dare to make unpasteurized goat cheese and share it with members of their community will continue to have their farms raided.
Privatized Prisons.
States will continue to outsource prisons to private corporations, resulting in a cash cow whereby mega-corporations imprison Americans in private prisons in order to make a profit. In exchange for corporations buying and managing public prisons across the country at a supposed savings to the states, the states have to agree to maintain a 90% occupancy rate in the privately run prisons for at least 20 years.
Endless wars.
Americas expanding military empire will continue to bleed the country dry at a rate of more than $15 billion a month (or $20 million an hour). The Pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health, education, welfare, and safety. Yet what most Americans fail to recognize is that these ongoing wars have little to do with keeping the country safe and everything to do with enriching the military industrial complex at taxpayer expense.
Are you getting the message yet?
The next president, much like the current president and his predecessors, will be little more than a figurehead, a puppet to entertain and distract the populace from whats really going on.
As Lofgren reveals, this state within a state, concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue , is a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose.
The Deep State not only holds the nations capital in thrall, but it also controls Wall Street (which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater) and Silicon Valley.
This is fascism in its most covert form, hiding behind public agencies and private companies to carry out its dirty deeds.
It is a marriage between government bureaucrats and corporate fat cats.
As Lofgren concludes:
[T]he Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda.
In other words, as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , as long as government officialselected and unelected alikeare allowed to operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, the courts and the citizenry, the threat to our freedoms remains undiminished.
So the next time you find yourselves despondent over the 2016 presidential candidates, remember that its just a puppet show intended to distract you from the silent coup being carried out by Americas shadow government.

739,Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Gary Stanton Americans given historic opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself 
Americans are today being given a once in a lifetime opportunity to tell Donald Trump to go fuck himself. 
According to experts, today’s vote is less an opportunity to select the leader of the free world, so much as the chance to remind Donald Trump what an arsehole they all think he is. 
Democratic countries around the globe are today united in telling Americans they have a unique chance to show the world that they have the ability to guide a leading nation in the direction of societal harmony, equality for all, and telling racists to go fuck themselves. 
US political expert, Chuck Williams, told us, “Setting the persuasive policy arguments made by the candidates to one side, the United States will wake on Wednesday morning to either of two plausible realities. 
“One in which the downcast misogynist billionaire leader has been roundly told to fuck the fuck off, or another in which he enjoys a prolonged, ill-tempered orgasm on the Fox News network.” 
Williams urged Americans to imagine a forward-looking country in which Donald Trump isn’t constantly forced to appear on the news in order to defend himself against accusation after inevitable accusation of improper behaviour, both privately and professionally. 
He concluded, “You can either offer a number of quiet ‘fuck you’s at him many, many times over the next four years, or you can give him one enormous one today.

740,"Efforts to Curb Police Abuses Have Mixed Record, and Uncertain Future - The New York Times","Looking to the federal government to rein in police excesses can be an exercise in managed expectations. On Friday, Chicago agreed to revamp its police department after the Justice Department found routine use of excessive force, and the mayor said he would negotiate a   settlement, known as a consent decree. But that is no guarantee of results  —   and not just because the man most likely to be the next attorney general has said he is skeptical of such endeavors. Attempts to force change in police departments have met with mixed success even under the Obama administration, which made police reform a signature issue. It has opened 25 investigations into law enforcement agencies over issues like excessive force, racial bias and poor supervision, issuing reports choking with outrage. Los Angeles, which was under a consent decree for 11 years, is regarded as one of the great success stories. “Los Angeles is a different place today because of the consent decree and the leadership of the department,” said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank. In Detroit, which emerged from a   consent decree last year, officer shootings and warrantless arrests have declined significantly. But Pittsburgh, the target of the first consent decree based on a Justice Department finding of a “pattern and practice” of misconduct, later backslid after changes in leadership, said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. And while Miami reduced police shootings to zero for 20 months after a federal investigation in 2002 that was later closed with no settlement, the Justice Department in 2013 reinvestigated and found a pattern of excessive force with firearms, underscoring some experts’ view that consent decrees or other settlements are needed for enduring improvements. Last year, Miami settled the 2013 inquiry by agreeing to improve supervision, training and internal investigations. The “pattern and practice” approach developed after the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991 forced a period of national introspection over how to curb misconduct if individual officers could not be held accountable. A jury’s decision not to convict the four officers charged in the attack on Mr. King incited deadly riots. Since the early attempts, Mr. Walker said, consent decrees have evolved to be more sophisticated and comprehensive. “The general pattern is that there is some backsliding on some issues,” he said, “but I don’t think there’s a case where a department has completely collapsed back to where it was before. ” Still, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and the nominee for attorney general under   Donald J. Trump, called them “dangerous,” writing in 2008 that they “constitute an end run around the democratic process. ” At his confirmation hearing this past week, he softened that critique, saying there were some circumstances that legitimately demanded consent decrees and that those already in place would be enforced. But, Mr. Sessions said, lawsuits could unfairly target whole police departments for the misdeeds of a few bad actors. “These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness,” he said. His critique did not extend to how well consent decrees actually work. But experts say that even systemic changes, like greater oversight of officers’ use of force, can be slow to yield results. “They change the ‘inputs’ through training, record keeping, community involvement and other internal reforms, but the inputs don’t necessarily translate into changes in ‘outputs’ including racial disparities, use of force, or other constitutional issues,” wrote Jeff Fagan, a Columbia University law professor, in an email. “The results have been quite variable. ” Consent decrees can span years and many of the Obama administration’s key settlements have just begun, including those in Cleveland and Albuquerque. So it would be premature to assess their success. Some reform advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will fail to investigate police departments or enforce consent decrees, robbing them of what they view as a crucial lever to compel change. Even some police chiefs might mourn a retreat from consent decrees. Baltimore’s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, has said that a consent decree would aid community relations. Charles H. Ramsey, who as Washington’s police chief invited the Justice Department to review his department, said, “The DOJ gives legitimacy to the changes that you’re making. ” Chiefs may want consent decrees in order to insulate them from political and union opposition to change, as well as make it easier to demand money to pay for reforms. Mr. Sessions wrote in his critique of consent decrees in 2008 that he is aware of that strategy. “Such decrees are particularly offensive when certain governmental agencies secretly delight in being sued because they hope a settlement will be reached resulting in the agency receiving more money,” he wrote. “Thus, the taxpayers ultimately fund the settlement enacted through this undemocratic process. ”",0

With continued weakness in the precious metals markets, did this major divergence just trigger a bottom in gold and silver? 
The gold and silver markets are now showing a huge divergence which may prove to be a key in terms of seeing the bottom of this correction in the metals. Below we see that the price of gold (GLD used as a proxy) is hitting new lows (see chart below). 
At the same time, the price of silver is also hitting new lows (see chart below). Unlocking The Key: Here Is The Major Divergence 
Meanwhile, the HUI (Gold Mining Index) is diverging by trading above recent lows (see chart below). 
And the XAU (Gold Mining Index) is also diverging by trading above its recent lows (see chart below). 
KWN also spoke with one of the top mining CEO’s today and he said, “The selling in the mining stocks is looking very tired right now and they are just looking for an excuse to rally.”… IMPORTANT… To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
The divergence in the HUI and XAU mining indexes vs gold and silver is a major clue that a bottom may be forming. If the miners can hold above the recent lows that will give the signal that the correction has now officially come to an end and the uptrend in gold, silver, and the mining shares will resume. I t will be very interesting to see if this divergence did in fact mark a bottom in gold and silver in the days ahead.

742,"Hey Ho, It’s Old: England Embraces Punk Rock 40 Years Later - The New York Times","BLACKPOOL, England  —   “Ramones forever!” C. J. Ramone yelled to a tightly packed crowd at the Rebellion Festival here earlier this month, and a little roar rippled through a sea of   mohawks,   spikes  —   and more than a few balding heads. It was 40 years ago this summer that the Ramones flew to London and played a July 4 concert at the Roundhouse in Camden, an event that many cite as the moment that punk rock first took flight in Britain. A month earlier, a   London group called the Sex Pistols had played a gig at Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester. It has been said that there were only a few dozen people in attendance, but every one went out and started a band. “I’ve said this quote before, but I’ll say it again,” Steve Diggle of the Buzzcocks said in a recent interview over a pint of Guinness in London. “If Jesus was born in Bethlehem, British punk was born in Manchester at that gig. ” The anniversary of that summer is being celebrated in Punk London, a citywide, yearlong series of exhibitions, talks and concerts supported by the mayor’s office and the National Lottery. Proving, perhaps, that punk’s rebellious spirit hasn’t yet receded into rock’s history books, this institutional endorsement of an   movement has drawn skepticism, a little bit of ridicule and even some mild acts of resistance. “We heard our song on BBC News,” as part of the anniversary celebrations, Noel Martin, 61, of the band Menace, which formed in the   said outside the Blackpool festival grounds. The song, “G. L. C. ,” which stood for Greater London Council, took aim at the city government, whose conservative members had called for a ban on punk concerts. “BBC banned that song 40 years ago, how come they’re playing it now?” In March, Joe Corré, the son of the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and the Sex Pistols manager, Malcolm McLaren, vowed to burn 5 million pounds, or about $6. 46 million, worth of punk memorabilia to protest what he saw as the   of the movement. (The event, which is planned for this fall, was promptly added by a City Hall staff member to the Punk London website). In July, the singer Viv Albertine of the band the Slits visited the British Library for a talk connected to Punk London. While there, she stopped by the institution’s punk history exhibition to scrawl over the names of prominent female punk artists in permanent marker onto to the show’s signage. “What about the women! !” she wrote on a sign, crossing out the names of male punk groups and replacing them with   acts like Siouxsie and the Banshees and   Spex. The concerts of the summer of ’76 proved a crucible: In the months that followed, punk broke into public consciousness across Britain. The Clash, the Buzzcocks and the Damned gained nationwide attention. And the Sex Pistols became tabloid sensations, both for their wild behavior and their   lyrics, particularly for “God Save the Queen,” an   screed that suggested the queen was the head of a “fascist regime. ” The reaction from the news media was swift: Sex Pistols tracks, including “Queen” and “Anarchy in the U. K.,” were banned from the BBC, and, after reports that band members had spit on and yelled at staff at Heathrow Airport, the Pistols were dropped from their record label, EMI. The Sex Pistols dissolved in spectacular fashion months later, but the Ramones soldiered on for another 20 years (C. J. Ramone joined the band in the late ’80s). Fans and musicians at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool, a resort town on the Irish Sea, noted the incongruity of the establishment’s embracing of punk rock, but they said the British punk scene was vibrant and even growing. “We go to gigs every week here, Manchester, Birmingham,” Graham Norris, 51, a fan of punk, said over a hot dog on the first day of the festival. “There’s lots of good bands coming through, a lot of them,” said Mr. Norris, who carried a cane and had a single synthetic green dreadlock threaded onto his last wisp of natural hair. “Maybe their dads were punks, maybe their mothers were punks and they’ve picked up on it. ” This festival’s lineup reflected that intergenerational spirit: Early bands like Agnostic Front and the Buzzcocks split the bill with newer acts like Youth Man and Angry Itch. Outside the main venue, a group of young punk fans gathered on a stoop, smoking and swigging from liquor bottles. One young musician, Connor MacPherson, 18, whose band the Antiseptics played at Punk Weekender, a   concert series held at the Roundhouse in July to commemorate the anniversary of the Ramones concert, said that the punk spirit was particularly relevant now that conservatives control Britain’s government. Describing himself as a “socialist with anarchist tendencies,” Mr. MacPherson got a rousing response from the others when he lobbed a shot at David Cameron, the former prime minister. “We have got a government that doesn’t care about the youth, that doesn’t care about the   people,” he said. “We need punk more than ever  —   we need punk more than they needed it in 1977. ” Nella Bellinzoni, 62, was selling bags and   sweaters in the halls of the festival. With blue hair sprayed vertical and reaching about a foot above her head (she said it took her around one and a half cans of hair spray and three hours to achieve the look) Ms. Bellinzoni, who described herself as an “old punk, from the beginning,” expressed a sunny vision of punk’s future. “It’s getting more and more stronger,” Ms. Bellinzoni, a native of Italy who lives near Blackpool, said. “All the kids, when their father or mother was punk, then they’re punk as well. ” One   duo was Simon Reynolds, 50, who took a train from London to Blackpool and his    son, Oscar. Mr. Reynolds, who started listening to punk in the early ’80s, said he thought that the movement had cleaned up its act somewhat since the early years and grown a “conscience. ” Oscar, with spiky green hair and a   advertising the punk band Gnarwolves, said he became interested in punk about eight years ago, through skateboarding and through his father. He said that he appreciated the sympathy for the working classes, and also that he liked that the music was different from what his friends listened to. Asked whether he ever felt strange dabbling in the same music scene as his father, he looked briefly incredulous. “No, no,” he said with a chuckle, before his face got serious and he added, “My dad’s rad. ”",0
743,"Canoes Reek of Genocide, Theft and White Privilege, Says Canadian Professor","Lukas Mikelionis, Heat Street, October 24, 2016 
{snip} According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society. 
In a radio interview for CBC Radio , which wasn’t picked up by the Internet until several months later, she claimed “we have a whole set of narratives that make the canoe into a kind of morally untouchable symbol, something that seems natural, that seems ordinary, and seems to promote values that we ascribe to.” 
“But I think if you look a little further that narrative obscures or erases another narrative–and that narrative is about, to be blunt, it’s about theft and genocide”, the professor said.

“It’s not a coincidence that it was white men of a certain age . . . Certainly the majority of wilderness canoers are people who have a very privileged place in society. They’re frequently highly educated people. They’re almost completely white,” she said. 
CBC Radio host Jim Brown then asked a question: “Should we look at the canoe as a non-controversial symbol or should we look at it as a symbol of colonialism?” 
To which the academic replied: “Absolutely a symbol of colonialism. It seems to me that this narrative we tell ourselves about the canoe about how canoeing makes us in touch with nature, how canoeing makes us in some way guiltless of the terrible things that the Canadian government and Canadians in general did to First Nations people.”

744,Illegal Immigrant Advocates Pledge to Resist Deportation Under Trump,"Email 
Following the surprisingly strong electoral victory of Donald Trump to the White House in this year’s presidential election, a spokesperson for a group founded to revive the rejected 2007 DREAM Atct — which would have granted amnesty to minors illegally in the United States — pledged to resist mass deportation of illegal aliens. The spokesperson also called Border Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel ""agents of racism.” 
In a statement quoted by the Washington Times , Cristina Jimenez, co-founder of United We Dream (which describes itself as “the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation”) said: “Immigrants are declaring a state of urgency and resilience. Over the coming weeks, our families and community members will need to tap into the incredible strength that brought us to this country and which we use to survive.” 
In her statement, Jimenez not only expressed dismay at the election of Trump but also castigated the agents of the federal agencies charged with protecting our borders. 
“All people with love in our hearts are angered and disappointed tonight and pledge to resist mass deportation,” she said. “ICE and CBP have proven themselves to be agents of racism and agents of hate.” 
Both the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Council — the two unions that represent Border Patrol and ICE agents, respectively, had announced endorsements of Trump during the presidential campaign. 
We reported in our article last April that the NBPC’s leaders — including Brandon Judd, the union’s president; Kenneth Palinkas, its past president; Shawn Moran; the union’s vice president; and Chris Cabrera, a spokesperson for the NBPC’s Rio Grande Valley council — have all been vocal in criticizing the Obama administration’s lack of enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws. 
The NBPC issued a press release on March 30 that stated part of the reason for its endorsement of Trump: Mr. Trump is correct when he says immigration wouldn’t be at the forefront of this presidential campaign if months ago he hadn’t made some bold and necessary statements. And when the withering media storm ensued he did not back down one iota. That tells you the measure of a man. When the so-called experts said he was too brash and outspoken, and that he would fade away, they were proven wrong. We are confident they will be proven wrong again in November when he becomes President of the United States. 
The union representing the nation’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and staff, the ICE Council, endorsed Trump last September. Their endorsement statement noted: Donald Trump reached out to us for a meeting, sat down with me to discuss his goals for enforcement, and pledged to support ICE officers, our nation’s laws and our members. In his immigration policy, he has outlined core policies needed to restore immigration security— including support for increased interior enforcement and border security, an end to Sanctuary Cities, an end to catch-and-release, mandatory detainers, and the canceling of executive amnesty and non-enforcement directives. 
A notice on the United We Dream website stated that when the DREAM Act failed to get 60 votes in the Senate in 2007, a “group of DREAMers, organizers, and advocates came together to reflect on the DREAM Act campaign and talk about building a movement and organization that would not hinge on votes in Congress.” 
President Obama, frustrated that the DREAM Act (the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act) had repeatedly failed to pass, had already decided to bypass Congress by creating the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to allow youth who had brought into the country illegally by their parents as children immigrants to work legally in the United States. 
Critics of DACA have pointed out that the program is a means to circumvent Congress and grant amnesty to those who reside here illegally. 
The DACA program was created in 2012 via policy memo by then-Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. In 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson further expanded the DACA program by removing its age cap and extending the work authorization to three years. Subsequently a group of states challenged this executive action in the case of State of Texas, et al v United States, et al. 
The DACA program was brought to a halt after U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas responded to the plaintiff states by issuing an order of temporary injunction to block the federal government from implementing the Obama administration’s policy memorandums that expanded DACA and implemented the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program. 
The Obama administration appealed Hanen’s ruing in a case that went all the way to the Supreme Court. After the court issued a tied 8-8 decision on the appeal, Hanen’s injunction was allowed to stand. 
With the election of Donald Trump, it is expected that the new president will issue an executive order of his own to reverse those issued by Obama administration officials to create DACA. It is the anticipation of this move that has groups such as United We Dream worried.

CDC Scientist Confirms Donald Trump is Right About Vaccines and Autism Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and ... http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/cdc-scientist-confirms-donald-trump-is.html Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and interviews over the past few years, the presidential candidate has stated that he strongly believes that there is a link between ""monstrous"" vaccines and autism . He has suggested that delivering vaccines in smaller doses over time could reduce autism rates among U.S. children. Despite being cast to the lunatic fringe by the mainstream media for his remarks, CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson has confirmed Trump's suspicions — namely, that   autism is real .Congressman Bill Posey from Florida helped expose the corruption of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . He recently read a statement on the House floor written by CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson.In the statement, Dr. Thompson admitted to omitting data from a study which showed that autism rates were higher among African American boys who received the MMR vaccination before the age of three.(1) ""Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about their children's health deserve to have the best information available to them. ""They should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth. For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor,"" Posey stated.(2) He then proceeded to read the statement provided by Dr. Thompson. The statement pertained to a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics. The doctor revealed that he and his colleagues intentionally destroyed data in the study which showed that African American MMR-vaccinated boys under the age of three had   for autism. According to the whistleblower, the CDC held a meeting of scientists to discuss whether they should destroy the evidence. The authors decided to scrap their findings. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved computer files and hard copies of the omitted data for legal reasons.(3) ""Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to insure that the documents that Dr. Thompson are not ignored. Therefore I will provide them to members of Congress and the House Committees upon request. ""Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted,"" Posey concluded.(2) Because the report pertains to vaccines, the mainstream media continues to ignore these revelations. Meanwhile, they continue to parade Donald Trump as a kook for suggesting that there is a link   The double standard boggles the mind and sickens the stomach.Trump hasn't backed down from the vaccine debate despite the mainstream media's backlash against his remarks. In 2015, he appeared on the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show stating: ""I've known people that had totally magnificent children, functioning a hundred percent, everything beautiful, smart as a whip, and they go for this shot and get this shot of this massive dose, of everything at one time, and they end up with horrible autism.""(4) In addition, Trump stated on a Fox News television program in 2012: ""I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy.""(5) Trump made similar remarks in a series of tweets in 2014, after a CDC report revealed that autism rates in U.S. children had increased by 30 percent in the last two years.(6)The CDC report that coincided with Trump's tweets did not actually state what caused the spike in autism rates. Given Dr. Thompson's recent testimony, however, it's easy to think of at least one possibility. By S. Johnson  ",0

747,Trump: The Media’s Frankenstein Monster,"The monster they created is running amok. Credit: VDare. 
These two things happened the day after Donald Trump won the election: First, a Washington Post reporter named Peter Holley called the American Renaissance office to ask–in dead seriousness–whether anyone from the Trump team had called us for policy advice. Second, Gloria Gonzalez-Garcia, a Mexican-American explained to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram what a Trump victory meant: “We were getting the message, ‘If you are not white, you don’t belong here.’ ” 
So what’s the connection? Let’s start with the Post ’s Mr. Holley . [ ] He is a professional newsman who attended Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism. He calls himself an “experienced reporter with a talent for uncovering compelling stories that other people overlook.” It’s his job to find out and report what is going on–and he seriously thought the victorious Trump team would check in with me for instructions. 
He’s not alone. The same day, a journalist from the biggest newspaper in Latin America– Folha de S. Paulo – wanted to know if I had telephoned my friend Donald Trump to congratulate him on his victory. I told her I have never met him and don’t have his number. 
What we have here is a stupefying delusion: that Donald Trump is a secret “white supremacist,” who dances to the tune of the Alt-Right. This delusion has two sources: ignorance and maliciousness . People like Peter Holley are so deeply marinated in liberal ignorance that they can’t tell the difference between American nationalism and racial nationalism–between the desire to put American interests first and white racial consciousness. 
As I have explained elsewhere , the maliciousness involved looking for racial dissidents who supported Donald Trump and then arguing that since “racists” backed him, Trump must be a “racist,” too. When Mr. Trump didn’t denounce David Duke and “white supremacy” fiercely enough to suit them, they claimed this was proof he is a secret sympathizer. They were wrong. He just doesn’t like being pushed around by journalists who hates him. 
The pro-Hillary media therefore created a Frankenstein monster–an imaginary Donald Trump who secretly wants to make America white again. They called him a bigot, a xenophobe, a fascist, a threat to democracy and, of course, the new Hitler. They hoped this would frighten enough voters into the Hillary camp to stop Mr. Trump, but it didn’t work. And now they are stuck with a Frankenstein president elect who, they are convinced, comes running to me for policy tips. 
Yesterday, Senator Harry Reid issued an idiotic press release that included these lines: 
White nationalists, Vladimir Putin and ISIS are celebrating Donald Trump’s victory, while innocent, law-abiding Americans are wracked with fear–especially African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Muslim Americans, LGBT Americans and Asian Americans. 
It is because she has heard so many Frankenstein stories that poor Gloria in Fort Worth–a US citizen–thinks the real Trump message is that non-whites don’t belong in America. 
And she’s hardly alone. 
Jason Perez (right) a university student in Hawaii, writes that “the next four years will be a living nightmare for all Hispanic Americans.” Mercedes Rosales , a high school senior in Homestead, Florida, says Mr. Trump “just wants to get rid of Mexicans, or Latinos.” Maria Perez , also of Homestead, says, “Because of the example of Donald Trump . . . now they can look at you and see you are an immigrant and kill you.” Mary Rabago , a Hispanic journalist living in Arizona, explains the election results: “Hate won.” 
The Muslim reaction is just as nutty. Asaad Alabdulaziz, an Iraqi who recently became a US citizen , asks, “Do I have to go back?” Sahar Aziz , a professor at the Texas A&M University, says that “the general mood I am seeing among Muslims is concern that a Trump presidency will be open season on them.” 
No one–not once in the campaign–ever talked about deporting law-abiding legal residents. So where did people get these deranged ideas? Obviously, from media caricatures. Hispanics are no doubt getting lurid stuff from the Spanish-language press as well. Telesur , a consortium based in Venezuela, reports that under a Trump presidency, “the rights of black and brown people, immigrants and women will suffer serious setbacks.” 
People like Peter Holley–who created the caricature and believe in it–are on such hair-trigger alert for “racism” that they can’t conceive of a non-racial American nationalism that expresses itself in the ideas that helped Donald Trump win: Illegal immigrants should stay out. Illegals who are here should go home. There should be no sanctuary cities. Birth-right citizenship is crazy. Muslims are potentially troublesome. Legal immigration should be cut. 
There is nothing inherently racial about any of these ideas, and they appeal to millions of Americans who don’t think in racial terms. But current dogma demands that we thrill to the idea that every brown-skinned newcomer–whether he has a job or even speaks English–is a precious addition to our “greatest strength,” which is diversity. Anyone who supports policies that have the effect of slowing the march of diversity is a “racist,” and might as well be a dedicated AmRen reader or even a member of the Ku Klux Klan. That’s why Peter Holley thinks Donald Trump wants my advice. 
The notion that Mr. Trump will hurt blacks is especially wrong, but it follows the usual sloppy liberal thinking: If you want to send home illegals it can only be because you hate Hispanics, which means you hate blacks, women, homosexuals, and Jews. Donald Trump wanted Confederate flags taken down in the South, is “fine” with affirmative action , and he blasted Justice Antonin Scalia’s critique of race preferences in universities. And only the most fevered imagination could have prompted the Salon headline: “ I Am a Gay Jew in Trump’s America. And I Am Afraid for My Life .” Mr. Trump’s close professional and family connections to Jews are well known . 
It is the widely circulated fantasies about Donald-Trump-the-racist that explain why Mexican-Americans and Muslims who are US citizens are reportedly crying themselves to sleep at night, and why there are violent anti-Trump demonstrations all over the country. Just as reckless anti-police reporting paved the way for the murders of policemen , frothing press coverage of Donald Trump has sent thousands of ignoramuses into the streets to smash store windows and attack cops. 
The papers are now full of breathless reports of Trump supporters calling blacks “ni**er” and tearing hijabs off Muslim women. Some of these attacks were faked , but some are no doubt real. What do they reflect? What Donald Trump wants or what the Frankenstein wants? If loutish whites are telling Hispanics “we’ll deport you,” who gave them the idea that a modern-day Hitler is about to move into the White House? 
The Trump-is-a-racist idea is so firmly planted in the minds of Hillary supporters that nothing can dislodge it. But they don’t even understand what they, themselves, mean by it. 
Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones called me after the election to talk about the Alt-Right. I explained to him how the media have painted a dishonest picture of Donald Trump, and he conceded that he was beginning to realize that using his favorite word–“racist”–to describe the president elect and people like me might be a mistake. I congratulated him on this intellectual breakthrough, and then asked what Donald Trump has ever said or done that was “racist,” whatever that word means. 
“Oh, there are so many, I don’t know where to begin.” 
“Then just tell me one.” 
There was a brief silence. “He retweeted an image of himself as Pepe the frog.” 
“What? Is that the best you can do? You’re really straining.” 
“Yes, I guess I’m straining.” 
Mr. Harkinson later brought up Mr. Trump’s suggestion that Judge Gonazlo Curiel’s Mexican ancestry meant he could not try the Trump University case fairly. I pointed out that Judge Curiel is a member of La Raza [the race] Lawyers, which gave Mr. Trump grounds to doubt his impartiality. “Besides,” I said, “if a white police officer is in an altercation with a black criminal and ends up shooting him, you’d be the first to say the officer was biased on account of his race.” 
“Not the first.” 
“Then the second.” 
We live in a world of malicious fantasy. If members of that priestly class known as journalists–everyone knows they are sternly objective–call someone a “racist” that’s what he is. And once you’re a “racist,” you might as well be a sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semite, homophobe, and who knows what else. This is what we get when reporters slant the news and then believe what they read in the papers. And the media can’t understand why no one trusts them anymore.

749,Globalism: A Far-Right Conspiracy Theory Buoyed by Trump - The New York Times,"Donald J. Trump’s election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the American people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news media, the banks and the government.   Trump and his allies often describe that system with one word: globalism. It is a word that conjures many images, none of them good: shuttered factories, unchecked immigration and a distant cabal that, believers say, controls the economy and the media. Analysts who track extremist groups in the United States have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the  . They say it carries multiple meanings  —   from benign to sinister  —   and often serves as a “dog whistle” for racist,   and antigovernment conspiracy theorists. “Globalism is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the United States,” said Ryan Lenz, the editor of Hatewatch, a blog published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “It is the enemy, ultimately. ” Globalism is often used as a synonym for globalization, the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor unions, environmental organizations and opponents of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But for the far right, the term encapsulates a conspiratorial worldview based on racism, xenophobia and   according to Mark Pitcavage, a researcher at the   League. Lauren Southern, a host on the   Canadian media site Rebel Media, explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for globalization in a video she posted online in September. She said the word meant rule by autocrats  —   such as President Obama, former President George W. Bush and the United Nations  —   who value “the false flag of diversity” and “unchecked immigration from the third world. ” “Globalists almost always sneer down their nose at tradition, disdain national culture, laugh at religion and generally despise the West while holding a creepy affection for the third world,” she added. “They want open borders, cheap labor and antinationalism to benefit their business and political visions, and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve it. ” Breitbart News, the   website run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s newly appointed chief White House strategist, frequently attacked globalism and   “globalist elites” during Mr. Bannon’s tenure there. But no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than Alex Jones, a   radio host who commands an online audience of millions through his Infowars media empire. He has been called “the most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary America” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Among his claims: the Sandy Hook school massacre in Newtown, Conn. was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terror attacks were an inside job. Mr. Jones posted his own definition of globalism to YouTube in 2014. In his trademark shout, he described it as a “global digital panopticon control system” engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites. He called it “the total form of slavery. ” The host, who has enthusiastically supported Mr. Trump, hailed the Republican as a “George  ” historical figure. Mr. Trump, who appeared on his show last year, has in turn heaped praise upon Mr. Jones. “Your reputation is amazing,” Mr. Trump said. “I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope. And I think we’ll be speaking a lot. ” So what is Mr. Trump talking about when he talks about globalism? His spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, provided a definition in an email before the election last week:   groups in the United States began to refer to globalism at the end of the Cold War, when it replaced communism as an idea that was an   danger to the nation, Mr. Pitcavage said. They have also referred to it as the New World Order, and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere. The shape of that conspiracy had distinctly   overtones, in part because many of communism’s foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to Judaism, Mr. Pitcavage said. Members of the far right became fixated on prominent Jews like the businessman and philanthropist George Soros. Those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former President George Bush celebrated the end of the Cold War in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a “new world order. ” His use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot. “It was very easy for them, especially because he was the one who said it, to take that ball and run with it,” Mr. Pitcavage said. “From that point on, the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy theory. ” The term’s multiple meanings have made it a powerful political tool, and Mr. Trump’s and his allies’ frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience. “  is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the right” from the mainstream to the extreme, said Brian Levin, the director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Professor Levin called globalism “the defining folklore and narrative for the racist right” but said it had also “become a convenient boogeyman to explain the various declines that the United States is perceived to be in. ” Globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of Mr. Trump’s campaign, for example, when he told  a rally in Florida in October that his opponent for the presidency, Hillary Clinton, had sat at the heart of a   conspiracy with international bankers “to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty. ” The   League criticized the speech for “evoking classic   themes. ” Conspiratorial talk has continued after the election. Mr. Trump referred to a plot against him again last Thursday, when he complained on Twitter that   protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters. Lou Dobbs, a Trump ally and host on Fox Business News, later accused Mr. Soros of “inciting riots. ” Many on the far right have celebrated Mr. Trump’s election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy. Last Friday, Mr. Jones claimed on YouTube that Mr. Trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon. Ms. Hicks, the Trump campaign’s spokeswoman, did not reply to an email seeking comment late Sunday night. Mr. Jones then pivoted to what he thought was most important: the coming destruction of “the globalists that hijacked the country,” primarily the news media and international business people. Soon they would be destroyed once and for all, he suggested. “This is America battling back to restore humanity and to break the chains,” he said. “There’s not gonna be any détente. We know you’re scum, and we’re just here to let you know you’re scum. ”",0
750,Georgia Father Is Convicted of Murder in Toddler’s Death in Hot Car - The New York Times,"ATLANTA  —   With local television programming interrupted and a camera trained on the defendant’s emotionless face, an   father was convicted of murder on Monday for causing the death of his young son by deliberately leaving him in a hot car more than two years ago. A jury in southeast Georgia, where the case was tried because of intense pretrial publicity here, returned guilty verdicts against the man, Justin Ross Harris, 35, on eight counts, including malice murder and cruelty to children. Mr. Harris, who sometimes glanced downward as the verdict was read in Brunswick, could be sentenced to life in prison for the death of his    son, Cooper. The verdict, announced on the jury’s fourth day of deliberations, ended the suspense of a trial that began on Oct. 3, and it capped nearly 29 months of sordid allegations and scrambled loyalties. The cause of Cooper’s death was undisputed  —   Mr. Harris left him in a Hyundai Tucson while he worked as a software engineer at Home Depot on June 18, 2014  —   but it fell to jurors to decide whether he had been malicious or merely  . The manner of Cooper’s death is a heartbreakingly familiar one: At least 39 children in the United States have died of “vehicular heatstroke” this year, according to statistics compiled by a San Jose State University researcher. But the case against Mr. Harris was striking because of the severity of the charges and the state’s argument that he was eager to end his responsibilities to his family. “This killer’s heart abandoned this child long before he died,” Charles P. Boring, an assistant district attorney, said during his closing argument. “This defendant’s heart abandoned this child when he left him to die a terrible death in that car. ” In a statement after the verdict, the district attorney’s office noted a message that Mr. Harris sent minutes before he left his vehicle, Cooper still in his car seat: “I love my son and all, but we both need escapes. ” But near the end of a trial in which Mr. Harris was vilified as a   man with a compromised marriage, one of his lawyers, H. Maddox Kilgore, argued that moral failings did not make a motive for murder. “There is no evidence of any kind of hatred or bad feelings or anger,” Mr. Kilgore said. “Whatever term you want to come up with, any term you come up with, there’s no evidence that Ross expressed that toward his son. ” In the end, Mr. Harris was convicted on all eight counts for which he was indicted. Three of the charges were not connected to Cooper’s death and instead focused on Mr. Harris’s electronic communications with at least one underage girl. He will be sentenced next month. Although Mr. Harris’s former wife, Leanna Taylor, filed for divorce after Cooper’s death, she testified in her husband’s defense. Ms. Taylor’s lawyer, Lawrence J. Zimmerman, said she was “deeply disappointed” by the verdict.",0
751,Richard Bolles Dies at 90 Wrote ‘What Color Is Your Parachute?’ - The New York Times,"Richard N. Bolles, a former Harvard physics major, Episcopal minister and career counselor whose own twisting vocational path led to his writing “What Color Is Your Parachute?”  —   the most popular  ’s manual of the 1970s and beyond  —   died on Friday in San Ramon, Calif. He was 90. His son Gary said he died in San Ramon Regional Medical Center. Mr. Bolles lived nearby in Danville, Calif. Mr. Bolles (pronounced bowls) originally   his manual in 1970 as a photocopied   booklet for unemployed Protestant ministers. In 1972, he recast it to appeal to a wider audience and found an independent publisher in Berkeley, Calif. willing to print small batches so that it could be frequently updated. Since then, “Parachute” has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print. In 1995, the Library of Congress placed Mr. Bolles’s book squarely within the canon of classic American   literature by including it, along with Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and the “The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,” in “25 Books That Have Shaped Readers’ Lives,” a list compiled as part of a nationwide   program. The book’s unconventional yet pragmatic advice, whimsical narrative style and vintage graphics  —   reminiscent of “The Whole Earth Catalog,” another   survivors’ manual of the time  —   earned it respectful reviews for its reliable research and an early    following among career counselors and personnel directors. It also found a fan base among   attracted to Mr. Bolles’s homespun style  —   a fusion of boot camp rigor (  should spend at least 40 hours a week hunting) practical advice (“If you’re being interviewed over lunch, never  —   never  —   order a drink . .. Don’t . .. do . .. it! . .. Even if they do it”) and muted spirituality.   was an art form, more like dating than like selling a used car, he told readers. “You may never understand why things sometimes work, and sometimes don’t,” he wrote. With that in mind, Mr. Bolles said, “What Color Is Your Parachute? ,” subtitled “A Practical Manual for   and Career Changers,” was framed less as a guide to the job market than as a guide to help readers understand themselves  —   to help them figure out what they really liked doing so that they could find the job that would let them do it. “You need firm ground to stand on,” Mr. Bolles told an interviewer in 2000. “From there you can deal with the change. ” Mr. Bolles, an ordained Episcopal minister until 2004, when he left the ministry, said the title of his book came from an   discussion he had in the 1960s with parishioners who were unhappy in their jobs. They would say they were thinking of bailing out. “And I always thought of an airplane when I heard that phrase,” he said. “So I would respond, ‘What color is your parachute?’ ” “Parachute” climbed   rankings slowly but steadily throughout the decade. In 1979, it reached the New York Times   list, where it remained for more than a decade, returning intermittently for years afterward. Mr. Bolles was well qualified to write a handbook on changing direction he had changed his own several times, from planning a career in the chemical industry to becoming a minister and then, at 41, experiencing being fired and enduring the anxiety of unemployment at a time when he and his wife then, the former Janet Price, had four small children. It had never entered his mind, though, that he would write a blockbuster. “I was just trying to help people be better prepared than I was when I was fired and started looking for a job,” he said in an interview for this obituary in 2014. Yet whether he knew it or not, Mr. Bolles had anticipated a sea change in the relationship between workers and employers in the United States, said Micki McGee, an associate professor of sociology at Fordham University and the author of “  Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life,” a 2005 examination of   literature that includes an analysis of Mr. Bolles’s book. She said “Parachute” had come along at the beginning of a historic shift, when corporate strategies like outsourcing, subcontracting, downsizing and mergers were starting to erode traditional notions of job security. The idea that you could stay in one job for a lifetime began coming undone in the early 1970s, and “Parachute’s” perennial sales reflected, at least in part, this new reality. Mr. Bolles said he had come to acknowledge that connection over time, but, he added wryly, the success of “Parachute” had also reflected the fact that it was a pretty good book. Richard Nelson Bolles was born on March 19, 1927, in Milwaukee, the first of three children of Donald Clinton Bolles, an editor for The Associated Press, and the former Frances Fifield, a homemaker. His brother, Donald Jr. who followed his father into journalism, was killed in 1976 in Phoenix when a bomb detonated under his car. Don Bolles was then working as an investigative reporter for The Arizona Republic, and the killing was widely believed to be linked to a series of exposés he had been writing about corporate and organized crime in the state. The assassination resulted in the prosecution of one person but remained largely unsolved. After serving in the Navy at the tail end of World War II, Richard Bolles studied chemical engineering for two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then transferred to Harvard, where he earned his bachelor’s degree cum laude with a major in physics. While still an undergraduate, he was moved by a sermon he heard one Sunday at church about a critical shortage of ministers. After graduation, instead of accepting a lucrative job offer in the chemical industry, he decided to become an Episcopal minister. He attended General Theological Seminary in New York, where he received a master’s degree in New Testament studies and was ordained in 1953. He served as a rector at several churches in northern New Jersey, including St. John’s in Passaic, where he often counseled teenagers on sex and drug use. After participating in the 1963 March on Washington led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. he reached out to an   church in Passaic and, with its pastor, the Rev. Avery Johnson, led the integration of their churches, despite the opposition of some parishioners. Mr. Bolles had been a clergyman for 18 years when a combination of budget problems and philosophical differences with superiors led to the elimination of his job and his dismissal in 1968 as a pastor at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, the flagship church of the Episcopal Diocese of California. After six months of anxious searching, he landed a job in 1969 with United Ministries in Higher Education, an interdenominational church organization that had long been involved in recruiting and supporting college chaplains across the country. But college chaplains were increasingly being laid off, leaving Mr. Bolles a new mission: to help chaplains at campuses in seven Western states find new careers. That effort led him into research that inspired him to write the   manual that evolved into “What Color Is Your Parachute?” Among his other books was “The Three Boxes of Life and How to Get Out of Them,” on balancing work and personal life. Besides his son Gary, he is survived by his wife, Marci Mendoza Bolles two other children from his first marriage, Stephen and Sharon Bolles and 10 grandchildren. A third son, Mark, died in 2012. In the 2014 interview, Mr. Bolles said he hoped his franchise would continue after he was gone. His son Gary, he said, had asked him about updating future editions of “Parachute” and finding other   experts who might provide new advice. “I told him to make sure to find people who were funny, have a lightheartedness about them,” Mr. Bolles said. “When you are out of work and on the ropes, that is so important. ”",0
752,Stranahan: Steve Bannon Nailed It on the Media’s Fight Against Trump - Breitbart,"Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon delivered a powerhouse presentation along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus at CPAC on Thursday, in which one of Bannon’s main messages was that the media’s daily war against the Trump administration will continue unabated. [As Bannon explained to the CPAC audience:  [President Trump] is going to continue to press his agenda as economic conditions get better, as jobs get better, [and] they are going to continue to fight. If you think they are going to give you your country back without a fight, you are mistaken. Every day, it is going to be a fight. Bannon also clearly and bluntly stated the reason that the media onslaught will continue, saying, “The corporatist, globalist media is adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has. ” Bannon’s message is solidly based in fact, and a deeper understanding of what he means by the “corporatist, globalist media” goes a long way toward explaining why the establishment media will be battling Trump tooth and nail. For one thing, the “corporatist, globalist media” is really a very small number of companies  —   something that Steve Bannon understands well given his background in both media and on Wall Street. As Business Insider reported five years ago, six corporations control 90% of the media in America, which puts a huge amount of power in the hands of a very few people. That number is down from 50 companies back in 1983. Who runs things? A ranking of the world’s largest media companies of 2015 says that Comcast Corporation is the largest media conglomerate in the U. S. with The Walt Disney Company,   Century Fox, and Time Warner in the second, third, and fourth slots. The members of the media, the “opposition party at the back of the room,” are really just cogs in this machine  —   the   foot soldiers who’ve been put through a rigorous program of indoctrination in journalism school. These members of the progressive left not only face corporate pressure to conform to certain narratives, but members of the modern American media have also been taught that they possess a moral superiority and are on a mission to help make the world a better place. This combination of corporate overlords and leftist propaganda is what allows the media to avoid the inherent contradictions in the system that they defend. It’s why the media can spread the message of “open societies” and a world based on “love, not hate” that is being directed by billionaire funders like George Soros and his multimillionaire allies like the Clintons. Now add in the internationalist factor at an ownership level, even with fundamentalist Muslim countries like the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As Forbes reported, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and the company Kingdom Holding have stakes in media ventures like Twitter and even the parent of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. The Saudi Prince owns about 1% of the company, plus 6. 6% shareholding in 21st Century Fox Inc. worth about $1. 7 billion. Kingdom Holdings also has substantial shareholding in Time Warner, the parent of CNN. This is just one small example of the complex world of globalist media that the Trump administration is facing and part of the reason that more and more people are turning to new media upstarts like Breitbart News to get real information. As former executive chairman of Breitbart, it’s a world that Steve Bannon sees clearly.",0

754,Not Guilty: The Power of Nullification to Counteract Government Tyranny,"
“The people have the power, all we have to do is awaken that power in the people. The people are unaware. They’re not educated to realize that they have power. The system is so geared that everyone believes the government will fix everything. We are the government .” —John Lennon
How do you balance the scales of justice at a time when Americans are being tasered, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed, hit with batons, shot with rubber bullets and real bullets, blasted with sound cannons, detained in cages and kennels , sicced by police dogs, arrested and jailed for challenging the government’s excesses, abuses and power-grabs?
Politics won’t fix a system that is broken beyond repair.
No matter who sits in the White House, the shadow government will continue to call the shots behind the scenes.
Relying on the courts to restore justice seems futile.
Indeed, with every ruling handed down, it becomes more apparent that we live in an age of hollow justice, with government courts, largely lacking in vision and scope, rendering narrow rulings focused on the letter of the law. This is true at all levels of the judiciary, but especially so in the highest court of the land, the U.S. Supreme Court, which is seemingly more concerned with establishing order and protecting government agents than with upholding the rights enshrined in the Constitution.
Even so, justice matters.
It matters whether you’re a rancher protesting a federal land-grab by the Bureau of Land Management, a Native American protesting an oil pipeline that will endanger sacred sites and pollute water supplies, or an African-American taking to the streets to protest yet another police shooting of an unarmed citizen.
Unfortunately, protests and populist movements haven’t done much to push back against an authoritarian regime that is deaf to our cries, dumb to our troubles, blind to our needs, and accountable to no one.
It doesn’t matter who the activists are (environmentalists, peaceniks, Native Americans, Black Lives Matter, Occupy, or the Bundys and their followers) or what the source of the discontent is (endless wars abroad, police shootings, contaminated drinking water, government land-grabs), the government’s modus operandi has remained the same: shut down the protests using all means available, prosecute First Amendment activities to the fullest extent of the law, and discourage any future civil uprisings by criminalizing expressive activities, labeling dissidents as extremists or terrorists, and conducting widespread surveillance on the general populace in order to put down any whispers of resistance before it can take root.
Thus, if there is any means left to us for thwarting the government in its relentless march towards outright dictatorship, it may rest with the power of juries and local governments to invalidate governmental laws, tactics and policies that are illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional.
Just recently, in fact, an Oregon jury rejected the government’s attempts to prosecute seven activists who staged a six-week, armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.
In finding the defendants not guilty—of conspiracy to impede federal officers, of possession of firearms in a federal facility, and of stealing a government-owned truck—the jury sent its own message to the government and those following the case: justice matters.
The Malheur occupiers were found not guilty despite the fact that they had guns in a federal facility (their lawyers argued the guns were “as much a statement of their rural culture as a cowboy hat or a pair of jeans”). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they used government vehicles (although they would argue that government property is public property available to all taxpayers). They were found not guilty despite the fact that they succeeded in occupying a government facility for six weeks, thereby preventing workers from performing their duties (as the Washington Post points out, this charge has also been used to prosecute extremist left-wingers and Earth First protesters ).
Many other equally sincere activists with eloquent lawyers and ardent supporters have gone to jail for lesser offenses than those committed at the Malheur Refuge, so what made the difference here?
The jury made all the difference.
These seven Oregon protesters were found not guilty because a jury of their peers recognized the sincerity of their convictions, sympathized with the complaints against an overreaching government, and balanced the scales of justice using the only tools available to them: common sense, compassion and the power of the jury box.
Jury nullification works.
As law professor Ilya Somin explains, jury nullification is the practice by which a jury refuses to convict someone accused of a crime if they believe the “law in question is unjust or the punishment is excessive .” According to former federal prosecutor Paul Butler, the doctrine of jury nullification is “premised on the idea that ordinary citizens, not government officials, should have the final say as to whether a person should be punished.”
Imagine that: a world where the citizenry—not the government or its corporate controllers—actually calls the shots and determines what is just.
In a world of “ rampant overcriminalization ,” where the average citizen unknowingly breaks three laws a day, jury nullification acts as “ a check on runaway authoritarian criminalization and the increasing network of confusing laws that are passed with neither the approval nor oftentimes even the knowledge of the citizenry.”
Indeed, Butler believes so strongly in the power of nullification to balance the scales between the power of the prosecutor and the power of the people that he advises :
If you are ever on a jury in a marijuana case, I recommend that you vote “not guilty” — even if you think the defendant actually smoked pot, or sold it to another consenting adult. As a juror, you have this power under the Bill of Rights ; if you exercise it, you become part of a proud tradition of American jurors who helped make our laws fairer.
In other words, it’s “we the people” who can and should be determining what laws are just, what activities are criminal and who can be jailed for what crimes.
Not only should the punishment fit the crime, but the laws of the land should also reflect the concerns of the citizenry as opposed to the profit-driven priorities of Corporate America.
This is where the power of jury nullification is so critical: to reject inane laws and extreme sentences and counteract the edicts of a profit-driven governmental elite that sees nothing wrong with jailing someone for a lifetime for a relatively insignificant crime.
Of course, the powers-that-be don’t want the citizenry to know that it has any power at all.
They would prefer that we remain clueless about the government’s many illicit activities, ignorant about our constitutional rights, and powerless to bring about any real change.
In an age in which government officials accused of wrongdoing—police officers, elected officials, etc.—are treated with general leniency, while the average citizen is prosecuted to the full extent of the law, jury nullification is a powerful reminder that, as the Constitution tells us, “we the people” are the government.
For too long we’ve allowed our so-called “representatives” to call the shots. Now it’s time to restore the citizenry to their rightful place in the republic: as the masters, not the servants.
Nullification is one way of doing so.
Various cities and states have been using this historic doctrine with mixed results on issues as wide ranging as gun control and healthcare to “ claim freedom from federal laws they find onerous or wrongheaded .”
Where nullification can be particularly powerful, however, is in the hands of the juror.
The reality with which we must contend is that justice in America is reserved for those who can afford to buy their way out of jail.
For the rest of us who are dependent on the “fairness” of the system, there exists a multitude of ways in which justice can and does go wrong every day. Police misconduct. Prosecutorial misconduct. Judicial bias. Inadequate defense. Prosecutors who care more about winning a case than seeking justice. Judges who care more about what is legal than what is just. Jurors who know nothing of the law and are left to deliberate in the dark about life-and-death decisions. And an overwhelming body of laws, statutes and ordinances that render the average American a criminal, no matter how law-abiding they might think themselves.
If you’re to have any hope of remaining free—and I use that word loosely—your best bet remains in your fellow citizens.
Your fellow citizens may not know what the Constitution says (studies have shown Americans to be abysmally ignorant about their rights), they may not know what the laws are (there are so many on the books that the average American breaks three laws a day without knowing it), and they may not even believe in your innocence, but if you’re lucky, those who serve on a jury will have a conscience that speaks louder than the legalistic tones of the prosecutors and the judges and reminds them that justice and fairness go hand in hand.
That’s ultimately what jury nullification is all about: restoring a sense of fairness to our system of justice. It’s the best protection for “we the people” against the oppression and tyranny of the government, and God knows, we can use all the protection we can get. It’s a powerful way to remind the government—all of those bureaucrats who have appointed themselves judge, jury and jailer over all that we are, have and do—that we’re the ones who set the rules.
We could transform this nation if only Americans would work together to harness the power of their discontent.
Unfortunately, the government’s divide and conquer tactics are working like a charm.
Despite the laundry list of grievances that should unite “we the people” in common cause against the government, the nation is more divided than ever by politics, by socio-economics, by race, by religion, and by every other distinction that serves to highlight our differences.
The real and manufactured events of recent years—the invasive surveillance, the extremism reports, the civil unrest, the protests, the shootings, the bombings, the military exercises and active shooter drills, the color-coded alerts and threat assessments, the fusion centers, the transformation of local police into extensions of the military, the distribution of military equipment and weapons to local police forces, the government databases containing the names of dissidents and potential troublemakers—have all conjoined to create an environment in which “we the people” are more divided, more distrustful, and fearful of each other.
What we have failed to realize is that in the eyes of the government, we’re all the same.
In other words, when it’s time for the government to crack down—and that time is coming—it won’t matter whether we supported Hillary or Trump, whether we stood with the pipeline protesters or opposed BLM, or whether we spoke out against government misconduct and injustice or remained silent.
When the government cracks down, we’ll all suffer.
Here’s the thing: the government wants a civil war.
The objective: compliance and control.
Its strategy: destabilize the economy through endless wars, escalate racial tensions, polarize the populace, heighten tensions through a show of force, intensify the use of violence, and then, when all hell breaks loose, clamp down on the nation for the good of the people and the security of the nation.
The government has been anticipating and preparing for such a civil uprising for some time now.
Those protests in Ferguson , Baltimore and Baton Rouge to protest police brutality? The militarized police “ clad in Kevlar vests, helmets, and camouflage, armed with pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, and tear gas ” turning towns into war zones? The kenneling of pipeline protesters in North Dakota?
Those were just dress rehearsals for the government to work out the kinks in its operating manual on how to deal with civil unrest.
They were also previews of what’s in store if we continue to challenge the powers-that-be.
After all, it’s hard to persuade anyone to stand against tyranny when all you can promise them as a reward is persecution, prosecution and a one-way trip to the morgue. And when the outcome seems to be a foregone conclusion—the government always wins—it can seem pointless, even foolhardy, to dare to challenge the system.
So how do you not only push back against the police state’s bureaucracy, corruption and cruelty but also launch a counterrevolution aimed at reclaiming control over the government using nonviolent means?
You start by changing the rules and engaging in some (nonviolent) guerilla tactics.
Employ militant nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience , which Martin Luther King Jr. used to great effect through the use of sit-ins, boycotts and marches.
Take part in grassroots activism, which takes a trickle-up approach to governmental reform by implementing change at the local level (in other words, think nationally, but act locally).
And then, as I explain in more detail in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People , nullify everything. Nullify the court cases. Nullify the laws. Nullify everything the government does that is illegitimate, egregious or blatantly unconstitutional. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

756,Tory Councillor Say Homeless People Should Be ‘Eliminated’,"  Carol Adl in News , UK // 0 Comments 
A Tory councillor believes that homeless people in Bradford city centre should be ‘grabbed by scruff of the neck’ and ‘dealt with’. 
The comments by David Heseltine, a Conservative Party Councillor in Bradford caused outrage during a meeting of the Council’s regeneration overview and scrutiny committee. He said : 
“The tramps and drunks sleeping in doorways. What we need to do is get them by the scruff of the neck and deal with them. People have said they’d go into Bradford if they were eliminated.” 
He claimed that while plans to redevelop the city centre were all well and good, the investment had been ruined by the homeless. 
So what exactly does Mr Heseltine envisage when he suggests grabbing the homeless “by the scruff of the neck” and eliminating them? 
EvolvePolitics reports: 
Why Councillor Heseltine believes that perpetrating an assault on the homeless would rectify the problem is a mystery. He would be better advised to encourage his colleagues to work towards providing people with homes, opportunities for employment, improving mental health services and providing interventions for alcohol and drug addiction. 
The ‘Nasty Party’ Councillor said that he had spoken to people who claimed that they would not visit Bradford city centre due to the number of drinkers and beggars. 
Heseltine is correct in his assertion that Bradford council – like many other councils – places the town centre aesthetic above the needs of those that live in and around them. However, his suggestions for dealing with the problem of homelessness are utterly reprehensible. These are people, not dogs or vermin to be disposed of to make your town look just a little better. 
Most people are never more than three paychecks away from being homeless. Our elected representatives would be well advised to remember that.",0
757,"Review: In ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’ a Tough Love Analysis of the Poor Who Back Trump - The New York Times","In late July, The American Conservative ran an interview with J. D. Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine’s website. The interviewer’s last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance’s publishing debut, “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis. ” Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10. After reading “Hillbilly Elegy,” you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar election cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we’re certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube. Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. Trump. Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized election, and he’s done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans. Imagine that. On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant. But his profile is misleading. His people  —   hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view)  —   didn’t step off the Mayflower and become part of America’s ascendant class. “Poverty is the family tradition,” he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers  —   all     occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security. Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a   steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw  —   in newscaster English, that’s grandma and grandpa  —   who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a   life (house, car) they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life. Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, “a violent nondrunk,” was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance’s mother was an empress of instability  —   violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn’t shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she’d later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands. The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin,   as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don’t finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from Ohio State University and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds. “Hillbilly Elegy,” in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells  —   most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life  —   and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes? In Mr. Vance’s estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he’s convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community’s problems the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he’s also convinced that it “increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it. ” His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line. He could not afford a cellphone. “Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,” Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. “I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about. ” Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to Facebook to blame the “Obama economy. ” Or with a former   at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant. Squint, and you’ll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance’s argument. It’s always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can  —   just as President Obama can say to fellow   “brothers should pull up their pants,” as he did on MTV. The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view. Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his   confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn’t laziness that’s destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls “learned helplessness”  —   the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot. What he’s really writing about is despair. Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for Ohio State University. He’s plumped with hope his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite. “There was something almost spiritual,” he writes, “about the cynicism of the community at large. ” His friends and relations are convinced that the media lies. That politicians lie. That the military, an institution they revere, is fighting two fruitless wars. Universities feel “rigged” and inaccessible job prospects are slim. For what purpose do you live under such circumstances? When the stanchions of your life have sunk into the muck? Mr. Vance doesn’t have all the answers. But he’s advancing the conversation.",0

All Governments Lie, The Movie By David Swanson on October 31, 2016 A Film About Liars and the Journalists That Expose Them 
By David Swanson 
Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media’s choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” 
That’s the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone . 
The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there’s a good deal of overlap — enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. 
I’d have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I’m tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. 
Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky’s analysis of how the media system is “rigged” without those doing the rigging believing they’ve done anything at all. It’s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It’s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it’s an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone’s tradition. 
One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I’d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. 
But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. 
And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. 
Stone’s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. 
Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. 
The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. 
Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn’t believe it. 
Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). 
Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone’s work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We’ve learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today.

760,"Trump and Brexit Defeat Globalism, for Now Anyway","Trump and Brexit Defeat Globalism, for Now Anyway   14, 2016 
Trumpism as a stress test for democracy …. A series of populist anti-globalism shocks is a test for Western democracies. Trump’s stunning ascent to the White House is the clearest signal yet of an anti-establishment revolt unfolding in major democracies, stretching across the Atlantic. – Swiss Info Tech 
Was Trump’s victory actually created by the very globalist elites that Trump is supposed to have overcome? 
There are some who believe the elites are actually splintered into numerous groups and that domestic US elites have positioned themselves against the banking elites in London’s City. We see no fundamental evidence of this. 
The world’s real elites in our view may have substantive histories in the hundreds and thousands of years. US elites are basically in the employ of a handful of families, individuals and institutions in our view. 
It is confusing because it is hard to tell if Hillary, for instance, is operating on her own accord or at the behest of higher and more powerful authorities. 
It is probably a combination of both but at root those who control central banks are managing the world’s move towards globalism. History easily shows us who these groups are – and they are not located in America. 
This is a cynical perspective to be sure, and certainly doesn’t remove the impact of Trump’s victory or his courage in waging his election campaign despite what must surely be death threats to himself and his family.. 
But if true, this perspective corresponds to predictions that we’ve been making for nearly a decade now, suggesting that sooner or later elites – especially those in London’s City – would have to “take a step back.” 
More: 
The vote to propel Trump to the US presidency reflects a profound backlash against open markets and borders, and the simmering anger of millions of blue-collar white and working-class people who blame their economic woes on globalisation and multiculturalism. 
“There are a few parallels to Switzerland – that the losers of globalisation find somebody who is listening to them,” said Swiss professor and lawyer Wolf Linder, a former director of the University of Bern’s political science institute. 
“Trump is doing his business with the losers of globalisation in the US, like the Swiss People’s Party is doing in Switzerland,” he said. “It is a phenomenon which touches all European nations.” 
Again, this article presumes that Trump has “won” and that he intends to attack the larger globalist enterprise and the bankers funding it. On the other hand, it could be that both Trump and Brexit have been engineered to look as if the tide is turning against globalism when it is not. 
Why would those in charge want to portray this point of view when it may not be so? Because of what we call the “Internet Reformation” that has blasted open the secretive manipulations of the globalist elite in the past decade or so. 
It is almost impossible for globalists to promote internationalist memes in this environment. Yet it is the secretive injection of internationalist memes into the body politic that moves society toward the globalist enterprise. 
As we have suggested before, it is perfectly possible that a decision has been made to pretend to grant the larger society a “victory” over internationalism. 
Following this analysis, certain trends would be identified and encouraged that would seem to portray globalism as falling back on its metaphorical heels. 
In truth, if this analysis is correct, globalism’s retreat is a kind of pretense that will steer society less obviously in a globalist direction. 
One way this could happen is by ensuring the splintering of Europe – but not in a way that actually reduces control from Brussels. It will APPEAR to be so but won’t actually happen. The same thing could take place in the USA under Trump. 
Again, this is not to say that Trump is party to this plot or even approves of it. But the idea that Trump is part of a co-option is certainly a feasible alternative to an alternative analysis that takes what is happening at face value. 
Nonetheless, even if an alternative elite strategy has been decided on to realize globalism in another fashion, it ought to be pointed out that things have changed. And the Internet and its revelations are surely responsible. 
This is a very big deal and it is one that ought to be emphasized repeatedly. Brexit and Trump could be, somehow, the result of a different elite approach – but the approach HAS changed nonetheless. 
Think of it this way: Hillary represented the blunt approach toward the realization of further globalism. Her way included an aggressively expanded war and the pursuit of other globalist trends. 
Trump, rhetorically anyway, has a different approach in mind that would gut many internationalist trends. 
If Trump follows through on his rhetoric, the trend toward an internationalist world will be reduced. And while there is controversy over Trump’s recent staff appointments we should also bear in mind that the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) both seem to be failing now. 
If indeed Trump’s election has damped the progress of TPP, and TTIP, this is a huge event. As we’ve pointed out, both agreements effectively substituted technocratic corporatism for the current sociopolitical model of “democracy.” 
The elites were trying to move toward a new model of world control with these two agreements. This is similar to what happened after the advent of the Gutenberg Press when the elites of the day moved away from royal control and apparently swapped in democracy. 
It seems evident that internationalism is now going to take a longer time to realize than we thought. However, this observation may not be entirely accurate if Trump turns out to be something other than his rhetoric suggests – or if Brexit is denied in Europe. 
Additionally, one of the elite’s most powerful, operative memes today is “populism vs. globalism” that seeks to contrast the potentially freedom-oriented events of Trump and Brexit to the discarded wisdom of globalism. See here and here. 
The reality of these two events, the victories of both Trump and Brexit, stand as signal proof that elite stratagems have been defeated, at least temporarily. Though whether these defeats have been self-inflicted as part of a change in tactics remains to be seen. 
Conclusion: But the change has come. One way or another the Internet and tens of millions or people talking, writing and acting has forced new trends. This can be hardly be emphasized enough. Globalism has been at least temporarily redirected",0
761,"Facing Congress, Some Sports Officials (Not All) Begin to Confront Sexual Abuse - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   It must have been uncomfortable for Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the United States Olympic Committee, to sit between two gymnasts during the congressional hearing about sexual abuse on Tuesday. To his right, Jamie Dantzscher started crying during her testimony. She described how she was molested by the former U. S. A. Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar when she was a teenager. Dantzscher, 34 and a former Olympian, said Nassar abused her “all over the world. ” “In my own room, in my own bed, in my hotel room in Sydney at the Olympic Games,” she said, through tears. “I thought I was the only one. ” To Adams’s left, Jessica Howard, a former national champion in rhythmic gymnastics, testified that Nassar began assaulting her when she was 15, during what he called therapy for a hip injury. “He began to massage my legs, and then quickly moved inwards on my thighs,” she said. “He then massaged his way into me. ” Give these women credit for telling their stories. They’re a main reason Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, decided to introduce a bill that would make it mandatory for national governing bodies of Olympic sports to report sexual assault to the police. It would be a federal crime not to report abuse. Give Adams credit, too. In the past, the Olympic committee had failed to prioritize the issue of sexual assault and appeared to turn a blind eye to the issue by handing it off to the governing bodies of each Olympic sport. But on Tuesday, finally, Adams said something that was a long time coming. He said sorry. “The Olympic community failed the people it was supposed to protect,” said Adams, the head of organizational development for the national governing sports bodies, which exist under the umbrella of the United States Olympic Committee. “We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse. ” Nassar was fired by U. S. A. Gymnastics in 2015 and is currently in jail in Michigan, where he is facing multiple sexual assault charges and federal child pornography charges. He has denied any wrongdoing. You would think U. S. A. Gymnastics would also go out of its way to apologize for its role in a scandal that has shaken Olympic sports and caused the ouster of its president, Steve Penny. More than 80 athletes have accused Nassar of abusing them. But the gymnastics organization did not even have a representative in that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room. Feinstein had asked U. S. A. Gymnastics to testify, and said its board chairman, Paul Parilla, was thinking about it but backed out. Instead, Parilla provided a statement. It said that the board of directors offered “our sincere and heartfelt regrets and sympathies” to any athlete harmed and that U. S. A. Gymnastics was “appalled that anyone would exploit a young athlete or child in the manner alleged. ” No apologies. Court documents released this month showed U. S. A. Gymnastics had complaint files on 54 coaches regarding sex abuse claims from 1996 to 2006. No apologies, even for its lack of a backbone and for sending only a lobbyist to the hearing. That lobbyist first identified himself as working for U. S. A. Gymnastics  —   which I figured, considering he was holding a file folder that said, “USAG 50 copies” on it. A few minutes later, he said, no, he was actually there for U. S. A. Hockey. The federation has had no shame, either. When the sex abuse bill was introduced, Penny and others from U. S. A. Gymnastics met with Feinstein about the federation’s sexual assault policies. How about this for a   stunt: Tagging along was Mary Lou Retton, the smiling, bubbly sweetheart from the 1984 Games, as they said that the federation’s policies were solid and that gymnastics was a happy, safe place. On Tuesday, Feinstein and her fellow senators weren’t thrilled that the gymnastics federation had ditched them this time. “If they really cared, they would be here,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said as he looked at Dantzscher and Howard, the abused gymnasts who testified. “They have to answer for what happened to you. ” At a news conference later, Blumenthal called for an investigation into “who knew what and when. ” Feinstein said she would like to see the gymnastics board of directors change and for its replacement to be people who make the sexual assault issue a priority. The U. S. O. C. should hasten that change. It can do so by decertifying U. S. A. Gymnastics, which would basically kick the federation out as the national governing body for the sport of gymnastics in the United States. To let U. S. A. Gymnastics back into the family, the Olympic committee could demand that the federation clean house and start new with fresh faces. The committee has used this power with other federations, and it used its influence to push out Penny when the Nassar case exploded into one of the biggest abuse scandals in sports history. It might as well go a step further, if only to show athletes and other federations that it won’t tolerate sexual abuse on its watch. When asked if U. S. A. Gymnastics knew about the abuse of gymnasts at the hands of Nassar, Feinstein said: “Do I believe they knew about it? Absolutely, yes, I do. ” But they didn’t report it, she said, and that’s the culture of the sport. If Feinstein’s bill passes, it would help change that culture. The new U. S. Center for SafeSport  —   a nonprofit formed to prevent and handle abuse in Olympic sports  —   should help, too, if it ever gets going the way it should. Last week, after many delays, including a struggle by the Olympic committee to find funding, the center finally opened for business. There should be a hotline for athletes and others to anonymously report abuse in Olympic sports. Good luck finding it on the center’s website. Feinstein said the Olympic committee should easily find money to fund the site and keep it running, whether it’s through raising money from the private sector or using its own cash. “The Olympic committee has money, so they can use it the way they want to use it,” she said. Mattie Larson was sitting in the public seats at the hearing on Tuesday. She is 24 now, but I first met Larson, a senior at U. C. L. A. when she was 15, sometime before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She was quiet, and a rising star. She said she was being molested by Nassar around that time. So many years later, in 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published an article about a gymnast who accused Nassar of abusing her, Larson’s former teammate on the national team called her and said, “Read the story and tell me what you think. ” The two said they realized that Nassar had abused them. It had never occurred to them that his   “intravaginal treatment” was sexual assault. After all, he was the head doctor for U. S. A. Gymnastics. If the federation trusted him, they should, too. Now Larson replays the abuse in her head, again and again. What could she have done to stop it? What should U. S. A. Gymnastics have done to stop it? “I’m mad at myself for not knowing,” she said of the abuse. “On so many levels, it was complete betrayal. “You’d think in a sport with young girls, with young girls wearing leotards, prancing around with their legs flying all over the place, that U. S. A. Gymnastics would educate gymnasts and coaches and parents about sexual abuse. But they didn’t. And they knew they should have. ” Larson said it could have saved her and others, countless others, if the U. S. Center for SafeSport had existed when she was competing. “There are so many more victims who haven’t come forward yet,” she said. “I know them. They’re national team members, Olympians. ” At the very least, U. S. A. Gymnastics or the United States Olympic Committee could have mandated sexual abuse awareness training for athletes and their parents. The committee didn’t require its national governing bodies to run abuse education programs, or even conduct criminal background checks, until 2014. When Adams was asked why so many years had passed with no independent entity like the SafeSport center, his answer was vague. “It took too long to happen,” he said.",0
762,Airbnb Ends Fight With New York City Over Fines - The New York Times,"Airbnb has capitulated to the demands of lawmakers over its operations in New York City, the company’s largest market in the United States, agreeing to drop a lawsuit in which it was pushing back against a newly passed state law that it said could have hurt its business. The   home rental service on Friday settled the lawsuit that it filed against New York City two months ago. The suit challenged a New York law that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed in October. That law called for fines of as much as $7, 500 for illegally listing a property on a rental platform such as Airbnb. The company had said the large fines could have deterred hosts and impaired its revenue in New York City. Hosts in the city generated about $1 billion in revenue last year, and the company took a cut of that in fees. But Airbnb on Friday agreed that it would drop the suit as long as New York City enforces the new law only against hosts and does not fine Airbnb. The settlement takes effect on Monday. The agreement is a victory for opponents of Airbnb. The company and New York authorities have battled for years over the legality of offering   lodging through the service, and the relationship has long been inconsistent. Since 2010, it has been illegal in New York to rent out a whole apartment on Airbnb for fewer than 30 days. In October, Airbnb said it was willing to crack down on people in New York City who rent out multiple homes, bowing to pressure from politicians and tenants’ rights groups who said the company had made it harder to find affordable housing in the city. “This is an astounding   on the part of Airbnb, which clearly recognized that this was a foolhardy and frivolous lawsuit,” Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who wrote the law that Airbnb opposed, said of the settlement on Friday. In a statement, Airbnb said the settlement was “a material step forward for our hosts. ” Airbnb has been fighting with local governments around the globe that are displeased with the effects of the online rental service. Cities such as Amsterdam, Miami Beach and New Orleans have been closely watching the New York case. “I expect the city will now get down to the important business of enforcing the law against the serial lawbreakers on the site” who turn affordable housing into illegal hotels, Ms. Rosenthal said in her statement. “This is a win for everyone. ”",0

764,"Next Big Tech Corridor? Between Seattle and Vancouver, Planners Hope - The New York Times","VANCOUVER, British Columbia  —   Seattle and Vancouver are like fraternal twins separated at birth. Both are bustling Pacific Northwest coastal cities with   populations that have accepted the bargain of dispiriting weather for much of the year in exchange for nearby ski slopes and kayaking and glorious summers. Yet 140 miles of   roads and an international border divide the two cities, keeping them farther apart than their geographic and cultural identities would suggest. Now the political, academic and tech elite of both cities are looking for ways to bring them closer together, with the aim of continuing the growth of two of the most vibrant economies in North America. “Vancouver has a lot more in common with Seattle than we do with Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, anywhere else in our country,” Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, said in an interview. “We should make the most of those cultural commonalities. ” Whether their grand vision of a “Cascadia innovation corridor”  —   which borrows its name from the region’s Cascade mountain range  —   ever materializes, leaders on both sides of the border have motives for getting cozier immediately. American tech icons like Microsoft, with voracious needs for global engineering talent, are expanding their Vancouver offices, partly because of Canada’s smoother immigration process. For its part, Vancouver wants to bring more American technology companies to the city in hopes of spinning out future entrepreneurs who will expand its comparatively small base of technology companies. One serious obstacle to Vancouver’s tech ambitions is its   housing costs. The median price for a detached home in the metropolitan area in August was 1. 4 million Canadian dollars (about $1. 06 million) a 27. 8 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. In the San Francisco metropolitan area, the median single family home price was about $848, 000, according to Zillow. But while median pay for   jobs is $112, 000 a year in the San Francisco Bay Area, it is just under $49, 000 in Vancouver, according to an analysis by PayScale, a compensation data firm. (Some of that discrepancy is due to a drop in the value of Canada’s currency relative to the United States dollar.) “We have San Francisco real estate prices with the incomes of somewhere between Reno and Nashville,” said Andy Yan, acting director of the city program at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. On the thrumming streets of downtown Vancouver, signs of the Seattle region’s growing economic ties to the city are hard to miss. A rectangular glass and steel office building with a large Microsoft sign occupies nearly an entire city block, sitting atop a large Nordstrom store (another Seattle brand). Microsoft says it invested $120 million in its new offices in Vancouver, which opened in June, and expects to spend $90 million more annually on wages and other operating costs. It plans to employ nearly 750 people in the city. Microsoft is hiring Canadians for the facility, but the country’s more open immigration policies were an important factor in its investment, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said in an interview. Microsoft and other tech companies have long complained that the United States education system does not produce enough computer science graduates, forcing them to rely on immigrants from India, China and elsewhere. Foreign workers in the United States can wait about three times as long for a work visa as those in Canada do, the Boston Consulting Group estimates. And the prospect of Donald J. Trump winning the presidency has raised concerns among tech companies, because of the Republican candidate’s comments about further restricting immigration to the United States. “Right now, there’s just a lot of uncertainty about open immigration,” Mr. Smith said. Last month, officials and executives from both cities huddled in a Vancouver hotel to discuss how to enable people, ideas and capital to flow more freely between them, as heedless of the international border separating the cities as a pod of orcas swimming in the sea. At the Cascadia conference, Ms. Clark and Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington, signed an agreement to deepen the ties between Vancouver and Seattle, including more research collaboration between the University of British Columbia and the University of Washington. Bill Gates,   of Microsoft, and Satya Nadella, its current chief executive, talked about globalization and education. One proposal to deal with traffic between Vancouver and Seattle was for a   rail line that would whisk travelers at more than 200 miles an hour between the cities in 57 minutes (it can take four hours or more by car). The details on financing the project  —   which could cost an estimated $30 billion or more  —   have not been worked out. A group of Seattle techies proposed a cheaper alternative: a dedicated lane for autonomous vehicles on Interstate 5, the highway connecting Seattle to the Canadian border. The plan  —   which relies on autonomous vehicles that still need a lot of work  —   would not shave much time off the commute between the cities, but could make the ride less tedious by letting travelers work or watch a movie, said Tom Alberg, a managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture capital firm, and an author of the proposal. With roots in timber and shipping, Vancouver’s economy has diversified in recent decades with the growth of film and video game production. The city claims a tech “unicorn”  —   a   valued at over $1 billion  —   in Hootsuite, which makes social media tools. But Vancouver remains a relative small fry in tech, with about $1. 78 billion in venture capital flowing into local tech   in the last decade, compared with about $8. 9 billion in Seattle, the research firm Pitchbook estimates. Still, the city’s   tech boom may hit a wall if it cannot address its    issues, which are by some standards more acute than those plaguing other thriving cities. Vancouver was ranked the third most unaffordable city in the world, after Hong Kong and Sydney, in a study published this year by Demographia, a consulting firm. Mr. Yan has spent years analyzing his hometown’s soaring real estate values and concluded that a surge in foreign capital, primarily from mainland China, has decoupled Vancouver home prices from the local economy. British Columbia recently imposed a 15 percent tax on new home purchases in the Vancouver area by foreign buyers, a move now facing legal challenges. The housing market is showing signs of cooling off, though it is not yet clear how much of that is because of the tax. The total number of homes sold in the area in August dropped 26 percent from a year earlier and price growth has slowed, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Dennis Pilarinos, chief executive of Buddybuild, a Vancouver maker of developer tools for mobile apps, says affordability has been less of a problem for young tech workers, who may be willing to rent smaller apartments and live with roommates. But when   get bigger, many struggle to recruit senior executives with families, said Mr. Pilarinos, who previously worked for Microsoft and Amazon in Vancouver. “Companies tend to run into scaling issues,” he said. “You end up with fewer Microsofts or Amazons. ”",0
765,Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs - The New York Times,"Who is winning the race for jobs between robots and humans? Last year, two leading economists described a future in which humans come out ahead. But now they’ve declared a different winner: the robots. The industry most affected by automation is manufacturing. For every robot per thousand workers, up to six workers lost their jobs and wages fell by as much as   of a percent, according to a new paper by the economists, Daron Acemoglu of M. I. T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University. It appears to be the first study to quantify large, direct, negative effects of robots. The paper is all the more significant because the researchers, whose work is highly regarded in their field, had been more sanguine about the effect of technology on jobs. In a paper last year, they said it was likely that increased automation would create new, better jobs, so employment and wages would eventually return to their previous levels. Just as cranes replaced dockworkers but created related jobs for engineers and financiers, the theory goes, new technology has created new jobs for software developers and data analysts. But that paper was a conceptual exercise. The new one uses   data  —   and suggests a more pessimistic future. The researchers said they were surprised to see very little employment increase in other occupations to offset the job losses in manufacturing. That increase could still happen, they said, but for now there are large numbers of people out of work, with no clear path forward  —   especially   men without college degrees. “The conclusion is that even if overall employment and wages recover, there will be losers in the process, and it’s going to take a very long time for these communities to recover,” Mr. Acemoglu said. “If you’ve worked in Detroit for 10 years, you don’t have the skills to go into health care,” he said. “The market economy is not going to create the jobs by itself for these workers who are bearing the brunt of the change. ” The paper’s evidence of job displacement from technology contrasts with a comment from the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who said at an Axios event last week that artificial intelligence’s displacement of human jobs was “not even on our radar screen,” and “50 to 100 more years” away. (Not all robots use artificial intelligence, but a panel of experts  —   polled by the M. I. T. Initiative on the Digital Economy in reaction to Mr. Mnuchin’s comments  —   expressed the same broad concern of major job displacement.) The paper also helps explain a mystery that has been puzzling economists: why, if machines are replacing human workers, productivity hasn’t been increasing. In manufacturing, productivity has been increasing more than elsewhere  —   and now we see evidence of it in the employment data, too. The study analyzed the effect of industrial robots in local labor markets in the United States. Robots are to blame for up to 670, 000 lost manufacturing jobs between 1990 and 2007, it concluded, and that number will rise because industrial robots are expected to quadruple. The paper adds to the evidence that automation, more than other factors like trade and offshoring that President Trump campaigned on, has been the bigger   threat to   jobs. The researchers said the findings  —   “large and robust negative effects of robots on employment and wages”  —   remained strong even after controlling for imports, offshoring, software that displaces jobs, worker demographics and the type of industry. Robots affected both men’s and women’s jobs, the researchers found, but the effect on male employment was up to twice as big. The data doesn’t explain why, but Mr. Acemoglu had a guess: Women are more willing than men to take a pay cut to work in a   field. The economists looked at the effect of robots on local economies and also more broadly. In an isolated area, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by 6. 2 workers and wages by 0. 7 percent. But nationally, the effects were smaller, because jobs were created in other places. Take Detroit, home to automakers, the biggest users of industrial robots. Employment was greatly affected. If automakers can charge less for cars because they employ fewer people, employment might increase elsewhere in the country, like at steel makers or taxi operators. Meanwhile, the people in Detroit will probably spend less at stores. Including these factors, each robot per thousand workers decreased employment by three workers and wages by 0. 25 percent. The findings fuel the debate about whether technology will help people do their jobs more efficiently and create new ones, as it has in the past, or eventually displace humans. David Autor, a collaborator of Mr. Acemoglu’s at M. I. T. has argued that machines will complement instead of replace humans, and cannot replicate human traits like common sense and empathy. “I don’t think that this paper is the last word on its subject, but it’s an exceedingly carefully constructed and   first word,” he said. Mr. Restrepo said the problem might be that the new jobs created by technology are not in the places that are losing jobs, like the Rust Belt. “I still believe there will be jobs in the years to come, though probably not as many as we have today,” he said. “But the data have made me worried about the communities directly exposed to robots. ” In addition to cars, industrial robots are used most in the manufacturing of electronics, metal products, plastics and chemicals. They do not require humans to operate, and do various tasks like welding, painting and packaging. From 1993 to 2007, the United States added one new industrial robot for every thousand workers  —   mostly in the Midwest, South and East  —   and Western Europe added 1. 6. The study, a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published Monday, used data on the number of robots from the International Federation of Robotics (there is no consistent data on the monetary value of the robots in use.) It analyzed the effect of robots on employment and wages in commuting zones, a way to measure local economies.

An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were stunned a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM)—and for reasons yet to be firmly established. 
According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. 
With Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign Chairman John Podesta having longstanding ties to the Russian mafia and money laundering, this report continues, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) maintains complete surveillance of him and his criminal associates—including both Hillary Clinton and her husband, and former US President, Bill Clinton. 
On Saturday 15 October (2016), this report notes, the SVR reported to the MoF that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta met with JP Morgan Chase & Company CEO Jamie Dimon at Clinton’s Chappaqua Compound outside of New York City—and who, in 2009, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton allowed to break US laws by his, Dimon’s, being able to buy millions-of-dollars of his company’s stocks prior to the public being told his JP Morgan bank was receiving a Federal Reserve $80 billion credit line—and that caused JP Morgan’s stocks to soar and that have had an astonishing 920% dividend growth since 2010. 
Within 12 hours of the Hillary Clinton-John Podesta-Jamie Dimon meeting at the Chappaqua Compound, this report continues, the BIS registered the transfer of $1.8 billion from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank. 
To why the Clinton Foundation transferred this enormous sum of money to Qatar, this report explains, is due to the longstanding ties between this Islamic neo-patrimonial absolute monarchy and then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who oversaw the “massive bribery scheme” that allowed this Gulf State nation to secure the 2022 World Cup—and that the Qataris were so appreciative of they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation, and incredibly, in 2011, gave former US President Bill Clinton $1 million for a birthday present—bringing Hillary Clinton’s total “cash grab” from these Persian Gulf sheiks of $100 million—all occurring as recently released secret emails revealed Hillary Clinton’s knowledge that both Qatar and Saudi Arabia were, and still are, funding ISIS. 
To what Jamie Dimon said to Hillary Clinton that caused her to suddenly transfer $1.8 billion to Qatar, this report notes, revolves around his JP Morgan bank being told by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in April (2016) that this “megabanks” master plan to save itself had “serious deficiencies” that could “pose serious adverse effects to the financial stability of the United States”. 
Two months after the FDIC’s warning letter to Jamie Dimon, in June (2016), this report says, he cryptically “sounded a warning” that the United States sub-prime auto loan bubble was nearing collapse and stated that “someone is going to get hurt”. 
Unbeknownst to the American people, MoF experts in this report explain, is that just 8 weeks ago multiple warnings began to be issued that the United States $1 trillion sub-prime auto loan bubble was beginning to collapse—and that this past week became so severe the Bank of America issued a recession warning telling its elite customers that “this market is scary”, and the British-based multinational banking and financial services company HSBC, likewise, issued a “Red Alert” warning all of its clients warning them to “prepare for a severe market crash”. 
With one of the first casualties of this sub-prime auto loan bubble being the German global banking giant Deutsche Bank that is “nearing its doom” and laying off tens-of-thousands of it workers worldwide, this report grimly states, the American mainstream propaganda media is failing to allow the people of that nation to know the full extent of this looming catastrophe—who unlike Hillary Clinton who has just protected $1.8 billion of her wealth, will be left defenseless once again at the hands of their elite rulers. 
As Wikileaks secret Hillary Clinton emails have now proven that the US propaganda mainstream media is now totally controlled by her, and who continue their blackout on the “Clinton Crime Story of the Century”, this report continues, the absolutely horrifying statistics released this week showing that an astounding 35% of American who have been brutalized by the Obama-Clinton regime these past 8 years are so buried in debt they can no longer pay their bills is, likewise, being kept from these most innocent of peoples.",0
767,Seeing Africa by Road - The New York Times,"We had made it to Tete, Mozambique. The sun was sinking behind the Zambezi River like a scoop of orange sherbet as we sat on the motel’s deck taking in the quiet close of another long day on the road. But we avoided one another’s eyes. The table in front of us was cluttered with maps, notebooks, competing spreadsheets and empty beer bottles. “I don’t know, man,” Robert said. “Mozambique’s interesting, but it kind of reminds me of Spain in the ’80s. Maybe we should go our separate ways. ” For days, tensions had been building. It was hard traveling with another family, facing the endless   of a road trip, especially this one. Robert and his wife, two Dutch friends whose children are about the same age as ours, were hankering to go west to see Botswana’s Kalahari Desert and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. I had promised our two boys, Apollo, 6, and Asa, 4, that we would hit the beach in Mozambique, fabled for its pristine coastline. But this wasn’t just a quibble over the route, which, in the spirit of this trip, we had always intended to be flexible. We were getting on one another’s nerves. No. That’s too soft. We were annoying the bejesus out of one another. We were locking horns over everything  —   when to stop and fill up the jerrycans, which little guesthouse to sleep in, whether to get chicken and chips or omelets, again, for dinner, great chunks of silence sitting between us at meals. And now as we contemplated the nuclear option, breaking up, we were staring down the most treacherous road of the entire trip: Mozambique’s Tete corridor, where a conflict that had claimed thousands of lives was reawakening. Some people had just been ambushed, the motel manager told us. “By who?” I asked. He just shrugged. “Bandits? Rebels? Rogue police officers?” It was all the same to him. “And from Inchope to Save,” he said offhandedly, mentioning two towns on our map. “Meu Deus,” he said, closing his eyes. “That’s even worse. ” The next morning my wife, Courtenay, and our sons jumped into our truck. “Roll ’em up, lock ’em up,” I said as we swung out of the parking lot. We headed down a long, bright highway by ourselves. I’d told Robert that we would meet him in Cape Town, though who knew if either of us would actually make it. Cape Town was still nearly 2, 000 miles away. This odyssey  —   driving across the bottom half of Africa, without any firm plans  —   started out as a lark. We were at a birthday party at Robert’s house at the time, (which was late last year) we all lived in Nairobi, Kenya. During the festivities, Robert abruptly turned down the music and called everyone outside. He has worked all over the world for the United Nations and other international organizations and speaks about 38 languages. You know what military officers call “command presence”? Well, Robert has it in spades: tall, handsome, confident, topped by a wicked crest of pure white hair. He also has an awesome smile. The instant he told everyone to go outside, I knew what he was up to. He was going to give his wife a car, and I could tell from the glint in his eye that this was as much a selfie gift as anything. Stepping into the driveway, everyone gasped and started laughing: He had bought her an old green Land Rover Defender, the ultimate safari vehicle, and wrapped it in Christmas lights adorned with Chinese lanterns. Maybe we had all had a little too much to drink, but in the glow of the moment I swung my arm around Robert’s back and mumbled, with Champagne breath: “With a car like that, you can’t just drive to the mall. Hey, man. Why don’t we drive to Cape Town?” Of course, we could have flown to Cape Town. But we were all hopelessly smitten by the historical, romantic and mystical experience of traveling Africa overland: covering all of that beautiful countryside, savoring the long distances, losing time, not just passing through landscapes but being absorbed by them. I think each of us was also a bit worn down by the rigors of our jobs and of being mommies and daddies to young children. We believed, perhaps naïvely, that turning our Christmas vacation into a challenge could rejuvenate us. It was the most ambitious road trip any of us had ever planned: 4, 250 miles one way, 16 days, six countries, five young children, four hardheaded adults and two questionable trucks. “Sounds like a bad Christmas carol,” Courtenay muttered. To be honest, she was never into it. Most areas we intended to pass through in Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and South Africa were relatively safe for drivers, northern Mozambique being the one question mark. But it wasn’t as though we had AAA for back up. You break down in rural Malawi or back roads Tanzania, where there aren’t any spare parts or much transport, and you might as well get comfortable for a week. And our truck was no spring chicken. It was a Nissan Patrol, sturdy as heck but 11 years old and with more than 100, 000 miles and a few rattles. This all might sound risky, maybe even reckless, but I’ve lived in East Africa for more than a decade and felt comfortable traveling here, knowing the region was more accessible than most people appreciate. As the   date approached, our mountain of gear stupidly grew. (When you take a road trip, you’re the worst packer. You think: “Oh, yeah. We’ll have all the room in the world.) Soon we were running out of space in our operational staging area. Our guest room was heaped with mosquito nets, tarps, sleeping bags, bed rolls, tin dishes, flats of water, a monstrous medical kit containing everything from malaria prophylaxis to Tums, copies of our passports, visas and this thing called a “Carnet de Passages,” a very   customs document that allows you to cross borders in your own vehicle. We’d also packed too many clothes, a satellite transmitter, spark plugs, granola, nuts, fuses, boxed milk, an air pump, a tow rope and seven packages of Huggies, for the long rides. Little did we know that within a few days, in Malawi, we would enter the dominion of Shoprite, a South African chain, where we could have bought many of these supplies if we had actually needed them. As we pulled out of our driveway, car stuffed, I looked up to see dark clouds and bright sunshine, the dramatic, schizophrenic lighting that often illuminates Nairobi’s equatorial skies. We passed zebras in Kajiado, an area that used to be rural but in the frenzied urbanization of Nairobi in the last 10 years is now more like a suburb. By midday, we reached the Tanzanian border. We spent the next hour and a half waiting in lines, to get our passports stamped, to get our yellow fever cards checked, to show our Carnet de Passages. Then we were free, out on the road again chugging past trucks with inspirational messages emblazoned on their backsides such as “Love Your Enemies. ” We crossed into Tanzania that same day, and the landscape immediately opened up: lush, green savanna unrolling from the sides of the highway. We passed through a string of villages, each specializing in a particular commodity. In the first, everyone along the road sold chickens. In the next, eggs. The village after that, oranges. We motored through spiky sisal fields that ran for miles and miles and ended in a town where dozens of people were selling wooden   stools  —   they were actually carving them along the road, flakes of wood shavings littering the highway’s shoulders  —   being gently stirred by the wind of our passing wheels. In rural Africa the economy isn’t hidden, as it is in the United States. You drive right through it. Robert was right behind me as I took a curve, perhaps a little fast. Ahead, I saw a man in a white uniform step out from under a mango tree into the road. Shoot. A police officer. He had his arm up, which meant stop. In eastern Africa, most traffic officers don’t have guns, radios or cars. You could blow past them and probably never get in trouble. It’s essentially an honor system: You stop because it’s the right thing to do. The officer sauntered up to my window with a black plastic object that I could have sworn was an old hair dryer. It was actually a radar gun, one that looked like it belonged in “Smokey and the Bandit. ” I had been speeding, he said. I don’t think the radar gun even had batteries, but I knew the game. In East Africa, it’s called “kitu kidogo,” “a little something” in Swahili  —   a euphemism for a bribe. You have to always let them make the first move. “Do you know the fine?” the officer asked. Earnestly, I told him I did not. “Twenty thousand shillings,” he said. “But,” he smiled, “if you don’t need a receipt, I make it 10. ” Who was I to argue? Soon we were whizzing past baboons shrieking from trees. Our boys kept a running tally of all the animals we saw: monkeys, giraffes, zebras, ostriches, gazelles, antelope, warthogs, even elephants. Tanzania is rightly celebrated for its wildlife. If we’d had the time  —   which we didn’t  —   we could have gone from national park to national park and made our drive one endless safari. We did camp one night next to Mikumi National Park, home to all the big wildlife species. The   Lodge was perfect: a clean spot for tents, showers and a nearby restaurant, $7 for each adult, free for children. A few bites into dinner, I could tell that the food  —   burgers, chips and roast chicken  —   was fresh and had been made with care. As we bedded down, I heard lions grunting in the distance. Or maybe it was just Robert snoring in the tent next to me. “Man, never in my life did I think I’d be here,” Robert said, smiling in the doorway of a border town barbershop where we went looking to change money. “Malawi was always distant in my memory, like this little country lost in the middle of Africa. ” One of the most pleasant African countries, Malawi is also one that Western tourists rarely visit. It is small, green, landlocked and friendly. Never aggressively colonized like Kenya or South Africa, its raison d’être is the lake. Lake Malawi is home to a thousand kinds of fish, more than any other lake in the world. It’s a beautiful place to swim and snorkel, with little industry or pollution. Scientists say you can catch bilharzia, an infection caused by a parasitic worm, but the risks are minimal along isolated beaches, where most tourists tend to go. As soon as we crested a hill and for the first time spotted Lake Malawi sunning itself, Courtenay said: “Can I sit in a beach chair just once on this trip? Is that asking too much?” Robert and company supplied the answer: Butterfly Space, a small   on Nkhata Bay. It sounded amazing, from the guidebooks: “spacious beachfront,” “picturesque beauty,” an “oasis. ” We booked it from the road, calling just a few hours ahead. We did that a lot, conducting a little internet research the night before or flicking through a guidebook, which gave us flexibility, because we didn’t know how far we would get each day. We rolled in at night, always a   in the dark it’s hard to tell what you’re getting. A guard steered us to a campsite that smelled of dog poop. As I was helping Robert set up his tent, I noticed garbage strewed everywhere. But I didn’t want to sound negative about a place he had picked, so I kept my mouth shut. “Hey, mon. ” It was a voice from the bushes. “Uh, yeah?” I answered, looking around. A young man stepped out, dreadlocked and  . “Name’s Happy. ” “Happy what?” Robert growled. Robert and I hadn’t eaten for hours, and the two of us were dangerously crabby. We just wanted to get the tents up and find some food. “Happy Coconut, mon,” the young man answered. “Happy Coconut. I’m soooo happy. ” Robert shook his head and whispered, “I think the guy writing the guidebook was high when he passed through here. ” Butterfly Space slithered with tattooed travelers smelling of patchouli oil and Malawi Gold (the cheap and potent local ganja). We weren’t prudes, but it didn’t seem to be the ideal family spot. The next morning we hit the road. We tended to drive about 10 hours a day, starting around 8 a. m. and by dusk we would find a small hotel or guesthouse, usually for no more than $50, sometimes for as little as $10. Road trips are as much about what is happening inside the car as out. Our collective brood, all boys between ages 4 and 7, did surprisingly well, napping, looking out the windows and pulling each other’s hair only occasionally. The roads were tarmac all through Malawi and Tanzania. The only problem was gas. Malawi has few fuel stations, and I ran out twice, rescued by Robert. I think our best day of the entire trip was shortly before we split up. We had treated ourselves to a classy old whitewashed hotel, the Sunbird Livingstonia Beach Hotel, on Salima Bay. It wasn’t even that expensive, around 90, 000 Kwacha a night, or about $125, and we took the day off from driving to swim in the   lake and get tossed around by the waves. I didn’t want to leave. But Robert and his team hadn’t signed up for a beach holiday, and driving all the way to Cape Town had been my great idea, after all. When we told the room steward that we had to go, he shook his head wistfully. “It’d be great to see other countries, see how other people live,” he said, folding a sheet. “In Malawi, everyone’s born in Malawi. They live in Malawi. They die in Malawi. They don’t see anything else. ” The instant we crossed the border, it felt as though we were in a different place. This is a huge benefit of arriving in a new country by land. You immediately get a sense of its development, its atmosphere, its spirit, which is hard to do in an antiseptic international airport. One of the few former Portuguese colonies in Africa (most of the continent was grabbed up by France or England) Mozambique has a palpable Latin vibe. The storefront colors were zanier, the clothes tighter, the music louder. As we cruised through a tiny village blasting salsa, Courtenay turned to me and asked, “Is this country deaf?” We were without comrades now. We had emerged unscathed from the scorched wastes of Tete and were flying downhill toward the legendary Praia do Bilene beach, on Mozambique’s southern coast. When we pulled in, I couldn’t even hear Courtenay’s yelling which way to go because of the roar of motorcycle engines. Young South Africans raced around on Ninja bikes, shirtless or in bikinis. We discovered that Mozambique during Christmas is a bit of a South African colony. After getting the keys to a rundown rondoval at a seaside hotel, we scampered to the beach, to sand that sparkled  —   but not in the way you might imagine. It was the day after New Year’s. Thousands of beer bottles lay at the water’s edge, as though they had been vomited up by the sea. The place was a pigsty, but our boys loved it, collecting dozens of dirty bottles and making giant bottle castles. In Kenya, you’d never see that. Poor people would have been all over that beach, scooping up the empties to make money from recycling. Courtenay and I found the whole scene depressing and consoled ourselves with heaping plates of rice, pãozinho (Portuguese rolls) and shrimp so succulent and tasty that even the boys  —   who usually flee at the sight of anything unusual on their plates, especially if that unusual thing has eyes  —   gobbled it up. But our clock was ticking. Robert was somewhere out there, chugging his way south. Though we’d had our disagreements, I missed seeing that dark green Land Rover behind me. As we hustled toward the Swaziland border, a wall of brown, stubbly mountains rising before us, I guess I started to zone out. I didn’t see her until it was too late. A corpulent police officer stepped out from under a tree. That was always their strategy: Hang out in the shade and wait for a victim. It was the equivalent of the American patrol officer on a motorcycle hiding behind a billboard. She walked into the road, arm up. When I pulled over, she fanned her face. “Que calor, que calor,” she said. (How hot.) “Indeed,” I responded. She asked for my license. I gave it to her. She asked for my insurance. I gave her that as well (a special Mozambican policy covering who knows what that I had spent $60 on at the border). She frowned. The boys stirred in the back seat, as she made a leisurely loop around the truck. She returned to my window. “You pay fine,” she said. “For what?” I asked. Her eyes darted around. “Baby no have seatbelt. ” “What? He just took it off. We’ve been stopped for three minutes. ” “Baby no seatbelt. We go police station Matola. ” “Matola?” I said incredulously. “Isn’t that an hour away?” “Then pay fine here,” she said, staring into my face. “Three hundred meticals. ” After I handed it over, she waved happily goodbye. The Kingdom of Swaziland is a strange little place: population 1. 4 million per capita income $8, 500, not bad by   standards and one of the world’s lowest life expectancies, at 52 years. AIDS destroyed this place, possibly because it is a country in between. In Africa, transit points have become H. I. V. hot zones   truckers are some of the worst culprits for spreading the virus. Swaziland’s roads were good, its landscape barren and windswept. We drove end to end in 2 hours 48 minutes 7 seconds. By the time we reached South Africa, we had six days of vacation left and more than 1, 000 miles to go. I had visited South Africa nearly a dozen times, but I had never driven the country. The landscape was dreamy: rippling green hills, tall trees and miles and miles of farms and vineyards stocked with grapes so plump and juicy, you just wanted to pull over and pluck them. I found myself asking: “How did this happen? How did South Africa get all the good land?” We caught one of the most beautiful sunsets I’d ever seen. Over the west side of the N2 highway, fingers of light reached into a cool, dark forest. We made three stops on the way to Cape Town, our favorite being St. Lucia, a   town sporting carpets of crab grass for front lawns. It felt like Boca Raton, Fla. except for the   hippos lumbering through the neat little streets at night. Set in a large estuary filled with life, St. Lucia is a great place for a boat tour to see hippos and crocodiles, which we enjoyed, booking through Hornbill House, the    where we stayed. We were all eager to get to Cape Town, arguably one of the world’s most stunning cities. Our boys were excited to see the penguins at the Simon’s Town penguin colony. I was ready to stop driving. Courtenay just wanted the trip to end. As we curved around a mountain near the penguins, bubbling with the sense of triumph at having made it, a familiar green Land Rover hurtled toward us. I tooted madly. We pulled over and hugged, a lot, in a parking lot. It was great to see Robert, his wife and their children, and we were sorry that we hadn’t been able to stay together the whole time. But we had adventures to share and the children were talking fast: “We saw crocodiles!” “Well, we saw a castle!” I wished I had seen more. Driving across Africa was far more doable than I expected: The roads were safe, the border crossings not too hellish, and it was no sweat booking hotels by cellphone on the fly. But we should have taken two months, not two weeks. Then we could have explored more wildlife parks, slipped off the main roads and lingered in small, charming towns, as opposed to getting up at the crack of dawn and strapping in again. Robert, God bless him, arranged for two couples to fly to Cape Town and drive our vehicles back to Nairobi, because they wanted to have the same road trip experience. On that final Sunday, we loaded into our trucks one last time and drove to the airport, his truck right behind mine. Then eight hours later, we were all back home.",0

769,Bill Maher Isn’t High on Trump: The State of Free Speech in a New Era - The New York Times,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  —   It was Nov. 12, and Bill Maher was about to begin his comedy act at the City National Civic in San Jose when he did something he hadn’t done in many years. He brought a drink with him to the stage a standup roadie (tequila). “And boy did I miss it,” he joked with me last week. “What an idiot all those years  —   drinking’s fun. You hear that, kids? Drinking’s fun!” Actually, that’s not why he did it, he said during a marathon session of talking and drinking  —   and, in his case, a wee bit of pot smoking  —   that started at his house here and ended several hours later at the nearby Polo Lounge (oh, the indignities of this job). He says he considers drinking on stage unprofessional. But that night, so soon after the election, he needed something to calm his nerves. Donald J. Trump, who Mr. Maher said “lives for vengeance,” had just won control over the most powerful instruments of the government, like the Justice Department, and, more to the point, the F. B. I. And it was dawning on Mr. Maher that “no one’s been meaner to him than me. ” Mr. Maher has a unique perspective. He resides at that most treacherous intersection where free speech meets government power and political passion, dodging traffic from left and right. He also once accused Mr. Trump of being part orangutan by birth. But first, a refresher on how Mr. Maher became a   totem in 2001 with one provocative line on his   ABC show, “Politically Incorrect. ” He said the Sept. 11 hijackers couldn’t be called “cowards,” especially when the United States’ preferred method of attack at the time  —   before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  —   was to lob cruise missiles from afar (“That’s cowardly,” he said). The White House criticized him, sponsors fled and, a few months later, ABC canceled his show. Whatever you might think of his argument, the moment was a dark chapter in the annals of public discourse. It could have been a   too, if HBO hadn’t provided Mr. Maher with safe harbor and a new show, “Real Time,” which has an audience of about 4. 5 million viewers. Yet, Mr. Maher puts that episode within “the normal parameters of awful. ” He says he’s more worried about our new era, when no one knows what “normal” is going to look like. It’s amazing how much anxiety Mr. Trump’s imminent inauguration is stirring in the   business  —   but perhaps not surprising given his open hostility toward the press, his willingness to use his platform against any who cross him and his seemingly proud dismissal of the government and political norms that precede him. No one knows whether a year from now, we’ll see today’s fears as overblown, underblown, or on point. Mr. Maher is taking the    approach based on his own experience in the Trumpian combat caldron in 2013. That was when Mr. Maher launched a “birther” —   or, “ ”  —   campaign about Mr. Trump, to rival the one Mr. Trump had pursued about President Obama’s citizenship. Appearing on “The Tonight Show,’’ he joked that Mr. Trump was the product of   crossbreeding it was the only thing, he said, that would explain the “color of his hair. ” He said he would donate $5 million to a charity of Mr. Trump’s choice if he could prove this wasn’t the case. (Mr. Maher pledged $1 million in 2012 to a “super PAC” supporting Obama.) Mr. Trump’s lawyers replied with a copy of his   birth certificate and a demand for the money, which Mr. Maher ignored. Then Mr. Trump filed a lawsuit that ultimately went nowhere. “It was worth it in comedy material,” Mr. Maher told me, taking a couple of puffs from a pipe molded into a bust of his head (a gift from a friend) as we stood by the bar in his   living room. “But you definitely spent money. ” That is, Mr. Maher had the money to pay for the courage that another comedian may not have been able to afford. He takes it as a harbinger. “No one knows what this man is capable of,” Mr. Maher said. “I never, ever, ever felt worried  —   it never crossed my mind  —   that George Bush would do something crazy, even though I knew he hated me. He never sued me for a joke. ” Mr. Maher was particularly focused on reports that several F. B. I. agents were agitating before the election for more aggressive examination of Hillary Clinton, which Democrats feared was politically motivated to help Mr. Trump. (The Justice Department’s inspector general has announced a broad investigation into the F. B. I. ’s   performance.) “It is a very troubling idea that the F. B. I. is politicized,” he said. “When the internal police department is politicized, that’s a place I don’t want to be on the wrong side of  —   I mean, that’s fascism. ” You could chalk it all up to shticky paranoia, and it’s quite a slippery slope from there to outright fascism. But with so many sharing similar worries (at least among those who didn’t support Mr. Trump) and with Mr. Trump’s continued cage rattling, I turned to Mr. Trump’s adviser, Kellyanne Conway, for a response. It seemed especially fitting because she has been a longtime guest of Mr. Maher’s, dating to the 1990s when he was first blazing the   trail on Comedy Central. Given Mr. Trump’s preference for Twitter, Ms. Conway joked, using the F. B. I. would be “so last century  —   it’s so bureaucratic and paperwork laden. ” Turning more serious, she said, “He’s not going to use the ‘tools of state,’” repeating the wording of my question. I noted that there are, of course, guidelines, professional tenets and laws that are meant to preclude a president’s ability to use federal investigative power as a political weapon, and she agreed, saying “This is America. ” Ms. Conway acknowledged, though, that Mr. Maher’s fears were widely held, especially in Hollywood  —   witness Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes address. “Talk about a Hollywood story  —   folks are unnecessarily flattering themselves to think for two seconds that Donald Trump is going to call out the big dogs to make their lives miserable,” she said. She described some of the discomfort as a natural reaction by “the elites” to an incoming president who is merely responding to their continued attacks. “Where’s the respect  —   open ear and open mind? ’’ she said. “The same people who had hoped for and desired and absolutely assumed they were going to get a different election result never laid down their muskets,” she said. It was time, she said, to “take the poison out of the pen and keyboard. ” Mr. Maher has no plans to do that when his show comes back from hiatus on inauguration day, Jan. 20 (his birthday, and Ms. Conway’s). But he shares Ms. Conway’s view of the cultural stakes in the election. “We’re the losers now, so it behooves us to break out of that bubble more,” he said. Mr. Maher said speeches like Ms. Streep’s  —   calling actors, screenwriters and the news media to arms  —   weren’t going to solve anything. “It looks very insular,” he said. “Just the liberals talking to themselves, which they are very good at doing. ” Still the bane of conservatives, Mr. Maher has more recently drawn scorn from liberals for his own diatribes against Islamic extremism, for which he says liberals have too much tolerance. That’s part of what he considers a politically correct corralling of speech from the left. At the same time, his restaurant selection, the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel, came in defiance of a Hollywood boycott that Ellen DeGeneres and Elton John helped start after the sultan of Brunei, whose investment agency owns the hotel, imposed a new penal code in his homeland based on Shariah law, making gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. To join the boycott, Mr. Maher said as we walked through the hotel lobby, would be to submit to an ineffectual form of “tokenism. ” “As if the sultan of Brunei is up there looking at the receipts  —   we only sold two soups? Is Stallone still coming in?” he said. “But Sultan, your harem awaits  —   ‘I’m sorry, I’m still going over the receipts. ’” With that, we took our seats and the waiter approached. Surprised to see Mr. Maher, he asked “You’re not in hiding?” That got Mr. Maher all worked up again. “I can be scared,” he said, “and never pull a punch. ”",0
770,The L.P.G.A. Tour and Donald Trump: It’s Complicated - The New York Times,"Lydia Ko could win her second consecutive ANA Inspiration title this week, or be eclipsed by Michelle Wie winning her first in her 13th career start, and it would still be   for the women in one respect. As the top golfers on the L. P. G. A. Tour compete in their first major tournament of the year, they will be   to ignore the storm clouds gathering in advance of their third, the United States Women’s Open, to be held in July at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N. J. Before Donald J. Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he was the Daddy Warbucks of women’s golf, hosting the top players every year at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla. during the L. P. G. A.’s   ADT Championship at Trump International Golf Club. In 2006, the tournament’s   prize was $1 million, a milestone that the men had reached seven years earlier. In his prepolitics life as a real estate mogul, Trump dispensed business advice to the L. P. G. A. players and invited them to his courses for informal rounds of golf. The women generally accepted his invitations for the same reason they play   events every year with dozens of other golfers, including those who harbor different political and personal beliefs: These people, usually men, sustain the Tour with their support. “Having played in the ADT Championship when it was held at his course in West Palm Beach, I have experienced nothing but good things from him and his golf course,” said Karen Stupples, a reporter for the Golf Channel and NBC who competed in the event in 2004 and 2008. “And I think the L. P. G. A. in general feels that same way, that he was very respectful to the L. P. G. A. to the tournament. ” The picture that L. P. G. A. golfers paint of Trump as a respectful supporter of women stands in stark contrast to the leering,   man caught conversing with Billy Bush during a taping of a 2005 segment for “Access Hollywood” in a video that surfaced shortly before the election. Since Trump became the putative leader of the free world, he has often been seen on the golf course, and for some of those outings, he has reached out to some of the best players in the game to accompany him. The top men and women have accepted invitations to play with him with their eyes wide open. They know that what they see as a social outing will be spun as a political statement  —   and they seem largely not to care. In an anonymous survey I conducted in February of 56 players on the PGA Tour, 50 (or 89 percent) said they would play with Trump if extended an invitation. Three said they would not, and three declined to answer. How would the best women, whose ranks cut across more cultures than the men’s, respond? At the Founders Cup in   the first L. P. G. A. event of the year held in the United States, I conducted an anonymous survey of 40 players.   (or 60 percent) said they would play with Trump, nine said they would not and seven declined to comment. A   joked, “I want to stay in the country so I’ll say yes. ” The women, who ranged in age from under 20 to over 50, represented 12 countries and make their homes in 11 states, including four that voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election. One player, Natalie Gulbis, spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention. Another, the Floridian Lexi Thompson, has played golf with Trump since the election. Ko, the women’s No. 1 from New Zealand, has not played a round with Trump  —   but only because she hasn’t received an invitation. “He’s the leader of one of the biggest countries in the whole entire world,” Ko said, “and it would be an honor if I got that call. ” Ryann O’Toole, an American who was raised in California, said, “I didn’t vote for him and I’ll still play with him. ” Ko is 19. Thompson is 22. O’Toole is 30. Stupples is 43 and the mother of a    son. It is unfair, Stupples said, to expect a consensus on any political issue from a tour membership that includes women under 20 and over 40 and Americans and foreigners. “Lydia and Lexi have both led a very sheltered life,” Stupples said. “They’ve played golf and that’s it. They probably haven’t seen much of what goes on outside of the golf course and a hotel. ” She added: “Would I play golf with him? Probably not. But then that’s me. That’s because I’ve been around the block a few times and seen a few other things. But it’s only because of my life experience that I feel like I can make a good judgment on what I want to do personally. ” The United States Golf Association awarded its flagship women’s event to Trump’s Bedminster course in 2012, when his reputation as an opportunistic outsider came from supporting golf when the economy was cratering and other benefactors were bailing. “He was such a huge fan of the L. P. G. A. and of golf in general,” said Gulbis, who has known Trump since she qualified for her first ADT Championship in 2005. Throughout the years, she said, he has counseled her to fight for the same pay as PGA Tour members for public appearances or sponsorships. “These were constant conversations that I saw him have not just with me, but with lots of people in our organization,” Gulbis said. The United States Women’s Open will not be the first golf major played at a Trump course. The Women’s British Open in 2015 was held at Turnberry, a Scottish resort that Trump bought in 2014, after the tournament had been awarded. In the past few years, some other top golf events have been given to   courses. This year’s Senior P. G. A. Championship will be at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, and the 2022 P. G. A. Championship will be hosted by his Bedminster club. Shaunna Thomas, the   of UltraViolet, a national group assembled to fight sexism and expand women’s rights, said her organization failed to see the upside of any professional women’s sports league aligning itself with Trump. “I’ve been playing golf all my life, I’m very familiar with how deeply ingrained sexism is in the game,” Thomas said in a telephone interview. “It’s upsetting. People who aren’t fans think it’s such an easy decision for the U. S. G. A. and the L. P. G. A. to make to avoid controversy. ” She added: “The question really is, do the U. S. G. A. and L. P. G. A. want to be on the right side of history? If the U. S. G. A. wants to stay relevant to a younger generation of golfers, they’re going to have to take a look at their decision. This is an opportunity to send a clear signal to women, people of color and people with disabilities that they stand on the side of inclusiveness. ” UltraViolet staged a protest on the third day of the Founders Cup, calling for the Women’s Open to be moved from Bedminster or, barring that, for the players to boycott the event. Roughly a dozen people gathered outside the public entrance to Wildfire Golf Club, the tournament site on a Marriott property in Phoenix, and handed out items including “Dump Trump” golf balls before being escorted away by hotel security. The organization also commissioned a plane to fly over the tournament grounds with a banner that read: “LPGA: Take a Mulligan. Dump Sexist Trump. ” On the eve of the protest, the L. P. G. A. one of the world’s oldest women’s professional sports organizations, released a statement that described its mission as creating opportunities “for the best female golfers in the world to showcase their talent” and said, “As a global tour and membership, we try not to let politics get in the way” of such opportunities. The organization added that the U. S. G. A. owns and operates the United States Women’s Open and “we respect and support the decisions made by the U. S. G. A. on this matter. ” The statement did not sit well with Thomas, who grew up in Los Angeles and played golf with her father at Rolling Hills Country Club and Riviera Country Club. Many of the courses she frequented were about as integrated as Trump’s cabinet, which has a smaller percentage of women and minorities than the first cabinets of his four immediate predecessors. “The ladies that play golf shouldn’t be forced to build up the Trump brand in any way,” she said. Judy Rankin, a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame, is discomfited by the notion that the players should allow politics to play through in the most prestigious women’s tournament in the United States. “Back in the dark ages, I did not agree with everything Gerald Ford did,” said Rankin, whose most successful season, 1976, coincided with Ford’s last full year as president. She won six tournaments that year and became the first L. P. G. A. player to surpass $100, 000 in yearly earnings. “I found him to be the most wonderful man, and I certainly played golf with him,” Rankin added. “Because you play golf with them does not necessarily mean you support every single thing they do. But they hold the highest office in the land. And I’m not sure that an invitation to play golf should be answered with a political statement. ”",0
771,"Legend Art Cashin On A Trump Presidency, The New World Order, Gold, Brexit, The Great Depression And Why We Will See Panic","56 Views November 14, 2016 GOLD , KWN King World News 
As the bond market continues to melt down, interest rates rise and the Dollar Index surges above 100, legend Art Cashin gave one of his most important interviews ever to King World News about a Trump presidency, the New World Order, gold, Brexit, the Great Depression, and why we will see panic before the end of the year. 
Eric King: “In Trump’s acceptance speech he said that we are going to have massive infrastructure spending. Is that bearish for gold? I don’t think so.” 
Gold Market Hit As Druckenmiller Sells Art Cashin: “No. That on the face of it would not be a reason to sell gold. One of the things that may have concerned Druckenmiller was not so much your scenario of fiscal spending and building roads and highways, but the fact that despite what the Fed has been doing, the money supply has not been showing any velocity. That’s a topic you and I have discussed time and time again and it’s one of the holdups to gold because if it gets no velocity that’s deflationary. 
In fact, the largest growth in money stock is in cash — green pictures of dead presidents — and that is deflationary because that does not have a lending factor that money in a bank would have. So those are two deflationary trends in money and that tends to weigh a little bit on gold and doesn’t allow it to fulfill its promise that you would expect in a somewhat inflationary period.” 
Eric King: “Victor Sperandeo, a former associate of George Sorors, said to me this will be ‘pure money printing.’ That we are going to print trillions of dollars and build infrastructure — talk about how you view that. Obviously there are going to be jobs created and it will be great for infrastructure, so it will juice the economy, but what are the longer-term ramifications?” 
Art Cashin: “On the face of it, it looks good. As you said, there will be jobs created and there will be improvements in roads and airports and so on. However, the other shoe to fall is that Mr. Trump is also committed to revamping the tax code. And those two things should lead to a massive increase in the deficit. And we are already deeply in debt, so people like Rosenberg and others feel like it will have virtually no impact. 
On the face of it the stimulus program should be great for the economy, but because you are in such a high level of debt it might not work out that way. He and others point out that if fiscal stimulus were the answer then Japan would be the king of the world with all of those bridges to nowhere that they built. Japan spent a lot of money, built up their deficit, and their economy never really turned around.” 
Eric King: “Going back even further than that and looking at the Great Depression, the United States was struggling and then FDR devalued the dollar by revaluing the price of gold higher. Those public works projects then got underway, the massive public works projects that built so much of the infrastructure here in the United States, Art. And that did turn the stock market around. It turned many things around — commodities, etc — but then it rolled over by 1937-1938 and then the war came. Is this infrastructure spending program something that can look good for a little while and then it will just roll over like we saw in 1937-1938?” 
Art Cashin: “It can. And the problem (during the Great Depression) was that the thing didn’t click, as it were. It didn’t lead to the next step. You hire people, you do the road projects, you do whatever, and then you want to see them go out and spend and business begin to borrow and banks to lend. And in ’37 and ’38 that never fully kicked in. U.S. Experiences Second Stock Market Collapse From 1937 To 1938 
You had high government officials, in frustration, go to Congress and testify: “We couldn’t get it started. We just couldn’t get it started.” 
For all of the deficit spending, for all of the government programs, it never fully worked. That’s the fear. Again, if you go back to Japan, clearly they spent trillions of Japanese yen in massive building projects and it never kicked in, it never took over. The people continued to worry and hold onto their money. 
A Worried Public Is Hoarding Cash As I’ve told you before, this whole thing about helicopter money and whatnot, if Bernanke flew over your house and dropped a million dollars in brand new money, and you were so worried that you got up and hid it in the garage until you figured out what the economy was going to do…And that is virtually what has happened to us for the past seven years. 
They have tried all kinds of increases in money supply but it has never kicked in and people are so terrified that they are not spending, and basically, as I said, the large amount of growth was in cash. So they are putting it in the mattress, not even in the bank.” 
Eric King: “Art, for so many years on King World News you have been talking about this lending and spending not kicking in, and you have used that Bernanke analogy over and over again. It’s not normal for you to beat up on a point as much as you have. But earlier you brought up Japan, and then when we covered the Great Depression you discussed 1937-1938, and the the testimonies before Congress from people saying, ‘We just couldn’t get it started.’ Did you know all along that it was going to unfold this way to some degree with the lack of lending and spending? Did you know that from history?” 
Art Cashin: “I had a fear of it and it became pretty evident after some of the first things they (central planners) did. It is not a very difficult game. Every week the Federal Reserve reports the Money Supply and the Federal Reserve of St. Louis reports the Monetary Stock, which is the amount of raw money that the Fed adds in. “We Just Couldn’t Get It Started” – Monetary Stock Plunging 
“That Shouldn’t Be” For a year now, despite all the things you have heard, despite all the programs and ‘pump-priming’ and Yellen and all the doves, the Monetary Stock has not increased all year. That shouldn’t be. 60-Year Velocity Of Money Stock Hitting New Lows 
If money has velocity, then you can see the economy begin to move up. If it gets too much velocity, then you get to see inflation. But so far we are not getting a high dose of either. Although, if you ask somebody standing in the supermarket if they have inflation they might give you a bit of an argument. But by government standards it’s not quite there yet.” 
Eric King: “Along those same lines, Art, you’ve warned repeatedly about Weimar Germany and the experience of the 1920s. This idea that there can be no inflation and then suddenly it just kicks in and then all hell breaks loose. You’ve warned so many time about that. Is that what’s in front of us?” 
Art Cashin: “You will begin to know it. Everybody talks about the Weimar Republic where they actually printed cash money and flooded the system. It wasn’t just the bank reserves — they actually flooded the system with paper money. And amazingly, amazingly, it was a while before that actually kicked in in an inflationary manner. And as you alluded to, I’ve said this time and time again, it’s one of those things like spontaneous combustion — it’s there and it’s there and it’s there and suddenly it bursts into flames. And when it bursts into flames it consumes everything about it. And that’s when you can have a runaway inflation. 
But so far it has not burst into flames. And that is why to even some degree the Fed is frustrated, hoping to get inflation up above 2 percent. And they may be in a position where, be careful what you wish for. Because if they get 2 percent and above it could suddenly combust and things could begin to move rather rapidly.” 
Eric King: “Art, let me ask you this about the Trump presidency. It seems like for those people out there who, as he said, felt lost, the lost Americans, and for those out there who really felt like they were having globalism shoved down their throats in Europe and in the United States, this seemed to be a moment in time where there was going to be some backtracking. The borders were going to be closed, there would be some protectionism — we all know the plusses and minuses of that — but how did you view this Trump election and him becoming president, the idea that the elite got sand kicked in their face and that this New World Order would be slowed down, if only for a moment?” 
Donald Trump’s Shocker And Why Brexit Is Nowhere Near Over Art Cashin: “I view it as yet one more extension of what looks to be a populist revolt that is sweeping the world. You saw the beginning of it with Brexit, and you have too many pundits on TV saying, ‘Well, that ended quickly in reverse.’ Brexit is nowhere near over. But the reason that markets didn’t continue to spiral (downward) is that they realized that Brexit has basically been postponed. They haven’t gone in and declared Article 50. Once they start the process in motion, the consequences of Brexit are going to be there and they are going to be drastic. 
Now, if you take Trump’s election as the second leg of populism, the next thing you look for is the December 4th referendum in Italy. And there’s a good chance that will cause the government to fail and Italy will be right back in the middle of a major European crisis, and we’ll be right back where we were with Greece (only much larger in scale). So this game is far from over and we could see further panic as we head into the end of the year.” 
Eric King: “Ahead of what’s going to happen in Italy, because I think that will unfold as you just predicted, Art, a Trump America going forward and this idea that the elites have been pushing globalism down everybody’s throats with NAFTA and so many things that have happened around the world. The globalism and the push to eliminate national boundaries, we’ve seen that in Europe and of course they had talked about combining Canada, the United States and Mexico into one regional unit. This idea that globalism has taken a huge blow here, is that true? Or did it just slow it down? What will a Trump presidency mean in that sense?” 
“You’re Fired!” Art Cashin: “We’ve got a lot of things to see. Over the next week or two you are going to see whom he appoints to the cabinet and who holds him under their sway. It would appear, however, because of the size of his commitment, he’s got to address globalization and global trade. He’s got to go back and revisit even NAFTA. 
I think some of his early attempts will be reasonably good. He will do some fiscal stimulus, some building and repairing, hopefully getting the tax structure in better order. But that will not be the end of it. He can pivot a bit but he can’t completely abandon it (his campaign promises). People will have to watch what he does. 
Now, he may cleverly hire some people and put burdens on their shoulders. If after six months things don’t work out, he can revert to his TV personality and say, ‘You’re fired,’ to show the American people that he’s staying on top. But for now…KWN encourages everyone around the world to listen to one of legendary Art Cashin’s greatest audio interviews ever discussing the gold market at length, including the recent takedown in gold and what to make of Druckenmiller selling, what to surprises to expect in key markets as Trump becomes president, and what impact massive public works projects will have on the United States, inflation, gold, bonds, and much more, by CLICKING HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW.

772,FL Sheriff: ’Not a Day Goes By That We All Don’t Arrest A Lot of Illegal Aliens’ Who Are ’Preying’ on People - Breitbart,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Polk County, FL Sheriff Grady Judd stated that illegal immigrants committing felonies is a phenomenon that is at an epidemic level “across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. ”  Judd was asked about his prior comments that illegal immigrants committing felonies are an “epidemic. ” He said, “It is at that level across the United States. There’s not a day goes by that we all don’t arrest a lot of illegal aliens that are out here preying on the people in this country. And they’re committing felonies, violent felonies, and they’re trafficking in narcotics. And if that’s not enough, we deport them, they come back, and pick up doing the same thing again. ” He added, “We’re seeing a total[ly] different attitude by Immigration and Customs already. And what we have to do is pick them up, keep them locked up until they’re deported to their home country of origin. And I can tell you this, the community will be safer, less drugs will flow on our streets, and there will be less weapons violence. Every day my detectives go out, and they seek out and arrest people for violating the drug laws. Many of those folks are illegal aliens, here, with guns, posing a specific danger to our deputies, to our law enforcement officers, and to the community. But I have a simple question for those who think there’s a problem with that: Why don’t you take them home with you? Why don’t you rent them a home next door to you? Because you know they’re living next door to somebody in our community, and they’re terrorizing them. ” Judd also stated that he didn’t think what he proposed would result in economic losses, and “The people we arrest, they’re not harvesting any vegetables, or any citrus. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
773,Donald Trump Threatens to Cancel Berkeley Federal Funds After Riots Shut Down Milo Event,"President Donald Trump reacted to the massive rioting at   in response to a scheduled campus speech by Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos. [“If U. C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view  —   NO FEDERAL FUNDS?” Trump wrote on Twitter early Thursday morning.  News of the rioting made cable news last night as students smashed ATMs and bank windows, looted a Starbucks, beat Trump supporters, pepper sprayed innocent individuals, and set fires in the street. Others spray painted the words “Kill Trump” on storefronts. The speech was canceled by   police as security failed. Yiannopoulos was evacuated from the area. “The left is profoundly antithetical to free speech these days, does not want to hear alternative points of view, and will do anything to shut it down,” Yiannopoulos told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in an interview on Wednesday night. “My point is being proven over and over and over again. ”    ",0
774,Концепция записка российского председательства,"Заседание Совета Безопасности от 28 октября 2016
Концепция записка российского председательства Сеть Вольтер | Нью-Йорк (США) | 27 октября 2016 français English Español عربي 中文 Сотрудничество Организации Объединенных Наций с региональными и субрегиональными орга-низациями в поддержании международного мира и безопасности: Организация Договора о коллективной безопасности, Шанхайская организация сотрудничества и Содружество независимых государств В качестве центрального мероприятия председательства Российской Феде-рации в Совете Безопасности планируем организовать 28 октября 2016 года деба-ты на тему «Сотрудничество Организации Объединенных Наций с региональны-ми и субрегиональными организациями в поддержании международного мира и безопасности: Организация Договора о коллективной безопасности, Шанхайская организация сотрудничества и Содружество независимых государств».
Глобальный характер современных вызовов и угроз, формирование коллек-тивных подходов, необходимых для их эффективного преодоления, диктуют необходимость наращивания сотрудничества между Организацией Объединен-ных Наций и региональными и субрегиональными организациями в области под-держания мира и безопасности.
Применительно к Организации Объединенных Наций это прежде всего ее универсальный характер как с точки зрения членства в Организации, так и ее де-ятельности, а также всемирно признанная легитимность. Региональные органи-зации, в свою очередь, зачастую обладают более тонким пониманием ситуации в зоне своей ответственности, а в целом ряде случаев — адаптированными к мест-ным реалиям превентивными и миротворческими механизмами. При этом важно, чтобы деятельность региональных организаций была направлена на поиск мир-ного, политического решения возникающих конфликтных ситуаций.
Именно в этом контексте высокую актуальность имеют регулярные «сверки часов» с основными региональными партнерами Организации Объединенных Наций в вопросах поддержания международного мира и безо-пасности. Так, Совет Безопасности на плановой основе проводит заседания по сотрудничеству с Африканским союзом, Организацией по безопасности и со-трудничеству в Европе, Европейским союзом. В последние годы проводился об-зор взаимодействия с Лигой арабских государств, Ассоциацией государств Юго-Восточной Азии, Союзом южноамериканских наций и другими «регионалами».
Как известно, сотрудничество между всемирной Организацией и регио-нальными партнерами включает в себя все более широкий круг проблем. K миро-творческим и миростроительным задачам добавились противодействие распро-странению оружия массового уничтожения и незаконным потокам легкого и стрелкового оружия, борьба c кибертерроризмом и нелегальной миграцией — области, где сотрудничество между рассматриваемыми организациями и Органи-зацией Объединенных Наций набирает обороты. Это имеет ключевое значение в плане поддержания мира и стабильности на широком пространстве Евразии, и в особенности в Центральноазиатском регионе.
Именно в этой сфере активны три относительно молодые организации, дей-ствующие в огромном регионе от Восточной Европы до Дальнего Востока: Орга-низация Договора о коллективной безопасности (ОДКБ), Шанхайская организа-ция сотрудничества (ШОС) и Содружество независимых государств (СНГ), — которые наращивают свой политический авторитет в мире и вносят большой вклад в укрепление региональной и международной безопасности.
В фокусе внимания в ходе дебатов будет вклад ОДКБ, ШОС и СНГ в проти-водействие угрозам миру и безопасности в регионе, в том числе в борьбу с тер-роризмом, наркотрафиком и организованной преступностью. Мероприятие также позволит подтвердить нацеленность этих трех объединений на развитие практи-ческого взаимодействия с Организацией Объединенных Наций, в том числе с ее Региональным центром по превентивной дипломатии для Центральной Азии.
ОДКБ — это многовекторная структура, способная уверенно реагировать на широкий спектр современных вызовов и угроз, с которыми могут столкнуться ее государства-члены. В этой связи перспективным видится углубление взаимодей-ствия между Организацией Объединенных Наций и ОДКБ в области миротворче-ства. В рамках ОДКБ ведется интенсивная работа по развитию собственного ми-ротворческого потенциала, в том числе для задействования в операциях Органи-зацией Объединенных Наций по поддержанию мира. Наряду c этим ОДКБ актив-но содействует международным усилиям по постконфликтному обустройству Афганистана, купированию исходящей c территории этой страны наркоугрозы.
Ее отношения с Организацией Объединенных Наций успешно развиваются по целому ряду направлений: противодействие терроризму и наркотрафику, ми-ротворчество, борьба с организованной преступностью. Поддерживаются и раз-виваются продуктивные контакты с профильными ооновскими структурами, включая Контртеррористический комитет Совета Безопасности и Управление Организации Объединенных Наций по наркотикам и преступности.
Каждые два года Генеральной Ассамблеей принимается резолюция о со-трудничестве Организации Объединенных Наций с ОДКБ. Подобную резолюцию планируется принять на семьдесят первой сессии Ассамблеи в рамках обсужде-ния пункта ее повестки дня, озаглавленного «Сотрудничество между Организа-цией Объединенных Наций и региональными и другими организациями».
Правовая база взаимодействия между Организацией Объединенных Наций и ШОС по вопросам международного мира и безопасности в соответствии с гла-вой VIII Устава Организации Объединенных Наций была заложена после подпи-сания в 2010 году совместной декларации о сотрудничестве между секретариа-тами двух организаций. В настоящее время между ШОС и Организацией Объ-единенных Наций налажено активное сотрудничество в таких областях, как предотвращение и урегулирование конфликтов, борьба с терроризмом (в этих це-лях в рамках ШОС действует Региональная антитеррористическая структура), нераспространение оружия массового уничтожения, противодействие транснаци-ональной преступности и незаконному обороту наркотиков, обеспечение между-народной информационной безопасности.
В данном контексте ШОС активно поддерживает усилия мирового сообще-ства и институтов Организации Объединенных Наций по восстановлению мира в Афганистане, последовательно выступает за сохранение центральной координи-рующей роли этой универсальной организации в процессе афганского урегули-рования.
Сотрудничество в обеспечении безопасности, противодействии современ-ным вызовам и угрозам всегда являлось и остается одной из приоритетных обла-стей интеграционного взаимодействия государств — членов СНГ.
Важным фактором активного противодействия возникающим угрозам явля-ется также конструктивное взаимодействие с международными организациями. Государства СНГ являются участниками всех важнейших международных доку-ментов, регулирующих сотрудничество в сфере обеспечения безопасности, разоружения, противодействия современным вызовам и угрозам, вносят реаль-ный вклад в их осуществление.
Совместные меры осуществляются с учетом ведущей роли Организации Объединенных Наций, необходимости развития конструктивного партнерства с другими международными институтами и их специализированными структура-ми, такими как Контртеррористический комитет, Управление по наркотикам и преступности, Международная организация уголовной полиции (Интерпол), Международная организация по миграции, Управление Верховного комиссара Организации Объединенных Наций по делам беженцев, Группа разработки фи-нансовых мер борьбы с отмыванием денег.
Как представляется, дальнейшее расширение и углубление взаимодействия Организации Объединенных Наций с ОДКБ, ШОС и СНГ на базе главы VIII Устава играет конструктивную роль в продвижении целей всемирной Организа-ции, включая преодоление современных вызовов и угроз. При этом, с одной сто-роны, эти региональные организации должны активно позиционировать себя с точки зрения задействования своего потенциала в интересах Организации Объ-единенных Наций. C другой — самой Организации Объединенных Наций следу-ет продолжать уделять необходимое внимание наращиванию координации и вза-имодействия c данными объединениями при строгом соблюдении прерогатив всемирной Организации и ее Совета Безопасности.
В этом контексте мы хотели бы предложить государствам — членам Орга-низации Объединенных Наций изложить собственное видение путей укрепления безопасности региона Евразии с опорой на имеющиеся региональные механиз-мы. Очевидно, что стабильность в этом макрорегионе станет фундаментом для экономического роста и государственного строительства стран Евразии; поэтому мы были бы признательны за соображения делегаций, в том числе и в плане увязки безопасности и развития. Убеждены, что здесь, в рамках всемирной Орга-низации, обладающей универсальной легитимностью, нам сообща будет по си-лам предложить инновационные подходы к вопросам стабилизации уязвимых ре-гионов, которые впоследствии могут быть применены и к другим частям плане-ты, находящимся в поле зрения Совета Безопасности.
В качестве докладчиков на дебатах выступят Генеральный секретарь Организации Объединенных Наций Пан Ги Мун, Генеральный секретарь ОДКБ Н. Н. Бордюжа, Генеральный секретарь ШОС Р. К. Алимов и заместитель Пред-седателя Исполнительного комитета СНГ С. И. Иванов. К участию в заседании приглашаются государства — члены вышеупомянутых региональных организа-ций и представители других заинтересованных государств.",0
775,"Bill Herz, Last of ‘War of the Worlds’ Broadcast Crew, Dies at 99 - The New York Times","Bill Herz, the last surviving crew member of Orson Welles’s mock “War of the Worlds” newscast, which terrified American radio listeners in 1938 with vivid bulletins warning Newark residents to evacuate as invading Martians incinerated central New Jersey, died on May 10 in Manhattan. He was 99. The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Bill Kux, a cousin. Mr. Herz, who worked on other radio and theater productions as stage manager and casting director for Welles’s Mercury Theater company, staked one additional claim to fame. Until about six months ago, he had been a regular customer at Sardi’s restaurant, the   gathering place for celebrities and   tourists in the theater district, for some 82 years  —   beginning in 1933, just six years after it opened. That longevity alone distinguished him as a bon vivant in a shrinking cadre of original Broadway personalties. But he was also singled out periodically in the wider world as a relic of a bygone era, when a bogus radio news broadcast could provoke panic as war was brewing in Europe  —   however much that hysteria may have been overstated then and since. Welles’s CBS show “The Mercury Theater on the Air” presented an adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel “The War of the Worlds” for its Halloween episode on Sunday, Oct. 30, 1938. The live hourlong program began with an updated prelude to the original novel eerily warning that superintelligent beings had been coveting “this Earth with envious eyes. ” Then music, a weather report and other regular features were interrupted by simulated news bulletins and fake feeds from   operators in the field. Mr. Herz, playing Operators Three and Five, took part in this exchange: Operator Three: This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     This is Newark, New Jersey.   …     Warning! Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes. Reaches South Street. Gas masks useless. Urge population to move into open spaces.   …     Automobiles use Routes 7, 23, 24.   …     Avoid congested areas. Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.   …     Operator Four: 2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling CQ   …     2X2L   …     calling 8X3R   …     Come in, please.   …     Operator Five: This is 8X3R   …     coming back at 2X2L. Operator Four: How’s reception? How’s reception? K, please. (Pause.) Where are you, 8X3R? What’s the matter? Where are you? John Houseman, Welles’s producer, wrote in his 1972 memoir, “ ”: “Our actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than 40 minutes. During that time men traveled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted it  —   emotionally if not logically. ” (Mr. Houseman went on to a distinguished career in theater and Hollywood.) Mr. Herz also read Welles’s part, that of a Professor Pierson at a New Jersey observatory, during rehearsals. He said he was surprised by the public’s response to the radio show. “During the broadcast, outside, policemen were coming,” he told CBS News in 2013. “They were told on the radio that the Martians were coming, the Martians were coming!” (Later scholarship about the incident suggested that the broadcast provoked far less fear among the public than has been popularly portrayed.) In a 2010 profile in The New York Times, Mr. Herz was quoted as saying: “I had done Orson’s part in the dress rehearsal, and after I did it, I thought to myself, ‘Nobody’s going to believe this in a million years.’ Boy, was I wrong. ” William Herz Jr. was born in Detroit on Aug. 2, 1916, the son of Harold William Herz, a girdle salesman, and the former Fannie Lichtig. (Bill Herz called himself Jr. even though he wasn’t one.) He graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh before moving to New York. He was briefly married to Susanne Guettel, whose brother Henry was a producer and film executive. No immediate family members survive. Mr. Herz had met Welles in Pittsburgh, where Welles, a young director at the time, had stopped while touring with a production of “Romeo and Juliet. ” They discovered that they had a common acquaintance in the actress Edith Meiser, a friend of Mr. Herz’s parents. Mr. Herz started working for Welles as a gofer. He later moved into Welles’s Manhattan home  —   Mr. Herz had been living with an aunt in Brooklyn  —   so that he could constantly be on call. They worked together on “Julius Caesar,” “The Cradle Will Rock” and “Too Much Johnson. ” Mr. Herz joined the Army Air Forces during World War II, managed a summer theater in Connecticut and produced and managed several plays in New York (including a few flops, one inauspiciously titled “The Strangler Fig”). After one failure, Vincent Sardi Sr. the founder of Sardi’s, generously invited him to keep an open tab in good times and bad. Another advantage to eating there was that Mackey’s Ticket Agency next door, where Mr. Herz later worked, had no restroom. Ivan Lesica, Sardi’s maître d’hôtel, said on Thursday that Mr. Herz would eat there once or twice a week and sit at Table Four, to the left of the dining room entrance, under his caricature. He would have coffee delivered in his own white mug, and typically order the chicken potpie or, appropriately enough for an habitué whom his cousin described as a confirmed curmudgeon, the crab meat sandwich.",0
776,Gary Johnson Equates Syria Deaths Caused by Assad and West - The New York Times,"Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, drew a parallel on Wednesday between the Syrian government’s targeting of noncombatants in that nation’s civil war and the accidental bombing of civilians by United   forces. Attacking Hillary Clinton over what he criticized as her overly interventionist instincts, Mr. Johnson pointed to the hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians killed by forces loyal to President Bashar   as well as civilian deaths caused by the   coalition, and said Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, bore at least partial responsibility. But when pressed four times on whether he saw a moral equivalence between deaths caused by the United States, directly or indirectly, and mass killings of civilians by Mr. Assad and his allies, Mr. Johnson made clear that he did. “Well no, of course not  —   we’re so much better than all that,” Mr. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said sarcastically. “We’re so much better when in Afghanistan, we bomb the hospital and 60 people are killed in the hospital. ” The remarks by Mr. Johnson came in an interview with The New York Times after a string of damaging stumbles when he has fielded questions about foreign affairs. After failing to recognize the   Syrian city of Aleppo during a television interview Sept. 8, Mr. Johnson had another difficult moment on Sept. 28, when he vainly tried to name a foreign leader whom he admired. In the Times interview on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson conspicuously sought to avoid another misstep. Asked if he knew the name of North Korea’s leader, Mr. Johnson replied, “I do. ” “You want me to name” the person, he said, then paused, before adding dryly, “Really. ” But he declined to supply the name. Mr. Johnson complained that Mrs. Clinton was being judged on her base of knowledge rather than her interventionist instincts. “Because Hillary Clinton can dot the i’s and cross the t’s on geographic leaders, of the names of foreign leaders,” he said, “the underlying fact that hundreds of thousands of people have died in Syria goes by the wayside. ” He charged that Mrs. Clinton “bears responsibility for what’s happened, shared responsibility for what’s happened in Syria. I would not have put us in that situation from the  . ” More than 400, 000 people have been killed in the Syrian civil war, according to the United Nations. But Mr. Johnson complained that presidential candidates were expected to talk tough about dealing with dictators like Mr. Assad or risk losing support. “This is what happens in this country right now  —   unless you’re willing to say that you’re going to get tough on this stuff, on these atrocities  —   and these atrocities are horrible  —   but unless you as a politician are willing to do something about these atrocities then we’re not going to elect you,” Mr. Johnson said. Mr. Johnson speculated about the deals or promises that the Obama administration may have dangled before   forces, but then said at other points that he was at a disadvantage discussing world events because he has not received the classified briefings that the Democratic and Republican nominees for president have been given. Mr. Johnson also declined to say whether his running mate, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, had warned him of his intention to change course and spend the remainder of the presidential campaign attacking Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, as unqualified. Mr. Weld revealed those plans in an interview with The Boston Globe on Tuesday. “That may be his primary mission,” Mr. Johnson said of Mr. Weld’s plans. “We’re not scripted at all. And so I guess my role will be Hillary and his role will be Donald Trump. ” But he insisted that Mr. Weld would not drop out at any point and endorse Mrs. Clinton. “Absolutely,” Mr. Johnson said when asked if Mr. Weld would fight on until Nov. 8. Mr. Johnson said that the idea of hunkering down and trying to make an aggressive play to win his home state of New Mexico, where polls show him in contention, had crossed his mind. But he conceded that his chances of winning outright were all but gone. “Right now it’s a Hail Mary, not being in the presidential debates,” he said.",0
777,Republican Senators Bill to Defund UN Over Anti-Israel Resolution,"On Thursday, Republican Senators Ted Cruz ( ) and Lindsey Graham ( ) introduced legislation that would defund the United Nations over the Security Council’s passage of UN Resolution 2334, which calls Israeli construction in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem “illegal. ”[The “Safeguard Israel Act” states that the U. S. government will be prohibited from giving any money to the UN, or any of its affiliates, until President Barack Obama confirms the UN resolution has been repealed and can certify that he has done so. America provides the UN with 22 percent of its budget, contributing $8 billion to the largely   organization annually.  “United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 falsely claims that Israel’s sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and Jewish communities in the West Bank are illegal under international law, and that the Old City of Jerusalem, along with the Temple Mount, the holiest site for the Jewish people, and the Western Wall are ‘occupied Palestinian territory,’” the Safeguard Israel Act states. The  December 23   resolution 2334 passed nearly unanimously despite the Obama administration’s decision to break with tradition and abstain from voting instead of vetoing it. Because the United States is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, an American veto would have automatically stopped the resolution and prevented it from passing. “President Obama betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by permitting the passage of a biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally,” Sen. Cruz said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Thursday morning. “The Security Council’s resolution is only the latest example of the UN’s long history of obsessive hostility towards Israel. ” Sen. Graham said, “I begged the UN months before, don’t put me in this box. I think most Americans believe the United Nations has become more   more  . ” He added, “I’m a big internationalist, but we’re gonna stop the money until we get this fixed. ” The Safeguard Israel Act also notes that during his final address to the UNSC on December 16, outgoing UN   Ban   admitted UN bias against Israel when he stated, “Decades of political maneuverings have created a disproportionate volume of resolutions, reports, and conferences criticizing Israel. ” The legislation adds, the “United Nations passes more resolutions condemning Israel than any other country in the world. ” Last week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on a   vote objecting to the Security Council vote. Despite strong bipartisan support for the measure, at least 75 Democrats and four Republicans voted against it many of the opposing Democrats accused Republicans of introducing HR 11 to attack Obama unfairly in the last two weeks of his presidency. Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( ) Rep. David Price ( ) and Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) were among Democrats to vote against HR 11. Follow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter and Periscope @AdelleNaz,  ",0
779,"Rose Evansky, a Pioneer in Women’s Hairstyling, Dies at 94 - The New York Times","Rose Evansky, a British hairdresser who liberated women from the prison of the   domed dryer when she invented   styling at her London salon in the early 1960s, died on Nov. 21. She was 94. Her death was reported only recently by the British news media. There was no information on where she died. Mrs. Evansky, a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany, set up as a hairstylist soon after World War II. She and her hairdresser husband, Albert, opened a small shop in Hendon, a London suburb, and did so well that, in 1954, they moved to Mayfair, where the city’s elite paid top money for    styling. One day in 1962, as she faced a tedious morning of chemical   and tight curling, tasks she disliked, inspiration struck. “I’d been wandering past a barbershop in Brook Street around the corner from our salon in North Audley Street, and I saw the barber drying the front of a man’s hair with a brush and a   dryer,” she told W magazine in 2012. “And this image  —   of the barber with the dryer  —   flashed through my mind and I thought, ‘Why not for women? ’” She experimented on one of her clients, a Mrs. Hay. “I picked up a spiky plastic hairbrush and a hand dryer and started rolling a wet section of her hair around the brush, followed by warm air from the hand dryer held in my left hand,” she wrote in a memoir, “In Paris We Sang” (2013). “The more sections of wet hair I rolled over the brush, the easier it became, and soon part of Mrs. Hay’s curly hair looked smooth, as if it had been brushed through from a set. Exciting!” One day by chance, Lady Clare Rendlesham, the editor of the British edition of Vogue, dropped by the salon and, witnessing a   in progress, stopped dead in her tracks. “What are you doing, Rose?” Mrs. Evansky recalled her shouting. Lady Clare immediately tipped off her friend Barbara Griggs, the fashion editor of The Evening Standard, who came in to behold the soft and flowing   style. That afternoon, the newspaper trumpeted the news of “the blow wave” to its readers. “This instantly earned her a reputation as one of the top hairdressers in London and went on to become the norm in hair drying,” Hairdressers Journal International wrote in 2012, celebrating the industry’s pioneers. Mrs. Evansky took quiet pride in getting women out from under the sizzling heat of the dome, and in the durability of her invention. “I always look at the prices of hairdressers now, and I say, my God, it’s still there: ‘’” she told an interviewer for the beauty brand Space NK in 2013. “How wonderful, 50 years later. ” She was born Rosel Lerner on May 30, 1922, in Worms, south of Frankfurt. Her parents were immigrants from Poland. In 1938, when the family was living in Ludwigshafen, her father was arrested and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Speaking only German and Yiddish, she was sent to Britain on one of the last Kindertransport trains that carried Jewish children out of Germany. She lived briefly with a family in Dudley, in the West Midlands, before moving to London, just in time for the Blitz. There, she apprenticed for a barber in Whitechapel, and distinguished herself with her zeal. “I worked and practiced till late at night on anyone who’d let me get at their hair,” she wrote in her memoir. As World War II raged, she embarked on her career, finding work at a salon near Regent Street. In 1943, she married Albert Evansky. When their marriage ended in divorce, her husband bought her share of the business. He sold it in the early 1980s. What Florence was to painting and sculpture during the Renaissance, Mayfair was to the art of hairstyling in the 1950s and ’60s. Mrs. Evansky sat atop the heap, the lone woman in a field monopolized by men. In “Vidal: The Autobiography,” Vidal Sassoon called her “without question the top female stylist in the country and the equal of any man. ” Her protégés included Leonard Lewis, known professionally as Leonard of Mayfair, who died on Nov. 30. Mrs. Evansky was in the forefront of the Mayfair style, which emphasized “freedom and movement, rather than contrived waves and curls,” Kim Smith of the University of East London wrote in her doctoral dissertation on West London hair salons. The Mayfair look led directly to the internationally celebrated styles associated with Swinging London and the likes of Jean Shrimpton, Julie Christie and Twiggy, who was a client of Mr. Lewis. In 1965, soon after leaving her husband, Mrs. Evansky married the playwright Denis Cannan, took his last name and moved with him to the countryside in East Sussex. He died in 2011. She is survived by two stepsons, Alexander and Nicholas Cannan a stepdaughter, Crescy Cannan and two  . Her own hair was naturally  . “My hair is best described as ‘windswept,’ as I live near the sea,” she told W magazine. “I’ve never colored it, and I cut it myself. Why would I let anyone else when I can do it myself?”",0

782,Saturated Fat and Heart Disease: “The Greatest Scam in the History of Medicine”,"Saturated Fat and Heart Disease: “The Greatest Scam in the History of Medicine” 
by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News 
Dr. Malcom Kendrick is a Scottish doctor and author of the book The Great Cholesterol Con . 
Recently he wrote a blog post on saturated fat and cardiovascular disease. He commented on how the science actually proves the opposite conclusion from what is commonly believed about saturated fats: 
To be honest, I have studied saturated fat consumption many, many… many, many, times. The one thing that has always stood out, most starkly, is the complete lack of any real evidence to support the idea that it causes cardiovascular disease. 
On the other hand, evidence contradicting it arrives on an almost daily basis. 
Kendrick goes on to quote from a recently published study which showed, in Kendrick’s words: 
The more saturated fat you eat, the lower your risk of dying of cardiovascular disease, and vice-versa. 
So why is this hypothesis about saturated fat and heart disease so entrenched in medical circles? 
Kendrick draws an interesting parallel between the recent attacks against Dr. Waney Squier and her exposure of the theory of “Shaken Baby Syndrome” as having no scientific merit. 
My thoughts were drawn to this issue by something seemingly unconnected. Which is a legal hearing in the UK concerning shaken baby syndrome. Most experts in paediatrics are absolutely convinced that there is such a thing. It is quoted in textbooks as an undisputed fact. Many parents, and other adults, have been convicted, and sent to jail, for shaking their babies so hard that it caused the ‘triad’ of shaken baby syndrome: subdural hematoma, retinal bleeding, and brain swelling 
On the other hand, we have Dr. Waney Squier, a paediatrician who used to provide expert opinion on child abuse cases in the UK. She was struck off by the General Medical Council (GMC) for, well the exact judgement is, as per Derrida, impossible to understand. 
Leaving the machinations of the GMC aside, the main issue is simple. Dr. Waney Squier does not believe that shaken baby syndrome exists. Of course she knows that the triad of subdural haematoma, retinal bleeding and brain swelling exists. But she believes there could be other explanations. Including, perish the very thought, an accidental fall. 
Because she does not believe in shaken baby syndrome, she has presented evidence in court which has tended to undermine the prosecution case against parents and carers, accused of shaking a baby and causing severe brain damage. Much to the annoyance of the police, and they then, for it was indeed them, reported Dr. Squier to the GMC. 
Now, I know what most of you are thinking. Surely ‘shaken baby syndrome’ exists. This must have been proven. Well, it has not. If you think about it, how could it be proven? How do you think a study on shaken baby syndrome could ever be done? Get five hundred children, shake them forcefully and see what happens to their brains. I suspect you might find gaining ethical approval for a such a study might be tricky. Shaken Baby Syndrome: Saturated Fat Consumption 
Kendrick goes on to explain what he sees as the rationale in both scientific theories that seem to have very little evidence to support, and yet is widely held in medical circles. Regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome: 
On the fact of it shaken baby syndrome and saturated fat consumption have very little in common. However, from another perspective the parallels are clear. Both are seductively simple ideas that appeal to common sense. That most deadly of all senses. 
Most people can clearly see how a small, vulnerable, baby will suffer significant brain injury if it is shaken too hard. Close your eyes and you can virtually see it happening. If you can bear having that image in your head for any length of time. 
Most parents, I think, can almost see themselves doing it, or having done it – when their child will ‘just not dammed well stop crying.’ In short, shaken baby syndrome can easily be visualised, and it triggers a kind of visceral horror. We can easily see how a feckless parent may lack the self-control required to stop themselves doing it. ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up….’ 
And that, dear reader, is as scientific as shaken baby syndrome gets. A hypothesis based on visceral fear, prejudice, and knee-jerk judgement. This makes it almost perfectly resistant to any contradictory evidence. Try to argue against it, and you will meet anger and bluster and the idée fixe. 
Regarding Saturated Fats causing Heart Disease: 
The ‘saturated fat causing heart disease hypothesis’ comes from a very similar place called – well, it’s obvious isn’t it, just common sense. Heart disease is basically a build up of fat in the arteries, isn’t it? Where can that possibly come from? Fat in the diet. Especially the thick, sticky, gooey stuff that you get on a pork chop, or suchlike. That’s got to be it hasn’t it? The thick horrible squidgy gooey fat that you eat, ends up as thick horrible squidgy gooey fat in your arteries. Serves you right for eating fat, and McDonald’s, and suchlike. 
There rests the entire scientific argument against saturated fat. As such it is difficult to argue against. Facts simply bounce off.

The first is that the president’s team is under investigation for having potentially interfered in the US presidential election. If that turns out to be true, that is traitorous conduct. And that means that this conversation should be set aside until that is cleared up. And the second is, Gorsuch is way out of the mainstream. He hates class action lawsuits. He doesn’t want the LGBT community to be able to use the courts to end discrimination. He finds and twists a lot to find corporations  —   for corporations against ordinary citizens time after time after time. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
784,Four Common Mistakes When Burning Wood,"Lisa Tanner October 31, 2016 Four Common Mistakes When Burning Wood 
Do you heat your house with wood heat? Wood stoves are a great way to provide heat even when the power goes out. They help lower your heat bill . 
But, burning wood takes a little preparation. You need to make sure your stove is ready to burn safely throughout the winter months. You’ll have to put up a supply of firewood to see you through the season. 
Here are some major mistakes people make when burning wood, and how you can avoid them. 
1. Not Inspecting & Cleaning Your Stove 
Before you start burning around the clock, make sure your stove and chimney are ready for the season. As part of this inspection, you’ll want to examine your firebrick lining and see if any of it needs replaced. The brick reflects heat, keeping the body of the stove from overheating. 
You’ll also want to make sure the chimney is cleaned. You can either get it cleaned professionally, or do it yourself, whichever you are most comfortable with. This will prevent chimney fires, and help your fire burn more efficiently. 
If any of your stovepipe leading to the chimney has a sharp turn, you’ll want to give that section extra attention during cleaning. Creosote can build up quickly in a bend. When your stove is cool, disconnect the pipe if you can and take it outside to ensure its thoroughly cleaned. 
While you’re checking your stove, be sure to check the seal around the door. You want a tight seal to keep smoke from getting into your house. The braid cord that’s around the door in many stove models may occasionally need replaced. 
Once everything is in good working order, you’ll be all set to use your stove all winter long. Neglecting these steps can lead to a chimney or house fire. 
2. Not Having Enough Wood 
You don’t want to run out of wood in the middle of winter. It’s always best to have too much wood on hand rather than too little. How much you’ll need depends on many factors, such as: Whether your family is home all day How large your house is How much insulation your house has How low the temperatures drop in your area The type of wood you’ll be burning How hot you like your fires How much of the year you’ll burn 
I live in a large, old home without much insulation in the rooms we haven’t yet renovated. Most windows are still single-paned. And the kids and I are home all day long. 
We burn a lot more wood than my parents who live across the street. Their home is insulated well, has updated windows, and they work out of the house so they just bank their fire before they leave. 
Ten cord of wood is what we try to have on hand at the start of winter. We don’t typically burn it all, but if the temperatures drop below zero, we go through wood at an alarming rate. We also don’t just burn in the “winter” months. To keep the house comfortable, we usually burn September through May. 
It’s a lot of wood, but I’d much rather end the burning season with a head start on next winter’s supply than be caught short. We did that once when we first moved here, and falling dead trees with three feet of snow on the ground in the freezing weather wasn’t fun. 
When you make your estimate for firewood usage, estimate high, especially if it’s your first year. You’ll be able to get a better idea of how much wood you used in the spring. That’ll make future estimates easier. 
3. Not Storing Your Wood Properly 
Once you have your firewood cut, it’s time to split it and stack it . You want to make sure it’s not going to get wet over the winter, so store it somewhere dry. 
It’s best to store your wood off the ground a bit, like on a pallet. That way the air can circulate throughout the pile and keep everything dry. 
You can stack your wood in a woodshed, an old barn, a lean-to, or pallets in the yard with a tarp on top. You’ll want to ensure a couple sides of your woodpile are opened to allow air to circulate. 
Since wood is flammable and can attract pests, it’s best not to store large quantities of it touching your house or in your basement. 
Properly storing your firewood will help protect your supply . That way you always have seasoned wood ready to go when you need it. 
If you don’t take care of your woodpile, it’ll get exposed to the elements and won’t dry out. 
4. Not Having a Backup Plan 
What would happen if your wood supply gets stolen or compromised? What if you underestimated how much you’d need and now you’re out? 
If you need to heat your home and you’re out of wood, there are some alternatives to burn in your stove. Some will burn quickly, while others will smolder for quite a while. 
You should think through a worst-case scenario before winter hits, and examine some of your options. Rolled Jean Logs 
Do you have old jeans that no longer fit or are so full of holes you can’t wear them? You can roll each pair into a tight log, tie it with string or twine, and then let it burn. 
The tighter you roll it, the longer it’ll take to burn. That’s because you’re keeping the air from circulating through it as quickly. 
To make a jean roll, you’ll need a pair of jeans and a couple of feet of string. Here’s the way I found to be the easiest. 
Stretch the jeans out in front of you, with the legs closest to your body. Begin rolling one leg. Roll it as tight as you can, jellyroll style. 
Once you get to the crotch, take a section of string and tie it around the rolled leg to keep it in place. You’ll want the string to run across the long end of the roll rather than the short end. 
Now, repeat with the other leg. 
When both legs are secure, grab onto both sections. Slowly begin rolling the leg rolls up into the waist of the pants. It’ll be bulky, so you’ll have to keep pressure on it to keep it tight. 
The waist section should completely cover the individual leg rolls and wrap around it a couple of times. Once you’ve reached the top of the jeans, it’s best if you have some help to tie it. That way you can ensure it stays tightly wound. 
Wrap string all the way around it and secure tightly. Repeat in three more places. Now your jean logs are ready for the fireplace. Rolled Paper Logs 
Do you have a large supply of newspapers on hand? What about books, magazines, or a couple of phone books? This paper can all be used to create rolled paper logs to burn. 
You’ll need to stack up your paper before you roll it. You want your finished log to be about three inches in diameter, so you might need to experiment with how much you stack to see how thick your finished product turns out. 
As with the jeans, you’ll want to roll the paper as tightly as possible. It’ll take a while to get the first couple of logs rolled, but once you get the hang of it, the process will go more quickly. 
Once the paper is rolled, use string, twine, or rubber bands to hold it tightly. You don’t want it to unroll on you. Video first seen on New and Lost Crafts . Green Wood 
If you have access to green wood, you can cut it down and it’ll burn. Are there any shrubs, bushes, or trees in your yard that you could get to safely? 
When going this route, keep in mind that green wood burns differently than seasoned wood. It’s harder to start, and may require a propane torch instead of just a match. 
Unseasoned wood also puts more creosote into your chimney, so you’ll want to ensure you check the chimney frequently for any build up. If you notice build up, let your fire go out and clean the chimney before you use it again. You don’t want to start a chimney fire! An Emergency Tree 
We usually pick out one or two emergency trees at the start of each fire burning season. These are standing dead trees on the property that’ll be accessible by tractor even in the middle of winter. If our wood supply is ever compromised, we know that we can get a couple loads from those trees. 
If you have your own wooded land, you might consider leaving an emergency tree too. Twisted Straw Sticks 
You can take a page out of a Little House book and use the method Laura and Pa did in The Long Winter. When the Ingalls family ran out of wood to burn, they started twisting hay into long sticks. 
It was time consuming, but kept the family warm through the long winter. If you have a surplus of hay or straw, you can make your own sticks to burn. You’ll want to ensure the sticks are tightly wound so they burn longer. Broken Furniture and Wood Scraps 
Do you have any broken wood furniture around your homestead? How about wood scraps from building projects? Both can be burned. 
What other wood burning mistakes can you add? 
These are four common mistakes that people burning with wood make. Can you add others to the list? How do you best prepare for your wood burning season?

785,Push for Internet Privacy Rules Moves to Statehouses - The New York Times,"Now that Republicans are in charge, the federal government is poised to roll back regulations limiting access to consumers’ online data. States have other ideas. As on climate change, immigration and a host of other issues, some state legislatures may prove to be a counterweight to Washington by enacting new regulations to increase consumers’ privacy rights. Illinois legislators are considering a “right to know” bill that would let consumers find out what information about them is collected by companies like Google and Facebook, and what kinds of businesses they share it with. Such a right, which European consumers already have, has been a longtime goal of privacy advocates. Two other proposals face a crucial Illinois House committee vote this week. One would regulate when consumers’ locations can be tracked by smartphone applications, and another would limit the use of microphones in   devices like mobile phones, smart TVs and personal assistants like Amazon’s Echo. Should they be passed into law, these rules could end up guiding the rights of consumers far beyond Illinois  —   because they would provide a model for other states, and because it would be difficult for technology companies with hundreds of millions of users to create a patchwork of   and   features to localize their effects. Congress is pushing to overturn regulations imposed by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration that limit the collection of data by broadband providers like ATT and Comcast. The Senate approved the rollback last week, and the House is expected to follow this week. Congressional Republicans argue that the rules would add an unneeded and confusing layer of regulation and that they fail to distinguish between broadband providers and content companies like Facebook and Google. They also assert, more broadly, that such regulation is onerous and stifles innovation. Illinois is not the only place where state legislators are asserting themselves in the opposite direction. California and Connecticut, for instance, recently updated laws that restrict government access to online communications like email, and New Mexico could follow soon. Last year, Nebraska and West Virginia passed laws that limit how companies can monitor employees’ social media accounts, while legislators in Hawaii, Missouri and elsewhere are pushing similar bills for employees, as well as for students and tenants. “More and more, states have taken the position that, if Congress is not willing or able to enact strong privacy laws, their legislatures will no longer sit on their hands,” said Chad Marlow, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Online privacy is the rare issue that draws together legislators from the left and the far right. At the state level, anyway, some of the progress has come from a marriage between progressive Democrats and   Republicans, who see privacy as a bedrock principle, Mr. Marlow said. States have often been a kind of regulatory laboratory. Be it tax cuts, emission regulations, gay rights or gun laws, advocates on both the left and the right have long worked at the state level to push agendas that Washington is too busy or hostile to handle. In the case of online privacy, consumer groups and civil liberties advocates had a friendly ear in many quarters of the Obama administration. Now they face a White House and a Congress that are looking to roll back regulations, not create them. But federal blockage can create local opportunities. “What you’re seeing is this growing recognition of the intrusiveness of these technologies, and some efforts  —   not to regulate them out of existence, but to regulate them in ways that allow people who care about this to preserve their own privacy,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School, and the former director of the Federal Trade Commission’s consumer protection bureau. “So what’s going to happen is California is going to supplant Congress, and it’s going to be augmented by states like Illinois, Minnesota and even Texas in efforts to protect consumer privacy. ” In Illinois, the “right to know” legislation recently cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee, paving the way for a full vote sometime in the next few weeks. Technology companies and their trade organizations are lobbying fiercely against it. “I think I created 30 jobs when I filed this bill,” said Michael Hastings, a Democratic state senator who sponsored the measure. Mr. Hastings said lobbyists representing companies including Microsoft, Apple, Lyft and Amazon had visited his office to talk about amending the bill. Several technology trade groups, including the Internet Association and NetChoice, have pushed publicly against the legislation. In an interview, Carl Szabo, senior policy counsel at NetChoice, said the law could add a burden of compliance costs and legal fees on essentially any company with a website that collects information, even routine things like creating email lists or giving online support to customers. “Hiring attorneys to write privacy policies, coming up with terms of service  —   that will be a real burden for small businesses,” he said. Illinois also has another dimension:   lawyers. Almost a decade ago the state passed a trailblazing law, the Biometric Information Privacy Act, that regulates the collection of things like facial scans, voice data and thumbprints. This has given rise to a series of potentially expensive lawsuits against Facebook, Google and others. Last year, lobbyists for Facebook failed in a push for an amendment that would have weakened the biometric law by exempting   technologies that are now commonly used on social media. In the interim, however, lawyers at Edelson PC, a     firm that has become notorious among tech companies for its prolific filing of privacy suits, have gone on offense with a lobbying campaign of their own. Firm lawyers have also helped found a new nonprofit group, the Digital Privacy Alliance, as an advocate for privacy legislation in Illinois and elsewhere. “We were forced to get involved politically because once we started winning a lot of cases in court, they all went on the offensive,” said Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC. “It’s important because the Trump administration is doing so much to roll back privacy rights, so there is going to be a huge shift to state lawmakers and state attorneys general. ”",0
787,Madonna Gave a Surprise Pop-Up Concert to Support Clinton. We Were There. - The New York Times,"The words “Madonna” and “concert” hardly conjure images of an intimate gathering, but on the eve of Election Day in the heart of Greenwich Village, that is what a few hundred people got. On Monday evening, the singer announced online a surprise concert in Washington Square Park in Manhattan with just enough time for fans to drop their forks, reroute their taxis and arrive to see her sashay onstage in a bomber jacket with fluorescent green sleeves and a winter hat sprinkled with stars. Madonna stood in the middle of the round fountain at the center of the square, holding a red guitar and pledging her support for the Democratic presidential nominee. She welcomed everyone to “a surprise, impromptu rally for Hillary Rodham Clinton. ” And the crowd, which had been huddled around the edges of the fountain, leapt to its feet. She then broke into her song “Express Yourself,” modifying the lyrics to say, “Make her express herself. ” The Material Girl’s message was decidedly feminist and   J. Trump, the Republican nominee. “Women are marginalized, let’s face it,” Madonna said between songs. “As far as I’m concerned, we still live in an extremely chauvinist, sexist, misogynist country. And that’s why Hillary Clinton needs to be president. ” The show was just five songs long: Madonna’s own “Express Yourself,” “Like a Prayer” and “Don’t Tell Me” as well as “Imagine” and a   of “If I Had a Hammer” and her “Rebel Heart. ” It was mainly a singalong, in the folk music tradition of the Village. People held signs, shouted “I’m with her” and appeared to know all of the words. Those in attendance included unsuspecting tourists in the right place at the right time,   New Yorkers who had gotten texts while leaving work and volunteers for Mrs. Clinton, many of them young women, who had spent the day calling and texting voters in battleground states. There were also some super fans. “I literally stalked this for 48 hours,” said David Yontef, 46, who lives in Chelsea and works in advertising. For more than a day, he said, there had been false leads on the location of the secret concert. “I was going to hop on a train to Philly then it seemed like it might be in Michigan  —   I was refreshing the browser every 10 minutes,” he said. “Then suddenly at 7 p. m. they said 7:30 here. We left dinner on the table, threw money on the table and jumped in a cab. This is history. This is Madonna, and she’s trying to get the first woman in the White House. ” Was he satisfied with the show? “Oh my God,” he said, “it was everything. ”",0
788,Women won't earn the same as men for another two centuries - report,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 11:40 UTC © Joshua Lott / Reuters It will take close to two centuries for women to earn the same as men, according to the World Economic Forum's latest report. The annual Global Gender Gap Report was released Tuesday and found economic disparity between the sexes is on the rise. When looking at income and employment, we are back to similar levels of inequality seen during the 2008 financial crash. ""At the current rate of change, and given the widening economic gender gap since last year, it will not be closed for another 170 years,"" the report read. The Gender Gap Index uses economics, education, health and political empowerment to rank 144 countries that have enough available data to use. Last year's report estimated it would take 118 years for economic equality to be achieved. Iceland, Finland, Norway and Sweden were the best countries on the Global Gender Gap Index having closed the gender gap in more than 80 percent of cases, but all still have disparities between the sexes. Rwanda and Ireland came fifth and sixth in the index. The UK came 20th and the US came 45th, falling 17 places from last year. Yemen came last. ""There also continues to be a persistent wage gap in paid work,"" the report says. ""Women's average earnings are almost half those of men, with average global earned income for women and men estimated at US$10,778 and $19,873, respectively. Countries that perform well in this dimension of gender parity span all regional and income groups."" To examine economic participation and opportunity, the report looks at the ratio of female and male workers, wage equality for similar work and the ratio of women to men in various roles. The greatest gap between the sexes was found in political empowerment. The first Index was conducted in 2006 to track gender disparities and countries' progress over time.",0

790,British Healthcare Offers a Glimpse into the Future of Obamacare,"Print 
Obamacare is once again in the news – this time for the massive rate hikes Americans have to look forward to in a few months. The right is decrying the hikes, as the left desperately tries to down-play them or just deflect and change the subject. 
Citizens already stretched to their budgetary limits are wondering how on Earth they will ever be able to afford the insurance premiums – some rising well over 50%. I personally fail to see how a family who is struggling to pay their current premiums will ever be able swing even a 15 or 20% increase, much less 50%. 
Combine the massive rate hikes with the availability of insurers, which shrink every year, and you have a recipe for mass financial disaster. Can you say a record year for personal bankruptcy? Yeah – I think so. And always remember – Obamacare is just shoddy health insurance. It is NOT healthcare, as everyone on the left consistently and purposely sells it. The left does like their word games. 
But, as has been said a myriad of times from us on the right – Obamacare is a fiasco by design. It is a premeditated failure. A single-payer, entirely government-run system has always been the end. Obamacare was always intended to be the deceptive means to that end. 
As a single-payer healthcare system is the want of the leftist statists, let me site yet another example of what the future holds for many in the good ole U.S. of A. 
Jolly old England is said to have the “best of both worlds” – private and public healthcare; but in fact, only the wealthiest 5-7% can afford the private care, leaving the rest to the public option – which is far from adequate. 
Inadequate care and hopelessly long wait times just to receive the sub-par care is the rule in England, not the exception. 
In 2011, the UK Telegraph reported that, “NHS [National Health Service] managers are deliberately delaying operations as they wait for patients either to die or go private in order to save money, according to an official report.” That’s right. In order to cut costs, bureaucrats at the NHS have become defacto “death panels.” Sound familiar? 
One such poor sap who just recently ended up caught in the maze of the British healthcare bureaucracy is Paul Dibbins, a former British Army Lance Corporal. The father of three had suffered serious frost bite. After months of trying to heal his toes, he had developed gangrene. 
The NHS scheduled surgery to remove his lower leg – below the knee. Without the surgery, the gangrene would spread, eventually killing him. A grim outlook either way, but having no lower leg is better than an agonizing death, he thought. 
Unfortunately for the former soldier, the NHS made him wait six weeks for the procedure. And then something happened. At the eleventh hour, NHS postponed the surgery yet again, for another six weeks – no doubt, in an attempt to cut costs. 
Mr. Dibbins was desperate at this point and decided to do the only thing he could. He said: “Knowing that it would take at least another six weeks to get me in front of a surgeon again, that’s when I bit the bullet and cut off the toes.” 
And that he did. Using no painkillers at all, Dibbins scraped away the dead flesh from his two blackened toes and proceeded to sever the tendons with the only thing he had available – a pair of nail clippers. The procedure took him about an hour to remove both affected toes. A surgeon later told him he was crazy, but that the home-style operation was “textbook.” 
So, as we proceed further down the path of a single-payer, government run healthcare system, home surgery may also be in our future – as Washington bureaucrats and death panels decide which of us is worth saving. 
I better dust off my old game of “ Operation ” and start practicing. shares",0

793,BREAKING: Sec of Defense Carter Attempting to Fool the American Public About Veterans! Caught Red-Handed!,"0 comments If you are one of the Americans DISGUSTED with Obama’s Pentagon demanding 10,000 war Veterans pay back enlistment bonuses handed out a decade ago, get ready to be FURIOUS! 
Many of these Veterans served multiple combat tours and the bonuses were used to entice them to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan! Many have lost limbs and have suffered! 
I would imagine that some are deceased and their spouses or family are having to deal with this! 
But the headlines read: U.S. Defense Secretary orders Pentagon to stop asking veterans to repay reenlistment bonuses 
He is only suspending until he is “satisfied that our process is working effectively.”. In other words, until this dies down so that they can go back to stealing from our fine Veterans! Secretary Carter and the Pentagon are NOT stopping this insanity! ABSOLUTELY NOT Ash Carter. This CHANGES NOTHING! 
You are still going about taking that money, just later after the anger dies down! I ain’t falling for it! 
If you are hurting for money, why don’t you ask the Iranians for some of those BILLIONS Obama just handed them back! Don’t you DARE do this to our hardworking Veterans! 
You need to be giving the monies already collected back! The Pentagon needs to be saying, we are STOPPING this entirely! SHAME ON YOU! You are even CHARGING INTEREST on this “debt”. I have never been so ashamed of the Pentagon and it’s leadership in MY LIFE! Secretary Carter, you are a MORON ! 
We already pay our servicemen and women way too little for the sacrifices they make! Their healthcare is abominable and their benefits are abominable! And I KNOW what kind of standard of living you live Carter!! 
EVERYONE involved in this decision to to walk down this insane road with our war veterans need to be publicly spanked. YES!! EXACTLY what I mean. They need to be…in public…bare butt spanked. Pull them trousers down, lay them over a lap, and blister red those butts attached to those morons who are behind this scheme with a big Texas belt!. Seriously! 
Maybe if they faced that humiliation they might think twice again before making such an obnoxious decision against our veterans. 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pledged a House investigation of the problem, calling the Pentagon demands for repayment of bonuses from combat veterans “disgraceful.” 
Congress best stop this insanity before it goes any further. Secretary Carter… DON”T YOU DARE try to deceive the American people and punt this down the road. 
Red Skelton famously said, “From the people to the leaders, not the leaders to the people!” YOU Sir, are a public SERVANT..not a Master. The “public servants” are the SLAVES and We the People are the masters because that is how this country was set up. 
You said today you have a responsibility to the American taxpayer! YES you do! You have a responsibility to STOP this MADNESS. We the People are not going away! You just set your legacy in stone! You might want to fix it!",0
794,Putin’s Adviser Takes Credit For Trump Victory: ‘Maybe We Helped A Bit With Wikileaks’,"  
Donald Trump’s shocking presidential win last night has left most of the world in mortified awe, but one leader seems especially pleased by the upset, perhaps because he had something to do with it. 
Just hours after Trump took the stage to deliver his acceptance speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated the president-elect on his win. It was only three weeks ago, at the third presidential debate that Hillary Clinton said Trump would be Putin’s “puppet” and it looks like Putin is eager to take on the master’s role. 
Speaking from the Kremlin, Putin specifically praised Trump on his vow to restore relations with Russia: 
“We understand the way to that will be difficult, taking into account the current state of degradation of relations between the US and Russia. As I have repeatedly said, that is not our fault that Russia-US relations are in that state. Russia is ready and wants to restore the fully-fledged relations with the US. I repeat we understand this will be difficult, but we are ready to play our part in it.” 
And what part will Trump play? Ask Sergei Markov. The pro-Kremlin political analyst, who was equally thrilled by the election outcome, is confident Trump will have America do a 180 on the Syrian debacle and join Russia in its backing of Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. 
There is every reason to believe the analyst, too. At the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, Hillary Clinton joked that Trump was ‘ healthy as a horse – you know the one Vladimir Putin rides on’. It looks like she might be right. Trump has always seemed a bit cozy with the Russian president , but now he may actually owe him a debt of gratitude for the Kremlin’s part in his win. 
In relation to Russian interference in the election, Markov said, “Maybe we helped a bit with WikiLeaks.” 
Up until now the Kremlin has denied any involvement; Putin calling The Obama administration’s accusations they hacked Democratic Party emails, then leaking them to WikiLeaks, as “nonsense” claims. 
Markov did admit it might not be all smooth riding, adding, “Putin is a macho, Trump is also a macho. Maybe it could be a problem.” 
Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Russia’s liberal Echo of Moscow radio, agrees: “Putin doesn’t like unpredictability and Trump is the definition of unpredictability.” 
I guess we will just have to see who will be riding whom.

795,Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up - The New York Times,"With this week’s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a “value” stock. That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing. Mr. Buffett is the world’s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing  —   an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their “intrinsic value,” as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic “The Intelligent Investor. ” Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing. So value investors took notice when Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had invested $1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter. “We’ve just looked at it again,” said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful   value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. “Anybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion. ” Value stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing   revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low    ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low. Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value   funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they haven’t already. Apple “is going to attract more value investors,” said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. “They’re looking for   stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month. ” Mr. Sacconaghi has a buy recommendation on the stock, “not because we believe this will be a   company going forward, but because the current price is discounting a decline in cash flow forever, and we think that’s overly pessimistic. ” According to the market research firm Thomson Reuters Lipper, just 69 of 357 actively managed value funds in the United States  —   fewer than 20 percent  —   currently hold positions in Apple. That’s because Apple has long been considered a quintessential growth stock: one of the glamorous   cousins to dowdy value stocks. Growth investors think growth stocks are undervalued, too, because they expect their earnings to grow faster (often much faster) than other investors recognize. As a result, valuation measures for growth stocks can go  . In two prominent   examples, shares of Facebook trade at a   ratio of about 73, and Netflix at about 312. (The   average for stocks in the Standard  Poor’s   index is currently about 24.) This week Apple’s    ratio was just over 10. If Apple is now a value stock, though, plenty of growth investors haven’t gotten the message. Among actively managed growth funds, 249 of 619, or 40 percent, hold Apple shares, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper. That’s more than the 230 growth funds that owned Apple stock in 2014. Should growth funds suddenly decide that Apple no longer meets their criteria, there could be a mass exodus that would be only partly offset by new purchases from value investors. Some prominent value investors aren’t convinced Apple really is a value stock, despite Mr. Buffett’s blessing, or that its stock price is significantly below its intrinsic value. (Intrinsic value considers all aspects of a business, including both tangible and intangible factors.) That means Apple could fall into the neutral zone of stocks that are neither growth  —   because they aren’t growing fast enough  —   or value, because they’re still not cheap enough. “Apple is extraordinarily cheap, but it’s never been a value stock in the traditional sense,” said Bruce Greenwald, who runs the value investing program at Columbia Business School and is a   of “Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett and Beyond” (Wiley, 2001). “Value investing has always focused primarily on asset value,” Professor Greenwald told me. Apple’s book value, or asset value, of $130 billion isn’t even close to its market capitalization of about $515 billion. That means, in theory, that other companies could replicate Apple’s assets at relatively low cost, produce rival products and undermine Apple’s enviably high profit margins. Tech companies typically have low asset values relative to their share prices  —   one reason Mr. Buffett and other value investors long shunned the sector  —   but their patented technologies and intellectual property nonetheless often create formidable barriers to entry by competitors. For an extraordinarily    technology company like Apple, the question is whether there are such “moats,” as value investors like to put it, that will continue to protect it from these competitive threats. “That’s always been the issue with Apple,” Professor Greenwald said. “How sustainable are these profit levels and how big are the barriers? The fear with Apple is that it will get overwhelmed by new entry and new competitors. The moat doesn’t seem that big. It’s not just giant rivals like Samsung, but smaller companies that can survive with even a small share of the smartphone market. ” Mr. Smead told me this week he had not added Apple to his value fund’s holdings, even though the stock is so cheap that it meets many of his fund’s investing criteria. “Over the past five or six years, when Apple was doing so well, we joked that we were the     fund that didn’t own Apple,” Mr. Smead said. “Not that we didn’t wrestle with it many times. ” “Our difficulty has been that we don’t understand what kind of moat protects their technology over the next 10 years,” Mr. Smead continued. “That’s the main problem. The other is that, given Apple’s huge success and its sheer magnitude, it needs a monstrous new product or enhancement of an existing product to move the needle on growth. ” For their part, many growth investors were startled on April 26 when Apple reported its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003. Both revenue and earnings fell short of analyst estimates, and Apple shares plunged 8 percent in one day. They rallied some this week on news of the Berkshire Hathaway investment, but are still down sharply from where they were as recently as  . But Apple still has defenders among growth investors. At the end of the year, Apple was the   holding in the Upright Growth Fund, the     growth fund so far this year, according to Morningstar. “Apple’s best and fastest growing days may be behind us,” David Chiueh, Upright Growth’s president and fund manager, told me. “But even   funds like ours don’t just contain   stocks with   percent growth rates in our portfolio. ” He said such rapid growth was not sustainable, and added that he was happy with companies that showed “solid 8 percent to 12 percent earnings growth,” a category in which he included Apple. ”Give them some time and they will show outstanding performance,” he said. Mr. Chiueh said he was also encouraged that Apple had stepped up its spending on research and development, suggesting that new products with strong growth prospects might still be in the offing. At some fund families, Apple seems to be both a value and a growth stock, even though that seems contradictory. At the fund giant Vanguard, Apple is a major holding in the Vanguard Windsor and Windsor II funds (both value funds) and the Vanguard Morgan Growth Fund and US Growth Fund. A Vanguard spokeswoman declined to comment. All of which suggests that when it comes to Apple, “value” and “growth” may be in the eye of the beholder. Still, Mr. Buffett’s announcement this week underscores that Apple’s once sizzling growth has slowed, and suggests it may well be on the inexorable path from growth to value stock. That’s not an especially good portent for investors. Among technology companies that have already made the same transition, Professor Greenwald cited IBM, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Dell, companies whose share prices, after great rocket rides, have mostly languished in recent years. (Dell was taken private in 2013.) For those who failed to buy the stock early enough, “as investments, they all turned out pretty badly,” he noted. Berkshire Hathaway also disclosed this week that it had increased the stake in IBM it first acquired in 2011. IBM shares have declined over the period, but by Mr. Buffett’s   standards, the investment is still too new to judge. “If you believe the iPhone will be the global standard in 25 years, you’d buy” Apple stock, Professor Greenwald said. But many value investors have already seen where smartphones can go, “which is where PCs have already gone. ”",0
796,Re: The FBI's Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor,"Email 
Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails , and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin ’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.

797,Hillary Horrified As 2 Pics Surfaced Overnight That She Didn’t Want Out,"Hillary Horrified As 2 Pics Surfaced Overnight That She Didn’t Want Out Posted on October 31, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Worried Hillary Clinton (left), Vindicated Donald Trump (right) 
Hillary Clinton got a Halloween surprise early when she turned on her computer and saw what was on Google. While she slept, forgetting about everything that came against her on Friday when the FBI decided to re-investigate her emails and private server, someone else was taking full advantage of the situation and exposing the truth about her as two posts showed. 
After Barack Obama gave control of the Internet to International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Hillary may have thought that her secrets would be safe. As WikiLeaks continues to prove, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Clever conservative web users are alive and well, working hard to expose the secrets that she’s enjoyed keeping behind closed doors before the Internet came along and swung them wide open, exposing the scandalous and criminal behavior that she almost got away with. 
Since Google tends to lean left and caters to liberal agendas, it’s not often that the search results you’re looking for are all that accurate. However, on Sunday, almost 36 hours after news broke about the FBI investigating Hillary, if you were to search two separate terms, the results were awesomely accurate. 
A tricky hacker managed to mess with the algorithm so that if anyone was looking for the definition of “pathological liar” on the popular search engine, the top result showed Hillary’s headshot alongside the description, but that wasn’t all. @triplejHack What in the Wide World of Sports is going on with Google!? pic.twitter.com/PJHC23CzDK 
— Dilo on Fire (@FireDilo) October 31, 2016 
The definition of this term said, “It is a stand-alone disorder as well as a symptom of other disorders such as psychopathy and antisocial, narcissistic, and historic personality disorders, but people who are pathological liars may not possess characteristics of the other disorders. Excessive lying is a common symptom of several mental disorders.” While that description may always come up in Google for “Pathological liar,” Hillary’s picture isn’t typically there, but it is the perfect example of the mental illness. 
Adding to the insult was another search result the hacker altered for better accuracy. When searching for who the “45th President” is, Donald Trump’s picture showed up, which Hillary probably wasn’t too happy about. The comparison between the two searches perfectly represents both presidential candidates. With any luck, the results will stay the same after November 8 and the treatment for Hillary’s diagnosis of “pathological liar” will be prison time.",0
798,"Paul LePage, the Governor of Maine, Now Says He’s Not Quitting - The New York Times","AUGUSTA, Me.  —   Paul R. LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term. “I will not resign,” said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind. “I’m not an alcoholic, and I’m not a drug addict, and I don’t have mental issues,” he said. “What I have is a backbone. ” Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking “spiritual guidance,” had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: “I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” he said. Behind the scenes, state lawmakers  —   Democrats and Senate Republicans  —   exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis. The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state’s drug crisis. As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist. The governor then left him an   voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes. In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine. Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade. The state’s four legislative caucuses have said that they believe all four would have to agree for a special session to be scheduled. But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage’s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts  —   essentially shielding him from any official political consequence. That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House. “With all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette’s position,” the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement. “The Republican senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made. ” Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage’s apology and promise to seek “spiritual guidance” had allayed their concerns about the governor  —   a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week. “There should be consequences for our actions,” Mr. Thibodeau said, “and I think that’s why we’re really struggling. ” There is no precedent for such a situation here  —   a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session. Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicans’ ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement. “It’s never been done before, so we’re in a little bit of uncharted waters,” said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get “a competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator. ” Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage’s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed. “Coming back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor’s political future are on the table,” said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond. Mr. LePage’s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy. Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry. By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm. “I want to put this behind us,” Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, “I will never talk about it again. ” Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with  —   and apologized to  —   Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail. And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maine’s heroin crisis. But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics. “I didn’t use racially charged language,” Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, “Let’s leave ethnicity out of it. ”",0

800,Bill Clinton Wants to be Called Something Completely Ridiculous if Hillary is Elected,"0 comments 
With the possibility that America may elect the first female president in history, there has been much speculation surrounding what we would call her husband. 
During the 2008 election, Todd Palin joked that he liked to be referred to as the “First Dude” when his wife was Governor of Alaska, and the term could be brought to the White House. 
But while speaking with the Daily Mail in North Carolina on Tuesday, Bill Clinton had another idea. 
“What I hope I’ll be is the first volunteer,” the former president said. “I hope to be the best free labor she’s got.”",0
801,"After Her Son’s Death, Sally Mann Stages a Haunting Show - The New York Times","LEXINGTON, Va.  —   “It’s just indescribable,” Sally Mann, the photographer and writer, was saying. She stood in the kitchen of the home she built on her family’s farm with Larry Mann, her husband of 46 years, and erupted in tears. “I’m just trying to keep moving,” she said. On the large dining table were her haunting, evocative photographs taken over the years of the studio in downtown Lexington where her friend, the painter Cy Twombly, had worked. Twombly was born 23 years before Ms. Mann in this same small town in Virginia. In her intimate and elegiac images, some with just the play of light on the wall and floor of the emptied studio, after his death in 2011, it was hard not to feel an acute absence  —   not of one man but two. In June, while preparing an exhibition of these photos, Ms. Mann suffered a sudden and most devastating loss. Emmett, her eldest child, who had struggled with schizophrenia in adulthood, took his own life, at the age of 36. Now the Twombly catalog she is gazing at, and the show, called “Remembered Light,” opening on Sept. 22 at the Gagosian Gallery in Manhattan, are “suffused with grief,” she said. The name Sally Mann is inseparable from the indelible images of her children, Emmett, Jessie and Virginia, in their unfettered youthful play, sometimes naked, in the countryside. In her   memoir, “Hold Still,” published last year, Ms. Mann wrote that her family pictures  —   which in the early 1990s became engulfed in morality debates about the depiction of children’s bodies and judgment of Ms. Mann as a mother  —   could not be completely understood outside the context of this farm. The farm is remote and sylvan, with horses grazing alongside the winding drive, dogs underfoot and a menagerie of colorful birds in the greenhouse sharing a glass wall with the open dining area. A communal family space flows into Ms. Mann’s office, with a photograph on her desk of a young Twombly taken by Robert Rauschenberg when they were at Black Mountain College together in 1951. It leads into her studio hung with the familiar,   photographs of Emmett and his sisters in their childhood. “I never separated myself as an artist and a mother,” said Ms. Mann, 65, who has always found her inspiration close to home, “in what William Carlos Williams called ‘the local,’” she wrote in her memoir. In this local realm she has created photographs of lush Southern landscapes and studies of her husband’s body revealing the effects of his progressive muscular dystrophy. Her art and motherhood “were really intertwined,” she continued. “It wasn’t hard until I had to defend it. ” Inevitably, there will be a chorus that assigns blame to the mother “for everything,” she added. Ms. Mann has barely ventured off the farm since Emmett’s death. Focusing on the printing of her Twombly images grounded her during the torturous weeks of June. In late July she offered to take a visitor with her on a foray into Lexington, a tour of the markers in Twombly’s life, and, as it turned out, her own. Her first stop would be Walmart, where she said Twombly liked to sit on a bench outside. “One of the most urbane, sophisticated humans alive, he would just sit there and watch the people come out and look at the mountains,” she said. “He was fascinated. ” Ms. Mann’s kinship with Twombly, whose wry, mentorly presence is woven throughout her memoir, began with her parents. Her father, a country doctor in Lexington for many years, first invited Twombly, then a high school senior, to dinner in the  . As a hostess gift, the artist brought an abstract tabletop sculpture he had crafted from found wood and metal. (That 1946 sculpture was in the first room of Twombly’s 1994 MoMA retrospective.) Early patrons, her parents bought one of Twombly’s   and pencil paintings in 1955 for $150, a transaction that may have occurred on the street. Last year, a 1968 “blackboard” painting set a new auction record for a Twombly work, of just over $70. 5 million at Sotheby’s New York. When Twombly moved back to his hometown in 1993 from Gaeta, Italy, for six months each year, “we became friends and compatriots and companions and helpmates,” Ms. Mann said. That developed just as Ms. Mann was receiving both acclaim and backlash from critics for photographs of her children. She and Twombly  —   a regular at her Thanksgiving dinners  —   visited back and forth constantly and casually. A record of their admiration for each other as artists  —   and for the creative process  —   is captured in the new exhibition. A painter of grand, abstract canvases cascading with layers of graffitilike script or explosions of vivid color, Twombly set up his studio in the most pedestrian of storefronts in downtown Lexington. “It was crude as can be, drop ceiling with water stains,” Ms. Mann said of the space that had been the gas company headquarters and then an eye doctor’s office. At Twombly’s suggestion, she began taking pictures there in 1999. “Usually I’m so blinkered when I approach work, but these were done for fun,” said Ms. Mann, who thinks her work shares with Twombly’s a kind of Southern melancholy or “moldering decadence,” as she put it. She switched from her trademark     view camera to a more nimble digital camera, which she retrofitted with an uncoated antique lens to give the pictures a blinding radiance and flair. “Cy would be taking pictures, too,” she said, adding that he once pointed his little Polaroid into the reverse end of her view camera. “He taught me a lot. He was so loose and free and energetic. ” Ms. Mann’s earliest photograph in the Gagosian exhibition focuses on Twombly’s tidy lineup of paints, brushes and stained cloths in a spartan   room. “I had no idea what level of misrule and chaos it would turn into,” she said. Over the sequence, the space becomes densely populated with Twombly’s secondhand finds, including a plastic flamingo and ceramic frog, and white plaster assemblage sculptures, bathed in hazy light filtering through the Venetian blinds. Next, Ms. Mann wanted to visit the Antique Mall that she and Twombly frequented together. She walked through aisles of    and nodded to a deer’s head similar to one in her picture of his cluttered work table. “He just loved this kitschy stuff,” she said. “He had such a wide spectrum of embrace, from the sublime to the ridiculous. ” Looking at the images, John Ravenal, who organized her 2010 survey “Sally Mann: The Flesh and the Spirit” at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, was struck by how Ms. Mann chose not to use her signature   collodion process, which typically gives her images a high degree of distortion and painterly sensuality. “I think that is really a sign of respect,” he said. “The careful focus on the contents, on the subject matter, is rich enough that it didn’t need this extra layer of abstraction. ” Twombly’s studio is now a shop called Old Lex Mercantile. The new owners led Ms. Mann to the back to see   drywall, removed during their renovation. She showed them her photographs of the same wall, intact, in the exhibition catalog. Nicola Del Roscio, director of the Cy Twombly Foundation and the artist’s longtime companion, recalled how Twombly painted a series by tacking a new canvas on top of older ones. He said that the artist appreciated the sounds of street activity and fragments of conversation that would trickle in to the studio. “He could not survive if he did not do a little trip every day around the countryside,” he said, whether strolling by the mansions of Lexington or making an excursion to Walmart. After Twombly’s death, Mr. Del Roscio asked Ms. Mann to photograph the interior of the artist’s home before its eclectic arrangements were packed up. They include one with an old master print on his mantel behind a framed sign saying “Street girls bringing in sailors must pay for room in advance. ” Today the sign graces Ms. Mann’s studio. Ms. Mann pulled up to the Lexington Restaurant, a diner where Twombly came for the grits and banter. “He would take really   art people from Europe here,” Ms. Mann said, adding that it was rumored he had left $10, 000 tips for waitresses. Eyeing an older waitress who might provide confirmation, she approached the counter and began chatting her up. A couple of minutes later, Ms. Mann exclaimed loudly, “Oh, of course you are!” Slipping back into the booth, Ms. Mann said that 40 years ago the waitress had “typed my master’s thesis in creative writing, and her daughter babysat for my kids. ” And yes, the rumor was true. At the diner, Ms. Mann brought up her son. “Emmett had three terrible brain injuries,” she said. He was hit by a car when he was very young, something she examined in her book. There were two other accidents in adulthood. “That’s when the schizophrenia took over,” she explained. “We don’t know if the injuries caused it, or exacerbated it, or if it was genetic. ” She felt he had been responding well to treatment, and the family was completely caught off guard by what happened. She asked if we could make a quick stop at Emmett’s house nearby, to retrieve a small bookshelf she wanted to keep. She steeled herself before entering the bungalow. Inside was just a small drift of household items piled to one side. Unflinchingly, she hoisted the humble shelf and walked it to her car trunk. On this day, as in her writing and through her view camera, she stared as squarely as she could, contemplating the passage of time and the transience of life.",0
802,Trump Team’s Links to Russia Crisscross in Washington - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   During the 2016 campaign, Donald J. Trump’s second campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had regular communications with his longtime associate  —   a former Russian military translator in Kiev who has been investigated in Ukraine on suspicion of being a Russian intelligence agent. At the Republican National Convention in July, J. D. Gordon, a former Pentagon official on Mr. Trump’s national security team, met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, at a time when Mr. Gordon was helping keep hawkish language on Russia’s conflict with Ukraine out of the party’s platform. And Jason Greenblatt, a former Trump Organization lawyer and now a special representative for international negotiations at the White House, met last summer with Rabbi Berel Lazar, the chief rabbi of Russia and an ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. In a Washington atmosphere supercharged by the finding of the intelligence agencies that Mr. Putin tried to steer the election to Mr. Trump, as well as continuing F. B. I. and congressional investigations, a growing list of Russian contacts with Mr. Trump’s associates is getting intense and skeptical scrutiny. Democrats see suspicious connections and inaccurate denials as part of a pattern that belies Mr. Trump’s adamant insistence that he and his associates “have nothing to do with Russia. ” The president’s supporters say innocuous encounters, routine for any incoming presidential team, are being treated for political reasons as somehow subversive. Mr. Trump denounced the furor over Russian connections on Thursday as a “total witch hunt”  —   but it may not have helped his case that the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, echoed his words on Friday, saying, “This all looks like a witch hunt. ” On Friday, Mr. Trump posted a picture on Twitter of a meeting between Mr. Putin and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and wrote that “we should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. ” The issue has already had momentous consequences for the new administration. Michael T. Flynn lasted less than a month as national security adviser before being forced out for mischaracterizing his conversations with Mr. Kislyak. This week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions admitted to having meetings with Mr. Kislyak that he had not disclosed during his confirmation hearing. Mr. Sessions fended off demands that he resign but agreed to recuse himself from what may be the most important investigation his Justice Department is conducting: of Russian meddling in the election and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates colluded in those efforts. And that did not end the issue all nine Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called on Friday for Mr. Sessions to testify about his inaccurate denials that he had met with Russian officials during the campaign. Part of the problem underlying disputes over such contacts may be Mr. Trump’s pugnacious style, which usually leaves little room for nuance. At a news conference last month, he said that he had “nothing to do with Russia,” and that “to the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. ” In fact, vigorous reporting by multiple news media organizations is turning up multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians who serve in or are close to Mr. Putin’s government. There have been courtesy calls, policy discussions and business contacts, though nothing has emerged publicly indicating anything more sinister. A dossier of allegations on   contacts, compiled by a former British intelligence agent for Mr. Trump’s political opponents, includes unproven claims that his aides collaborated in Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. Current and former American officials have said that phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. Former diplomats and Russia specialists say it would have been absurd and contrary to American interests for the Trump team to avoid meetings with Russians, either during or since the campaign. John R. Beyrle, the United States ambassador to Moscow from 2008 to 2012, said he feared that “we’re beginning to   the Russians” by treating all contacts as suspicious. When he returns to Russia now, he said, “this real     frenzy” prompts some old acquaintances to refuse to meet him because they worry about being tagged as too friendly to the United States. “That’s the last behavior we should model  —   that simply meeting with a Russian official is wrong, without any knowledge of what was said,” Mr. Beyrle said. In a possible sign that Mr. Trump hopes to put behind him the impression that he is an uncritical admirer of Mr. Putin, he is expected to name Fiona Hill, a respected Brookings scholar, to the top Russia post at the National Security Council, according to administration officials. Ms. Hill, who served as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia from 2006 to 2009, is viewed as a Putin skeptic, if not as outspoken in her criticism of the Russian leader as are some other academics. Angela Stent, a Russia expert at Georgetown, said Ms. Hill was “realistic about Putin” and praised the 2013 book she wrote with Clifford G. Gaddy, “Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,” as the best biography of the Russian leader. It might take a Russia scholar to unpack the significance of particular meetings that are now coming to light in the glare of investigations and   politics. Rabbi Lazar, who has condemned critics of Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine, is the leader of the Hasidic   group in Russia, where it is a powerful organization running dozens of schools and offering social services across the country, while maintaining links to a lucrative financial donor network. Mr. Greenblatt, who handled outreach to Jews for the campaign, said that Rabbi Lazar was one of several Chabad leaders he had met during the campaign. He said the two men did not discuss broader United   relations and called the meeting “probably less than useful. ” Rabbi Lazar said they had spoken about   in Russia, Russian Jews in Israel and Russian society in general. While he meets with Mr. Putin once or twice a year, he said, he never discussed his meeting with Mr. Greenblatt with Kremlin officials. Joshua Nass, a public relations executive in New York, confirmed arranging the meeting between Mr. Lazar and Mr. Greenblatt. Mr. Gordon, the former Pentagon official, portrayed his meeting with Mr. Kislyak at the Republican convention  —   first reported by USA Today  —   as similarly unremarkable. After a panel discussion, he said, he spoke briefly with “dozens of ambassadors and senior diplomats” including Mr. Kislyak. During a brief chat with the ambassador, Mr. Gordon said, he “repeated some of the points made by the campaign on the importance of improving relations with Russia” but did not get into substantive policy matters. At a meeting to draft the Republican platform, Mr. Gordon, representing Mr. Trump’s views, opposed a delegate who wanted to call for providing “lethal defensive weapons” to Ukraine. Mr. Gordon said that proposal “was soundly defeated by the other delegates in the national security subcommittee meeting. ” There was no connection, he insisted, between his chat with Mr. Kislyak and the platform language. “Unfortunately some in the media have repeatedly tried to connect the dots where there was nothing to connect,” he said. The case of Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who was previously the Kiev manager of Mr. Manafort’s consulting company, Davis Manafort International, is more complicated. A dual citizen of Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Kilimnik worked years ago as a translator in the Russian military. He was hired by Mr. Manafort in 2005 after he was dismissed from the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute, an American   group, amid concerns that he was informing on its activities, according to a former employee, who said he could not speak publicly about personnel matters. From August until December of last year, Mr. Kilimnik was at least formally under investigation in Ukraine on suspicion of ties to Russian spy agencies, according to documents from Ukraine’s Parliament and the prosecutor general. A defense lawyer and a former Ukrainian prosecutor characterized the investigation as unserious and politically motivated, and the inquiry closed without charges against Mr. Kilimnik. Mr. Kilimnik, in an interview in Kiev, said he had never been questioned by Ukrainian law enforcement over connections to Russian spy agencies. “If there were any truth to me talking to any security service in the world, they would arrest me,” he said. In a recent interview, Mr. Manafort said he thought there was no chance Mr. Kilimnik was a Russian agent. In their phone calls last summer, he said, the two men discussed a range of matters  —   including news media reports that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic targets. But at the time, he said, he and other Trump campaign officials had no idea who was responsible for the cyberattacks.",0
803,North Korean Is Arrested in Killing of Kim Jong-un’s Half Brother - The New York Times,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   A man from North Korea has been arrested in the assassination of Kim   the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim   the Malaysian police announced Saturday. The man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, was arrested Friday evening, the police said, but they provided no further details. The police had been searching for four men, including at least one North Korean, who they believed had been involved in the attack on Mr. Kim on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Two women suspected of being involved in the attack, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, were arrested earlier in the week. A Malaysian man, described as the boyfriend of the Indonesian woman, was arrested and is said to be assisting the police in the investigation. On Friday, North Korea broke its silence on Mr. Kim’s assassination, demanding that the Malaysian authorities surrender the body and vowing to reject any   they conducted. The response to the assassination, in a statement by the North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, also accused the Malaysians of plotting to “besmirch” the North over the killing, heightening tensions between the two countries. The statement was read to reporters outside a Kuala Lumpur hospital where the body of Mr. Kim, 46, has been held since he was attacked on Monday at the airport. The police believe that the assassination was carried out by two women who struck Mr. Kim with a poisoned needle and wiped   poison on his face as he awaited a flight to Macau, where he lives with his family. Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said Friday that the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aishah, told the Malaysian police that she had thought she was engaged in a prank and had been paid a small amount for her participation. She told the police that she had not realized it was an assassination, he said. South Korean officials have said they suspect that the assassination was ordered by Kim   33, as part of his effort to consolidate power in the reclusive country, run by his family for nearly seven decades. Malaysian news media on Thursday quoted officials as saying that the North Korean government had requested the body. The ambassador’s statement on Friday did not identify the body as that of Kim  . But the statement, quoted by news agencies at the scene, said that the “Malaysian side forced the   without our permission and witnessing” and that “we will categorically reject the result of the   conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance. ” Channel NewsAsia, in its account of the ambassador’s response, quoted him as saying, “We will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our republic by politicizing this incident. ” No relatives of Kim   have come forward from Macau to claim the body. The South China Morning Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported on Friday that the relatives had been placed under police protection in Macau, fearing for their safety.",0
804,SURGEONS ADMIT THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS OUTDATED AND HARMFUL TO WOMEN,"Home › HEALTH › SURGEONS ADMIT THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS OUTDATED AND HARMFUL TO WOMEN SURGEONS ADMIT THAT MAMMOGRAPHY IS OUTDATED AND HARMFUL TO WOMEN 0 SHARES 
[10/28/16] ETHAN A. HUFF – Every year, millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms, a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a woman’s breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors. But surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice , which studies show isn’t even an effective screening tool, and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive it. 
The public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early, but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure, found that mammography is neither effective nor safe. After looking at data on more than 600,000 women between the ages of 39 and 74 who underwent the procedure on a routine basis, researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed. Many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy , resulting in their rapid demise. 
As published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good , because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer. Thus, the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments, and not at the forefront of women’s medicine. 
“If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women , who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily,” the authors concluded. Group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good 
One year after this review was published, a second one published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) came to a similar conclusion. A team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist, a clinical epidemiologist, a pharmacologist, an oncologic surgeon, a nurse scientist, a lawyer and a health economist, decided that the medical industry’s claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunk. 
They found that for every 1,000 women screened in the U.S. over a 10-year annual screening period beginning at age 50, one breast cancer death would be prevented, while a shocking 490 to 670 women would have a false positive, while 70 to 100 would undergo an unnecessary biopsy. Between three and 14 of these women, the study found, would also be over-diagnosed for a non-malignant form of cancer that never even would have become “clinically apparent.” 
This study out of Switzerland corroborates another out of Canada – the 2014 Canadian National Breast Screening Study – which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination. In other words, the procedure is completely unnecessary, and in many cases exceptionally harmful . 
And on and on the list goes, with data out of Norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isn’t all that it’s cracked up to be. U.S. data spanning the course of nearly 40 years shows that more women are over- or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully early-diagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization. This represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesn’t work. 
“I believe that if you did have a tumor, the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates, because that would spread it,” says general practitioner Dr. Sarah Mybill, as quoted in the documentary film The Promise . Post navigation",0
805,Le terrorisme régional protège Israël,"Le terrorisme régional vise à protéger les intérêts d'Israël Wed Oct 26, 2016 9:35AM Iran Le ministre iranien de la Défense, le général Hossein Dehqan. ©Tasnim #iran #terrorisme 
Selon le ministre iranien de la Défense, le général de brigade Hossein Dehqan, l'objectif de la création et de la propagation du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme dans la région est de protéger le régime israélien. 
Le général Hossein Dehqan, ministre iranien de la Défense, a indiqué, lors d'une réunion du comité stratégique de défense de ce ministère, que la création et l'extension du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme visaient à protéger les intérêts du régime israélien, à maintenir l'instabilité dans la région et à y prolonger la présence des forces d'occupation arrogantes. 
""Les États-Unis et leurs alliés régionaux et internationaux scandent des slogans humanitaires d'un côté, mais de l'autre ils donnent le feu vert aux groupes terroristes tels que Fatah al-Cham (ex-Front al-Nosra), les autorisant ainsi à enfermer les civils dans les zones de combat et à les utiliser comme boucliers humains pour endiguer les opérations antiterroristes de l'armée syrienne, ce qui assure la survie des terroristes,"" a dit le ministre iranien de la Défense. 
""Pourtant, l'une des priorités et des principales préoccupations des commandants du front de la Résistance, est de sauver le peuple et de préparer leur évacuation hors des régions non sécurisées. C'est avec ce même souci qu'ils ont sauvé, d'ores et déjà, la vie de milliers de gens sans défense"", poursuit-il. 
""Dans tout lieu où une opération antiterroriste se dirigeait vers la victoire, les États-Unis et leurs alliés ont recouru à des projets mensongers de cessez-le-feu et procédéà des démarches prétendument pacifistes, dans le but, en fait, de sauver les terroristes, alors qu'au moment où les terroristes commettaient crimes et massacres, ils n'avaient fait qu'observer le silence."", a regretté le général Dehqan. 
""Dès le début de la formation des groupes terroristes takfiristes, la RII avait mis en garde contre les maux inimaginables que causeraient ces derniers en menaçant la sécurité de la région, voire du monde entier. L'ordre de l'Arrogance poursuit toutefois tous ses soutiens à ces groupes extrémistes"", a-t-il rappelé. 
Le ministre iranien de la Défense a exigé alors que l'on mette fin à la crise régionale, ce qui n'est possible, selon le responsable iranien, qu'avec la fin du soutien des États-Unis et de leurs alliés au terrorisme, le rejet du projet de démembrement des pays de la région, la reconnaissance des gouvernements légaux et l'aide à la lutte contre le terrorisme.

806,WAR ON THE STREETS OF PARIS: Armed migrants fight running battles in the French capital,"By wmw_admin on November 3, 2016 Nick Gutteridge — Daily Express Nov 2, 2016 . 
The area around Stalingrad Metro station was turned into a refugee battleground as rival gangs of migrants set upon each other in shocking scenes of violence. 
Asylum seekers wearing hooded tops wielded makeshift clubs fashioned from lengths of wood which they used to bludgeon each other as horrified pedestrians looked on. 
The blood-curdling brawl erupted just yards from the Stalingrad Metro station, where a squalid migrant camp has popped up following the demolition of the Jungle. 
It was not immediately clear what sparked the early morning fight, but rival gangs of people smugglers have previously been involved in violent brawls in Calais. 
And despite the horrific brawl, a pro-migrant rally is apparently being organised to take place at the camp at 6pm tonight. 
The once peaceful neighbourhood, in Paris’ 10th Arrondissement, used to be a popular area with tourists, boasting a lively nightlife scene bustling with restaurants and bars. 
But worried residents have revealed how it has become a no go zone in recent weeks following the establishment of the refugee camp, which has brought squalor and violence. 
Thousands of migrants – mostly from Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan, and Eritrea – have pitched tents under the Metro station after the demolition of the Jungle hampered their attempts to reach Britain. Gangs of migrants armed with clubs and staves prowl the streets of the 10th Arrondissement, Paris, at night. Click to enlarge 
French police have tried and failed on many occasions to clear the squalid squat, but asylum seekers simply keep on returning and reestablishing it. 
There are now nore than 2,500 migrants pitching up in the makeshift camp, with locals saying the eyesore is ruining their businesses and making life a “living hell”. 
Residents in the once popular district say that the squatters are now becoming increasingly violent and dangerous, with increased reports of muggings. 
Faisal, a shopkeeper, told the French daily Le Figaro that Stalingrad locals are living in fear, threatening the future of his business. 
He said: “The stench of urine, faeces, and rubbish has made Stalingrad an insalubrious place to live. The place is dead – no-one wants to come here anymore. People are afraid to go out and lock themselves in. 
“I’m making less than €60 (£53) a day. A few more weeks like this and I’ll go bust! 
“French people have been kind to them. I know they’re desperate, but the least they can do is respect the law and try and integrate into French society.” 
Jeanne, another Stalingrad resident, told Le Figaro the migrants had become increasingly violent towards locals. 
She said: “Brazen migrants are snatching jewellery and handbags off passers-by – they’re even stealing bread. I’ve seen them beat people up too.” 
Police have raided the camp some 30 times in the past year, and on Monday French president François Hollande vowed to close the camp for good. 
But within 24 hours of a police operation to move migrants on tents had sprung up again, showing the uphill battle authorities in the French capital face to shut down such illegal encampments. 
Furious locals have demanded that the camp be closed once and for all, describing how they have heard “blood-curdling noises” coming from it in the middle of the night. 
Marie, who lives right next to the makeshift camp, told Le Figaro: “Life here has become unbearable. More than 2,500 squatters were evacuated in September, and now, less than two months later, they’re back. And now that the ‘Jungle’ camp has been closed, things are about to get even worse.” 
Another local, Monique, said that she was at “a loss for words” and “utterly distraught” over the situation. 
She said: “The streets are littered with rubbish and faeces. We can hear blood-curdling screams coming from the camp in the middle of the night.",0
807,Oscar Voter: Meryl Streep Only Nominated for Anti-Trump Speech,"One “brutally honest” Oscar voter says   nominee Meryl Streep played her role in this year’s Florence Foster Jenkins “like a clown”  —   and believes the actress was only awarded a nomination in return for delivering her infamous   Trump speech at last month’s Golden Globes. [“I thought Meryl [Streep in Florence Foster Jenkins] played it like a clown  —   she’s cute and adorable, but this woman didn’t matter to me in the end  —   but people are gaga over Meryl, and I think she solidified her nomination when she gave that speech at the Golden Globes,” the anonymous Oscar voter told the Hollywood Reporter.   The Academy member  —   a female member of the acting branch  —   added: “I don’t think she would have gotten nominated without it. ” In January, Streep used her Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes to rebuke President Trump for what she called his “disrespect” and his “violence” the actress also challenged a “principled press” to stand up to the president, and urged Hollywood to support the Committee to Protect Journalists. The    ’s Globes speech was lauded by the film industry and the press and set the tone for other awards shows to feature     screeds. Later that month, actors including Ashton Kutcher and Julia   trashed Trump and his executive order on immigration from the podium at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In February, a number of artists at the 59th annual Grammy Awards used their performances to make political statements, including Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest and Katy Perry. The Hollywood Reporter solicits opinions from anonymous Oscar voters every year in the week before the ceremony. While the responses of one Academy member are hardly an indication of how the entirety of the 6, 000+ members will ultimately vote, the   “brutally honest” ballots usually offer a refreshing perspective on the process. In addition to her comments on Streep, this year’s anonymous voter said La La Land star Emma Stone’s performance wasn’t “as wonderful” as everyone is saying, the   thriller Arrival “just sucked” and the Denzel   Davis starring Fences underwhelmed because “they just filmed the play. ” See the rest of the anonymous voter’s “brutally honest” ballot here.

808,Texas Enacts ’Anti-Sharia’ Law,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law House Bill 45, more commonly known as “American Laws for American Courts,” or ALAC. It prohibits the use of any foreign law in the state’s courts, specifically in family cases that involve marriage or   relationship matters. [One of the bill’s   Representative Jeff Leach ( ) thanked the governor, who signed HB 45 on Wednesday. Leach called the law “vitally important bill to further safeguard and protect our Constitutional rights!” In the last legislative session, Leach authored the comparable yet unsuccessful ALAC measure, House Bill 562.   HB 45 lead author Representative Dan Flynn ( ) also introduced similar past legislation that failed. In a recent press release, Flynn noted foreign law is often applied in Texas cases concerning divorce orders, child support, property settlements and sometime even, spouses enter into agreements to have foreign law applied to their disputes. “My colleagues and I here at the Texas Legislature want to make sure Texas judges never apply foreign law in Texas courts in violation of constitutional rights and the public policy of our state,” said Flynn. Under HB 45, Texas and U. S. law supersede all other laws. It prevents state judges from applying any foreign law because, in doing so, it infringes upon U. S. and Texas constitutional rights. The bill shields litigants in family law cases “against violations of constitutional rights and public policy in the application of foreign law” under the U. S. and Texas Constitutions, federal and judicial precedent, the Texas Family Code, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, among other protections. HB 45 makes no mention of any particular foreign nation, religion, or cultural practice but clarifies that “foreign law” means a rule, law, or code from a jurisdiction outside of the United States and it shall not override U. S and Texas law or their respective constitutions. It specifies that a “foreign judgment” means a ruling from a court, tribunal, or administrative adjudicator outside U. S. states and territories. The bill underscores that, in the event of any legal conflicts, “federal or state law prevails. ” In January 2015, Breitbart Texas confirmed in a report that an Islamic tribunal using Sharia law operated in Dallas. Dr. Taher   one of four attorneys who called themselves “judges” and not arbitrators, claimed the tribunal and its decisions were “voluntary. ”   said the tribunal operated under Sharia as a form of “  dispute resolution” in civil disputes in family and business cases but also admitted that when in conflict between Sharia and Texas law, “we follow Sharia law. ” In December 2015, Flynn asked Attorney General Ken Paxton “the extent to which current law authorizes or requires a judge of a state court to apply foreign law in certain family law disputes. ” Last year, Paxton ruled in a   nonbinding legal opinion: “Under Texas law, a court is not required in family law disputes to enforce a foreign law if enforcement would be contrary to Texas public policy or if it would violate a party’s basic right to due process. ” However, according to the Attorney General’s office, Paxton’s opinion only constituted a written interpretation of existing law and did not decide any law. The Texas chapter of the Council for   Relations (CAIR) called HB 45   law and lobbied for the state’s Muslim community to oppose the bill. “We believe it prevents Muslims from practicing their faith in areas such as Islamic marriage, divorce, funeral procedures, and civil agreements, they said in a press release. HB 45 requires the Texas Supreme Court adopt its rules by January 1, 2018. The law goes into effect on September 1, making Texas the 12th state to enact ALAC. The other states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington, according to ACT for America.

809,Chicago Police Board Chair: Windy City Needs Federal Help to Turn Tide on Crime - Breitbart,"During a January 7 interview on NPR, Chicago Police Board Chairwoman Lori Lightfoot said Chicago cannot end the city’s violence alone  —   they need federal help. [Chicago’s Lightfoot “also chairs Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Police Accountability Task Force. ”  According to NPR, Lightfoot said: We need to have more federal gun prosecutions in Chicago. Our federal partners from the U. S. attorney’s office, the ATF, the FBI need to be much more invested in this overall strategy. Chicago Police Department cannot tackle this issue by itself. Lighfoot’s statement came less than a week after   Donald Trump tweeted: Chicago murder rate is record setting  —   4, 331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can’t do it he must ask for Federal help!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017,  Think about it  —   Chicago saw over 4, 300 shootings for the year and nearly 800 murders, yet the left greeted Trump’s tweet with disdain. That disdain was epitomized by Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, who used a CNN   to claim: As with many of the  ’s tweets, we are forced to speculate as to the content of that federal “help,” but certainly Trump’s campaign rhetoric gives us plenty of evidence to understand his approach to criminal justice policy and more broadly, his views of people of color. Thus far, he has proposed a crackdown on communities that have suffered gravely from violence as well as a crisis of confidence in policing. This    strategy is fueled by Trump’s own ignorance of the communities most impacted by violence and his inability to account for the political and social causes that create violence. Maybe Van Cleve should have consulted Lightfoot before belittling Trump’s offer of federal help. Had she done so, she would have seen that Lightfoot also mentioned the problems resulting from a lack of confidence in policing. But Lightfoot suggested these problems cannot be used as an excuse to continue down a path which obviously isn’t working: In our history in this country, the police have been used as a bludgeon against communities of color, particularly black folks in the segregated South and frankly in the North in enforcing Jim Crow laws. We know that history, so this is not an easy and delicate topic. But it’s one that we have to dive in, we have to embrace because I said before I’m 100 percent convinced that if we don’t take steps in each other’s direction to try to address this strained and fractured relationship, those communities that are most in need, those people that are most desperate for quality and effective policing, they’re going to be further victimized by the failure in that relationship. A quick aside  —   If Lightfoot and Van Cleve really want to be honest about the past, they should be sure to point out that Democrats were the authors of Jim Crow and the authors of southern segregation. These things, along with gun control, were part of the Democrats’ plan for communities of color.

810,Looking Beyond November 8th - A Song of Oligarchy and Doom,"link Hello again ATS! Though we are two weeks out from Election Day as I sit to write these words – I find myself already looking beyond Tuesday, November the eighth and at some of the things that I think will happen between now and 2020 as well as what I think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that year's election. It won't be a popular opinion here on ATS, I am sure... But as of today I feel confident in saying that, short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event – this years election is very likely a done deal. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly be the next President of the United States. With just two weeks remaining before Election Day ( as of this writing ), the meta-analysis of polls shows Clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead. While it is true that Trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base, he has done little to successfully expand that base. The potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day. Having come to this view, I find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post 2016 world will look like. Frankly, gazing into my allegorical crystal ball, I see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon. Clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way. Election Night Blues The night of Tuesday, November the eighth could well be historic – in the worst of ways. This election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways. It has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has built-up a great deal of social tension. We currently sit atop a very, very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile. Passions will be flaring among many as we watch the Election results stream in on our televisions, computers and phones. Many of those watching will be deeply, deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race. In this climactic moment we, as a nation, will be perilously close to critical mass. One spark away from potential disaster... Four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media, Twitter, to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion... That minor celebrity was one Donald J. Trump: Source Imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this Election night. Imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger. Then stop imagining and take a deep breath... Such a reaction is not just possible – given the evidence, it is more than likely the probable outcome. Trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged, that they have no voice and that he is ""the only one"" who can save them. This is a very, very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry. Most Trump supporters, obviously, will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race – even if they personally feel that the outcome of the Election was not legitimate. However some Trump supporters, those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling ""the alt right"" very well could take to the streets in rage. Given some of the fringe support that Trump enjoys, I would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe. The rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late – and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally... Across the line. Blunty put – if Election night comes and Trump loses – and if he takes to Twitter as he did four years ago – it could well result in a very long and bloody night. A catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame. A night that could well poison our nation for years to come. Much Ado About Trump TV Many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that Trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation... Presumably a news network or service of some kind. I count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time. However where I differ is that I don't see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer. While I do think that Trump's original thoughts ( or more the thoughts of those who influence Trump ) was to create a new media Conservative news venue... I think that it's now grown into something more. I think that Trump TV ( Or whatever they end up calling it - ""Trump TV"" is too generic. There's no inherent propaganda value in the name. I think something more like ""Trump's MAGA Network"" is probably more on point. ) will be used as a device to begin a new political party. More accurately to succeed where others have previously failed ( I’m looking at you Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck ) by congealing the various ""Patriot"", ""Tea Party"" and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity – a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal. My prediction is that Donald Trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement – using this new network much as he currently utilizes his Twitter feed... A platform for him to vent his late night frustrations, angers and insecurities. His name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and Trump will be the face of it all. The most frequent speaker and guest. Imagine if The Apprentice had been a 24/7/365 live streaming show – and Trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind... That is how I see Trump TV. However I don't see Trump being the driving force behind the actual message. Trump is a brand, after all. He has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didn't build, shows that he didn't create and ideas he didn't originate. Trump works as a spokesperson – the guy who says ""I’m not only the President of... But I'm also a member"". The real people behind the curtain will be The Mercers ( Robert and Rebekah ), Steve Bannon and, to a lesser degree, Roger Ailes. As for on camera talents? I think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be Hannity, O'Reilly and Lahren – though I'm honestly not personally sure if O'Reilly will make the jump. Money is money, after all, and Big Daddy Bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the Fox news heap as his career winds down. Regardless, however, of who wins the backstage power war ( Other than the Mercers who are a lock ) and the on camera positions... The network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and I think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming 4-8 years. Particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics.",0

812,Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence,"Schools All Over America Are Closing On Election Day Due To Fears Of Violence   
Will this be the most chaotic election day in modern American history? All across the nation, schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears. Traditionally, schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people, they usually have lots of parking, and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily. But now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place. According to Fox News , “voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere.” Just a couple days ago , I shared with you a survey that found that 51 percent of all Americans are concerned about violence happening on election day, and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach November 8th. 
Many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence. The following comes from Fox News … 
Several schools across the nation have decided to close on Election Day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail. 
The fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways, endangering students. 
“If anybody can sit there and say they don’t think this is a contentious election, then they aren’t paying much attention,” Ed Tolan, the Falmouth, Maine police chief, said Tuesday. His community has already called off classes on Nov. 8 and an increased police presence will be felt around town. 
And without a doubt, voting locations are “soft targets” that often have little or no security. We have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past, but we also need to realize that times have changed. I believe that there is wisdom in what Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp told reporters … 
“There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn’t have 15 or 20 years ago,” said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. “ What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something? If that happens at a school, then that’s certainly concerning.” 
All it is going to take is a single incident to change everything. 
Let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that. 
Another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud. This is something that Donald Trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail. For instance, just consider what he told a rally in Pennsylvania … 
“We don’t want to lose an election because you know what I’m talking about,” Trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in Manheim, Pa., earlier this month. “Because you know what? That’s a big, big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody has the guts to talk about it. So go and watch these polling places .” 
And of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines. In Illinois this week, one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from Republicans to Democrats… 
Early voting in Illinois got off to a rocky start Monday, as votes being cast for Republican candidates were transformed into votes for Democrats. 
Republican state representative candidate Jim Moynihan went to vote Monday at the Schaumburg Public Library. 
“I tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent,” Moynihan said. “You could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when I tried to vote for a Republican and the machine registered a vote for a Democrat.” 
In addition, if you keep up with my work on The Economic Collapse Blog , then you already know that a number of voters down in Texas have reported that their votes were switched from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . 
Well, it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the Clinton Foundation … 
According to OpenSecrets, the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of The McCarthy Group. 
The McCarthy group is a major donor to the Clinton Foundation – apparently donating 200,000 dollars in 2007 – when it was the largest owner of United States voting machines. Or perhaps the 200,000 dollars went to paying Bill Clinton for speeches? 
Either way, it doesn’t look good. 
After everything that we saw in 2012 , I am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines. 
But Democrats don’t like poll observers, because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters… 
“It’s un-American, but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that ,” Ari Berman, author of the 2016 book “ Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America ,” previously told The Christian Science Monitor. “Voting was very, very dangerous. I don’t think anyone’s suggesting that we’re at the same place today. I just think the loss of the [official poll observers] is going to be really problematic.” 
Without a doubt, this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades, and I have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier. 
But will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country ? 
If that is the outcome after all that we have been through, it will be exceedingly depressing indeed.

814,"Exclusive — Amid Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 Push, Mississippi’s Chris McDaniel Preps for Potential 2018 Senate Run - Breitbart","Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, a hardline conservative who nearly toppled Sen. Thad Cochran ( ) in the 2014 midterm primaries, told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday evening he is considering launching another bid for the U. S. Senate in 2018. [This new bid would come against Sen. Roger Wicker ( ) a different but similar U. S. Senator from the Magnolia State, amid concerns over House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2. 0 plan, the “American Health Care Act. ”  McDaniel told Breitbart News: I am definitely considering another run for U. S. Senate, for precisely the reason that now is the time when Mississippi’s conservatives should be leading the nation in the fight against Obamacare. Rather than championing conservative reform in D. C. Mississippi’s federal delegation  —   and Roger Wicker in particular  —   has been silent. Mississippians are among the most conservative people in the republic. We shouldn’t have to beg our Senators to fight for us. Wicker has until now remained publicly silent on the bill from Ryan and House GOP leaders, even though Ryan’s legislation does not repeal Obamacare, keeps in place the individual mandate but shifts the recipient of the penalty payment from a tax collected by the government to a fee collected by insurance companies, keeps the Obamacare Cadillac Tax in place indefinitely —  among many other serious concerns. Republicans   are rising up against it, from the House Freedom Caucus to Sens. Rand Paul ( ) and Mike Lee ( ). Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) who does not support the concept, says it does not have enough support to pass the Senate —  and Sen. Susan Collins ( ) a moderate, says it will not pass the Senate either and that it is dead on arrival should it even reach that chamber. But it is unlikely to get there. The House Freedom Caucus, aides say, is united against the bill, and that is more than enough members to crush it. But many House Republicans outside the House Freedom Caucus are also against the legislation, their offices tell Breitbart News, with as many as “70 or more” Republicans against Ryan’s bill, according to one aide. Paul told Breitbart News in a recent interview that Ryan appears to be misleading the president when it comes to this bill’s realistic chances in the House —  and that it really does appear this bill will fail. An aide in Wicker’s Senate office, Ryan Taylor, told Breitbart News that Wicker suports Ryan’s Obamacare 2. 0 legislation even though it does not repeal Obamacare. He claimed inaccurately in his statement to Breitbart News that the bill does repeal Obamacare. Taylor also attempted to blame President Trump for the proposal, stating inaccurately that it was “the President’s proposal,” not Ryan’s bill. “Sen. Wicker is working with President Trump, Vice President Pence, and most Republicans to pass the President’s proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Taylor said, providing —  when Breitbart News offered him an opportunity to amend that part of his statement and his claim the bill repeals Obamacare —  a screenshot of President Trump’s Tweet announcing that Ryan rolled out the bill and that it is up “for review and negotiation. ” “Sen. Wicker is running for   and has a campaign manager,” Taylor added, connecting Breitbart News with that campaign manager, Justin Brasell. “Senator Wicker is taking nothing for granted in his   campaign,” Brasell said in a statement. “He has hired a campaign manager, is actively working to raise money and is organizing grassroots support in all 82 counties. He will be ready to once again earn the support of Mississippi voters in 2018, regardless of who runs. ” McDaniel has proven he can win a statewide U. S. Senate race in Mississippi. Back in 2014, McDaniel won more votes than Cochran in the primary, but since both finished under 50 percent plus one vote, it was kicked to a runoff election. In the runoff, McDaniel won more Republican votes than Cochran. And Cochran only won because of a   effort to get Democrats to cross over to vote in an underhanded way in the GOP primary. McDaniel was endorsed, too, by   Donald Trump. Of McDaniel, Trump said, he “is strong, he is smart  he wants things to change in Washington. ” I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel. He is strong, he is smart  he wants things to change in Washington.  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2014,  In response to President Trump’s endorsement of McDaniel for U. S. Senate back in 2014, Brasell told Breitbart News that “this is a different race” and “Senator Wicker works well with President Trump. ” When Brasell was pressed on why, then, Wicker is not supporting efforts to repeal Obamacare, he told Breitbart News: “He is working with President Trump to repeal and replace Obamacare. ” But since the only bill that Wicker’s team is publicly supporting right now on this matter is a bill that does not repeal Obamacare, the American Health Care Act —  or Obamacare 2. 0 from Paul Ryan —  Breitbart News asked Brasell in a   question what specific legislation other than that bill he is backing that repeals Obamacare. He has not answered. The more important implication than this McDaniel news out of Mississippi, however, is that Ryan’s failure here to deliver a healthcare bill that actually does repeal Obamacare may unleash a wave of primary challenges against incumbent Republicans nationwide in both the House and Senate in 2018. With Republicans in the majority in both the House and Senate, and with a Republican president, a primary challenge wave is the last thing anyone in the Republican Party wants. But Ryan may have just triggered it.",0
815,BOOM: Short List of People More Inspiring Than Michelle Obama,"Pinterest 
Regan Pifer reports apparently the White House can only distribute criticism and cannot receive it. Must be a problem with their shipping department… 
In a move that Putin or Kim Jong-un would admire, the White House issued a warning to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump this week and told him First lady Michelle Obama is off limits. 
Where oh where did the First Amendment go? Oh where, oh where can it be? 
As reported by Newsmax.com : 
The White House sent a warning to Donald Trump Thursday: Attacking Michelle Obama is off limits. 
The first lady blasted Trump without actually naming him during a campaign speech for Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday. The White House followed up with its own message for the Republican presidential candidate. 
“I can’t think of a bolder way for Donald Trump to lose even more standing than he already has than by engaging the first lady of the United States,” principal deputy White House press secretary Eric Schultz said on Air Force One… 
…Mrs. Obama’s comments are some of the most forceful of a week in which scores of Republican leaders abandoned Trump… 
So, while First lady Michelle Obama condemns Trump’s remarks, in an attempt to catapult Hillary Clinton to the White House, Trump is left with little alternative than to simply let her speak without defending himself. 
Ahhh, the freedom of censorship… 
As Michelle Obama told a packed audience of Trump’s remarks, “I can’t stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way I could not have predicted. I know this is a campaign, but this isn’t about politics. It’s about basic human decency.” 
Agreed. Basic human decency is letting someone respond to the comments you have made against them. 
But let’s campaign for the Hillz–a compulsive, ill liar. 
Make egregious attacks against her opponent, then hide behind the First lady shield. 
That lacks human decency. That is politics.",0
816,‘More Artists Are Going to Boycott’: The Grammys Face Fallout After Fraught Awards - The New York Times,"Before the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, the music industry murmured about what it might mean for Adele to once again sweep the top awards, leaving Beyoncé snubbed in the major categories and with her third loss for album of the year. Having long faced accusations that the Grammys overlook young, progressive black artists  —   the last black woman to win album of the year was Lauryn Hill in 1999  —   the Recording Academy faced a potential backlash for going   on a white, traditionalist choice like Adele. Indeed, it happened again. Now, building on a conversation that was already bubbling, some artists and industry observers are considering the potential fallout. “More and more artists are going to boycott and step away,” Laura Stylez, a   of “Ebro in the Morning” on the New York   and RB station Hot 97, said in an interview, citing the absence of Drake, Frank Ocean, Justin Bieber and Kanye West from this year’s show, despite their major eligible releases and nominations. “You don’t want to lose today’s generation. They feel like they’re not represented. ” Charlamagne Tha God, an influential radio personality from “The Breakfast Club” on Power 105. 1, named Grammy voters his “Donkey of the Day” for their album of the year selection. “I tell artists all the time: Go where you’re celebrated, not where you’re tolerated,” he said, adding that Beyoncé had been “robbed. ” “They absolutely, positively got it wrong,” he said. “The Grammy committee should all feel foolish this morning, because even Adele acknowledged that she should not have won album of the year. ” Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister and herself a Grammy winner this year for best RB performance, tweeted her dismay not long after Sunday’s final award was presented, linking to an earlier diatribe by the singer Frank Ocean. Mr. Ocean, one of the most critically adored artists of the streaming generation, had declined to submit his music for consideration at this year’s Grammys, calling the boycott his “Colin Kaepernick moment. ” In a blog post after insinuations from Grammy producers that his absence was because of a disappointing performance at the 2013 show, Mr. Ocean called out the Recording Academy for what he said was a “cultural bias,” referring specifically to last year’s show, in which Taylor Swift’s “1989” won album of the year over the rapper Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly. ” After Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” lost to Adele’s “25” on Sunday, Terrence Henderson, an executive at Mr. Lamar’s label, Top Dawg Entertainment, also expressed his frustration. “Maybe Frank had a point,” he wrote on Twitter. This year’s show was not entirely homogeneous. In addition to a Prince tribute and exemplary performances by Beyoncé and A Tribe Called Quest, Chance the Rapper won three awards, including best new artist, for what was essentially an online mixtape. But the broader pattern was hard to ignore. In the last five years especially, albums by Mr. Ocean, Mr. Lamar and Beyoncé have been passed over for the top award in favor of releases by white artists: Mumford  Sons, Daft Punk, Beck, Taylor Swift and Adele. Though Beyoncé has 62 nominations and 22 wins overall, most have come in the designated RB categories, with only one in the big three of record, song or album of the year. “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” won best song in 2010. Only 10 black artists have ever won album of the year the last was Herbie Hancock, then 67, for a collection of Joni Mitchell covers in 2008. In light of Adele’s sweep on Sunday, the presentation of the award for best urban contemporary album, a minor hodgepodge of a category, to Beyoncé for “Lemonade” couldn’t help but feel like a consolation prize. She used her one speech on the telecast to highlight the importance of her children’s seeing themselves reflected at “the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys. ” Beyond that, Beyoncé, who is stingy with her extemporaneous commentary, has not spoken about her Grammy defeat. But she did have a surprise planned, win or lose: A new song with DJ Khaled and her husband Jay Z, released exclusively on his streaming platform Tidal, called “Shining. ” “All of this winning, I’ve been losing my mind,” she sings, seemingly above it all. “Don’t try to slow me down. ”",0
817,"VIDEO: Idiot Destroys Trump’s Hollywood Star, Gets BAD NEWS Seconds Later","VIDEO: Idiot Destroys Trump’s Hollywood Star, Gets BAD NEWS Seconds Later Posted on October 26, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
Social media is buzzing about Donald Trump’s Hollywood star being destroyed in California. However, it seems that the man responsible just came forward by making a video – but his stupid stunt turned around and slapped him big time when he got bad news just a short time later. 
Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump’s Hollywood star in Los Angeles, California has sustained it’s fair share of vandalism. From people spray painting a Nazi swastika on it to literally taking a crap on it, the most recent stunt was far worse than all the rest. 
Seemingly trying to destroy the star for good, a man, who has since been identified as James Otis, used a sledgehammer and pickaxe in order to help him vandalize the well-known emblem. All caught on video by shocked onlookers, Otis could be seen hitting the star with a pickaxe resulting two plates breaking free. 
As it turns out, those plates depicted both the Hollywood star television emblem and the presidential hopeful’s name. Since that point in time, Otis has come forward in order to claim his fame – but it took mere seconds for him to realize that not everything is exactly going according to his poorly thought out plan when he promptly got some bad news. Donald Trump’s star before (left) and after (right) (Source: TMZ ) 
Although the man states that he’s willing to go to jail for his crimes, he may not have actually known what he was getting himself into. According to The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the plaque is (or was) worth a whopping $30,000, meaning that Otis admitted to a felony. 
Felony vandalism (damaging over $10,000 worth of property) can result in imprisonment for up to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $50,000. Otis stated that he does intend to turn himself in and has already hired a lawyer, but we’ll see just how tough he is when he has to face a judge. 
The tough guy wannabe later added that he “wanted to face Trump in court,” but the idiot must have forgotten that he didn’t destroy Trump’s property, but rather, the state of California’s. Making matters worse for himself, Otis states that he intends to sell the plaques taken from the star on election day, claiming he will donate all the money to Trump’s so-called sexual assault victims. 
Unfortunately for him, the more he talked, the more trouble he got himself into. After all, most people know that selling or buying stolen property is a criminal offense as well. We all know that Hillary Clinton’s voters aren’t the smartest in society, but this guy may just take the cake. Then again, he’ll have plenty of time to think about how dumb he is while he’s pissing his life away behind bars.",0
818,"“He Won Because The Elites WANT HIM There, The Global Economy WILL Collapse”","
This article was written by Melissa Dykes and originally published at The Daily Sheeple . 
Editor’s Comment: Though Trump’s election was a great victory/rebuke over the dictates and controls of the financial oligarchy that own and run this nation, the American people are not out of the woods yet. Quietly but constantly in the background of the entire Obama Administration, the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program that combined unlimited QE with zero percent interest rates has absolutely wrecked this country and its economic stability. 
The system as we know it cannot be sustained. Yellen and co. have been simply waiting for the right time to let the other shoe drop – namely, after it could influence the election even further in the direction of Trump’s populist uprising. Unfortunately, he will now be largely blamed for the great destruction that is scheduled to fall upon this nation. In fact, that is the very reason that Brandon Smith of Alt-Market.com attributed to Trump’s victory when he predicted his election many months ago. 
Something big is coming… prepare yourselves accordingly. 
How Alt-Market Predicted Trump’s Win Months in Advance: “He won because the elites WANT HIM THERE, the global economy WILL collapse” 
by Melissa Dykes
While many of us in the alternative media and especially those researchers of Clinton crimes are breathing a big fat sigh of relief that anybody but Hillary is headed to the White House in 2017, Brandon Smith of Alt Market is warning us all not to get too comfortable… and with history on his side here, we should listen to him.
Despite what looked like a rigged, fraudulent Hillary win orchestrated from the top down with the entire establishment machine behind her, Trump won the election. In an election year that would have otherwise seen record low voter turnout, the specter of Hillary that led to Trump’s victory has now given the people a reason to believe their vote actually matters again, an extra boon to further relegitimize the corrupt system running things in this country.
But Smith reminds us that if Trump is walking into the Oval Office in January, it is only because the elites decided to put him there in advance — and for a reason.
First it should be noted that Smith accurately predicted that Brexit would pass , even when the majority of the alt media was reporting that there was no way it possibly could. Was it another victory for the people?
No, it was predetermined well in advance:
“The mainstream media has been consistently comparing Trump supporters to Brexit supporters, and Trump himself has hitched his political wagon to the Brexit. This fits perfectly with the globalist narrative that populists and conservatives are killing the global economy and placing everyone at risk. “
Then he accurately predicted a Trump win … but not because voting actually matters:
“U.S. elections are indeed controlled, and have been for decades, primarily through the false left/right paradigm. However, as I have been pointing out since I correctly predicted the success of the Brexit referendum, I don’t think that Clinton is the choice of the elites.”
“To be clear, my position is that Trump is slated to take the White House and that this is by design. This has been my position since before Trump won the Republican Primaries, it was my position when the election cycle began, it has never changed, nor have my views on the reasons for this outcome ever changed…”
Smith says regardless of whether or not Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment candidate, his win means the global economic collapse the system has been holding off on will finally come to pass — as planned — under Trump’s watch:
“…Even if Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment conservative, his entry into the Oval Office will seal the deal on the economic collapse, and will serve the globalists well. The international banks need only pull the plug on any remaining life support to the existing market system and allow it to fully implode, all while blaming Trump and his conservative supporters…”
He will be the perfect scapegoat for something the alternative media have known is coming for a long, long time.
Now Smith is spelling it out :
The bottom line is, Trump is on the way to the White House because the elites WANT HIM THERE. Now, many liberty proponents, currently in a state of elation, will either ignore or dismiss the primary reason why I was able to predict the Brexit and a Trump win. These will probably be some of the same people that were arguing with me only weeks ago that the elites would NEVER allow Trump in office.
So, to clarify: 
Trump may or may not be aware that he and his conservative followers have been positioned into a a trap. We will have to wait and see how he behaves in office (and he WILL be in office, despite the claims of some that the elites will try to “stop him” before January). My primary point is THAT IT DOES NOT MATTER, at least not at this stage. The elites will initiate a final collapse of the global economy under Trump’s watch (this will probably escalate over the course of the next six months), and they WILL blame him and conservatives in general. This IS going to happen. The elites play the long game, and so must we.
And there you have it.
It’s not much of a secret that the economy is being artificially propped up. The Fed’s QE stimulus programs are no longer working. We know it can’t remain this way forever.
And even though everyone just feels so much relief that we’ve all been spared the nightmare of Hillary Clinton climbing into yet another seat of even more power, we can’t just assume we’re all going to skip off into happy magical fairy sprinkle land unscathed.
Sure, the people have spoken, but it’s only the illusion of power that we’re seeing play out now. The Powers That Shouldn’t Be running this insanity circus always have a plan… how else have they gotten away with controlling the globe for at least the past century?
After saying “I told ya so,” Smith issued a final warning that we shouldn’t be so naive:
While millions of Americans are celebrating Trump’s win today, I will remain even more vigilant. The party is just getting started, folks. Don’t get too comfortable.
Sadly, we can’t ignore decades of New World Order history here just because we’re relieved a psychopath like Hillary lost the election. Smith is right. We’d all do well to listen to him and get prepared for what’s coming.
2017 is going to be a bumpy ride .

820,Senate Confirms Scott Pruitt as E.P.A. Head - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt on Friday to run the Environmental Protection Agency, putting a seasoned legal opponent of the agency at the helm of President Trump’s efforts to dismantle major regulations on climate change and clean water  —   and to cut the size and authority of the government’s environmental enforcer. Senators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E. P. A. ’s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency’s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from   states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him. Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general’s office is under order to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep. Democrats, environmental groups and even current E. P. A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt’s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate. Both opponents and supporters of Mr. Pruitt’s say he is well positioned to carry out Mr. Trump’s campaign trail promises to dismantle the agency and slash its ranks of employees. Mr. Trump vowed to “get rid” of the agency “in almost every form. ” A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors. Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E. P. A. regulations. Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships. “I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them  —   and shame on us if we didn’t,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. “Mr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a   and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E. P. A. ,” Mr. Carper said. “Like many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, ‘Did he mean it?’ With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it’s clear he did. ” For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt’s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president’s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E. P. A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting   power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell’s   state. Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about   global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules. “Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E. P. A. ,” Mr. McConnell said. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the   consequences of E. P. A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the  . ” Mr. McConnell added: “We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years. ” Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House’s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the   to   legal process of withdrawing the   climate rules and replacing them with looser, more   rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate   greenhouse gases in the first place. Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress’s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.",0
821,"Crickets, Snakes, Crabs: A Mix of Fact and Fraud in New York’s Subway - The New York Times","Perhaps you’ve heard the saying, “You can’t make this stuff up. ” So, so wrong. It turns out the subway cricket lady was a prank. The   subway riders? Flimflam. Even, it seems, that      New Yorker the Pizza Rat may have been schooled and rehearsed for the camera. Is no crazy thing sacred, or at least genuine? The subway cricket lady, for those not paying attention, was videotaped last week on the D train as she was supposedly trying to sell crickets and worms out of a bucket. As the story went, a group of teenagers bumped into her and she flew off the handle and dumped the crickets and worms into the train. “Straphangers Go Berserk After Woman Tosses Bugs in Subway Car,” The New York Post reported. The emergency brake was pulled  —   a truly useless maneuver, bringing the train to a dead stop on the Manhattan Bridge. The first reports of this were accompanied by a cellphone video of the chaos. Then another video surfaced and the   reporters Rafi Schwartz and Soraya Auger of Vox noticed that it was quite a polished bit of filmmaking. Through advanced interrogation techniques, they extracted an admission of responsibility from the woman who posted it. She declared herself to be the   and said she was engaged in performance art having something to do with homelessness. The bucket of bugs was knocked out of her hands by another member of her troupe. Who knows how many other passengers were part of the staging or just fated to be along for the ride. Eventually, the brakes were reset and the train moved off the bridge. On Tuesday, having been exposed, she was arrested on a charge of reckless endangerment by the police, who had previously been willing to let her slide. So actually, you can make this stuff up, and be believed. But why bother? The implausible is the daily bread of the subway, served without irony. Real events: Trysts. Preachers. Makeup artists. The “    ” acrobats. Buckets of dead crabs, as Gothamist reported, and a condom tied to a pole on the F train, apparently for weeks, and seemingly, we regret to say,  . All manner of live creatures: chickens, frogs, goldfish, cats, a monkey. And of course, microbes, by the kajillion. (The Central Intelligence Agency took it upon itself in 1966 to see how quickly germs would be propelled through the tunnels via the piston effect of moving trains. At strategic spots, the C. I. A. people dropped light bulbs filled with what they termed innocuous bacteria, then measured how far they traveled.) Then there is the snake guy. “He wasn’t talking at all,” Conor C. Walsh remembered. “He had an intern, a young kid helper, and a duffel bag filled with five or six snakes. ” It was Halloween night two years ago, and Mr. Walsh and some friends were on a train that was moseying to Williamsburg. At first, the man draped the snakes on an overhead handrail. Then he walked through the car with them. “Unless you really protested, he was putting them on people,” Mr. Walsh, 28, said. “There was a   woman shrieking and screaming. He wasn’t going to put it on her. ” Some of the passengers seemed thrilled about having a snake coiled around their bodies. “I don’t like them at all,” Mr. Walsh said. “It’s my one thing. I kept him away, at all times. I was just imagining his apartment, or his warehouse, wherever he kept them. ” Although the man did not speak, he appeared to be marketing the snakes. “He had business cards that he passed out,” Mr. Walsh said, “but no one was walking away with a snake. ” Mr. Walsh, who grew up in New York and teaches high school in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, is also a singer and guitarist with the indie band  . He has put subway exotica to excellent use in his music. “There are days when you hate the subways and days when you meet some awesome people,” he said. “I sat down next to this guy one time, and we got talking, so I asked him what he did. He said: ‘I’m a shaman. I’m an actual shaman. I help my clients speak to the spirits.’ He was a nice kid, 26. Had gone to Hampshire, that college in Massachusetts. ” Mr. Walsh turned his encounter with the young shaman into a brisk, fun pop tune, “Shaman,” which begins: “I met a shaman who grew up in Queens   On the D train his knees touching me. ” After all, there’s magical realism to spare.",0
822,Sessions’s Potential Deputy Faces a Stern Test on Russia Inquiries - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Known as a     prosecutor, Rod J. Rosenstein was expected to sail through Senate confirmation to be the Justice Department’s   . But that process has become enmeshed in the drama surrounding questions about President Trump’s campaign ties to Russia. Mr. Rosenstein faces the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday as the president’s nominee for deputy attorney general. In that post, he would oversee investigations into Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, because Attorney General Jeff Sessions removed himself from any such cases after the disclosure last week that he had misled Congress about meeting twice with the Russian ambassador. Democrats who have otherwise expressed confidence in Mr. Rosenstein’s prosecutorial skills said they were skeptical that he  —   or anyone besides an independent outside counsel  —   would not be subject to political pressure while overseeing such an investigation. “Rosenstein has a good reputation as a career prosecutor, but this is going to test him, and I worry about the integrity of the Justice Department,” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said in a telephone interview Monday. Through his office, Mr. Rosenstein declined to comment. The F. B. I. which is overseen by the Justice Department, is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. The House Intelligence Committee has also opened an inquiry into whether Russia tried to influence the election. Mr. Rosenstein, who received his law degree from Harvard, is nothing if not a survivor after nearly 12 years as the United States attorney for Maryland under both Republican and Democratic presidents. He was one of only three United States attorneys appointed by the administration of President George W. Bush to be kept in the job by President Barack Obama in 2009  —   and the only one to last all eight years of Mr. Obama’s administration. His supporters say he has been willing to take on politically charged cases throughout his career. Two decades ago, Mr. Rosenstein worked on Kenneth Starr’s independent counsel investigation into the Whitewater affair, earning three convictions related to President Bill Clinton’s business dealings in Arkansas. In a   leak case last year, Mr. Rosenstein extracted a guilty plea from James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, a retired   Marine general and a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. had asked Mr. Rosenstein and another prosecutor to handle the investigation after accusations the Obama administration was behind leaks related to a cyberattack and drone strikes. Just last week, Mr. Rosenstein announced the indictments of seven Baltimore police officers on conspiracy and racketeering charges. “He has a reputation for being a straight shooter who plays it right down the middle, and those are important qualities for a deputy attorney general,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, who was the top aide to former Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates and is now in private practice in Washington at the Linklaters law firm. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as the acting attorney general five weeks ago after she refused to defend the initial version of his travel ban in court because she said she was uncertain it was legal. Mr. Leahy, the Vermont senator, said that her firing made the debate over Mr. Rosenstein’s nomination even more important, with “that kind of precedent” hanging over him. Douglas F. Gansler, a former Maryland attorney general, said on Monday, “Rod is about as apolitical a person as you can imagine, which is why he could survive eight years in a Democratic administration after being named by a Republican. ” “Would he stand up to the political winds of President Trump?” he said. “I’d think yes. ” The Justice Department said Monday that if Mr. Rosenstein was confirmed, he would oversee any investigations related not only to the Trump campaign, but also to the president’s transition after the Nov. 8 election. In announcing on Thursday that he would remove himself from such a case, Mr. Sessions had left open the possibility that he might still oversee matters related to the transition period. But in a letter to leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee late on Monday, he said that his recusal “would include any such matters,” as well. That question is important because Michael T. Flynn, who served as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser for less than a month, admitted that he had contacts with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, during the transition. Some Democrats have said that those contacts  —   which helped force Mr. Flynn’s resignation  —   might have been illegal. Mr. Sessions also spoke at least twice with Mr. Kislyak: once at the Republican National Convention in July, and again at his Senate office in September, two months before the election. When asked at his confirmation hearing in January about a news article about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, Mr. Sessions responded, “I didn’t have, did not have communications with the Russians. ” Democrats accused him of lying to the committee by not disclosing his conversations with the ambassador, and they called for the Justice Department to open a perjury investigation. In his letter on Monday, Mr. Sessions said that “my answer was correct,” because he said his conversations with the ambassador were not political in nature. In answering the question, Mr. Sessions wrote, “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian ambassador over the years, because the question did not ask about them. ” Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, said he was satisfied with the attorney general’s explanation. “I appreciate Attorney General Sessions’s quick action to clear up confusion about his statement,” Mr. Grassley said Monday.",0
823,‘Suicide Squad’ Tops Box Office for Second Weekend - The New York Times,"LOS ANGELES  —     anthropomorphic food. Meryl Streep as a clueless opera singer. A furry, folksy Disney dragon. Bank robbers in   West Texas. It was a weekend of unusually   new offerings at North American theaters, and it worked out well for Hollywood  —   for the most part. As expected, “Suicide Squad” (Warner) led the box office pack for a second weekend, taking in an estimated $43. 8 million, for a new domestic total of $222. 9 million, according to comScore. But the film also   dropping 67 percent weekend to weekend, as its Rotten Tomatoes grade from critics caught up to it and the fanboy audience turned toward the   animated “Sausage Party. ” Backed by a crackerjack marketing campaign, “Sausage Party” (Sony) collected about $33. 6 million, beating the prerelease expectations of some box office analysts and proving once again that audiences respond to original concepts. “Sausage Party,” with character voices provided by Seth Rogen and Kristen Wiig, was also relatively cheap: Sony and Annapurna Pictures split the $19 million in production expenses. “Pete’s Dragon” (Disney) was third. Ticket sales totaled $21. 5 million, a bit less than anticipated. This   remake charmed most critics, but its crowd appeal was limited. Disney said on Sunday that 33 percent of the   audience was under the age of 12. “Pete’s Dragon” cost about $65 million to make. Playing in less than half as many theaters, the Meryl Streep vehicle “Florence Foster Jenkins” (Paramount) began its run with $6. 6 million in ticket sales, on par with expectations for a period film aimed at older women. (Paramount said on Sunday that 97 percent of the audience was over the age of 25.) While Ms. Streep has lost some of her box office sizzle in recent years, she continues to be adored by critics, receiving strong enough reviews in this modestly budgeted film to spark early awards buzz. Also of note: “Hell or High Water” (Lionsgate and CBS Films) a $12 million Texas heist thriller that has received euphoric reviews and stars Jeff Bridges, began a slow,   rollout, arriving in 32 theaters and collecting $592, 000, for a hefty   average of $18, 500.",0
824,Health Insurers Plan Rate Hikes for Obamacare Exchanges - Breitbart,"Several health insurers will raise premiums by roughly 20 percent on plans sold through Obamacare exchanges. [The biggest Obamacare rate hikes will take place in Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, which will ask for premiums on average higher than 30 percent in 2018. In Maryland, the average premium from CareFirst will rise by at least 50 percent. Oregon, North Carolina, and Maine health insurers will raise premiums by 20 percent or higher.  The health insurers’ rate hikes reflect the continuing collapse of Obamacare, as many state Obamacare exchanges continue to experience insurers exiting the Obamacare exchanges. Insurers also remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s potential decision to discontinue subsidies for health insurers to lower the cost of premiums. Conservatives argue that the Obamacare subsidies amount to handouts to large health conglomerates. Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan, said, “It’s still a very volatile market. There are so many uncertainties. ” Notter argues that the individual health care market continues to experience turbulence through the uncertainty that comes out of D. C. Republicans, who passed a health care bill through the House, point to insurers’ rate hikes and withdrawals from Obamacare exchanges as fundamental problems with the Affordable Care Act. “The laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars,” a White House official said. Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) argues that Republicans’ attempt to repeal Obamacare, as well as President Trump’s threat to remove subsidies to health insurers, created the health insurance rate hikes. Kaine said, “These actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition. ” Kevin Lewis, the chief executive at Maine Community Health Options, said that its 19. 6 percent increase in 2018 arises from healthy people exiting the Obamacare markets. “It’s the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market,” Lewis said. “It’s a bit of a   prophecy. ” President Donald Trump, citing that two million Americans have withdrawn from their Obamacare plans since signing up in January, declared that Obamacare is in a “ . ” 2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2017, ",0
825,Re: Looks Like Someone Thinks the Democrats in Ohio Are Full of Manure,"In an epic demonstration of showing the that the Democrat Party if full of manure, someone took it upon themselves to dump a truckload of manure in front of the headquarters of the Warren County Democratic Party headquarters in Ohio. 
The Washington Post reports : 
For those who think this election season can't get crappier, we bring you to Warren County, Ohio, where a large truckload of manure was dumped in front of Warren County Democratic Party headquarters in Lebanon, about 35 miles northeast of Cincinnati. 
A sheriff's deputy was the first to notice the pile and alerted office leaders of it about 8 a.m. Saturday, local party officials told The Washington Post.

— David Pepper (@DavidPepper) October 29, 2016 
In 2012, something very similar occurred. A pile of manure was dumped almost in front of the headquarters in identical fashion. 
""At the time, we did not have a camera system, because it kind of caught us by surprise,"" Bethe Goldenfield, chairwoman of the Warren County Democratic Party, said of the 2012 dump. ""We didn't think something like that would happen."" 
This time, the act was caught on surveillance video that the Warren County Sheriff's Office is now reviewing, Goldenfield said. She did not want to elaborate on what the cameras captured because it was an open investigation, but she noted that it involved a dump truck. 
""And I'm not going to jump to the conclusion that it was the same person [as in 2012], but of course that crossed my mind,"" Goldenfield said. ""We just need to have a little more specifics, and then hopefully we'll bring the perpetrators to be accountable."" 
It appears to me this is something akin to the Boston Tea Party, only in this case whoever dumped the manure probably paid for it to make a political statement, one that we already know to be true and both the crimes of Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah and Hillary Clinton have demonstrated. That statement is that the Democrat Party is the BS party and cannot be trusted.   shares",0

828,Senate Narrowly Passes Rollback of Obama-Era ‘Auto-I.R.A.’ Rule - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   By a single vote, the Senate gave final approval on Thursday to a measure to block cities and counties from organizing retirement savings accounts for workers who have no access to   plans. The vote reverses a Labor Department rule that allows local governments to automatically enroll   workers in retirement plans unless they opt out. The   vote was a startling reversal for many Republicans, who have argued for much of their careers that overzealous federal regulators were trampling the rights of state and local governments. In this case, congressional Republicans protested that President Barack Obama’s rules gave local regulators too much leeway. Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, a sponsor of the legislation, called it “unconscionable” that the Obama administration’s rule was denying workers federal consumer protections. The White House has indicated that President Trump will sign the measure into law. New York City, Philadelphia and Seattle all have considered retirement plans taking advantage of the Labor Department rule  —   what they call a “safe harbor”  —   that Republicans seek to reverse. Five states have also passed legislation permitted by a similar Labor Department regulation, which gives the states the power to appoint private money managers who would oversee portable savings accounts for workers. The Senate is expected to soon take up a separate House resolution rolling back that state rule. The consequences of the Senate’s votes could be significant. The Labor Department rules were designed to give around 13 million people in the five states access to retirement accounts, out of 55 million nationwide who lack   retirement programs. Among those affected most by the measure passed on Thursday will be small business owners and employees who have blanched at the cost of conventional 401( k) plans or pensions. In a joint statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, the City Council president, the city’s public advocate and a council member said that they were “deeply disappointed that Congress has voted to overturn the Department of Labor rule providing a safe harbor for us to create retirement savings plans for private sector employees. ” “This vote does little more than block them  —   the majority of whom are women and people of color  —   from securing their futures,” the statement said. Thursday’s vote was only the latest regulation that Republicans have rolled back this year using the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which had hardly been used in the two decades before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Seven rollbacks have been signed into law by President Trump, with several others awaiting his signature. But in this case, Republicans were replacing local regulatory authority with federal control  —   taking up a cause of investment banks that fear competition from state and local governments. The Obama Labor Department’s rule actually gave states more autonomy in reaching contracts with   financial managers to handle the savings accounts. State governments could be administrative conduits, keeping records while passing on funding to private consultants, who would manage the money in place of state treasurers. “Too many states have made questionable decisions when it comes to managing retirement funding,” said Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee. Republicans maintained that   retirement savings accounts free of federal consumer protection rules had an unfair advantage over plans from   providers. Under the law that governs pensions, employers must show that they are managing their retirement programs on behalf of their workers, not the investment funds  —   a provision some Republicans argued that state and city plans could skirt. In fact, many states that have passed legislation to take advantage of the Labor Department regulation have included a similar “fiduciary responsibility” requirement in their   programs. And Congress has acted to reverse an Obama administration regulation that demanded that retirement investment advisers make their clients’ interests paramount. Senators in both parties lobbed comments on the issue on the Senate floor Wednesday. Critical of what he called the “competitive advantage” that the rules might give cities and states over   retirement offerings, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said the Labor Department statutes spelled “more government at the expense of the private sector. ” “These retirement savings regulations are a classic case of the whole being worse than the sum of its parts,” he said. Both of Oregon’s senators, who are Democrats, spoke on behalf of the Labor Department rules, which would protect their state’s “OregonSaves” retirement accounts, scheduled to open in July. “I hear all the time in here about states’ rights. I hear all the time about how states are the place for experimentation to see what works and what doesn’t work,” Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said. “This Congressional Review Act proposal says the opposite. It says, ‘Let’s stomp out experiments by our municipalities. ’” Some liberals see the fight over the House bills as a proxy battle that Republicans were eager to wage on behalf of the financial services industry. “They’re ignoring the fact that the idea of the  . R. A. came out of the Heritage Foundation and Brookings,” said Joshua Gotbaum, chairman of the board responsible for setting up Maryland’s version of the plan, referring to a conservative research institution and the more liberal Brookings Institution. “It’s supported by the Republican state treasurer of Utah and Indiana  —   real    Republican states. ” “This is fundamentally a Republican idea,” Mr. Gotbaum added. David John, a policy adviser at AARP and the deputy director of the Brookings Institution’s Retirement Security Project, wrote papers defending the  . R. A. concept while he was at the conservative Heritage Foundation. “This is a problem that could be just as easily dealt with at the federal level. But it’s not being dealt with. Rather than doing nothing, states are stepping in and recognizing that it’s in their financial interests to act and build these systems,” Mr. John said. “With the   plans, we’re seeing for the first time hundreds of thousands of people who have access to these from the day they go to work to the day they retire,” he added. Mr. Gotbaum expressed confidence in states’ ability to defend their prerogatives. “There’s going to be a lawsuit, and the lawsuit is going to decide this,” he said of the next step for them. “They’re going to go ahead no matter what. ”",0
829,"In Cramped and Costly Bay Area, Cries to Build, Baby, Build - The New York Times","San Francisco does not have enough places to live. Sonja Trauss, a local activist, thinks the city should tackle this problem by building more housing. This may not sound like a controversial idea. But this is San Francisco. Ms. Trauss is a   anarchist and the head of the SF Bay Area Renters’ Federation, an upstart political group that is pushing for more development. Its platform is simple: Members want San Francisco and its suburbs to build more of every kind of housing. More subsidized affordable housing, more   rentals, more   condominiums. Ms. Trauss supports all of it so long as it is built tall, and soon. “You have to support building, even when it’s a type of building you hate,” she said. “Is it ugly? Get over yourself. Is it   housing? Get over yourself. Is it luxury housing? Get over yourself. We really need everything right now. ” Her group consists of a   mailing list and a few dozen   members  —   most of them young professionals who work in the technology industry  —   who speak out at government meetings and protest against the protesters who fight new development. While only two years old, Ms. Trauss’s Renters’ Federation has blazed onto the political scene with youth and bombast and by employing guerrilla tactics that others are too polite to try. In January, for instance, she hired a lawyer to go around suing suburbs for not building enough. The organization also inflamed Sierra Club volunteers in San Francisco by trying to elect its own   candidate to the environmental group’s executive committee. That effort failed, and last week her candidate, Donald Dewsnup, was arrested and charged with voter fraud  —   a move that Ms. Trauss claims is political retaliation. “There’s no other explanation for why the district attorney of a major city would investigate and charge one person for registering at an inaccurate address,” she said. In an interview, Mr. Dewsnup said he was homeless and simply used an address near the place where he was sleeping at the time. Across the country, a reversal in urban flight has ignited debates over gentrification, wealth, generational change and the definition of the modern city. It’s a familiar battle in suburbs, where     homeowners are an American archetype. In San Francisco, though, things get weird. Here the tech boom is clashing with tough development laws and resentment from established residents who want to choke off growth to prevent further change. Ms. Trauss is the result: a new generation of activist whose   bent is the opposite of the San Francisco stereotypes  —   the lefties, the aging hippies and tolerance all around. Ms. Trauss’s cause, more or less, is to make life easier for real estate developers by rolling back zoning regulations and environmental rules. Her opponents are a generally older group of progressives who worry that an influx of corporate techies is turning a city that nurtured the Beat Generation into a gilded resort for the rich. Those groups oppose almost every new development except those reserved for subsidized affordable housing. But for many young professionals who are too rich to qualify for affordable housing, but not rich enough to afford $   rents, this is the problem. Adding to the strangeness is that the typical San Francisco progressive and the typical      member of Ms. Trauss’s group are likely to have identical positions on every liberal touchstone, like   marriage and climate change, and yet they have become bitter enemies on one very big issue: housing. “We have liberal Democrats, and very liberal Democrats, and yet we are as polarized as the rest of the country,” said Tim Colen, executive director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition. Ms. Trauss is smart and energetic and unpolished. She called her group the Bay Area Renters’ Federation because “federation” reminds her of “Star Trek” and because her roommate thought it would be funny if her group’s acronym spelled “BARF. ” Jennifer Fieber, policy director at the San Francisco Tenants Union, likened the group to the Tea Party, because it lacks nuance (“Just build! ”) and can be rude. BARF’s public message board does in fact veer into strident libertarianism and juvenile ribbings, like pictures that equate its opponents to Adolf Hitler. This might make it tempting to dismiss Ms. Trauss as just another colorful activist in a place where activism is a local sport. But the anger she has tapped into is real, reflecting a generational break that pits cranky homeowners and the San Francisco political establishment against a cast of newcomers who are demanding the region make room for them, too. To befriend a certain kind of techie on social media is to be bombarded with angry Facebook posts and retweeted news articles about how San Francisco doesn’t build enough housing or how it is also the suburbs’ fault and isn’t Seattle great? Every few weeks, when a company like Zillow puts out a new price report, both sides hold up the numbers as an example of how San Francisco has failed the middle class. Zillow puts the city’s median home price at $1. 1 million, neck and neck with Manhattan. The region’s rent, at $3, 500 a month for an average apartment, is the highest in the nation. Today Ms. Trauss’s group is one of several   organizations (GrowSF and East Bay Forward are others) that represent a kind of “Yimby” party, built on the frustrations of young professionals who feel priced out of the Bay Area. BARF has won the backing of technology millionaires  —   Jeremy Stoppelman,   and chief executive of Yelp, is the group’s largest individual donor  —   and the encouragement of local politicians. “BARF is an important voice in this housing debate, and that is the voice of young people who are asking the question: ‘What is my future in this city? ’” said Scott Wiener, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. “And you can agree or disagree with them, but they have activated a new generation of   activists. ” The group’s   platform may be politically contentious, but economically speaking, it is anything but controversial. The Bay Area was expensive even before the tech boom. And the supply of new projects, while increasing, remains decades behind population growth. This extends from Silicon Valley suburbs like Palo Alto, whose ratio of jobs to housing units is triple the median level in the Bay Area, to San Francisco, which despite an increase in new housing has lagged behind job growth, according to the Association of Bay Area Governments. Much of San Francisco’s progressive establishment feels the city is building too much   housing. Some go so far as to argue that the appetite for real estate here is so high that    rules don’t really apply. To get prices down, “You’d have to, like, build another city on top of the city,” said David Campos, a   member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He thinks the city should focus the vast majority of future development on affordable housing limited to people making well below the city’s median income. This thinking is at odds with a February report on housing prices from the California Legislative Analyst’s Office, which said underdevelopment was the primary cause of the high prices that afflicted cities throughout the coastal part of the state, especially in the Bay Area. “Many housing programs  —   vouchers, rent control and inclusionary housing  —   attempt to make housing more affordable without increasing the overall supply,” the report said. “This approach does very little to address the underlying cause of California’s high housing costs: a housing shortage. ” Ms. Trauss, 34, is a born activist from Philadelphia whose father is a lawyer who defends   homeowners against foreclosure. She moved to the Bay Area in 2011, shortly after getting her master’s degree in economics from Washington University in St. Louis, and taught math at local community colleges. She intended to live in San Francisco, but settled across the bay in Oakland. Like nearly everyone who moves to the Bay Area, Ms. Trauss spent an inordinate amount of time complaining about rent. In 2014, after reading a   history of Bay Area housing politics written by   Cutler, a reporter at the TechCrunch news site who has gone on to help found a     called Roam, Ms. Trauss started writing letters to the San Francisco Planning Commission in support of any new project with more than 30 units. She graduated from writing letters to attending planning meetings, and, after registering the SFBARF website, started recruiting members by finding   voices on sites like Reddit and the comments sections of local news articles. “People say testifying doesn’t do anything  —   but guess what definitely doesn’t do anything: giving a dumb speech to your friend at the bar,” she said. Today BARF is her   job, allowing her the financial wherewithal to become one of those strangely persistent people who speak regularly at City Hall. To an outside observer, this can feel like watching an obscure and   sport. This is a town with an app for everything and where people get fussy when an Uber driver takes more than five minutes to arrive. City Hall, with its   architecture and   wait times, can feel like an anachronism. Ms. Trauss may be a   millennial, but she loves it. “Even in this modern era of, whatever, the Internet and people like interacting in a place that’s no place at all, City Hall is still a center,” she said. One recent afternoon, she spent an hour on the hard wooden benches in the chamber of the Board of Supervisors. She was there to make a   public comment in favor of a    proposal to streamline the permitting process for some   projects. Three days later she was back, this time to support a “density bonus”  —   a proposal to let developers build taller buildings in exchange for including more affordable housing as well. When she arrived, Mr. Campos, from the Board of Supervisors, was blasting the proposal from the City Hall steps, surrounded by 70 or so supporters. Ms. Trauss and another member of her group stood opposite and held up signs that said “Stop Affordable Housing. ” This was meant to be ironic. Their point was that Mr. Campos was opposing legislation that would create more   housing  —   but also more affordable housing. Nobody seemed to get it, so Ms. Trauss went inside City Hall to add her name to a list of people making public comments before the planning commission. Her chance to speak would be hours away, so she trekked around City Hall, past bronze busts and wedding parties, in search of a quiet place to take a lunch break. She was joined by a man whose legal name is Starchild. Starchild is the sort of    Francisco character you end up making friends with if you spend enough time at City Hall. He works nights as an “erotic service provider. ” Asked if this meant he was a prostitute, he said, “‘Prostitute’ is O. K. as long as it’s said in a respectful way. ” Starchild spends his days campaigning for libertarian causes and running doomed campaigns for office. The two ate on a marble ledge and discussed police brutality, pretrial detention and whether it was possible for an anarchist to be in favor of soda taxes. A short while later, Ms. Trauss headed back to a waiting room, where she took a selfie for the @SFyimby Twitter account and began a      wait for a few more minutes at the   microphone. “This is my life,” she whispered. “It’s ridiculous. ” Many longtime San Franciscans view groups like BARF as yet another example of how the technology industry is robbing San Francisco of its San  . Far from the hippies of the 1960s, many of today’s migrants lean libertarian  —   drawn by   dreams or to work for the likes of Google or Apple, two of the world’s most valuable companies. They tend to share a belief, either idealistically or naïvely, depending on who is judging, that corporations can be a force for social good and change. But BARF members are so   about housing that they can be hard to label politically. They view San Francisco progressives as, in fact, fundamentally conservative. That is because, to the group members at least, progressive positions on housing seem less about building the city and more about keeping people like them out. On a drizzly Sunday in December, Ms. Trauss hosted the SF YIMBYParty Congress, a gathering of   groups held at a Market Street   space full of   touches like mismatched furniture, a foosball table and lots of white men. Toward the beginning, a debate broke out about whether they should call themselves moderates to distinguish themselves from progressives. Ms. Trauss joked that she liked moderate because you can shorten it to mod, and mod sounds cool. Mr. Wiener, the supervisor, disagreed, noting that in San Francisco, a moderate Democrat “might have a Bernie Sanders sticker on their car. ” One man, who seemed exasperated by the discussion and the idea of using his Sunday to talk about politics, said, with more colorful language, that he did not give a hoot about progressives versus moderates  —   he just wanted some darn housing. The tech boom takes much of the blame for soaring housing prices. But the   movement has less to do with tech as an industry, and everything to do with newcomers as a class. Brian Hanlon, a federation member who regularly attends Board of Supervisors meetings with Ms. Trauss, has a day job doing administrative work for the United States Forest Service. Two years ago, when he started worrying that his claim to an $   room in a   apartment might be in jeopardy, he reacted in classic San Francisco fashion. He started marching in   protests next to people beating drums and signs that said things like “Tech = Death. ” But he quickly broke ranks. Many of his fellow protesters also opposed building new apartments  —   putting him at odds with them. “They want to be on the side of tenants, but they don’t have any real plan for how do we become a welcoming metropolitan area for new people who don’t have money,” Mr. Hanlon said. “Their plans are only to allow current incumbent renters to stay in their place, presumably until they die and some rich person comes along. ” The progressive movement has played a guiding role in creating the quirky and picturesque San Francisco that many people love today. Progressives battled plans to crisscross the city with freeways and opposed urban renewal programs that destroyed black neighborhoods. They have fought for, and won,   protections and funding for affordable housing, along with various   amenities that many newcomers take for granted. The question is how to handle a   demographic reversal in which cities across the country have regained population following years of “white flight” to the suburbs. After losing population for two decades through the 1970s, San Francisco resumed growth in the ’80s and has only accelerated from there. “There’s that book, ‘What’s the Matter With Kansas? ’” said Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of SPUR, an urban policy research organization. “What’s the matter with San Francisco? Why is it that in a city that’s   renters we have adopted a housing policy that is horrible for renters?” The challenge for groups like BARF is that, politically speaking, they have a lot of persuading to do. The   talk might sound great to a recent Stanford graduate, but San Francisco is in a moment when corporate buses are regarded as instruments of a tech invasion bent on turning people who can’t code into a   underclass. The idea that everything would be better if only the city threw up more tall buildings is a hard sell. Of the 11 propositions on San Francisco’s ballot in November, seven were either directly or indirectly related to high home prices and the influence of the technology industry. Michael Hankinson, a Harvard Ph. D. candidate who is studying   and housing prices, surveyed voters for his dissertation and found renters skeptical that new development would do anything other than raise prices. For instance, a recent proposal to temporarily stop   development in the city’s Mission District, a gentrifying neighborhood popular with technology workers, failed citywide. But Mr. Hankinson found that a majority of renters favored it because they did not think that new development would do anything for them  —   and feared that it might, somehow, get them evicted. “BARF has to convince renters that neighborhood change will benefit them in the long run,” he said. Today, when eviction is a hot party topic, most renters are unwilling to take that gamble. So Ms. Trauss is taking her campaign to the courts. In December she sued the city of Lafayette, Calif. an East Bay bedroom community, after it took a parcel that had been set aside for   apartments and office buildings and rezoned it for   homes instead. She wrote the petition herself, saying the move violated the California Housing Accountability Act, a 1980s law and “ ” statute that limits cities’ ability to downsize housing developments. Recently, she hired a lawyer to litigate the case. Asked about Ms. Trauss’s lawsuit, Steven Falk, Lafayette’s city manager, said the city actually faced another lawsuit over the same development. The second group is suing, he said, because they think it is too big.",0
830,"Championing Optimism, Obama Hails Clinton as His Political Heir - The New York Times","PHILADELPHIA  —   President Obama delivered a stirring valedictory address at the Democratic convention Wednesday night, hailing Hillary Clinton as his rightful political heir and the party’s best hope to protect democracy from “homegrown demagogues” like the Republican Donald J. Trump. Taking the stage to rapturous roars of “We love you” and “Yes we can,” Mr. Obama acknowledged that Democrats were still divided after a bruising nomination fight and that Mrs. Clinton had made “mistakes. ” But he vouched passionately for Mrs. Clinton as a trusted and reliable ally not just for him but for all Americans who need a fighter to improve their lives and keep them safe. “She’s been there for us  —   even if we haven’t always noticed  —   and if you’re serious about our democracy, you can’t afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue,” Mr. Obama said, an explicit appeal to supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders who continue to resist Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama offered an optimistic portrait of America and a strong defense of his policies, but also unleashed by far his most ferocious attack yet on Mr. Trump, even portraying the Republican nominee as a threat to the country. “That’s why anyone who threatens our values, whether fascists or communists or jihadists or homegrown demagogues, will always fail in the end,” he said. In the most unmistakable declaration yet by Mrs. Clinton that she is effectively seeking Mr. Obama’s third term, she strolled on stage after his speech and embraced the president as the delegates roared. It was a tableau of continuity and a vivid illustration of how dependent the two former rivals are on each other now. Mr. Obama also used his own remarks to try to drive a wedge between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Republican voters. “It wasn’t particularly Republican and it sure wasn’t conservative,” he said of last week’s Republican convention. “There were no serious solutions to pressing problems. Just the fanning of resentments and blame and hate and anger. ” The president’s contempt for Mr. Trump took on a personal dimension as well when he recalled his grandparents from Kansas and said, “I don’t know if they had their birth certificates”  —   a reference to Mr. Trump’s leadership of the   birther movement that raised questions about Mr. Obama’s citizenship. Wednesday signaled a transition for the party. Emotion suffused the convention hall: Some delegates, in tears, were not ready to say goodbye to Mr. Obama yet, and others  —   particularly some liberals and young Democrats  —   were not ready to accept Mrs. Clinton as their new leader. As she prepares to give her nomination acceptance speech on Thursday night, the left wing of the party still remains divided, while many Republicans appear ready to fall in line behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama’s speech, a passionate defense of Mrs. Clinton’s vision and character, did not itself herald the start of new political era. Mrs. Clinton has wrapped herself in the cloth of the Obama presidency rather than break with him and offer a new path, like Vice President George Bush’s promise of “a kinder, gentler nation” in 1988 after the Reagan years. Instead, the lineup on Wednesday reflected a party attempting to rally its own partisans and attract Republicans with blunt warnings that, whatever they may think about the new Democratic   they must all do their duty to thwart Mr. Trump. And the convention speeches were full of   appeals, as Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic   nominee, offered Republicans “a home” if they felt Mr. Trump did not represent “the party of Lincoln,” and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York urged independents to vote for “a sane, competent person”  —   Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Kaine, a   senator and a former governor of Virginia, introduced himself to his largest television audience yet as a product of a Jesuit high school who embraced its motto  —   “Men for others”  —   who held close to his faith while trying to help Americans as a civil rights lawyer and then as a political leader whose most searing experience was the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007. He occasionally shifted to Spanish, which he speaks fluently, and led the audience in a chant of an Obama political slogan, “Sí se puede” (“Yes you can”). Mr. Kaine paid brief tribute to Republicans and also hailed Senator Bernie Sanders, whom Mrs. Clinton defeated for the nomination, at several points. Yet some Sanders supporters were not willing to fall behind the new   nominee. As Mr. Kaine spoke, jeers broke out from the Utah delegation attacking the   Partnership trade deal that the senator has supported and Mr. Sanders is against  —   and Mrs. Clinton has shifted to oppose. Placards denouncing the trade deal quickly spread through the hall, including a couple of dozen in the California delegation. Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and C. I. A. chief, spoke early in the evening and was repeatedly interrupted with shouts of “No more war!” from several state delegations that favored the candidacy of Mr. Sanders during the presidential race. As the heckling persisted, Mrs. Clinton’s supporters took up a   heard more often at the Republican convention to drown out the jeers: “U. S. A. U. S. A. !” Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also turned to images and language more commonly used by the right to depict Mr. Trump as denigrating American greatness, invoking patriotism and saluting military service. Before Mr. Obama even entered the convention hall here, the audience was clearly as devoted to him as they were excited for Mrs. Clinton. The first lady, Michelle Obama, was received with adoration and her speech on Monday was the most   moment of the first days of the convention. And even a quick flash of Mr. Obama’s face, amid a procession of past presidents on the convention screen Tuesday, brought a burst of applause. The president is also the strongest adhesive holding Democrats together after five months of bitterly fought primary and caucus contests between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. According to a New York   poll earlier this month, 82 percent of Sanders supporters approved of Mr. Obama’s job performance. After two nights of convention speeches focused on Mrs. Clinton’s virtues and attempts to make peace with Sanders supporters, Clinton campaign officials sought to address the threat of radical Islamists  —   an omission early on that Republicans had criticized. And in a shift from only about a decade ago when they largely avoided the issue, Democrats used much of Wednesday to advocate gun control, sending relatives of those murdered in Newtown, Conn. and Charleston, S. C. as well as a former congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords, to recount their stories. But virtually all of the anticipation on Wednesday surrounded Mr. Obama and the symbolic passing of the torch to Mrs. Clinton after she became the party’s nominee on Tuesday night. Mr. Obama’s resounding endorsement of his   rival was the final consummation of a political alliance over a decade in the making, since Mrs. Clinton flew to Chicago in 2004 to raise money for a    state senator and discovered a phenom. Back then he was the one who benefited from the imprimatur of a   political star, and her support continued to prove critical over the years. After he won the presidential nomination that she expected to be hers in 2008, Mrs. Clinton put aside her resentment and helped him unify a divided Democratic Party. And later that year, she again came to his aid by agreeing to become his first secretary of state. Mr. Obama is the one riding high now, his approval rating over 50 percent. And his image is only enhanced as voters view him, in his final months as president, through the prism of a race to replace him that features two deeply unpopular candidates. While acknowledging that Mrs. Clinton has “her share of critics’’ on the right and the left, the president sought to transfer his prestige and political appeal to his long ago rival. “Tonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me,” he said. “I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. ” “And if you’re serious about our democracy, you can’t afford to stay home just because she might not align with you on every issue. You’ve got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn’t a spectator sport. America isn’t about ‘Yes he will.’ It’s about ‘Yes we can. ’”",0
831,Fiona Apple Releases a Trump Protest Chant - The New York Times,"On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of women are expected to march in Washington after Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. This past Tuesday, the   Fiona Apple gave those preparing to protest a signature chant. The chant is on a new   track called “Tiny Hands,” which repeats 10 words recorded by Ms. Apple on a phone: “We don’t want your tiny   near our underpants. ” The track includes a sample of Mr. Trump’s comments from a 2005 leaked “Access Hollywood” recording with Billy Bush in which he brags of grabbing of women’s body parts whenever he wanted. The track was produced by the composer Michael Whalen, who released the song on SoundCloud, where some commenters did not think that the chant went far enough. ”A reference to male rhetoric?” said one SoundCloud critic, arguing that Ms. Apple should have included more substantive complaints. “If that’s the worst we can complain about him, then maybe we should have all voted for him. ” Mr. Whalen responded that Ms. Apple’s goal had simply been to create a chant for the march. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Online, the song met with a scattering of criticisms from Mr. Trump’s supporters, who pointed out that those who normally denounce bullying were embracing derogatory and demeaning language about the future president. Ms. Apple, who began her music career in the 1990s, has become something of a recluse. A New York Magazine article from 2012 labeled Ms. Apple a “musical hermit. ” But her albums continue to be critically acclaimed. Her last L. P. released that year, received a high aggregate score, 89, on the website Metacritic, and was her     effort to date. Ms. Apple’s new song is not the first time that Mr. Trump’s comments from the incendiary recording have been repurposed by his opponents. A group of knitters united online to form “The Pussyhat Project,” dedicated to creating 1. 1 million hats for protesters to wear at the march on Saturday. “Tiny Hands” is also not the indie singer’s first protest song aimed at Mr. Trump. Last year, Ms. Apple released a Christmas tune on Tumblr that made such ferocious use of a double entendre that its title can’t be published in The New York Times. Ms. Apple has spoken publicly about being sexually assaulted at the age of 12 and has a history of airing her perspective on serious matters in her music. Accepting an MTV award for best new artist in 1997, she railed against the artificiality of the music industry, referred to Maya Angelou as an inspiration and implored her fans to think for themselves. Other artists, however, are celebrating Mr. Trump’s imminent assumption of the presidency. A relatively obscure American poet, Joseph Charles MacKenzie, wrote a poem praising the   and his Scottish heritage. The poem refers to Mr. Trump as “the Domhnall,” the Scottish form of his first name. It reads in part: When crippling corruption polluted our nation And plunged our economy into stagnation, As   rogues took the opulent office And plump politicians reneged on their promise, The forgotten continued to form a great crowd That defended the Domhnall, the best of MacLeod!",0
832,Susan Rice: U.S. Must Integrate LGBT Rights into Gov’t and Foreign Policy,"October 28, 2016 Susan Rice: U.S. Must Integrate LGBT Rights into Gov’t and Foreign Policy 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice told students at American University in a speech on LGBT rights Wednesday that the “United States must continue to integrate LGBT rights into our government and foreign policy,” including “creating a more diverse national security workforce.” 
“This is an issue that I’m particularly passionate about, and one that President Obama has prioritized,” Rice said, “because without tapping America’s full range of races, religions, ethnicities, social and economic experiences—without embracing people of every sexual orientation and gender identity—we’re leading in a complex world with one hand tied behind our back.” 
Rice, who once served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said that “whether we are talking about race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, this fight for equal rights is what our history and values demand.”",0
833,Trump Organization Moves to Avoid Possible Conflicts of Interest - The New York Times,"In its latest effort to defuse a major public relations problem that might have loomed over Donald J. Trump’s presidency, the Trump Organization on Wednesday announced union accords at two major hotel holdings. The agreements resolve labor disputes that could have posed a conflict of interest for the   and come on the heels of other similar moves in recent weeks. In November, Mr. Trump paid $25 million to settle a number of lawsuits surrounding fraud allegations at Trump University, his former   education business, and this month the Trump Organization extricated itself from the management of a hotel project in Brazil, where the authorities were investigating allegations of corruption. Taken together, the moves suggest that Mr. Trump is sensitive to at least the perception that his business dealings could cast a shadow over his presidency, even if he has yet to detail how he might seek a more comprehensive solution to potential conflicts, such as outright divestment. “On the one hand, I think it’s important to acknowledge that this is meaningful, it does matter,” Danielle Brian, the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog group, said of Wednesday’s agreements. “However, this piecemeal approach to dealing with conflicts is not going to deal with the bigger looming problem. ” The agreements also provide insight into Mr. Trump’s views on workers and labor unions. In contrast to the deal he helped broker at the Carrier plant in Indiana, which recently agreed to preserve about 850 jobs that it had planned to shift to Mexico, and which Mr. Trump was on hand to announce in person, the announcement of Wednesday’s deals came by way of a news release featuring statements from the Trump Organization and affiliates of the unions involved. The Trump transition team offered no comment and released no statement. One of the two labor agreements provides a union contract to workers at the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, whose union the hotel had previously refused to bargain with. The second agreement eases a hurdle to unionization at a recently opened Trump hotel in Washington. The agreements reduce the probability that the National Labor Relations Board, which protects the labor rights of   employees, will be called on to adjudicate disputes between workers and the Trump Organization. That possibility raised the prospect of a conflict of interest if Mr. Trump were to retain a stake in his business. As president, Mr. Trump will eventually nominate all five members of the labor board, as well as its general counsel, who typically has the final say on whether to issue formal complaints against employers. The speed of the negotiations at the hotel in Las Vegas suggested that Mr. Trump was eager to put the issue behind him before his inauguration in January, after the hotel resisted workers’ efforts to unionize there for most of the past year and a half. The hotel hired consultants who spoke with employees at mandatory meetings about the risks of unionizing, according to earlier statements from the union. In charges filed with the labor board, some workers alleged that they had been fired or suspended from their jobs because of their unionization efforts. After the successful union election last December, the hotel appealed within the labor board structure, arguing that workers had been intimidated into voting for the union. When the full board rejected its final appeal last month, the hotel appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Bethany Khan, a union representative, said the new labor agreement had come together over a few days of negotiation last week and been ratified by union members over the weekend. Under the accord, the workers will join locals for culinary workers and bartenders that are affiliated with Unite Here, a prominent national union that represents hotel workers. The two sides agreed to a contract beginning Jan. 1 and running through May 31, 2021, which follows a relatively standard template for hotels in Las Vegas by providing annual wage increases, pension and health benefits, and job protections. Under the second accord, the Trump International Hotel Washington D. C. agreed to remain neutral as workers seek to unionize under a   agreement, enabling workers to simply sign authorization cards indicating that they want to unionize. The hotel will recognize the union if a majority of workers sign cards. The alternative, a   election, typically occurs when the employer opposes the unionization effort, as was the case at the Las Vegas property. In a statement referring to the agreement in Washington, Eric Danziger, the chief executive of Trump Hotels, said, “We share mutual goals with the union, as we both desire to ensure outstanding jobs for the employees, while also enabling the hotel to operate successfully in a competitive environment. ” Wednesday’s agreements do not eliminate the potential for conflicts of interest involving Mr. Trump and the labor board. The board’s general counsel, whose replacement Mr. Trump will probably appoint next year, will be in a position to decide whether to issue complaints about allegations of labor rights violations, but could also leave the decision to career civil servants. Such allegations could include refusing to bargain with the union in the future, or firing or disciplining union stewards for sticking up for fellow members under procedures outlined in the contract. The decision on issuing a complaint is in some sense the critical step of the labor board process. There are typically 20, 000 to 25, 000 charges of unfair labor practices in a given year, of which only a fraction result in a complaint  —   about 1, 270 last year  —   although some are settled beforehand. Any complaint issued by a regional director or the general counsel could then come before the board, at least some of whose members are likely to have been appointed by Mr. Trump. But if the general counsel declines to issue a complaint, the charge is effectively dead and generally cannot be appealed. “It’s the gateway into litigation,” said Wilma Liebman, a former labor board chairman. There remains an open charge of unfair labor practices against the Trump Organization, which was filed on behalf of a worker advocacy group in September over the contract that employees of the Trump presidential campaign were required to sign. The group alleged the contract’s noncompete and confidentiality clauses illegally discouraged employees from exercising their labor rights. Mr. Trump and his organization faced a potentially punishing calculus in deciding to bargain with the union in Las Vegas, aside from the issues of conflict of interest. Even if the Trump hotel in Las Vegas had prevailed in its efforts to undo the union election in federal court, which was probably a long shot in itself, the culinary workers would probably have continued their unionization campaign, creating a lingering source of embarrassment for the  . In September, workers at the Boulder Station casino in Las Vegas  —   owned by a company controlled by Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, who until recently operated the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a mixed martial arts promoter  —   voted to unionize after a dogged campaign by the union that lasted more than six years. The campaign included the creation of a website highlighting the   tirades of the president of the U. F. C. and an effort by union affiliates in New York State to fight the league’s attempts to overturn a law banning the sport there. “They fight really hard,” said C. Jeffrey Waddoups, an economist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who studies union bargaining in the hotel and gambling industry. “It would draw a lot of attention. ”",0
834,Sweden on the Brink? Police Force Pushed to Breaking Point by Violence amid Migrant Influx,"Sweden on the Brink? Police Force Pushed to Breaking Point by Violence amid Migrant Influx Lizzie Stromme, Express, November 1, 2016 
Sweden is on the brink of becoming a lawless state as the police force is losing the battle against unprecedented levels of crime and violence amid a growing migrant crisis. 
The Scandinavian country is facing an existential crisis with on average three police officers handing in their resignations a day. 
If the alarming trend continues, and police officers continue to resign more than 1,000 officers will have quit the service by New Years. 
Since the migrant crisis began last summer, Sweden has been hit by a series of brutal crimes and violent incidents . 
In 2015 alone Sweden, with a population of 9.5 million, received over 160,000 asylum applications and the country is expected to take as many as 190,000 refugees, or two per cent of the population, by the end of 2016. 
Since the Second World War Sweden has prided itself on helping migrants who cross their borders despite some moves to the political right in recent years. 
But police have now admitted the force has reached breaching point as more than 50 areas in the country have now been placed on a “no-go zone” list . 
In February a report from Sweden’s National Criminal Investigation Service announced there were 52 areas where officers would not cope with the levels of crime being committed . 
Sex assaults , drug dealing and children carrying weapons were just some of the incidents mentioned in the report. 
In September, Swedish officials were forced to add another three areas to the list. 
Now the Police Association have said they need at least 200 new officers to regain control in the south-east of the country. 
Thomas Stjernfeldt, from the region’s police association, told SVT : “We are missing extremely many officers in the operational sector, right now we need 200 more officers to be added to the force to establish a reasonable working environment in the southeast of Götaland.” 
Götaland is one of the regions in the country that has been hit hard by the car fire attacks, which have been occurring throughout Sweden. 
On Monday, Express.co.uk reported a number of the arsonist attacks in the city of Växjö, in Götaland, had been committed by frustrated migrants . 
Currently there are more than 6,000 suspected crimes that are unsolved in the area and 400 of these cases are suspected to be rapes, murder or attempted murder. 
Mr Stjernfeldt said the figures are alarming and police officers are constantly forced to work overtime in an attempt to solve the reported crimes. 
The Police Association admitted it fears the public will lose faith in the force and their ability to protect citizens if the situation is not resolved. 
The union’s call for more resources echoes National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson’s February warning, where he said he needed a further 4,100 officers and specialist staff to reestablish law and order in Sweden.",0
835,Comment on Hemp vs Cotton: The Ultimate Showdown by Hemp: Readdressing Cannabis – kuebiko.co,"  Hemp has been making a lot of noise lately, especially with the growing awareness surrounding the use of hemp oil for treating cancer. Although the word ‘hemp’ still often gets confused and lumped into the same definition as Cannabis, a similar but psychoactive plant, it’s important to realize hemp can be a major game changer for our world if used to its potential. As we go through this post, you will be wondering ‘why don’t we use this stuff all the time.. for everything?!’ Simple answer, farming hemp was banned in the US and other countries in the 1937 because of the threat it caused to certain companies and their businesses. More about that here.   Although hemp has many practical uses , let’s focus on one that would affect us every day; clothing. For this, we will compare hemp to cotton, as cotton is a very popular resource used in clothing production. We’ll need to focus on various areas that have to be taken into consideration when comparing the two so we can determine not only what is better for us, but also what is best for our environment as it’s important to view things holistically. Let’s do it. Water Cotton : To grow cotton you require about 1400 gallons of water for every pound you intend to produce. That’s a lot of water! Some areas of the world that produce cotton are running out of fresh water due to the production of cotton as well as clothing. Some areas of the world have even experienced desertification as a result of producing cotton. Hemp : You require about half the amount of water to produce hemp as you would if producing cotton. Hemp is a strong and reliable plant that grows very quickly. Not only that, hemp produces about 200% – 250% more fibre in the same amount of land compared to cotton. 
The victor: Hemp Pesticides Cotton : One of the biggest downsides to cotton is how much pesticides are used to grow the plant. Although organic cotton farming is beginning to catch on a bit more, the production of cotton worldwide takes up about 25% of the world’s pesticide use. The other unfortunate factor is that these chemicals can end up being absorbed into our skin as we wear clothing.   Hemp : The beauty of hemp is that it requires no pesticides to grow. In fact, it doesn’t require any chemicals at all to grow. The growing nature of the plant competes with weeds and over-powers their ability to sustain themselves. This allows the hemp plant to grow freely and quickly. 
The victor: Hemp Comfort & Longevity Cotton : Generally very comfortable to begin with, as you continue to wear cotton it ‘breaks in’ to become even more comfortable. There is no denying how soft cotton can be, but it is also true that cotton fibres break down over time and the more it is washed the faster it breaks down. Hemp : The hemp fibre used in clothing is a strong natural fibre that, like cotton, gets progressively softer with each passing day you wear it and each time you wash it. Although it may not start off quite as soft, it is still soft and certainly would not be considered uncomfortable. The plus is that the fibre is much stronger and durable. Repeated washed will not break the fibre down anywhere near as quickly as cotton. Creating more hemp clothing would mean we would need to produce much less clothing. 
The victor: Hemp B reathability & Wicking Cotton : Breathability is certainly a strong suit for cotton. It also does not hold odours for very much. This is quite possibly one of the biggest downsides to synthetic fibres, they don’t dispel odour well and don’t often deal with moisture well either. While cotton has a natural wicking system, it also holds moisture a little longer than what might be considered most desirable. Hemp : Performs very well when it comes to breathability and wicks moisture away from the body effectively. Hemp also carries anti-bacterial properties that trump any other natural fibre. This means hemp will not mold or grow mildew very easily. Since it also does not hold odours, hemp clothing edges out cotton slightly on this one The victor: Almost a tie, but hemp is our pal on this one again Aesthetics Cotton : Without the use of dyes, cotton comes naturally in white, cream and off-white. Cotton can be dyed naturally or synthetically to achieve a desired color. The growing knowledge that cotton is very taxing on the environment and not healthy for our skin is creating quite the demand for organic cotton. In terms of the fashion market, organic cotton is showing up more and more. Hemp : Given the various processes available to remove fibres from the stem of a hemp plant, hemp can be naturally creamy white, black, green, grey or brown. Without even requiring the use of dye, hemp comes in a variety of colors. Of course, you are still able to dye hemp both naturally and synthetically. Hemp is quickly becoming more and more popular in the fashion market as designers see the potential in the material while being a very environmentally sound option. Since it is durable and lasts a long time, it can be attractive to certain designers. 
The voctor: Hemp Final Decision Winner by knockout and growing undisputed champion of natural harmony, HEMP! This isn’t to say that cotton, especially grown organically, is not a good material, it simply isn’t better all around than hemp. In some cases, cotton could be a must use if something specific is being produced. The biggest differences are in the facts that hemp requires much less water and no pesticides to produce. Not only that, it boasts a lot more fibre per acre. Concerned about excess CO2 in the atmosphere? Hemp is spectacular at sequestering CO2! Take the time to check out some hemp clothing around the internet or see if there are some local stores who sell it. Although options can sometimes be limited right now, look out for more hemp clothing as awareness continues to spread!

836,"Jared Kushner, Trump’s Son-in-Law, Is Cleared to Serve as Adviser - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Hours after President Trump took his oath on Friday, the Justice Department issued an opinion saying that his appointment of his    Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser would be lawful despite a federal antinepotism law. In a   opinion signed on Friday, a longtime career lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel said that the president’s special hiring authority exempted White House positions from a 1967 law barring the president from employing relatives at a federal agency. Some legal experts had raised concerns that Mr. Kushner’s appointment violated that law, which Congress enacted several years after President John F. Kennedy had appointed his brother Robert as attorney general. But the new Justice Department opinion, signed by Daniel L. Koffsky, a deputy assistant attorney general in the legal counsel office, said Mr. Trump had the power to appoint Mr. Kushner anyway because of a subsequent 1978 law that gives the president the authority to appoint White House staff members without regard to other laws restricting employment and compensation of federal employees. Mr. Koffsky’s opinion acknowledged that in several cases since 1978, the Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the antinepotism statute prevented presidents from appointing relatives to positions. “Although our conclusion today departs from some of that prior work, we think that this departure is fully justified,” he wrote. The revised position came after an effort by Jamie S. Gorelick, Mr. Kushner’s lawyer and a deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration who is now a lawyer at the firm WilmerHale, to clear away obstacles to Mr. Kushner’s appointment. The opinion paves the way for Mr. Kushner, 35, to join Mr. Trump in the West Wing. Among the new president’s closest advisers during the campaign, Mr. Kushner married Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka in 2009. He has run his family’s vast real estate company and has owned a newspaper, The New York Observer. Mr. Trump announced on Jan. 9 that he would appoint Mr. Kushner, who will not accept a salary. His purview is expected to include the Middle East and Israel, government partnerships with the private sector and matters involving free trade. “If you can’t produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Kushner at an event on Thursday. The appointment of Mr. Kushner will be a dramatic change. In 1977, for example, the Justice Department barred President Jimmy Carter from appointing his son to an unpaid White House role, citing the antinepotism law. Even after Congress enacted the 1978 law, the Justice Department continued to block proposed appointments of presidential relatives. Mr. Koffsky’s opinion, which he worked on in the final days of the Obama administration, acknowledged a 1983 case in which the office barred President Ronald Reagan from appointing a relative to an advisory committee, and a 2009 case in which it blocked President Barack Obama from appointing his    and a half sister to advisory committees. But, Mr. Koffsky maintained, those opinions failed to adequately address the impact of the special hiring authority that Congress gave the president for his personal staff as part of the 1978 law. He also wrote that it was unlikely that Congress could bar a president from obtaining informal, ad hoc policy advice from a relative, and a major consequence of allowing Mr. Kushner’s appointment to a formal role is that he will be subject to the usual ethics rules for White House employees, like    laws. Mr. Kushner intends to sell some assets to his brother and to put others into a trust overseen by his mother, said Ms. Gorelick, who has worked on the plan. Ms. Gorelick said she had been consulting with federal ethics officials to try to address any    issues associated with Mr. Kushner’s appointment. He will also be required to file a financial disclosure report that details his assets and income, and to divest some holdings that could create a conflict of interest. When Mr. Trump announced Mr. Kushner’s appointment, Ms. Gorelick told reporters that while there were arguments on both sides of the legal question, she believed the “better argument” was that it would be lawful. She also disclosed then that the Trump transition team would seek an Office of Legal Counsel opinion. In an email on Saturday, Ms. Gorelick said that “we believed that we had the better argument on this,” adding that “the Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department  —   in an opinion by a highly regarded career deputy assistant attorney general  —   adopted a position consistent with our own. ” Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while he had some doubts about the new opinion, “it is a reasonable interpretation” of the law. “But what is important now,” he added, “is that Mr. Kushner complies with the    and disclosure provisions, and I wish his    the president, would do the same. ”",0
837,"Fisherman Faces Life in Prison for Catching $500,000 Worth of Cocaine and Selling It - Breitbart","A commercial fisherman faces life in prison for catching a 45 pound haul of cocaine and selling it instead of turning it over to the authorities. [Thomas Breeding, a    boat captain who has had a history of drug and weapons convictions, was charged with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance and unlawfully transporting a firearm, the Panama City News Herald reported.  Breeding said he had never been involved in the drug trade before and was “just a   young commercial fisherman. ” Breeding distributed the cocaine to four others who helped him sell the product and then received a cut from the sales. The cocaine haul was worth between $500, 000 and $620, 000, according to AL. com. Authorities investigated the scheme and charged all five people involved with conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. Breeding pleaded guilty to the charges Wednesday along with his  . Breeding faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $4. 25 million fine, and he’s warning others not to follow his example. “This changed my life and way of thinking and also made me aware of some of the dangers that can be found off shore in the Gulf,” Breeding wrote recently in a letter to the News Herald from the Washington County Jail. “I would like to let the public know the dangers and what not to do if this situation comes about. ”",0
838,Stepping Out of the Ring While Rolling With the Punches - The New York Times,"The moment Joanna Acevedo first set foot in a boxing gym, she had a vision of herself standing in the ring, wearing gloves and trading blows with an opponent. But her adoptive mother refused to let her box. She was too much of a fighter out of the ring. Ms. Acevedo, who as a child would not back down from a schoolyard brawl, said her irascible nature stemmed from years spent in the foster system. Her birth mother had a substance abuse problem, and her father was in prison for much of her life. “I grew up not being loved at all,” Ms. Acevedo, 22, said. “If you tell me how it feels for somebody to love me, I wouldn’t even know. ” She distracted herself with heavy partying and dropped out of high school. In 2011, Ms. Acevedo was arrested on robbery and assault charges. After her release from the Rikers Island jail complex, Ms. Acevedo vowed to correct her errant path. She returned to Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School in the South Bronx and received her diploma. She also connected with a social worker from the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Then Ms. Acevedo finally took up boxing. “Boxing has changed my life from zero to 100,” she said. “It helped me stop drinking, smoking, clubbing. That’s all I was doing at one point. ” The sport brought   and a focus she had never known. Ms. Acevedo devoted herself to it, competing in numerous tournaments across New York City. In 2014, she learned she was pregnant. Her first instinct was not to go through with the pregnancy. But she decided to become a mother in part because she dreamed of training alongside her daughter at the boxing gym. Ms. Acevedo gave birth to Serenity in July 2015. Her daughter, she said, has helped her experience life in a new way. “The only love I have is for my daughter,” Ms. Acevedo said. “Once I had my daughter and I cried, I felt like this is how it feels to be loved. I love her like crazy. ” Serenity was born with a rare condition called optic nerve hypoplasia. In utero, her pituitary gland shifted in her brain, preventing her optic nerves from fully developing. The extent of her blindness is still unknown. “That’s a one in a million,” Ms. Acevedo said. “My daughter got it. That’s not fair. ” A month after Serenity was born, her father was arrested, and Ms. Acevedo and her baby moved into her mother’s home in the Bronx. Ms. Acevedo does not work. Much of her time is dedicated to caring for Serenity, administering medications and taking her to doctors. Each month, Ms. Acevedo receives about $250 in federal assistance. She is in the process of applying for disability benefits for Serenity. In June, Ms. Acevedo was given $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund by the Children’s Aid Society for gift cards, which were used to buy clothing and food. For a time Ms. Acevedo was able to continue boxing, taking her daughter with her to the gym. As Serenity grew older, more apt to squirm and cry, Ms. Acevedo had to stop going. “Sometimes people can’t accomplish their dream because of a certain situation they’ve got to put first,” she said. “That’s how I feel right now. I can’t really do what I’d love to do because I have to take care of her right now, put her first. ” Her dream of expanding her family has been postponed. Ms. Acevedo is hesitant to have more children, concerned that something could happen to them. And without an outlet for aggression, Ms. Acevedo has become more restless. She has picked back up what she admits is a bad habit: smoking. But she said she would go no further than cigarettes, for fear of losing her daughter. “That’s what keeps me focused,” she said. “I don’t want her reliving a life that I lived. ” Recent experiences have led Ms. Acevedo to consider a career in nursing, but she is not sure when or if she will be able to pursue it. There is no day care for blind children in the city, she said, and she does not trust others to care for Serenity as vigilantly as she does. Ms. Acevedo says she believes in God, and in miracles, and remains hopeful that modern medicine will find a remedy for her daughter’s condition. Ms. Acevedo laments what her daughter will miss: sunsets, the delight in the holiday spectacle of Rockefeller Center or the joy of animals at the zoo. “I’m going to wish she could do this with me, that with me,” Ms. Acevedo said. “I’m never going to let her know, of course. But deep down inside, closed in a room or when she’s sleeping, and I’m up at night, that’s going through my head. ”",0
839,"Adnan Syed, of ‘Serial’ Podcast, Gets a Retrial in Murder Case - The New York Times","A judge in Maryland has granted a new trial to Adnan Syed, setting aside his conviction for the 1999 murder of his former girlfriend, in a case that was the subject of the first season of the hit podcast “Serial. ” Mr. Syed’s lawyer, C. Justin Brown, posted the news on Twitter on Thursday afternoon and confirmed by phone that the motion for a new trial had been granted by Judge Martin P. Welch of the Baltimore City Circuit Court. The decision to grant Mr. Syed, 35, a retrial was a major victory for an inmate who has long maintained his innocence and has exhausted all other avenues of appeal. He was convicted in 2000 in the murder of his former girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, and had served 16 years of a life sentence. “Serial” turned speculation about Mr. Syed’s guilt and whether he had received a fair trial into something of a national pastime in 2014. The show was downloaded more than 100 million times and won a Peabody Award for its role in illuminating flaws in the criminal justice system. At a news conference in Baltimore, Mr. Brown was asked if he thought there was any chance that the retrial could have come about without “Serial. ” “I don’t think so,” he said. On the possibility that Mr. Syed may eventually go free, Mr. Brown said: “I’m feeling pretty confident right now. This was the biggest hurdle. It’s really hard to get a new trial. ” On Thursday, Mr. Brown said that he had not been able to reach Mr. Syed to tell him the news, but by Friday, he said in a post on Twitter that his client had been “informed of the decision. ” The family of Ms. Lee has expressed pain and outrage at the attention surrounding Mr. Syed’s bid for a new trial. In a statement released through the Maryland Attorney General’s Office on Friday, the family said: “We continue to grieve. We continue to believe justice was done when Mr. Syed was convicted of killing Hae. ” For its part, the Attorney General’s Office said Thursday night that it had a responsibility to keep pursuing justice and “to defend what it believes is a valid conviction. ” Mr. Syed’s brother, Yusuf, 26, said in an interview on Thursday that the family had high hopes for a favorable decision, based on the strength of the legal arguments and the outpouring of support. “We really felt 100 percent that the judge would rule in our favor,” he said, adding, “We’ve been waiting 20 years for this. ” Rabia Chaudry, a family friend of Mr. Syed’s who introduced Sarah Koenig, the host of “Serial,” to the case, celebrated the decision online, thanking the judge and witnesses, among others. A production manager for “Serial,” Emily Condon, declined to comment on Thursday. The judge’s decision came after three days of postconviction hearings in February. Mr. Syed and his legal team had presented new evidence, including the testimony of a new alibi witness, and argued that his original defense counsel had been grossly negligent. The   proceedings were held before Judge Welch, a retired judge, who had granted Mr. Syed’s request for a hearing in November. Mr. Syed first filed a request for a postconviction hearing in 2010, but was denied. Mr. Syed’s defense had argued in February that the decision by Mr. Syed’s lawyer in the original trial, Maria Cristina Gutierrez, not to question a state’s expert, Abraham Waranowitz, about the reliability of evidence relating to cellphone towers constituted ineffective assistance. The judge’s decision to grant Mr. Syed a new trial turned on that issue. In a memo, Judge Welch wrote that Ms. Gutierrez’s failure to question Mr. Waranowitz “created a substantial possibility that the result of the trial was fundamentally unreliable. ” Judge Welch also said in the memo that the substantial public interest in the case did not affect his decision. “Regardless of the public interest surrounding this case, the court used its best efforts to address the merits of petitioner’s petition for postconviction relief like it would in any other case that comes before the court unfettered by sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion,” he wrote. Ms. Gutierrez was a prominent Baltimore defense lawyer in the 1990s whose career crumbled in 2001 when she was disbarred by consent after a state commission uncovered financial improprieties involving her clients. She told The Baltimore Sun at the time that her legal practice suffered in part because of her severe medical problems related to multiple sclerosis. She died of a heart attack in 2004. On Thursday, hundreds of fans of “Serial” took to social media, some of them to celebrate and others to emphasize that they still believed Mr. Syed was guilty. The podcast recently ended its second season, which told the story of Bowe Bergdahl, an American soldier in Afghanistan who was captured by the Taliban in 2009 and released as part of a prisoner swap in 2014.",0
840,NYT Admits Key Al Qaeda Role in Aleppo,"EDITOR'S CHOICE | 08.11.2016 NYT Admits Key Al Qaeda Role in Aleppo Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s As much as The New York Times and the mainstream U.S. media have become propaganda outlets on most foreign policy issues, like the one-sided coverage of the bloody Syrian war, sometimes the truth seeps through in on-the-ground reporting by correspondents, even ones who usually are pushing the “propo.” Such was the case with Anne Barnard’s new reporting from inside west Aleppo, the major portion of the city which is in government hands and copes with regular terror rocket and mortar attacks from rebel-held east Aleppo where Al Qaeda militants and U.S.-armed-and-funded “moderate” rebels fight side-by-side. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016. Power has been an advocate for escalating U.S. military involvement in Syria. (UN Photo) Almost in passing, Barnard’s article on Sunday acknowledged the rarely admitted reality of the Al Qaeda/”moderate” rebel collaboration, which puts the United States into a de facto alliance with Al Qaeda terrorists and their jihadist allies, fighting under banners such as Nusra Front (recently renamed Syria Conquest Front) and Ahrar al-Sham. Barnard also finally puts the blame for preventing civilians in east Aleppo from escaping the fighting on a rebel policy of keeping them in harm’s way rather than letting them transit through “humanitarian corridors” to safety. Some of her earlier pro-rebel accounts suggested that it wasn’t clear who was stopping movement of civilians through those corridors. However, on Sunday, she reported: “We had arrived at a critical moment, as Russia said there was only one day left to pass through a corridor it had provided for people to escape eastern Aleppo before the rebel side was flattened, a corridor through which precious few had passed. The government says rebels are preventing civilians from leaving. Rebels refuse any evacuation without international supervision and a broader deal to deliver humanitarian aid.” Granted, you still have to read between the lines, but at least there is the acknowledgement that rebels are refusing civilian evacuations under the current conditions. How that is different from Islamic State terrorists in Mosul, Iraq, preventing departures from their areas – a practice which the Times and other U.S. outlets condemn as using women and children as “human shields”– isn’t addressed. But Barnard’s crimped admission is at least a start. Barnard then writes: “Instead [of allowing civilians to move through the humanitarian corridors], they [the rebels] are trying to break the siege, with Qaeda-linked groups and those backed by the United States working together — the opposite of what Russia has demanded.” Again, that isn’t the clearest description of the situation, which is stunning enough that one might have expected it in the lede rather than buried deep inside the story, but it is significant that the Times is recognizing that Al Qaeda and the U.S.-backed “moderates” are “working together” and that Russia opposes that collaboration. She also noted that “Three Qaeda-linked suicide bombers attacked a military position with explosive-packed personnel carriers on Thursday, military officials said, and mortar fire was raining on neighborhoods that until now had been relatively safe. It was among the most intense rounds in four years of rebel shelling that officials say has killed 11,000 civilians.” While she then throws in a caveat about the impossibility of verifying the numbers, the acknowledgement that the U.S.-backed “moderate” rebels and their Al Qaeda comrades have been shelling civilians in west Aleppo is significant, too. Before this, all the American people heard was the other side, from rebel-held east Aleppo, about the human suffering there, often conveyed by “activists” with video cameras who have depicted the conflict as simply the willful killing of children by the evil Syrian government and the even more evil Russians. More Balance With the admission of rebel terror attacks on civilians in west Aleppo, the picture finally is put into more balance. The Al Qaeda and U.S.-backed rebels have been killing thousands of civilians in government-controlled areas and the Syrian military and its Russian allies have struck back only to be condemned for committing “war crimes.” The second plane about to crash into the World Trade Center towers in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001 Though the human toll in both sides of Aleppo is tragic, we have seen comparable situations before – in which the U.S. government has supported, supplied and encouraged governments to mount fierce offensives to silence rockets or mortars fired by rebels toward civilian areas. For instance, senior U.S. government officials, including President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, have defended Israel’s right to defend itself from rockets fired from inside Gaza even though those missiles rarely kill anyone. Yet, Israel is allowed to bomb the near-defenseless people of Gaza at will, killing thousands including the four little boys blown apart in July 2014 while playing on a beach during the last round of what the Israelis call “mowing the grass.” In the context of those deaths, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, who has built her career as a supposed humanitarian advocating a “responsibility to protect” civilians, laid the blame not on the Israeli military but on fighters in Gaza who had fired rockets that rarely hit anything besides sand. At the United Nations on July 18, 2014, Power said , “President Obama spoke with [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning to reaffirm the United States’ strong support for Israel’s right to defend itself…. Hamas’ attacks are unacceptable and would be unacceptable to any member state of the United Nations. Israel has the right to defend its citizens and prevent these attacks.” But that universal right apparently does not extend to Syria where U.S.-supplied rockets are fired into civilian neighborhoods of west Aleppo. In that case, Power and other U.S. officials apply an entirely different set of standards. Any Syrian or Russian destruction of east Aleppo with the goal of suppressing that rocket fire becomes a “war crime.” Perhaps it’s expected that the U.S. government, like other governments, will engage in hypocrisy regarding affairs of state: one set of rules for U.S. allies and another for countries marked for U.S. “regime change.” Statements by supposed “humanitarians”– such as Samantha Power, “Ms. R2P”– are no exception. But double standards are even more distasteful when they come from allegedly “objective” journalists such as those who work at The New York Times, The Washington Post and other prestige American news outlets. When they take the “U.S. side” in a dispute and become crude propagandists, they encourage the kind of misguided “group thinks” that led to the criminal Iraq War and other disastrous “regime change” projects over the past two decades. Yet, that is what we normally see. A thoughtful reader can’t peruse the international reporting of the U.S. mainstream media without realizing that it is corrupted by propaganda from both government officials and from U.S.-funded operations, often disguised as “human rights activists” or “citizen journalists” whose supposed independence makes their “propo” even more effective. So, it’s worth noting those rare occasions when The New York Times and the rest of the MSM let some of the reality peek through. When evaluating the latest plans from Hillary Clinton and other interventionists to expand the U.S. military intervention in Syria – via prettily named “safe zones” and “no-fly zones”– the American people should realize that they are being asked to come to the aid of Al Qaeda.

841,Scientists say weird signals from space are 'probably' aliens,"Scientists say weird signals from space are ‘probably’ aliens A team of astronomers believes that strange signals emanating from a cluster of stars are actually aliens trying to tell the universe they exist. The study, which appeared in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, analyzed the odd beams of light from 234 stars — a fraction of the 2.5 million that were observed. The bizarre beacons led the paper’s authors, Ermanno F. Borra and Eric Trottier from Laval University in Quebec, to conclude that it’s “probably” aliens. “We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,” wrote Borra and Trottier. They also note that their findings align with the Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) hypothesis, since the mysterious activity only occurred in a tiny fraction of stars. The hypothesis also suggests that an intelligent life force would use a more sophisticated optical beacon than, say, radio waves to reveal its existence. Click link for article... **MODS - If this is a duplicate please delete / and or lock ** So apparently signals detected from 230+ stars are fitting the hypothesized parameters established for extraterrestrial intelligence. The stars in question also fit the hypothesized parameters for supporting life. Since only a small amount of stars in the area being looked at are fitting the parameters they are using that as further evidence in support of their claims. Thoughts?",0
842,U.S. Swimmers’ Disputed Robbery Claim Fuels Tension in Brazil - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Soon after the first news media reports surfaced Sunday morning of an armed assault on four American swimmers, the athletes were interviewed at the United States Olympic team’s hospitality house by State Department officials, national swim team officials and Olympic officials. They all agreed that the swimmers should avoid further attention and that the United States Olympic Committee would soon put out a statement. But Ryan Lochte, a   medal winner, left the hospitality house and walked across the street to Ipanema Beach, where he gave a lurid interview to NBC, describing a    holdup by men identifying themselves as police officers. Mr. Lochte’s account touched off a dispute that quickly transcended sports, emerging as a point of tension between the United States and Brazil as the authorities in Rio de Janeiro faced scrutiny over their security preparations for the Olympics in a city on edge over a crime wave and gun battles between drug gangs and the police. On Thursday, Mr. Lochte’s account came under siege by the Brazilian police in an internationally televised news conference. They said he had fabricated his description of the episode, damaging Rio’s image at its moment on the global stage. “We saw our city stained by a fantastical version,” said Fernando Veloso, the Civil Police chief for the state of Rio de Janeiro. Beyond the sensitive issues of sovereignty and nationalism around the Rio Olympics, the episode unleashed a discussion around Brazil about perceptions of privilege, accountability and danger in a society where many Brazilians themselves often lament their exposure to alarming levels of violent crime and police corruption. The episode “has tapped into one of Brazilians’ biggest pet peeves  —   gringos who treat their country like a   spring break destination where you can lie to the cops and get away with it,” said Brian Winter, vice president for policy at Americas Society and Council of the Americas. The uproar has its origins in a lavish Olympics party hosted by the French authorities over the weekend at the Sociedade Hípica, a riding club that is a bastion for Rio’s   elite. The four swimmers  —   Mr. Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz  —   stumbled out at dawn into a taxi for the ride across Rio to their lodgings in the Olympic Village. In his original account, Mr. Lochte said the car had been pulled over by armed men, one of whom put a gun against his head before taking the cash from his wallet. But police investigators said Thursday that Mr. Lochte and the others had acted more like   vandals than the victims they claimed to be. Making a stop around 6 a. m. Sunday at a Shell gas station, the men were obviously drunk, the station’s owner said. They broke a soap dispenser in the bathroom, damaged a door, tore down a sign and urinated around the premises, the owner told reporters. “One of them was really worked up,” said Mr. Veloso, the police chief, who described Mr. Lochte, 32, as a kind of elder ringleader of the group. Mr. Lochte had left Brazil before a judge ordered the police to seize his passport. Mr. Bentz, 20, and Mr. Conger, 21, flew back to the United States on Thursday night, the United States Olympic Committee said in a statement. Mr. Feigen, 26, remained in Brazil on Thursday evening, but on Friday morning, after meeting with a judge and prosecutors, his lawyer, Breno Melaragno Costa, told reporters that Mr. Feigen had agreed to pay 35, 000 reals, or about $10, 800, to a Brazilian organization called the Reaction Institute, as part of a deal to avoid prosecution, The Associated Press and ABC News reported. The Brazilian police suggested on Thursday that Mr. Lochte and Mr. Feigen, the only swimmers who had given initial testimony to investigators about the episode, could face charges of providing false testimony about a crime. Mr. Bentz and Mr. Conger, who were pulled off their plane by the police on Wednesday in Rio, offered testimony on Thursday that contradicted Mr. Lochte’s accounts, police investigators said. The two men were still shouted down as “liars” by a crowd when they left a Rio police station. The sight of the athletes wading through the crowd, along with a torrent of venomous comments by Brazilians on social media, raised concerns after a period in which Brazil and the United States had experienced a thawing of ties, with law enforcement officials working closely to identify potential security threats during the Olympics. “This episode will not in any way interfere in the relations between the U. S. and Brazil,” said Eliseu Padilha, the chief of staff for Brazil’s interim president, Michel Temer. Mr. Padilha added, “This could have happened with individuals of any other nationality. ” Using video footage, accounts from witnesses and testimony from the swimmers, investigators said a security guard had brandished a gun after one or more of the athletes vandalized the gas station bathroom. In his original account, Mr. Lochte claimed that men claiming to be police officers had pulled over the taxi and that an assailant had put a cocked gun to his forehead before taking his money. He later altered that account, saying the taxi had stopped at a gas station so the athletes could use the bathroom. Still, the description of the security guard’s use of a gun dovetailed with Mr. Lochte’s   explanations of the episode, raising the possibility that the men had felt during the confusion of the moment that they were being pressured to hand over their money. Mr. Veloso, the police chief, said he could not rule out that there was an extortion attempt by the guards, whom he described as “public agents,” a term that can be used for police officers or other members of the public security forces. Another police official clarified that the guards were   prison guards working a second job at the gas station. “For the time being, nothing indicates” extortion, Mr. Veloso said, emphasizing that the guards were reacting to four large athletes “exhibiting, at a minimum, inadequate attitudes, breaking things and showing themselves ready to elevate the level of violence. ” In the midst of the confusion at the gas station, someone called the police, but by the time a police car arrived, the swimmers were gone. Witnesses, including a man who offered to translate for the swimmers, said they had offered to give money to the manager before leaving. Mr. Lochte’s lawyer, Jeff Ostrow, said the video footage had corroborated the “primary elements” of his client’s descriptions of the episode. “There was a uniformed person with a gun who forced them to hand over their money,” Mr. Ostrow said. Mr. Veloso said one of the first leads in the investigation had come from a taxi driver who gave a ride to two Brazilian women who had left the same party and discussed having romantic encounters with the swimmers. “At least one of the athletes may have had a motive for telling a story that wasn’t true,” Mr. Veloso said, raising the possibility that the accounts were fabricated to disguise that the swimmers had remained at the party until almost sunrise. Mr. Veloso did not specify which of the swimmers might have had that motive. Still, Judge Marcello Rubioli, the head of the special court handling the case involving the swimmers, said that making a false claim in Brazil was “not that serious” and “results in very little punishment. ” “If they are found guilty, they would just have to make a payment to an N. G. O. that does humanitarian work,” he continued, referring to a nongovernmental organization. The new turns in the case raised tensions around Brazil, with some commentators questioning the role of American Olympic officials in providing confusing initial accounts and then shielding the swimmers from scrutiny. But Olympic officials in Rio seemed to be trying to play down the episode. “No apologies from him or from the other athletes are needed,” said Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympics organizing committee, referring to Mr. Lochte. “We need to understand that these kids were trying to have fun. ” He added, “Sometimes you take actions that you later regret. ” Some in Rio lamented the episode, though, emphasizing that they wished the police were always so efficient in clearing up reports of violent crime. Before the Olympics, the authorities had sought to ease fears by deploying a security force comprising 85, 000 police officers and soldiers. “The real dilemma is that people in this city live in fear of crime,” said Eduardo Rangel, 64, the owner of store selling office supplies. “The swimmers took advantage of the mess that exists around here to further denigrate the city. That doesn’t mean Rio is some paradise without crime. ” Others in Rio, however, said they felt deeply insulted by the behavior of the American swimmers. “These guys from abroad think they’re superior to us, that they can come here, make a mess, lie about it and stain the image of Brazil,” said Airton Rocha, 28, a waiter at a cafe. “Well, the law is the law, and it should apply to everyone in the same way. ” Late Thursday night, American Olympics officials issued an apology. “The behavior of these athletes is not acceptable, nor does it represent the values of Team USA or the conduct of the vast majority of its members,” said the statement, which was attributed to the organization’s chief executive, Scott Blackmun. “On behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, we apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellence. ”",0
843,5 Ways to Take a Self-Care Vacation - The New York Times,"In the past five weeks, you’ve seen America inaugurate a president, march for women’s rights, protest an immigration order and debate a Supreme Court nominee. Even if you’ve only occasionally peeked at the news, the shock of so many updates may have left you reeling. This is the moment for a   vacation, especially one where the focus isn’t on screens. But it sounds easier than it is. “Being so technologically connected all the time, as many of us are, is overwhelming, and a break is a way to show yourself some love,” said Miriam Geiser, a travel consultant with KK Travels Worldwide in Chicago who has planned   getaways for clients and has taken several herself. “A   vacation is about slowing down and nurturing yourself so you feel truly mentally and physically rested at the end,” she said. Here is advice on how to take such a trip. D. I. Y. a Digital Detox  You don’t have to camp on a remote island to shed your devices. Leave your laptop and iPad at home, and lock your cellphone in your hotel room safe, using it only for emergencies. Sometimes, just the idea of cutting the cord can lead to anxiety, and the first few hours of such a trip can feel stressful, but Ms. Geiser said that many of her clients who have taken digital detox trips report feeling liberated and peaceful by the second day of their vacation. Suggested destinations: Post Ranch Inn in Big Sur, Calif. and any national park within driving distance. Painting Away the Pressure You don’t have to be Picasso, but a vacation incorporating art can inspire creativity in your everyday life, according to Susan Sparks, a travel adviser at Points of Interest Travel in Aspen, Colo. “Art is a way to express yourself and go beyond your usual spectrum, and that can be very reviving,” she said. Many resorts and spas around the world offer art classes, ranging from a few hours to several days, in painting, sculpture and collage. Suggested destinations: Vik Retreats in Uruguay Ojai Valley Inn  Spa in Ojai, Calif. and Sundance Mountain Resort in Sundance, Utah. Immerse Yourself in Nature There’s nothing more relaxing, according to Ms. Geiser, than being surrounded by nature. Hearing the sound of crashing waves or chirping birds and insects, taking in a beautiful vista on a pristine lake, smelling the flowers of a tropical garden or feeling the warmth of the sunshine on your skin stimulate the senses in a positive way and take you away from the hubbub of your daily life. Spend your days on a   trip, going on hikes, bike rides and walks, or consider kayaking, fishing, horseback riding or snowshoeing. Suggested destinations: Lake Kora in the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York the Resort at Paws Up in Greenough, Mont. Jade Mountain Resort in St. Lucia Minaret Station on South Island in New Zealand. Savoring Rather Than   Food  —   cooking and eating it  —   can actually be a destressor, Ms. Sparks said. “Cooking, even if you only do it for a few hours, shuts off your brain, and at the end, you have a meal that you put your heart and soul into,” she said. Weeklong cooking holidays abound around the world. Suggested destinations: Mamma Agata, a cooking school on the Amalfi Coast of Italy and Ballymaloe Cookery School in County Cork, Ireland. Many hotels also offer   and   cooking classes. The Wellness Retreat Route The singular focus of these means that they do often work.

844,370 Economists Sign Letter Urging America Not To Vote For Donald Trump,"By Jason Easley   5:03 pm 370 of nation's top economists have come together to urge the American people not to elect Donald Trump to be the next President Of The United States.   
370 of nation’s top economists have come together to urge the American people not to elect Donald Trump to be the next President Of The United States. 
In the letter , the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for Trump, but it as their conclusion that was stunning, “He promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options.Donald Trump is a dangerous, destructive choice for the country. He misinforms the electorate, degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories, and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality. If elected, he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions, and to the prosperity of the country. For these reasons, we strongly recommend that you do not vote for Donald Trump.” 
Trump’s thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country. It isn’t just that Trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president. It is also that his policies are nonsense. 
Economists don’t write these types of letters ever. The economists aren’t discussing partisan politics. They view Trump and his ideas as a threat to the American economy. 
Donald Trump’s economic ideas aren’t based in reality. Trump is selling a fantasy, and when 370 of the nation’s top economists warn that a vote for Trump is a dangerous choice for the country, voters would be wise to listen.",0
845,"Campaigns Are Long, Expensive and Chaotic. Maybe That’s a Good Thing. - The New York Times","The election of a president of the United States isn’t just democracy in circuslike action. It also may be, at its core, the most elaborate and expensive recruitment and hiring process that mankind has ever created. You can think of a presidential election as being like a particularly large company’s search for a chief executive. In this case, the search costs a couple of billion dollars (the amount that will be expended on campaigns) has a hiring committee of 127 million people (the number of voters last cycle) and is covered at every turn by virtually every media organization on earth. What, then, can the latest evidence about best hiring practices tell us about the election, in which hiring the best employee has particularly high stakes? Good news: The answers might just make you feel a little better about American democracy. In the last several years, there has been a lot of evidence, both from academic work and from companies that approach recruitment analytically, that traditional job interviews aren’t particularly good tools for identifying the best employees. One conclusion: It’s a bad idea to hire someone primarily based on a job interview, or on a manager’s gut instinct. Some people perform better when being interviewed, but that seems to be a   skill. It doesn’t tell you much about whether a person would be a good software engineer or accountant. “Interviewers are likely to feel they are getting useful information from unstructured interviews, even when they are useless,” concluded a 2013 article in the academic journal Judgment and Decision Making. “Our simple recommendation for those who make screening decisions is not to use them,” wrote Jason Dana, Robyn Dawes and Nathanial Peterson. Major companies have come to the same conclusion. Google long had a reputation for putting job candidates through multiple interviews and asking potential employees    questions to see how they responded. Not anymore. “We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job,” Google’s chief human resources executive, Laszlo Bock, told The New York Times in 2013. “We found zero relationship. It’s a complete random mess. ” Maybe the search committee for the next president  —   that is, every American voter  —   shouldn’t put too much weight on what they see in unstructured press interviews with candidates. I argue that speeches and debate performances fit the same pattern, in that they are performances that don’t tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presidency that takes place  . So what does work? Google found that structured interviews, in which applicants are asked uniform, concrete questions, were helpful. And a large body of work suggests that tests and simulations can give particularly useful information about how a person will perform on the job. Economists looked at data from firms employing   workers, in which some managers had the discretion to hire the employees they thought were the best fit, while others relied on a performance test. Those hired with tests alone stayed in the jobs 15 percent longer than those chosen by managers, a sign they were a better match. And in an experiment with British doctors, a daylong series of simulations, such as interaction with an actor playing a sick patient, more accurately predicted their future performance than a   test. Plenty of companies in a wide range of fields have embraced the idea. Consulting firms like McKinsey have long hired bright young M. B. A.s in part by giving them a case study of a business challenge and asking them a series of questions about how they would approach the problem. If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee, what does that mean for picking a president? Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they must jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation. That won’t happen anytime soon. But in a weird way, we might be seeing a version of exactly that simulation. What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? He or she needs to be good at hiring and trusting the right people making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted setting the right big picture strategy and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments. If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president! The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a businessman, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we’re seeing an    comparison in how they run a campaign. Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the aforementioned mix of smart   strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions? It’s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party’s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a   test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid. In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did. The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C. E. O. you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that’s exactly what you’re getting.",0
846,‘Alien Megastructure’ Star Targeted by $100 Million SETI Search,"By Mike Wall
If intelligent aliens actually do live around Tabby’s star , astronomers are determined to find them.
The Breakthrough Listen initiative, which will spend $100 million over the next 10 years to hunt for signals possibly produced by alien civilizations, is set to begin studying Tabby’s star with the 330-foot-wide (100 meters) Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, project team members announced Tuesday (Oct. 25).
“The Green Bank Telescope is the largest fully steerable radio telescope on the planet, and it’s the largest, most sensitive telescope that’s capable of looking at Tabby’s star given its position in the sky,” Breakthrough Listen co-director Andrew Siemion, who also directs the Berkeley SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement.
“We’ve deployed a fantastic new SETI instrument that connects to that telescope, that can look at many gigahertz of bandwidth simultaneously and many, many billions of different radio channels all at the same time so we can explore the radio spectrum very, very quickly,” Siemion added.
The observations will take place for 8 hours per night for three nights over the next two months, with the first observations set to take place Wednesday (Oct. 26), project team members said.
Tabby’s star, officially known as KIC 8462852, lies about 1,500 light-years from Earth. Observations by NASA’s Kepler space telescope showed that the star dimmed dramatically several times over the past half-decade or so, at one point by a whopping 22 percent. These occasional brightness dips — which were first reported last year by a team led by Yale University postdoc Tabetha Boyajian (hence the star’s nickname) — are far too substantial to be caused by an orbiting planet, astronomers have said.
So researchers have offered up a number of alternative explanations for the dimming to date. Perhaps a cloud of comet fragments periodically blocks the star’s light, for example, or maybe some unknown structure in the depths of space between Earth and Tabby’s star is responsible.
It’s even possible that the brightness dips are caused by an “alien megastructure” — an enormous collection of energy-gathering solar panels, for example.
Astronomers have stressed that the megastructure hypothesis is a long shot, but long shots shouldn’t be dismissed out of hand, Breakthough Listen team members said.
“I don’t think it’s very likely — a one-in-a-billion chance or something like that — but nevertheless, we’re going to check it out,” Dan Werthimer, chief scientist at Berkeley SETI, said in the same statement . “But I think that E.T., if it’s ever discovered, it might be something like that. It’ll be some bizarre thing that somebody finds by accident … that nobody expected, and then we look more carefully and we say, ‘Hey, that’s a civilization.'”
A number of other research teams have already searched for signals coming from Tabby’s star, and all of those searches have come up empty so far.
Siemion, Boyajian and astronomer Jason Wright, who’s based at Pennsylvania State University, will discuss the planned Tabby’s star observations during a video chat from the Green Bank Telescope site on Wednesday at 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT). You can watch it live here:

848,Brazen Killing of Myanmar Lawyer Came After He Sparred With Military - The New York Times,"YANGON, Myanmar  —   The   rights lawyer had devised a plan to replace Myanmar’s Constitution with one that would strip the military of its extraordinary political powers. The lawyer, U Ko Ni, a top adviser to the governing National League for Democracy, had recently been working on a new draft, a colleague said, and he hoped to promote his project at a conference this month. But when he returned to the Yangon airport on Sunday from a trip to Indonesia, cradling his young grandson in his arms as he waited for a taxi, a man drew a pistol and shot him in the head. The killing appears to have been a rare political assassination in Myanmar, fueling rumors, distrust and worry about the country’s future. “This bullet was not only for Ko Ni,” the colleague, U Thein Than Oo, a human rights lawyer in Mandalay, Myanmar, said by telephone. “It was for the N. L. D. and the people who want to amend and replace the 2008 Constitution and support the peace process. ” The Myanmar police have said that the assailant, detained shortly after the shooting, was a professional hit man, and they  have arrested three other suspects in the attack, including the man they say hired the killer. The police have not announced a motive for the killing. It is not clear whether Mr. Ko Ni could have succeeded in changing the Constitution, although colleagues said he had been pressing the case. While unverified rumors swirled on Myanmar’s social media this week that the military was behind the killing, the police said there was no evidence to support the claims. The assistant secretary of the   Home Affairs Ministry, U Maung Maung Myint, issued a statement on Wednesday denying rumors that the home affairs minister, Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swe, had orchestrated the killing. But even as a few details began to leak out, there were still more questions than answers. Those guessing at motives noted that Mr. Ko Ni, 65, was one of the country’s most prominent Muslims in a majority Buddhist country torn by religious strife. But he was hardly a firebrand. While he did not hesitate to advocate the legal rights of Muslims and other minorities whenever he felt they were threatened, he did not promote Islamic law and he backed a decision by the National League for Democracy not to field Muslim candidates in the 2015 election, telling a reporter at the time that it was not worth it given the polarized political climate. Instead, he expressed an inclusive vision that was shaped in part by his background as the son of an ethnic Burmese and Buddhist mother and a Muslim father from India. “He was a man who could appreciate different traditions precisely because his own tradition in his country did not always receive the respect that it deserved,” said Melissa Crouch, an expert on Myanmar’s Constitution at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The main suspect, U Kyi Lin, had been jailed from 2003 to 2014 for smuggling ancient Buddha statues, according to police statements and leaked police documents. That would hardly be the profile of a radical Buddhist. Mr. Kyi Lin was pardoned in 2014 in a prisoner amnesty by the government of former President Thein Sein, who was an army general. Some lawyers wondered how the gunman had acquired a   pistol, which is manufactured by the Myanmar Army, in a country where civilian firearm sales have been prohibited for decades. There was also speculation about how the attacker could have carried out the killing in daylight in a public place that is among the country’s most secure and that regularly hosts national and foreign dignitaries. All of which lead Mr. Ko Ni’s friends and colleagues back to his efforts to challenge the military and its powerful supporters. A canny constitutional lawyer, Mr. Ko Ni had outmaneuvered the military before. Before the military dictatorship that ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years allowed democratic elections, it left in place a Constitution that barred anyone with a spouse or child with foreign citizenship from becoming president. That clause was aimed at one person: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the popular Nobel laureate and leader of the National League for Democracy, whose husband, now dead, was British and whose sons are also British citizens. Mr. Ko Ni is widely credited with helping devise the strategy that allowed her to take power after her party won a landslide election in 2015. Parliament created a new position, state counselor, that would be above the president and appointed her to the job. Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official in Yangon, called the move a legal “fudge” that may have survived because Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party controlled the courts. But he said that Mr. Ko Ni was among the most knowledgeable legal minds in the National League for Democracy orbit. “There aren’t many people like that, so in that sense, he played a very important role,” Mr. Horsey said. But the party has long had another target: eliminating the special powers for the military enshrined in the Constitution, including a crucial veto. The veto is actually two parts: a quota that allocates a quarter of the seats in Parliament to the military, and the requirement of a 75 percent majority to pass a constitutional amendment. Mr. Ko Ni had proposed introducing a bill on a referendum about drafting a new constitution. The bill could be passed with a simple majority, which the National League for Democracy could easily muster. “If the military still focuses on protecting its interests, it will be impossible to change any part of the Constitution within Parliament,” he said last year, according to The Myanmar Times. “That’s why writing a new one is the best way to pursue a democratic Constitution. ” Party officials, however, have not publicly endorsed this solution, and U Win Htein, a party leader contacted this week, said the party still favored amending, rather than replacing, the Constitution. But Mr. Ko Ni was still promoting the idea, and one colleague, Mr. Thein Than Oo, said that “one of his last works” had been drafting a new Constitution. The consequences of the killing for the country will depend on what motive is ultimately established, as well as the transparency of the police investigation. But the killing has already demonstrated that the rule of law in Myanmar remains fragile, and it could further erode the National League for Democracy’s ability to govern, said Elliot Brennan, a Myanmar specialist and a research fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm. Initial expectations that the party could bring major changes to Myanmar were “far too high, and we’ve been waiting for the expectations, the red balloon, to pop,” he said. “The assassination might not be the final pinprick, but we’re getting very close. ” That the party leadership has said little about the killing has raised questions about its ability to handle the situation. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced international criticism for recent military operations in   Rakhine State against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority, has also been rebuked. The office of Myanmar’s president, U Htin Kyaw, said in a statement on Monday that the attack had been carried out to undermine the country’s stability. U Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, later said that the statement by the president’s office had been made on her behalf. But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not attend Mr. Ko Ni’s funeral, and his daughter, Dr. Yin Nwe Khaine, said on Wednesday that, to the best of her knowledge, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had not sent condolences. She said she knew that her father’s work carried risks, but that he never talked about them at home. “He always said that lawyers are forever worrying, and he never wanted to pass those worries on to his family,” she said by telephone, fighting back tears. But he did train her to be strong in difficult times, she added, and this was one of them. “My father is my hero,” she said.",0
850,Jane Pauley Is Back — Again - The New York Times,"Shortly after Jane Pauley’s daytime talk show was canceled 11 years ago, she thought that might be it for her. Though long forgotten, “The Jane Pauley Show” was a program NBC spent millions on, and executives had very high hopes for it. Instead, it was a bust, and was yanked off the air after one season. “I didn’t expect to have a career in television after that,” Ms. Pauley said in a recent interview. For a while, it looked like she might be right. All anchors of a certain age  —   particularly women  —   are confronted with the reality of diminished opportunity, and even with a distinguished broadcasting career, Ms. Pauley was no exception. Over the course of the next several years, there were some work with PBS, the irregular appearance on “Today” where she profiled aging baby boomers, and little else. And then came an unexpected comeback. She signed on with CBS two years ago and started doing features for its popular “Sunday Morning” program and filling in for various anchors, including on “CBS This Morning” and “The Evening News. ” And on Sunday she will triumphantly return to the spotlight: A couple weeks shy of 66, Ms. Pauley will formally succeed Charles Osgood as the anchor of “Sunday Morning. ” “There have been high points in my career, and low points as well,” she said. “But even at the low points there have always been these rebounds. Like those trick birthday candles: It flickers off, and comes on again!” Ms. Pauley was sitting on a couch at the CBS Broadcast Center, nursing a cup of tea to help her stave off a coughing fit. (She said she got a cold from her grandchildren by way of her husband, the “Doonesbury” creator Garry Trudeau.) She was quick to point out the fairly incredible timing of her “Sunday Morning” debut: It will occur almost 40 years after her first day as a   on “Today” where, at 25, she followed Barbara Walters. Her first day at “Today” was Oct. 11, 1976. But as much as Ms. Pauley will be remembered for her broadcast accomplishments, it is her departures that have prompted more sensational headlines. “I always make news by leaving,” she said, laughing. Well before Ann Curry’s disastrous departure from “Today,” in 2012, Ms. Pauley also left the show in acrimonious circumstances. NBC had brought in Deborah Norville to join Ms. Pauley and Bryant Gumbel in 1989. Ms. Pauley figured NBC had hired her replacement, and decided to act first: She announced shortly after Ms. Norville’s arrival that she was leaving the show. The damage to NBC was significant. Viewers were repelled by what they perceived as Ms. Pauley being pushed out, and fled “Today” for “Good Morning America” on ABC. The magazine editor Michael Kinsley once said Ms. Pauley was “the first baby boomer they tried to put out to pasture   …     and failed. ” Ms. Pauley stayed with NBC and moved onto a successful   run as   of the newsmagazine show “Dateline. ” But Ms. Pauley decided it was time to do something different, and in 2003 announced she would leave that show. NBC was caught off guard by her decision and what followed was yet another wave of warm publicity for her. NBC’s parent company found a way to get her to stay. “I think NBC noticed I’m getting all this attention and then came to me with the offer of a daytime show,” she said. Ms. Pauley has long been praised for exuding normalness on camera (“She’s as skilled a prompter reader as anyone I’ve worked with in 40 years in the business,” said Michael Weisman, the producer of her daytime show). That skill set did not carry over for her talk show. “People respected her and liked her, but she wasn’t relatable to the typical daytime audience,” Mr. Weisman said. “She was somebody who you would go to for career advice, not the girlfriend who you’d go to for cooking tips or weight loss tips or who’s dating who. ” Ms. Pauley said she was proud of the show, but even she acknowledged that it was a failure. And that is when she entered what she describes as her “fallow period. ” She returned to “Today’’ with a    segment about baby boomers. In 2014, she published a book, “Your Life Calling: Reimagining the Rest of Your Life,” that was inspired by those spots. The AARP paid for and sponsored the segment  —   which is why Ms. Pauley says she believes “Today” broadcast it  —   but just as she was beginning her book tour, the AARP said it was ending its commitment. Once again, Ms. Pauley was a television personality without a television job. “It wasn’t a tremendous disappointment but it was a little awkward in that I was on book tour talking about the future and I didn’t have one,” she said. Until she did again. While promoting her book, she was featured on “Sunday Morning. ” That is when CBS producers noticed something unusual: Emails were pouring in from viewers about how much they enjoyed the segment. CBS signed her as a contributor. Ms. Pauley leapt at the chance, and what was a modest commitment soon turned into steady work. When Mr. Osgood, the      host of “Sunday Morning,” was ready to step aside after more than two decades, CBS turned to Ms. Pauley. David Rhodes, the CBS News president, said that Ms. Pauley’s range, reputation and warmth made her the right steward for the job. “Sunday Morning” is the highest rated show on Sunday mornings, and CBS needs it to stay that way. “As much as you always want to bring new viewers to a program, this broadcast has a very dedicated audience,” Mr. Rhodes said. “You can’t chase them away. ” Ms. Pauley said that there would be few changes to the quirky show and that she was confident of one thing: she would be a good fit as anchor, she said repeatedly during the interview. And after a stretch where TV work was hard to come by, she said she’s soaking it all in now. “Where I come from  —   which is Indiana, and I’m a Hoosier five generations both sides  —   you do not boast or brag,” she said. “It’s an old joke of mine that the only thing we’re entitled to brag about is our humility. I’ve been dragging that around my whole career by apologizing, or saying ‘Oh, I’m so lucky. ’” She started laughing and added, “I seem to be over that. ”",0
851,"People Power! Natives declare treaty rights, police admit defeat - cite lack of 'manpower' to remove DAPL protesters","Wed, 26 Oct 2016 23:00 UTC Authorities in North Dakota may be feeling the heat from the international attention the Dakota Access Pipeline is getting. They're now saying they lack the manpower to remove the encampment of protesters located on federal land near the controversial pipeline. The announcement may signal a softening of the treatment the protesters, up until now, have been receiving. For months now, The Free Thought Project 's spotlight has been shining on the, some might say, dark and dirty deeds of law enforcement and their treatment of largely Native American peaceful protesters. Attack dogs were unleashed on the protesters in September, injuring six, and an additional 30 protesters, including children, were sprayed with pepper spray. In all, more than 260 people have reportedly been arrested since the protests began in Morton County — over 100 this weekend alone. The sheriff's office's announcement comes just two days after The Free Thought Project encouraged readers to contact Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier's office demanding him to allow for peaceful protest, even providing a link to a petition for his removal. Spokeswoman Donnell Preskey told The Associated Press the department doesn't ""have the manpower"" to remove the more than 100 protesters from the property. ""We can't right now,"" she said. Preskey said the land belongs to a Texas-based firm, Energy Transfer Partners, and was purchased from a local rancher for an undisclosed price. According to the AP , the Native Americans claim the land is theirs by way of an, ""1851 treaty and they won't leave until the pipeline is stopped."" ""We never ceded this land,"" said protester Joye Braun. ""The $3.8 billion pipeline, most of which has been completed, crosses through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Opponents worry about potential effects on drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux's reservation and farther downstream on the Missouri River, as well as destruction of cultural artifacts,"" writes the AP. The disputed ranch is more than 100 years old and was the first one to be inducted into the North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame. According to the AP: ""It is within a half-mile of a larger encampment on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' land where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and hundreds of others have gathered in protest. Protesters do not have a federal permit to be on the corps' land, but the agency said it wouldn't evict them due to free speech reasons . Authorities have criticized that decision, saying the site has been a launching point for protests at construction sites in the area."" While the announcement by the Morton County Sheriff's office may signal a change in tone and the potential for more relaxed police tactics, it remains to be seen. Late Monday, Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II issued the following statement, calling on the Obama Administration's U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the militant treatment of its peaceful protesters, and asked for an injunction to the pipeline's construction. Archambault wrote; The militarization of local law enforcement and enlistment of multiple law enforcements agencies from neighboring states is needlessly escalating violence and unlawful arrests against peaceful protestors at Standing Rock. We do not condone reports of illegal actions, but believe the majority of peaceful protestors are reacting to strong-arm tactics and abuses by law enforcement. Thousands of water protectors have joined the Tribe in solidarity against DAPL, without incident or serious injury. Yet, North Dakota law enforcement have proceeded with a disproportionate response to their nonviolent exercise of their First Amendment rights, even going as far as labeling them rioters and calling their every action illegal. We are disappointed to see that our state and congressional delegations and Gov. Jack Dalrymple have failed to ensure the safety and rights of the citizens engaged in peaceful protests who were arrested on Saturday. Their lack of leadership and commitment to creating a dialogue towards a peaceful solution reflects not only the unjust historical narrative against Native Americans, but a dangerous trend in law enforcement tactics across America. For these reasons, we believe the situation at Standing Rock deserves the immediate and full attention of the U.S. Department of Justice. Furthermore, the DOJ should impose an injunction to all developments at the pipeline site to keep ALL citizens - law enforcement and protestors - safe. The DOJ should be enlisted and expected to investigate the overwhelming reports and videos demonstrating clear strong-arm tactics, abuses and unlawful arrests by law enforcement. The chairman's request seems to validate many of the reports coming from the field, that peaceful protesters are being labeled as rioters and are not being treated with the dignity they feel they deserve. As The Free Thought Project reported two days ago, many of the protesters are being thrown to the ground, squashed underfoot, strip-searched, and forced to remove sacred hair braids — all considered ""strong-arm tactics, abuses, and unlawful,"" by Archambault.",0
852,Deutsche Bank Considering Alternatives To Paying Cash Bonus,"By Zero Hedge
It has been at least a few weeks since Deutsche Bank appeared in the flashing red breaking news sections of newswires, with news that was – mostly – negative. And while the stock has since rebounded materially, wiping out all losses since the DOJ’s $14 billion RMBS settlement leak, it appears that not everything is back to normal for the largest German lender. Because in what may be the worst news yet for DB’s employees, moments ago Bloomberg reported that the German Bank is exploring “ alternatives to paying bonuses in cash ” as Chief Executive Officer John Cryan seeks to boost capital buffers.
According to Bloomberg, DB executives have discussed options including giving some bankers shares in the non-core unit instead of cash bonuses. Another idea under review is replacing the cash component with more Deutsche Bank stock.
The supervisory board may discuss the topic of variable pay at a meeting on Wednesday though no final decisions are expected, the people said, the day before it reports third-quarter earnings. The measures, if pursued in the coming months, would mostly impact the investment bank, the people said . The Frankfurt-based lender is still considering other alternatives, they said.
As Bloomberg adds, any bonus-related decision will depend on the size and timing of Deutsche Bank’s settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over a probe into the the sale of faulty real-estate securities. Last year, Deutsche Bank awarded staff 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of bonuses for 2015, 1.45 billion euros of which was for the combined investment banking and trading unit. Of the 2.4 billion euros, 49 percent was deferred stock and cash while the remainder was paid out immediately. It appears that DB wants to take the 49% number and make it bigger.
The idea echoes a similar move by Credit Suisse Group AG at the height of the financial crisis, when the Swiss firm used its most illiquid loans and bonds to pay employees’ year-end bonuses.
The report is comparable to a similar announcement made exactly one year ago , when DB announced it may slash bonuses by as much as one third. Since then, however, DB’s aggressive cost cutting initative has made life for the bank’s employees progressively more miserable. Since taking over in 2015, Cryan has suspended the dividend, reduced bonuses, cut risky assets, frozen new hiring and announced plans to shed some 9,000 jobs. The CEO has already said Deutsche Bank may fail to be profitable this year after posting the first annual loss since 2008 last year. Now, DB bankers may end up getting “paid” in some of the billions in impaired tanker loans, carried quietly on the bank’s book, if not CDS or interest rate swaps. Those DB certainly has a lot of.
Should DB be successful with this significant shift in compensation strategy without leading to an exodus of workers, it will likely be attempted at other banks as the core problems facing Deutsche Bank, namely declining profitability, have now become systemic across the entire banking sector. Which is bad news for investment bankers everywhere.

What ensued in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and in a   court decision handed down on Monday, was an exercise in   grammar pedantry that could cost a dairy company in Portland, Me. an estimated $10 million. In 2014, three truck drivers sued Oakhurst Dairy, seeking more than four years’ worth of overtime pay that they had been denied. Maine law requires workers to be paid 1. 5 times their normal rate for each hour worked after 40 hours, but it carves out some exemptions. A quick punctuation lesson before we proceed: In a list of three or more items  —   like “beans, potatoes and rice”  —   some people would put a comma after potatoes, and some would leave it out. A lot of people feel very, very strongly about it. The debate over commas is often a pretty inconsequential one, but it was anything but for the truck drivers. Note the lack of Oxford comma  —   also known as the serial comma  —   in the following state law, which says overtime rules do not apply to: Does the law intend to exempt the distribution of the three categories that follow, or does it mean to exempt packing for the shipping or distribution of them? Delivery drivers distribute perishable foods, but they don’t pack the boxes themselves. Whether the drivers were subject to a law that had denied them thousands of dollars a year depended entirely on how the sentence was read. If there were a comma after “shipment,” it might have been clear that the law exempted the distribution of perishable foods. But the appeals court on Monday sided with the drivers, saying the absence of a comma produced enough uncertainty to rule in their favor. It reversed a lower court decision. In other words: Oxford comma defenders won this round. “That comma would have sunk our ship,” David G. Webbert, a lawyer who represented the drivers, said in an interview on Wednesday. The language in the law followed guidelines in the Maine Legislative Drafting Manual, which specifically instructs lawmakers to not use the Oxford comma. Don’t write “trailers, semitrailers, and pole trailers,” it says  —   instead, write “trailers, semitrailers and pole trailers. ” The manual does clarify that caution should be taken if an item in the series is modified. Commas, it notes, “are the most misused and misunderstood punctuation marks in legal drafting and, perhaps, the English language. ” “Use them thoughtfully and sparingly,” it cautions. Legal history is replete with cases in which a comma made all the difference, like a $1 million dispute between Canadian companies in 2006 or a very costly insertion of a comma in an 1872 tariff law. Varying interpretations of a comma in the Second Amendment have figured in court decisions on gun laws, including a Federal District Court overturning a Washington gun ordinance in 2007. (The Supreme Court later overturned the law in the case known as District of Columbia v. Heller.) Most American news organizations tend to leave the Oxford comma out while allowing for exceptions to avoid confusion, like in the sentence: “I’d like to thank my parents, Mother Teresa and the pope. ” Reporters, editors and producers at The New York Times usually omit the comma, but Phil Corbett, who oversees language issues for the newsroom, wrote in a 2015 blog post that exceptions are sometimes made: The Associated Press, considered the authority for most American newsrooms, also generally comes out against the Oxford comma. But the comma is common in book and academic publishing. The Chicago Manual of Style uses it, as does Oxford University Press style. “The last comma can serve to resolve ambiguity,” it says. A 2014 survey of 1, 129 Americans by FiveThirtyEight and SurveyMonkey Audience found 57 percent in favor of the comma and 43 percent opposed. Mr. Webbert, who said working on the case recalled his boyhood grammar and Latin lessons, scoffed at the idea that he was representing all those in favor of the Oxford comma. He was only representing the truck drivers, he said. The drivers, who earned between $46, 800 and $52, 000 per year without overtime, worked an average of 12 extra hours a week, Mr. Webbert said. Though three drivers filed the   lawsuit in 2014, about 75 will share the money. Oakhurst, a longtime family business that was acquired by Dairy Farmers of America in 2014, employs about 200 people and has annual sales of $110 million, selling dairy products throughout New England, according to its website. Its president, John H. Bennett, said in an interview on Thursday that “our management team values our employees and we take employee compensation seriously. ” “We believe we’re in compliance with state and federal wage laws, and we’ll continue to defend ourselves in this matter,” he said. Mr. Webbert declined to take a personal position on the broader debate of using the Oxford comma. But he sounded like a lot of English teachers and writing coaches who offered an alternative suggestion: If there’s any doubt, tear up what you wrote and start over. “In this situation, it did create an ambiguity, which means you have to either add a comma or rewrite the sentence,” he said.",0
855,European Parliament Committee Considering Legal Rights for Robots - Breitbart,"The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs has voted favorably on a draft report which proposes giving legal personage to robots. [With seventeen votes against two, along with two abstentions, the committee agreed that “the most sophisticated autonomous robots could be established as having the status of electronic persons with specific rights and obligations, including that of making good any damage they may cause. ”  The   report asserts that humanity stands “on the threshold of an era” in which artificial intelligence could be responsible for a “new industrial revolution. ” It includes obligations that robots would be held to as well, which seem based on Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, introduced by the author in a 1942 short story. His visionary fiction is now on the road to becoming a legal reality. Luxembourg MEP Mady Delvaux has further proposed a “kill switch,” a mechanism by which humans could deactivate any artificially intelligent entity that operates outside of the laws established. Different levels of accountability would be assigned robots based on their level of sophistication, with increased levels of personal responsibility commensurate with the complexity of the synthetic being in question. Despite offering a semblance of humane treatment to robots, the draft report also proposes very stringent boundaries on their design. It clearly draws a line in the sand, where “a robot is not a human and will never be human. A robot can show empathy but it cannot feel empathy. ” Furthermore, it declares that no robot should ever appear to be “emotionally dependent. ” Robots should never be allowed to seem overtly human, or “that he loves you or he is sad. ” Delvaux addressed the need to solve the complicated problems arising from daily interaction with complex AI in a brief interview. Among those issues are things as obvious as safety and privacy, but as nuanced as “informed consent. ” The rise of artificial life will very likely be humanity’s first interaction with intelligent   entities. Despite being of our own creation, there is a distinct possibility that they could outstrip us both mentally and physically. It’s heartening to see such concepts addressed with the gravity they’re owed, even if such rules are somehow never necessary. The draft report and its revolutionary proposals are now on their way to the house, which will vote on it in February.

856,"Rex Tillerson, an Aggressive Dealmaker Whose Ties With Russia May Prompt Scrutiny - The New York Times","HOUSTON  —   Twenty years ago, as Rex W. Tillerson was rising through the ranks at Exxon, he was charged with negotiating with the government of Yemen to build a natural gas export plant. The talks got bogged down over Yemen’s insistence that it have veto power over important business decisions. Mr. Tillerson, at one point, flew into a rage, throwing a    book across the room and storming out, perhaps for dramatic effect. Yemeni negotiators and other representatives of other oil companies partnering with Exxon in the international consortium looked on in bewilderment. In the end, Yemen got at least some of its demands. But that kind of   determination to bend others’ wills could be exactly what   Donald J. Trump is looking for in a secretary of state. It is also the kind of unconventionality that could open up Mr. Tillerson to closer scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings, particularly when it comes to his close relations with Russia. “He’s much more than a business executive,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Tillerson in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, without confirming that Mr. Tillerson would be the ultimate choice. “He’s a   player. ” To make a fresh start with Russia, as Mr. Trump promised during the campaign, there may not be a better envoy than Mr. Tillerson, 64, who has made a career at Exxon  —   and Exxon Mobil since the 1999 merger  —   by drilling more fossil fuels out of Russian soil and has even been decorated for his friendship with the country. The United States and Russia are quarreling these days in ways rarely seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Ukraine and Syria are just two of several hot spots where the countries have clashing interests, and United States intelligence has concluded that Russia covertly tried to undercut the very essence of American democracy by hacking computers and selectively leaking information to hurt Hillary Clinton and promote Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Tillerson’s clever maneuvering in Russia at a time of growing tensions with the West was amply shown in 2014, shortly after the United States and its allies applied sanctions on Russia for meddling in Ukraine. President Obama asked American business leaders not to attend a major business forum in Russia that May, and Mr. Tillerson obeyed the president’s wishes. But Mr. Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chief executive, still found a way to get a seat at the table. He sent his company’s top exploration official in his place. The official, Neil W. Duffin, signed an agreement to promote more business with   Rosneft to expand joint drilling in the Arctic Ocean, develop shale fields with new technologies and cooperate on a gas export plant in Siberia. Tougher sanctions eventually froze the growth of Exxon’s activities in Russia, but Mr. Tillerson had once again proved his commitment to doing business with the country’s president, Vladimir V. Putin. “Tillerson will be a credible and effective messenger for a U. S. reset because he is not a member of the foreign policy establishment but also because his history embodies the investment potential Russia could enjoy with a better relationship with the United States,” said David L. Goldwyn, who was the State Department’s top energy diplomat during the first Obama administration. Of Mr. Trump, Mr. Goldwyn said: “He has definitely decided to do a reverse Nixon and side with Russia against China. He thinks we probably can make common cause with Russia in Syria but also in Libya, and he doesn’t have a problem supporting strongmen. ” Russia may be Mr. Tillerson’s strength, but it could also ultimately be his Achilles’ heel. The Russian government gave him the country’s Order of Friendship decoration in 2012, an award that could now well be an embarrassment. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter on Sunday, “Being a ‘friend of Vladimir’ is not an attribute I am hoping for from a Secretary of State. ” Mr. Tillerson has opposed sanctions on Russia, which are the single greatest obstacle to foreign investment in that country. Russia has two enormous areas for new oil development, in the Barents Sea and the Bazhenov shale field in western Siberia, that are essentially closed to development because of a lack of foreign capital and expertise. Exxon was poised to invest in both areas before the sanctions. Exxon operates in about 50 foreign countries, and Mr. Tillerson has relationships far and wide. Energy experts say he is particularly well versed in the affairs of Angola, Argentina, Canada, Mexico, Nigeria and Qatar. “My impression is he is a   corporate diplomat,” said Chase Untermeyer, who was United States ambassador to Qatar in the George W. Bush administration. “In my day in Qatar, he would come and go for meetings with the most senior leadership of the country. ” But environmentalists and human rights groups have already reacted to the likely appointment with alarm, saying Mr. Tillerson would send the wrong message on the United States’ commitment to curbing climate change because he has spent his entire professional career at a    company. Also likely to come up at confirmation hearings would be Mr. Tillerson’s potential interest in seeing Exxon succeed in Russia and elsewhere in the future. According to company filings this year, Mr. Tillerson owned $218 million in company stock, and his pension plan was worth nearly $70 million. Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, an antipoverty organization, said his group questioned how Mr. Tillerson would “balance the pressure to transact   deals against his larger responsibility to strengthen the rules and institutions that protect economic hope and fundamental human rights for so many on the planet. ” Mr. Offenheiser added, “Under Tillerson’s leadership, Exxon has continued to work to undermine climate science. ” Mr. Tillerson is not always easy to define. Deeply conservative and committed to the Boy Scouts of America, he quietly pushed the organization to be open to gay rights. But under his leadership, Exxon was slow to adopt explicit policies protecting gay employees from discrimination. Although reputed to be a decisive leader with a long view, he appeared slow to grasp the full potential of the United States’ shale gas revolution. Exxon executives, speaking confidentially because they were not authorized to discuss the potential nomination, argued that Mr. Tillerson had pushed for more research on advanced biofuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse emissions. Mr. Tillerson has also moved the company toward acknowledging climate change as a serious problem, although he has strongly defended the company amid investigations by several state attorneys general into allegations that the company took public positions skeptical of climate change when its own scientists were warning of the risks of burning fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Mr. Tillerson’s opposition to sanctions for Russia made sense given Exxon’s interests there, supporters say. Exxon has been active in Russia for decades, and it has various joint ventures with Rosneft inside and outside Russia. Western sanctions against Russia have hurt the company, costing it as much as a billion dollars by some estimates. The company is unable to collect revenue from an investment in an oil and gas consortium that operates off Sakhalin Island or develop other unconventional projects, like Arctic offshore and shale drilling. Mr. Tillerson’s strong suit could be his knack for getting his way in negotiations. He can be expected to encourage the permitting of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would deliver more oil from the Canadian oil sands to American refineries. Having just successfully bid for a deepwater drilling block off the coast of Mexico, and understanding the importance of Mexico as a growing natural gas export market, he can also be expected to try to smooth relations with Mexico City. Some energy experts say Mr. Tillerson could encourage Mr. Trump to support the international climate accord negotiated in Paris last December, but with added emphasis on the benefits of natural gas and ways to bury carbon waste. Mr. Tillerson, said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate change adviser in the Clinton administration, “might bring Trump equal measures of new pressure and political cover to engage on international climate change issues. ”",0

860,Russian scientists will track sea lions from space,"Russian scientists will track sea lions from space 28 October 2016 TASS The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses. Facebook science , research , russia 
Researchers at the Kamchatka branch of the Pacific Institute of Geography of Russia’s Science Academy’s Far East Department now have the opportunity to monitor Steller sea lions that are on Russia’s Red List of Threatened Species, from space, the Komandorsky Nature Reserve’s Spokesman Alexei Veledinsky told TASS on Friday. The researchers succeeded in installing five GPS tags on two full-grown sea lionesses and three cubs on the national park’s territory. 
""It was not an easy task as these animals are very timid. They had to be knocked out using tranquillizers so that they could be tagged,"" Veledinsky said. 
However, right after the animals woke up, scientists started receiving the data on their movement. In one case, a few days after being tagged, a sea lionesses and her cub travelled several hundred kilometers from the Commander Islands through the Pacific Ocean to Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula. All of the sea lions’ movements are depicted on a map via a computer program. 
""Researchers will be able to follow the sea lions for approximately one year. The tags placed on the animals’ heads will fall off when they begin to shed their fur. That said, the tags are glued to their fur with a specific paste,"" Veledinsky explained. 
One of the main goals of this research is to garner scientific data on the winter habitats of the sea lions populating the Commander Islands as their number has been falling. In the 1960s and 1970s up to 12,000 sea lions used to spend the winter on the islands, while in summer there were 2,000 to 5,000 animals there. Now there are no more than 600 sea lions. The new data will enable the creation of more safe conditions in the sea lions’ rookeries. There are four rookeries where sea lionesses bear cubs on the Commander Islands, which is encompassed by the national park. Besides that, there are also three rookeries where cubs are not born. 
The Komandorsky Nature Reserve, founded in 1993, is the largest marine sanctuary in Russia with a territory of more than 3 mln hectares.

861,"By Seizing the Definition of ‘Populism,’ Reuters Warns Us of Chaos to Come","By Seizing the Definition of ‘Populism,’ Reuters Warns Us of Chaos to Come By Daily Bell Staff - November 10, 2016 
After Trump & Brexit, populist tsunami threatens European mainstream … Back in May, when Donald’s Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election seemed the remotest of possibilities, a senior European official took to Twitter before a G7 summit in Tokyo to warn of a “horror scenario”. Imagine, mused the official, if instead of Barack Obama, Francois Hollande, David Cameron and Matteo Renzi, next year’s meeting of the club of rich nations included Trump, Marine Le Pen, Boris Johnson and Beppe Grillo. -Reuters 
Back in June, we identified what has become an overarching elite meme: “populism versus globalism.” 
We’ve never fully defined populism, and this Reuters article gives us an opportunity to examine the word and the context in which it is being used. 
With Trump’s triumph over his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, the populist tsunami that seemed outlandish a few months ago is becoming reality, and the consequences for Europe’s own political landscape are potentially huge. 
In 2017, voters in the Netherlands, France and Germany – and possibly in Italy and Britain too – will vote in elections that could be colored by the triumphs of Trump and Brexit, and the toxic politics that drove those campaigns. 
The lessons will not be lost on continental Europe’s populist parties, who hailed Trump’s victory on Wednesday as a body blow for the political mainstream. “Politics will never be the same,” said Geert Wilders of the far-right Dutch Freedom Party. “What happened in America can happen in Europe and the Netherlands as well.” 
We can see from these excerpts that “populism” is not seen by Reuters as positive description. In fact, the synonym in the above excerpt is “toxic.” 
“Populism” is contrasted to the “political mainstream” as well. This informs us that populism is irregular, even aberrant. We are living through unusual times and populism is the result. 
Watching the “populism versus globalism” meme advance is fascinating because it is such a significant positioning of propaganda. 
We can see clearly that in many ways mainstream media around the world is not at all hesitant to reveal the basic organizational structure behind it. 
There is no way that populism – and, contrastingly, globalism – would appear ubiquitously in so many arenas without considerable unity among supposedly disparate media. 
In other words, the organization behind this is formidable. It’s not just this one example either that provokes our observations. The powers-that-be were not shy about illustrating the essential linkages between publications during Trump’s election. 
The mainstream sounded as one when it came to Trump. And top-down control was obviously evident, and commented on as well. 
The emergence of “populism versus globalism” doesn’t just provide us with evidence of editorial control. Even more importantly it shows us how those who secretly run our societies find this sort of meme-making to be a priority because it anticipates trends and reinterprets them. 
By beginning to disseminate the meme in the summer, elite media shapers were able to position fall’s narrative – Trump’s win in particular – within the larger context they’d already defined. 
We would suggest that the wave of “populism” sweeping over the US and Europe is at heart a resurgence of a yearning for freedom that is obviously slipping away – not that there was much of it to begin with. 
But the Internet has raised people’s consciousness about what they are losing, and why. As a result, more than ever, people are coming to understand the globalist narrative and are registering their disgust. 
But this is NOT going to be how the mainstream media interprets what is going on. We can already see that people’s determination to shake off political, monetary and military control is going to be interpreted as essentially greedy and selfish. 
We could see this interpretation emerge within the context of Trump’s increasing appeal. Over and over we were told that his support was “rural” and “white” – and that these individuals were flocking to Trump because they were feeling “left out” of the current prosperity and thus resentful. 
Of course, one can interpret this trend much differently. Our perspective is that globalism is at fault here. Initiated and expanded by a tiny group of banking interests, globalism seeks to consolidate worldwide power with a tiny group of massive corporations, governments and technocratic leaders. 
No wonder why so many people in the West feel left out. This vision provides them no room to grow or prosper. In fact they are not – but their emotion at what’s occurring is perfectly reasonable and logical. We wouldn’t characterize it as resentment so much as rightful anger and frustration. 
But Reuters and the other mainstream media have gotten here first and are busily redefining what’s taking place. 
We’ve pointed out that the mainstream may be actively enhancing the meme now that they have gotten control of it. 
The idea is to marry this emergent propaganda with “directed history” and create a series of economic and political disasters that can be directly (if illegitimately) linked to “populism.” 
As populism is denigrated, globalism, in our view, will be uplifted. We’ll be subject to considerable contrasts between “toxic” populism and erudite – “mainstream” – globalism. 
We’ve already indicated that we believe this meme is a cultivated one. We don’t believe that the sudden emergence of populism throughout the West is simply coincidental or even evolutionary. 
We think this meme is being deliberately cultivated and that it is part of a larger Hegelian dialectic that is intended to reinforce globalism in the long-term. You can see some additional speculation here. 
Here at DB we analyze elite memes, their significance and impact. It’s clear to us that the mainstream media is “out front” when it comes to defining “populism” and that there are forces urging it on. 
The conclusion of the meme will probably involve a series of catastrophes that will further cultivate and expand globalism. It’s happened before, especially after the 20 th century’s world wars. There is no real reason to think the playbook has been significantly adjusted. 
Conclusion: This meme is not only of the utmost importance, it is clearly warning us of considerable distress to come.",0
862,Seaworthy and Ready for an Early Unveiling - The New York Times,"ABOARD WAVERTREE IN KILL VAN KULL  —   In the 131 years since the   cargo ship Wavertree was built, it has been tossed and tattered  —   its main mast ripped away in a hurricane, and its role demoted to sand barge. So when the vessel sailed from the South Street Seaport to Staten Island last year for a    restoration, the crew feared that the extensive damage would draw out repairs and delay the ship’s return to its Manhattan berth. They should have known better. Wavertree, which has endured no shortage of natural and economic calamity, turned out to be more resilient than anyone anticipated. In September, after more than a year away, it is set to return to the South Street Seaport Museum, mended, gleaming and ready to remind visitors of the ships that define New York City’s history. The   $13 million   undertaking has progressed ahead of schedule, hastening the goal of once again sailing Wavertree through New York Harbor. “We were pleasantly surprised,” Jonathan Boulware, the executive director of the seaport museum, said. “It’s a real testament to the era’s wrought iron. ” When it was commissioned in Southampton, England, by R. W. Leyland  Company of Liverpool, Wavertree was among the last   sailing ships fashioned from wrought iron and it remains the largest afloat, according to the museum. Last May, workers brought it by tugboat to the Caddell Dry Dock and Repair Company in the Richmond Terrace section of Staten Island and expected to replace 10 large metal plates on the hull. Instead, the 4     slabs of iron, which sit below the water line, needed only minor repairs. Wavertree has nonetheless required an ambitious overhaul, carried out by a crew of up to three dozen. The ship spent five months in dry dock, where workers scrubbed away barnacles, seaweed and other gunk before adding layers of protective paint to its underside. The team has also been replacing three decks. The wood that once covered the main deck has been exchanged for steel to keep out water. The poop deck is being repaired traditionally, using wooden planks caulked with cotton and oakum then sealed with pitch. And Wavertree once again has its ’tween deck, a modest level between the main deck and the cargo hold that had been absent for decades. The most daunting task, workers said, has been the renovation of the ship’s three   masts and their rigging. For that, Caddell built a pair of    sheds outfitted with both   and highly modern tools. Inside one, the crew is building 16 spars from laminated timber. The other has held more than three miles of wire, which was stripped of its old protective coating and wrapped in a new layer of   pine and leather. Though the crew did not expect to fully rig the ship by September, time and money saved on the hull plates accelerated the schedule. “I marvel at how effectively and efficiently we’ve been able to conduct the restoration,” Mr. Boulware said. Although its immense iron frame and masts give Wavertree a distinguished profile today, it was a relatively common model when it was built by Oswald Mordaunt  Company in 1885. A plaque identifies the   Wavertree as the company’s hull No. 231. Mr. Boulware noted that stringers, which fortify the hull, on the ship’s port side dip below those on its starboard  —   one of several imperfections in the construction. The cramped quarters once held bunk beds stacked tightly to accommodate a crew of 35 men in the ship’s heyday. Over the years, Wavertree circumnavigated the globe nearly 30 times, ferrying sundry cargo  —   coal, kerosene, jute, cotton, tea, coffee, molasses, timber. On Jan. 14, 1895, it called on the Port of New York, bearing a load of nitrate from Chile. In 1910, a violent storm off Cape Horn splintered Wavertree’s masts, ending its   days. Its owners sold the ship to Chilean businessmen, who used it as a warehouse for 30 years. It transferred hands again in 1947, beginning a career as a sand barge in Buenos Aires. Wavertree was acquired by the museum in 1968. The ship’s homecoming was made possible in part by the impending departure of Peking, another   sailing ship, which has graced the seaport since 1974. Peking, too, has been battered  —   by war, by waves and by weather. It suffered through plummeting tourism in Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Faced with mounting financial difficulties, the museum considered dispensing with the   barque, which was built in Hamburg, Germany, in 1911. However, salvation came from the German government, which is spending 30 million euros (about $33 million) to bring Peking home, carried across the Atlantic Ocean on the back of a   ship. “I’ll be sad to see her go, but it’s what’s best for everyone,” Mr. Boulware, said. “It’s about resource allocation. ” Funding for Wavertree’s restoration has come from the City Council, the office of the Manhattan borough president and the city’s Cultural Affairs Department. “Wavertree is an incredible object with a direct connection to the site that really gives the area an authentic sense of its past,” Tom Finkelpearl, the department’s commissioner, said. The Wavertree project was also helped by a $4. 8 million grant given to the museum in March by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. The money will go toward improving safety and accessibility at the museum, and adding an    education center, Mr. Boulware said. “The port is what built the city and what continues to build it today,” Mr. Boulware said, showing off the museum’s first new exhibition since 2012, “Street of Ships: The Port and Its People. ” It plumbed the museum’s collections to tell the history of the Port of New York, once the fulcrum of world shipping. That exhibition will be complete, Mr. Boulware said, when Wavertree assumes its place again in the museum’s marina.",0
863,Donald Trump Adds K.T. McFarland to His National Security Team - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump filled two   but influential White House staff jobs on Friday, while his   candidate for secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, continued to deliberate about whether to join the administration. Mr. Trump offered the housing job  this week to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who challenged him for the Republican presidential nomination. But despite expectations of a Friday announcement, Mr. Carson was “still pondering,” said a friend, Armstrong Williams. The  ’s aides said Mr. Trump did not plan any more   announcements until next week. For the politically sensitive post of White House counsel, Mr. Trump chose Donald F. McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws. The counsel’s job may be even more daunting than it was in previous administrations, given Mr. Trump’s   business empire, with which he shows no inclination toward severing ties. For the equally critical job of deputy national security adviser, Mr. Trump chose K. T. McFarland, an aide in three Republican White Houses and a Fox News commentator. She has been highly critical of President Obama’s approach to combating terrorism  —   a view that aligns her with Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn. In rolling out the appointments, the Trump transition team lined up testimonials from big names in both parties. Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, regarded as a foreign policy hawk, praised Ms. McFarland, 65, as “one of our country’s most experienced, informed and wise foreign policy and national security experts. ” Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat turned independent, was a Yale College and law school classmate of Ms. McFarland’s husband, Alan R. McFarland, a   investment banker. Edwin Meese III, an attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, said Mr. McGahn, who was the general counsel for the Trump campaign, had “dealt ably with the intersection between politics, government ethics and the rule of law. ” C. Boyden Gray, a White House counsel to the elder President George Bush, said Mr. McGahn was well suited to the job because of his “serious prior relationship with the president” and his “working knowledge of government ethics and election law. ” A brash,   conservative born in Atlantic City, Mr. McGahn learned the fine points of election law from a longtime Republican expert in the field, Benjamin L. Ginsberg. At the Federal Election Commission, where he served five years, including terms as chairman and vice chairman, Mr. McGahn was a powerful voice of opposition to what he often saw as intrusive government meddling in elections. He also spent nearly a decade as the general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ms. McFarland’s national security experience dates to the Nixon administration, when she was an aide to Henry A. Kissinger. She was a staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, a speechwriter for Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, and the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs. She is a familiar presence on Fox News, where she has harshly criticized Mr. Obama over his handling of the Islamic State. “The president has stuck his head in the sand,” she said in September 2014 after the group had kidnapped and executed two American journalists. “To me, it’s a dereliction of duty,” she added. “What was this president doing? Well, he was playing a lot of golf this summer, but he clearly was not attending to the defense of the United States. ” In 2006, Ms. McFarland mounted a bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate in New York. The mayor of Yonkers, John Spencer, defeated her and went on to lose to the Democratic incumbent, Hillary Clinton. During the campaign, Ms. McFarland came under scrutiny for gilding her résumé  —   claiming, for example, that she had been the   woman in the Pentagon when, in fact, two other women outranked her. The deputy national security adviser has one of the most demanding jobs in the West Wing, coordinating meetings of deputies and principals to formulate policies and organizing the vast flow of paperwork from the agencies to the White House. “That job is the ultimate policy    and   job,” said Peter D. Feaver, who served in the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. “It is all about reviewing policies, framing disagreements and teeing up decisions. It is supposed to be the place where bad ideas die, and so places a premium on analytical insight. ” “Her early work in the Reagan administration is more important than her recent work on TV,” he said of Ms. McFarland. As Mr. Trumps fills key staff positions, some of his cabinet decisions have become complicated. The search for a secretary of state has bogged down as rival factions argue for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a Trump loyalist, and Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, who stridently opposed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Among those raising questions about Mr. Giuliani is Vice   Mike Pence, according to people in the Trump transition who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. Mr. Pence, they said, has favored Mr. Romney in internal discussions. Reince Priebus, whom Mr. Trump named as chief of staff, has said positive things about Mr. Romney but has been more circumspect, and has tried to offer perspective to Mr. Trump on both men. But other people, including Kellyanne Conway, who managed the campaign, have raised questions about Mr. Romney’s loyalty after he became one of the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Mr. Trump has remarked to people that he was surprised by the intense resistance to Mr. Romney. Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump spoke again in recent days, according to people briefed on the deliberations, and plan to speak again early next week. But some of Mr. Romney’s allies, who have no interest in seeing him apologize for criticizing Mr. Trump during the campaign, say privately that his chances of being chosen are dimming. With Mr. Carson, the delay appears to be less about fissures within the Trump camp than within Mr. Carson himself. “He’s still pondering, believe it or not,” Mr. Williams, his friend, said on Friday. “Dr. Carson is very methodical, just like he’s going through a surgery, planning every aspect. ” Mr. Carson endorsed Mr. Trump after ending his own campaign. But he has appeared conflicted about joining the administration. Last week, Mr. Williams was quoted as saying his friend was reluctant to take a job for which he had no experience and that “could cripple the presidency. ” Mr. Carson, however, then took to Facebook, where he has built much of his   political following, to say his reasons for declining a cabinet job had been misreported. He was on Facebook again on Wednesday, explaining his change of heart. “After serious discussions with the Trump transition team,” Mr. Carson wrote, “I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone. ”",0
864,Snowstorm Brings Wintry Mix of Slush and Gripes - The New York Times,"As the snow falls, Times reporters hit neighborhoods and airports from Washington to Boston. Here are some of the stories they found. Snow may have been in the forecast for the Jersey Shore on Tuesday morning but something else ended up coming down in buckets: sarcasm. “What storm?” said Billy Pisano, a painter, who said he “fought the lines for bread and milk” Monday night and canceled his Tuesday job only to wake up to no snow. “I guess I’m going to stay home in the rain,” he said. “I think it’s going to be a Netflix day. ” At a Wawa convenience store in Neptune, people stopped for coffee, cigarettes and griping. George Martin, 50, had strapped a snowplow to his sport utility vehicle and planned to spend the day using it to scrape up a few dollars. He expected seven inches. His spirits sank when he woke up extra early and looked outside. “Like, oh man, come on, they did it again,” he said. “It’s like having a firecracker and you throw it and it’s a dud. ” He added, “There’s nothing to plow. You can’t charge people for something that’s not there. ” Al Clark, 38, and Stephen Vierschilling, 26,   at a shop that paints fire engines, shared jokes about weather forecasters. “The last few storms they said it was going to be Armageddon and it wasn’t,” Mr. Clark said. Soo Becchina, a   special education teacher from Oceanside on Long Island, tutors students after school four days a week. Because of the storm, she had to cancel sessions with her students. The missed day means missed wages. “Tutoring is a side business for me,” Ms. Becchina said. “But, more important it always upsets me when I cannot give my kids what they need. One of the girls I see is having a math test tomorrow. I am hoping that the teacher doesn’t give the test but, I know this teacher and she normally doesn’t move test dates. ” Despite losing the day and the money, Ms. Becchina still plans on doing a phone session with her student later in the day, at no charge.  —   NATE SCHWEBER and RUTH BASHINSKY Cancellation notices covered the international flight board at Terminal 4 at Kennedy Airport in Queens on Tuesday morning. But one flight, from Guangzhou, China, had landed shortly before 5 a. m. David Dubois, an engineer and   aviation enthusiast from Hudson, N. H. was among the passengers. He said he was impressed with the plane’s landing, despite the snowy conditions. “The pilot really had a difficult time and pulled it off really well,” Mr. Dubois said. “There was no tarmac it was all snow. When he landed, you could just feel it starting to go sideways. He pulled it straight  —   no bounce, no nothing. I couldn’t believe it. ” But Mr. Dubois still had to get to New England. Kamari Simon, 18, was in a similar bind in Terminal 5. Mr. Simon, a D. J. said he was scheduled to perform with a    rapper named Smooky Margiela at the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. “I hope everything goes through and I’ll be down in Austin,” said Mr. Simon, who studies music at Five Towns College in Dix Hills, on Long Island. “It’s an opportunity for me to meet other artists and network. ”  —   SEAN PICCOLI Tuesday’s storm shuttered schools along the Eastern Seaboard, keeping students out of the classroom. But, even though school was closed, elementary students in Petersham, Mass. a town of 1, 200 in the central part of the state, did not exactly have a snow day. Instead, they had homework  —   books, activities, worksheets and even a science experiment  —   intended to allow them to make up the day of school without being there, and, thus, to prevent the school from having to add a day at the end of the year. The idea emerged after the winter of 2015, when the district had 10 snow days. Tari Thomas, the superintendent of schools for a consolidated school district that includes Petersham, said the district experimented with sending older students home with online coursework to complete on laptops (although that was not the case on Tuesday, because the students had already used up the five days of online learning they were allowed for the year). “There have been a small pocket of parents that have said, ‘Why can’t kids be kids and have a snow day? ’” said Ms. Thomas. But, Ms. Thomas added, “We’ve had parents say, ‘Oh my gosh, thank goodness you gave them something to do. ’” In Central Park in Manhattan, it was a different story. It was a true snow day with schools canceled. Aliana Lambert, 6, dragged her purple sled to a   hill. There was no written rule banning girls from the hill at 100th Street and Central Park West, but at 2 p. m. Aliana was the only girl standing. Kat Vlasica, Aliana’s mother, said they came to their neighborhood hill for every snowstorm. “When you’re in New York with 800 square feet, you have to take advantage of a hill like this,” she said. “This is our hill, and we don’t even have to salt or scrape it. ”  —   JESS BIDGOOD and EMILY PALMER Navigating New York City streets was a challenge, what with snow and sleet and gusting wind and patches of ice. Drivers on Staten Island confronted another obstacle: a pair of runaway ponies. Terence Monahan, the chief of patrol, said the two ponies escaped from a stable. An   police officer driving his truck saw them walking down Hylan Boulevard on the South Shore. The officer stopped and grabbed a tow strap from inside his truck. “He grabbed them, tied them to a lamp post. We got a radio car there and we were able to return them back to the stables,” he said. “They’re safe, they’re in great shape. ” The mayor, for his part, thanked the “cowboy officer. ”  —   ASHLEY SOUTHALL WASHINGTON  —   Washington is finally getting the snow day it thought this winter had forgotten  —   well, kind of. Never mind that only an inch or two of snow, sleet and freezing rain fell across the city and nearby swaths of Virginia and Maryland overnight. Or that public transportation and the federal government, the region’s largest employer, were open for business. As layers of snow and sleet buried crocuses and wilted Washington’s early cherry blossoms, the roads were unplowed and mostly empty at dawn on Tuesday. Business owners who decided to open anyway shoveled front walks only to see them recoated in slippery slush. Even lawmakers in the House of Representatives, who are racing to move major health care legislation forward this week, elected to give themselves something of a snow day on Tuesday. Citing the rash of canceled flights across the country, they postponed all votes until Wednesday. Inside the Oval Office, President Trump hosted Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s deputy crown prince, for lunch and a  . Outside, the daily steady shuffle of tourists posed for pictures. David and Michelle Wilding of Dallas were among them, accompanied by their daughters, Hope and Grace. They had imagined something of a greener spring getaway. So snow? “It’s wonderful,” Mr. Wilding said, especially after a winter at home that did not send its usual dose.  —   NICHOLAS FANDOS The snowstorm threw a wrench into Town Meeting Day, a   pillar of the local democratic process in New Hampshire. With the jury out on what, exactly, elections officials were allowed to do, some town moderators postponed the    votes that make up the backbone of governance here. Others let them go ahead, and voters navigated wind and snow to make it to the polls. “We had to instruct our voter clerks to tell the voters, please don’t drip on the ballots,” said Wayne Colby, the town moderator in Henniker, N. H. west of Concord. “I grew up in New Hampshire,” Mr. Colby said, adding, “We don’t have snow days for elections. ” The town meeting, where voters hash out the budget or other issues related to fire and police departments, is older than the state itself. It is also a day of voting for local offices, ordinance changes or bonds. When it became clear that the day would collide with a major winter storm, some town moderators wondered if they could postpone their votes and meetings. The answer from the governor? It’s not clear, but please don’t. “Given that there are differing opinions, the best we can do is strongly recommend that all towns stay open for voting tomorrow,” said Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican. The issue has become the latest disruption in a state that is reeling over accusations of widespread voter fraud by President Trump, and comes on the heels of a number of proposals by Republicans to tighten voting rules.  —   JESS BIDGOOD",0
865,"Republicans, Wilders, Tillerson: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump has produced an “America First” fiscal plan that is not even earning much praise from his own allies in Congress. His $1. 1 trillion spending plan does not reduce the deficit. It sharply increases military spending while cutting the budgets of federal agencies and programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. It is a gamble for a politician whose supporters include   workers who rely on many of the programs he proposes to reduce, including grants that feed hungry children and help local law enforcement. “This will be a heavy lift for the House, and for the Senate, a lot of this will be nonstarters,” said former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who chaired the Budget Committee. Here are the winners and losers in the budget, broken down by agency. _____ 2. House Republicans took another step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act. After the Budget Committee approved the new health care bill over the objections of three Republicans, it goes now to the full House. Party leaders acknowledge that they don’t have the votes yet to ensure it will pass. To appease conservatives, the White House is looking at accelerating cuts to Medicaid. Above, Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director. _____ 3. Who undercut Mr. Trump’s travel ban? You might say Mr. Trump himself did  —   as a candidate. The two federal judges who blocked his revamped travel ban cited his own campaign rhetoric as evidence of his unconstitutional aim of barring Muslims from entering the country. The White House says it will appeal the rulings. We took a look at the long and extensive visa process to enter the U. S. It can take months, or even a year, and often ends in denial. And we tagged along on a trip to the airport, as one family caught up in the travel ban was reunited. _____ 4. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson began his first major foreign trip in Japan, warning that the United States needs a “different approach” to North Korea’s escalating nuclear threat. He faced questions (from preselected reporters) about the 29 percent cuts to the State Department in Mr. Trump’s budget plan. He called current spending “simply not sustainable” and said that the department could “do a lot with fewer dollars. ” He heads to South Korea and China next. _____ 5. European leaders cheered the record turnout  —   and results  —   in the Dutch elections on Wednesday. Voters denied Geert Wilders’s   party a victory in an election that was seen as a barometer of the far right’s appeal on the Continent. The   party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte won the most votes, offering a milder version of Mr. Wilders’s   platform, and remains the largest bloc in Parliament. “The Netherlands, after Brexit, after the American elections, said ‘Whoa’ to the wrong kind of populism,” Mr. Rutte said in his victory speech. _____ 6. Federal and state prosecutors closed their yearlong investigation into the   practices of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City. While they faulted the mayor and his aides, saying he had failed to abide by the “intent and spirit” of the law, they said they would not press charges. _____  7. While scolding Mr. Trump, the Mexican government is quietly trying to gut basic legal protections for its citizens at home. Experts fear a bill submitted by a close ally of President Enrique Peña Nieto to overhaul the legal system would set human rights in Mexico back decades, while another bill would legalize the military’s domestic security role. _____ 8. Ivanka Trump and Nikki Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, were among the 600 guests that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada took to a new Broadway musical. Mr. Trudeau sent a clear message with his choice of show  —   “Come From Away,” which is about a Canadian town that hosted thousands of air travelers from around the world when North American airspace was closed after Sept. 11. The musical celebrates generosity toward foreigners in need. Mr. Trudeau, whose policy of welcoming refugees has been at odds with the harsher stance of the Trump administration, was greeted with a standing ovation. _____ 9. The first games in the N. C. A. A. men’s basketball tournament were tight. Here’s the full March Madness schedule, plus how to watch. South Carolina is allowed to host for the first time in 15 years, after it took down the Confederate flag from the State Capitol. Now it’s North Carolina that is banned, because of a law that curbs   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. _____ 10. Finally, some updates from  .   comedians were unimpressed with Rachel Maddow’s Trump tax return scoop. “Is this news or a reality show?” asked Stephen Colbert. “I don’t want to watch ‘America’s Got 1040s. ’” Netflix is adding more foreign programming. Our critic likes “Fauda” from Israel, above, and “Nobel” from Norway. If you haven’t bought a television in the last two years, it might be a good time to upgrade. Here’s a guide on what to look for.

866,Review: Bryan Cranston Shines as Lyndon Johnson in ‘All the Way’ - The New York Times,"Bryan Cranston brings his Tony   interpretation of President Lyndon B. Johnson to television on Saturday night in an adaptation of the Robert Schenkkan play “All the Way,” and it’s still quite a sight to behold, just as it was on Broadway in 2014. Nothing beats witnessing this kind of    portrayal onstage, of course. But the television version, presented by HBO, offers plenty of rewards, allowing Mr. Cranston to work the   and liberating him from the confines of a theater set. In his hands, this accidental president comes across as an amazing bundle of contradictions, someone who seems at once too vulgar for the job and just right for it. Mr. Schenkkan adapted his own play (which also won a Tony) for HBO, and he and the director, Jay Roach, have quickened the pace a bit. The slice of history, though, remains the same: Johnson’s pivotal first year in office, from his swearing in after John F. Kennedy’s assassination through his 1964 campaign for election to a full term. The first half of the film, its most compelling stretch, focuses on Johnson’s wheeling and dealing to get the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed. Other prominent figures of the era are manipulated by this master of political hardball: senators like Hubert H. Humphrey (Bradley Whitford) and Richard B. Russell Jr. (Frank Langella) J. Edgar Hoover (Stephen Root) the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (Anthony Mackie). Some, especially King and other black leaders, are quite good at manipulation themselves. Given all we hear about the current climate in Washington, “All the Way” is enough to make you misty for the days when   in the interest of securing significant achievements was what national politicians did. Not that the film gilds this era. We hear some of the actual arguments used to oppose civil rights legislation (sometimes via archival clips of George Wallace and others) and they’re mighty ugly. Is the verbiage today any different? The film invites us to make the comparison. Halfway through, Mr. Schenkkan turns his attention to the presidential campaign of 1964, with Johnson showing signs of paranoia about his Republican opponent, Barry Goldwater, and about the possibility of a challenge from Robert F. Kennedy. The details of the story grow a bit technical  —   a tussle over the seating of black delegates at the Democratic convention takes up a lot of time  —   but Mr. Cranston keeps it watchable with a performance that grows ever more fervent but never goes over the top. [See our NYT Watching picks for what else you should watch this weekend] The main obstacle in turning the play into TV fare is that “All the Way” has considerably more competition on television than in the theater. Muscular political drama is an entire genre on the small screen, whether it’s made up (“The West Wing” and all its thematic offspring) or based on historical events (“Game Change” and “Recount,” both of which Mr. Roach also directed for HBO). There’s a sameness to a lot of these offerings: the lurching from one crisis to the next the brusque, pithy exchanges that rarely last more than a few sentences the cursory attention to secondary characters. (Lady Bird Johnson, the first lady, played by Melissa Leo, is the most noticeable casualty in “All the Way. ”) Also sapping power from this film is that we’re only a few years removed from the orgy of   coverage of the watershed events of 1963 and ’64. With those caveats, “All the Way” is still solid historical drama, and Mr. Cranston’s performance is a gem.",0
867,Samsung Urges Consumers to Stop Using Galaxy Note 7s After Battery Fires - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   Samsung on Saturday urged consumers worldwide to stop using Galaxy Note 7 smartphones immediately and exchange them as soon as possible, as more reports of the phones catching fire emerged even after a global recall by the company. The call from the South Korean company, the world’s largest maker of smartphones, came after the United States authorities urged users to switch the Galaxy Note 7 off and not to use or charge it during flights. Several airlines around the world asked travelers not to switch on the smartphone or put it in checked baggage, and some carriers banned the phone on flights. In a statement posted on Saturday on its website, Samsung asked users around the world to “immediately” return their existing Galaxy Note 7 and get a replacement. “We are asking users to power down their Galaxy Note 7s and exchange them as soon as possible,” said Koh   the president of mobile communication for Samsung. “We are expediting replacement devices so that they can be provided through the exchange program as conveniently as possible. ” Consumers can visit Samsung’s service centers to receive rental phones for temporary use. Samsung plans to provide Galaxy Note 7 devices with new batteries in South Korea starting Sept. 19, but dates for other countries vary. This month, Samsung announced an unprecedented recall of 2. 5 million Galaxy Note 7s worldwide, just two weeks after the phone was released. That move came after Samsung’s investigation into reports of fires found that rechargeable lithium batteries manufactured by one of its suppliers were at fault. The United States was among the first countries to take action after the recall. Late on Friday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission urged people to turn the phones off and leave them off. It also said it was working with Samsung and hoped to  announce an official recall “as soon as possible. ” The recall by the safety commission will allow the United States Federal Aviation Administration to bar passengers from carrying the phones on planes. The F. A. A. warned airline passengers on Thursday not to turn on or charge the Galaxy Note 7 during flights and not to put the smartphone in their checked bags. Scandinavian Airlines said Saturday that it had prohibited passengers from using the Galaxy Note 7 on its flights because of concerns about fires. Singapore Airlines has also banned the use or charging of the device during flights. Samsung said it had confirmed 35 cases of the Galaxy Note 7 catching fire as of Sept. 1, most of which occurred while the battery was charging. There are at least two more cases that Samsung said it was aware of  —   one at a hotel in Perth, Australia, and another in St. Petersburg, Fla. where a family reported that a Galaxy Note 7 left charging in a Jeep had caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 on Aug. 19. The Galaxy Note series is one of the most expensive lines made by Samsung.",0

869,AG Lynch told FBI Director Comey NOT to go public with the new Clinton email investigation,"Posted by Daisy Luther 
According to a report in the New Yorker, James Comey , Big Kahuna of the FBI, went full-on cowboy in releasing details of the new Clinton email inquiry. Apparently, the Department of Justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election. 
Gosh. I wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was Donald Trump who was being investigated by the FBI. 
Comey explained his decision in a letter to FBI employees : 
“We don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.” 
The DoJ – and by DoJ I mean Attorney General Loretta Lynch , who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with Bill Clinton to talk about her non-existent grandchildren – is implying that Comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election. 
Here’s Comey’s letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee: 
Really? 
The DoJ thinks that the public shouldn’t know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the FBI? 
That’s the most absurd thing I have heard for quite some time, and considering this election, that’s really saying something. 
This is from the New Yorker report, emphasis mine. 
On Friday, James Comey, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting independently of Attorney General Loretta Lynch , sent a letter to Congress saying that the F.B.I. had discovered e-mails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server. Coming less than two weeks before the Presidential election, Comey’s decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about Clinton was contrary to the views of the Attorney General, according to a well-informed Administration official. Lynch expressed her preference that Comey follow the department’s longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations, and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election, but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise . 
Comey’s decision is a striking break with the policies of the Department of Justice, according to current and former federal legal officials. Comey, who is a Republican appointee of President Obama, has a reputation for integrity and independence, but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities, who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the Presidential and congressional elections. ( source ) Is this investigation the iceberg to HRC’s Titanic campaign? 
Hillary Clinton has said she finds the development “unprecedented and deeply troubling.” (source ) 
Oh, I’ll bet she does. 
I’ll bet if Trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage, gripping the podium to stay upright , saying how wonderful it was that Comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws. I’ll bet she’d be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation. I’ll bet she’d take the high road and say that those elected to the office of President of the United States have to be above and beyond reproach. 
Of course, when it’s her, things are a little different, aren’t they? 
We do have a right to know. We absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets. It seems like a no-brainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her. 
And the fact that we know has severely damaged Clinton’s campaign. Although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake , it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls. A poll from ABC news and the Washington Post , both hotbeds of liberal voters, has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over Donald Trump due to the Clinton email scandal. 
“About a third of likely voters say they’re less likely to support Clinton given FBI Director James Comey’s disclosure Friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state. “ 
Finally, some people are actually paying attention to the character of Hillary Clinton. 
But it may not be enough. There was one finding that was astonishing to me, even though it probably shouldn’t be: 
“Given other considerations, 63 percent say it makes no difference.” 
Meanwhile, on social media, the FBI emails are somehow not a trending topic. It certainly appears that Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and Buzzfeed are blacking out the topic. My biggest question is this: Why now? 
Why did James Comey, who has probably committed career suicide, along with a potential actual “suicide” via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the Clintons, feel the need to break the news, particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation? 
Opponents will jump on the fact that he’s a Republican and will say that he did it for political reasons. 
They won’t admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the Clinton email negligence. 
They will never, ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that, perhaps, when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong, he took it. Clinton isn’t taking it gracefully. 
Clinton’s complaints, which have appeared in the press around the world, make her look even worse than she did before. 
This is from The Telegraph , a UK publication: 
Hillary Clinton was furiously fighting to keep her Presidential bid on track on Saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed, after the FBI’s bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails. 
James Comey announced on Friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether Mrs Clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material. 
On Saturday, the latest poll of polls by tracker site RealClearPolitics put Clinton 3.9 percentage points ahead of the Republican nationwide, down from 7.1 points just 10 days previously. 
But wait – it gets better: 
The Clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against Mr Comey, alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive. And Mrs Clinton herself called the decision “unprecedented” and “deeply troubling”. 
“It’s pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election,” she complained, addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the must-win state of Florida. 
Democrats questioned the timing of the agency’s decision, which comes as polls showed Mrs Clinton’s lead falling just 10 days before the presidential election. 
“This is like an 18-wheeler smacking into us, and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time,” said Donna Brazile, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. 
“The campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can. 
“We don’t want it to knock us off our game. But on the second-to-last weekend of the race, we find ourselves having to tell voters, ‘Keep your focus, keep your eyes on the prize.’” 
Hillary’s campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me. As for the complaints from HRC, they just make her sound like the out-of-touch, money-grabbing, power-hungry, deceitful",0

HOLY SMOKES! So ALL of Huma’s emails from her smartphone are now in possession of the DOJ and FBI. 
Anthony Weiner says it was “by accident.” Perhaps so, either way he is an epic disgraced loser. 
You have to believe that with DOJ and the FBI having all of Huma’s emails, MANY will contain threads with Hillary and there will be enough damning information to convict her without any reasonable doubt. 
The question is, are there people in the DOJ and FBI with enough pull to have the courage to tell the truth, or will their efforts be stonewalled by the likes of Hillary shill Loretta Lynch and Peter Kadzik.

872,GUEST POST: Why I’m Exceptional & Indispensable – by Hillary Clinton - Rob Slane,"Originally appeared at The Blog Mire 
Following on from her recent piece for Time magazine , in which she so eloquently explained why America is indispensable and exceptional, TheBlogMire brings you an exclusive piece in which Mrs Clinton explains why an indispensable and exceptional nation must have an indispensable and exceptional leader. 
(Warning: May contain traces of satire) 
If there’s one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of my career in public service, it’s this: I am an exceptional woman. A great, unselfish, compassionate woman, to paraphrase Robert Kennedy. And when you add up all my advantages, it’s clear I’m indispensable too – someone all others can look to for leadership. 
And what I’m really excited about is not just that I’m indispensable, but that I’m about to become President of the indispensable nation. An indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman. An indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation. It’s a match made in heaven, which is why I am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on November 8th – so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are. 
So what makes me so indispensable? 
I’m indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces. Our military is the greatest in history, with the best troops, training and technology, and I believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential. It’s essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform, and I intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency. 
I’m indispensable because of my commitment to the truth. Throughout my career, I’ve always sought to stay close to the truth. I know that there’s a lot of folks out there who say I’m corrupt. But those who know me closest will tell you that this isn’t the real Hillary. Ask those who know me best. Ask my husband Bill. He’ll tell you. Ask my campaign chairman John Podesta. He’ll tell you. Ask Lloyd Blankfein, CEO at Goldman Sachs. He’ll tell you. Ask some of our closest allies in places like Saudi Arabia. They’ll tell you. They will all tell you about the real Hillary, and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none. It may even be my most exceptional quality. Alongside humility. 
I’m also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters. You only have to look at who they are. Has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate America? I don’t think so. But it does tell you something, doesn’t it? I humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me. 
I’m indispensable because, unlike Donald Trump, I don’t need to rely on the help of people like Vladimir Putin and countries like Russia to help get me elected. Can you imagine me having to rely on Putin and Russia to get elected? Of course I’ve had to bring Putin and Russia up in this campaign from time to time, not because I want to keep bringing Putin and Russia into it. In fact, the only reason I’ve occasionally mentioned Putin and Russia is not because I want to keep talking about Putin and Russia, but because I have to keep taking about Putin and Russia because Trump is depending on Putin and Russia to get him elected and so I have to draw attention to Putin and Russia. But trust me, if I had my way I wouldn’t bring Putin and Russia up at all. 
I’m indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators, and establishing democracy and peace. Like Libya, for example. We came. We saw. He died. And the Libyans got their liberty. 
Most of all, I’m ­indispensable — and exceptional — because of my values. 
Take my commitment to human rights, which I have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy, right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human. 
Take my commitment to raising money, which my husband and I have shown through our tireless work with the Clinton Foundation, and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations. 
Take my commitment to making the world a better place, which I’ve shown time and time again by saying things like “love trumps hate”. Which it does, doesn’t it? I’m proud of that expression. 
But with all of these advantages comes ­responsibility – I need to lead the world. You need me to lead the world. Because if I fail to lead, I will leave a vacuum that lets extremists, Putin and Russia, haters, bigots, the intolerant, Putin and Russia, the severely backwards , the Julian Assange’s of this world,Putin and Russia – Baskets of Deplorables – take root everywhere. 
Of course, being exceptional doesn’t mean that other people don’t also have something to offer — maybe they do. But I have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace, progress and prosperity around the world, which I intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency, by standing up to Putin and Russia and showing Putin and Russia who’s boss. 
I’ll never stop doing good. Never. That’s what makes me great. I’m good because I’m great, and I’ll tell you one thing, I’ll never stop. 
That’s why I’m indispensable. 
Let’s keep me exceptional. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us! Russia Insider depends on your donations: the more you give, the more we can do. $1 $10 Other amount

873,"Red, Blue and Divided: Six Views of America - The New York Times","Red, blue, optimistic, fearful. Here are six takes on a divided America, in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s narrow election victory. DENVER  —   Marjorie Haun, 55, a Trump supporter living in Colorado, let me sign into her Facebook account on Friday.   protests had rocked cities  across the country, and I wanted to see what the reaction looked like to her. And so I logged in and took a spin. Her friends (she has 4, 996) had posted images of a supposed Democrat defecating on a Trump sign. Another shared a protest video  —   “Idiot Paid   Anarchists Yell ‘Peaceful Protest’ as they Bash Cars”  —   with the message, “Run these vile Liberal dirtbags down! !!” Others called protesters “spoiled brats” and urged friends to keep their guns loaded. Ms. Haun had added a video of her own  —   “  rioters brawl  —   with each other!”  —   with a note: “Are we having fun yet?” Then I opened a new window and logged in as Meredith Dodson, 42, a Hillary Clinton supporter who lives in Washington, D. C. She has 1, 176 friends. On her feed, no one was talking about the protests. Instead, there was fear. How would women,   Latinos, immigrants, gay people and others be treated under President Trump? “As a woman and a Latina I’m feeling lost and afraid,” one person wrote. “Friends please tell me you have my back. ” “This morning,” another wrote, “I started mentally planning how I would react if someone were to refer to me as the N word. It has already happened to 3 of my friends. ” Ms. Dodson had tapped out her own message: “The vast majority of my daughter’s DC Public Schools PreK classmates are the children of immigrants,” she said. “These are 3 and 4 year olds! I am so frightened. ” In some ways, the echo chamber was the winner of this election. Here we are, deeply connected. And yet red America is typing away to red America, and blue America is typing away to blue America. The day after the election, some people said the echo chamber had begun to feel like a prison. I called Ms. Haun and Ms. Dodson and thanked them for letting me hang out in their social spaces. Ms. Dodson said that she had two or three Facebook friends who supported Mr. Trump, but no   friends who did, and that she had been trying to get out of her bubble. ”I have this suspicion that I have no idea what’s going on in the rest of white America,” she said. Ms. Haun has a few friends who support Mrs. Clinton, but they largely avoid talking about politics online, she said. She was less concerned than Ms. Dodson about getting trapped in a loop of ideas. “We want to be inclusive in our echo chamber,” she said. “If anyone wants to come in, come on in. ” JULIE TURKEWITZ NEW ORLEANS  —   Perhaps the best way to understand “the elite” that Mr. Trump railed against is to consider what it is not  —   or at least how it differs from the way Clinton supporters might see it. Elite does not simply mean having a lot of money. Mr. Trump, who inherited millions, is not considered an elite sellout by his supporters any more than Edward J. Snowden is considered a tool of the government for having worked at the National Security Agency. Rather, the thinking goes, it’s because Mr. Trump knows how it all works that he is in the best position to take it all apart. “The people he hung around, with all those wealthy folks and how they manipulated everything,” made him uniquely qualified, said Pat Bruce, a conservative activist in the suburbs of Jackson, Miss. who grew excited about the Trump campaign when she saw that “he never changed what he said to fit what they wanted him to say. ” Elite does not necessarily mean educated, either. While university professors might be scorned as condescending eggheads, book smarts are prized when used against the bookish. While covering the 2012 Republican primary races in the Deep South, I remember conservatives crowing giddily about Newt Gingrich’s ability to demolish foes in a debate. Elite is certainly not, as many on the left would argue, a function of historical advantage: being, say, a white Christian male in a country that has long made little room for anyone else. It is in some ways exactly not this. Rather, much of Mr. Trump’s support arose from frustration that the majority must grant marginalized groups  —   immigrants, transgender people  —   particular protection and deference. Last year, the political leadership of Mississippi came out for the dedication of a   metal cross south of Jackson, an event at which speakers talked of taking a stand despite “people coming against you, of course, your atheists, your critics. ” There, in the most religious state in the country, atheists are an extreme minority. But they are the ones who ignite the court battles, who mean no prayers at high school football games, who must be accommodated. This is, to many, what constitutes the elite: the people who set the cultural and societal norms, and who do so without their input or influence. Across   social media this week, some were celebrating but many others  —   including the   himself  —   were expressing deep frustration. Even after a stunning victory, they saw themselves being described as bigoted and unenlightened. And even with the Republicans having achieved   control of all levels of government, this remained an aggravating conundrum: The elites are still the ones who decide who gets to be elite. CAMPBELL ROBERTSON Religion is a purple state. There were indeed plenty of religious folks cheering at Mr. Trump’s rallies, but there were many clergy members who fought hard to elect Mrs. Clinton. White evangelicals stuck with Mr. Trump. Exit polls show that 81 percent voted for him, more than either of the past two Republican presidential candidates drew. Majorities of Mormons and white Catholics, as well as many mainline Protestants, also supported Mr. Trump, undeterred by his offensive language and harsh perspectives on Mexicans, Muslims and the disabled. In interviews this year, I often heard bewilderment and resentment from these believers at the pace of cultural and demographic change. Still reeling from last year’s Supreme Court decision to legalize gay marriage, they felt pummeled this year when the Obama administration set rules for transgender students in school bathrooms. They were disturbed to see businesses setting aside prayer rooms for Muslims when Christians were not allowed to recite the Lord’s Prayer at high school graduation. Mr. Trump told them he was their “last chance” to protect their religious liberty and limit abortion  —   and many believed it. The Clinton camp included many evangelicals, but they were predominantly black, Latino, Asian and female. Her supporters also included   of Latino Catholics and four in 10 white Catholics Jews, Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities and those who say they have no religious affiliation. These voters are also guided by religious and moral values, but they arrive at a completely different destination than do conservatives. Their concerns are poverty, economic inequality, immigration, health care, criminal justice reform, voting rights, gay and transgender rights, reproductive choice, climate change and environmental protection. The Rev. William Barber II, a black minister and civil rights leader in North Carolina, held “moral revivals” in 22 states this year with three friends: the Rev. James A. Forbes, the Rev. Traci Blackmon and Sister Simone Campbell. After the election, Mr. Barber’s Twitter feed went silent until Friday, when he put out a stream of posts. “This is where we redouble our commitment to be instruments of truth, love, and justice,” he wrote, rallying people of faith to lead the way in resisting the Trump administration. LAURIE GOODSTEIN A Trump supporter called me Thursday to criticize my coverage of the  ’s immigration policies. He pointed to it as an example of egregious bias that he said had led the news media to miss the groundswell of support that lifted Mr. Trump to victory. His tone was hostile at first, but we got to talking. The supporter, Douglas Freeman, a    retired postal worker from Knoxville, Tenn. explained why Mr. Trump’s proposals to raise a border wall and punish cities that protect immigrants here illegally resonated with his view of the United States as a nation under siege  —   from outside and within. “He speaks with conviction and passion,” Mr. Freeman said of Mr. Trump, “and he is obviously an American patriot who is very upset with the political ruling class, which is selling our sovereignty out to globalism. ” He added: “When he said Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo, we stood up and cheered. ” For Mr. Freeman, Mr. Trump’s blunt immigration talk signified that he was a true rebel who would take on the powers that be, including in the Republican Party. “We have a   duopoly,” he said. “They want to destroy this country by importing armies of people who will vote to keep the checks flowing from the federal government. ” Mrs. Clinton’s paid speech to a Brazilian bank, in which she said open borders throughout the Western Hemisphere were “my dream”  —   an excerpt that was released by WikiLeaks  —   confirmed that for Mr. Freeman. In covering immigration for The Times, I’ve been to the southwest border many times in recent years. I have not seen the   boundary Mr. Freeman depicts. There are 700 miles of walls and fences, 17, 000 Border Patrol agents, and drones and aerial cameras. Homeland Security officials said last week that they were detaining more than 41, 000 immigrants and opening jails for more. Despite a surge of Central American migrants, illegal crossings are at the lowest level since the 1970s. But Mr. Freeman wants Mr. Trump to add a lot more border security to send a message to migrants to stay out, and to reassure his American supporters that the borders “are no longer open. ” He said he did not expect Mr. Trump’s actions to match all the heated statements of his campaign. The wall does not have to cover remote, impassable stretches of the border, he said. He understands the country needs guest workers for agriculture. He does not expect agents to go door to door looking for immigrants to deport. But he wants Mr. Trump to cut federal funding for cities that do not cooperate with immigration authorities. And he strongly favors “extreme vetting” for refugees from the Middle East. “We are deliberately importing Muslims who are very intolerant and don’t believe in   ” Mr. Freeman said. “If Mr. Trump doesn’t deliver,” he said, “he won’t have support for very long. ” JULIA PRESTON In vowing to “Make America Great Again,” Mr. Trump laid bare competing visions of what America is  —   or should be. For years politicians have framed the divide as Red America versus Blue America. But Mr. Trump’s victory has me thinking about our national divide as a clash between Americans who prize the melting pot, and those who embrace the concept of the “salad bowl. ” So I reached out to several women I knew. Mary Barket is 60, a Republican strategist and avid Trump supporter in Nazareth, Pa. squarely in the Rust Belt. Her grandfather emigrated from Poland shortly before World War I, joined the Army and returned to Europe to fight. He learned English and insisted his children do the same. “He was all about assimilation,” she said. Mrs. Barket said she had watched with alarm as identity politics and racial divisions flourished under President Obama, the nation’s first black president. She works in her church, helping run a food pantry, and once took in a black friend of her daughter’s for six months. She said she approved of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, but today’s Black Lives Matter protests against the police have unnerved her: “It doesn’t seem like they come from a place of peace. ” She has a gay cousin who is in a   relationship, but she is not enamored of the gay rights movement she says the focus should be on “human rights” instead. “I just don’t like this striating of our culture,” she said. “I think we have to go back to thinking of ourselves as Americans. ” I met Tessa    —   who is “ ” and the president of the Baltimore chapter of the N. A. A. C. P.  —   while covering the unrest spurred by the death of Freddie Gray after his arrest by the police. Her grandfather, a doctor in Kentucky, was the descendant of a slave impregnated by her master. “We didn’t come here looking for a melting pot,” she said. “We were tortured and brought here. ” Like Mara Kiesling, 57, who began life as a boy in Harrisburg, Pa. and now fights for transgender rights in Washington, Ms.   envisions an America where differences are celebrated, not airbrushed away. Both women are terrified Mr. Trump will roll back their   rights. “The feeling that is the strongest for me this week is that this is my country,” Ms. Kiesling said, “and no one is going to tell me I can’t be here. “ All of these women insist they want a unified America, and in many respects  —   including their age and socioeconomic status  —   they are very similar. Yet as they fight for their version of America, they could not be further apart. SHERYL GAY STOLBERG HOUSTON  —   Before America had a presidential candidate who offended Latinos,   Muslims, women and the disabled, Texas had Sid Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, who compared Syrian refugees to snakes and called Mrs. Clinton an obscene term on Twitter. And Dan Patrick, the lieutenant governor, who said illegal immigrants were bringing leprosy and other “  diseases” to Texas. And Molly White, a state lawmaker who told her staff to ask Muslims visiting her office to “publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws. ” And Jonathan Stickland, another state lawmaker, who in 2008 wrote on an online forum: “Rape is nonexistent in marriage, take what you want my friend!” A candidate for the State Board of Education  —   Mary Lou Bruner, a former kindergarten teacher, 69, who was pleasant when I spoke to her by phone in March  —   claimed President Obama was a   gay prostitute in his youth. Chris Mapp, a candidate for Senate, referred to undocumented immigrants as “wetbacks. ” None of this bothered Texas Republicans a great deal. There were a few apologies and statements of regret, but not much more. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters in blue America cringed at Mr. Trump’s inflammatory remarks during the campaign, but his supporters throughout red America barely flinched. They were used to it. They lived in places where public figures had been making   comments for years. In red Texas in particular, I have found, the notion of being offended is regarded as a “blue” concept. Lance Herrington, 73, has long offended Democratic motorists on State Highway 71 in La Grange, plastering the marquee and other signs outside his classic car company with provocative slogans. He told me a story about someone he had offended with his marquee in 2012. Red America will take it one way. Blue America will take it another. After the debates between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama in 2012, his marquee read: “The Mormon won. The moron zero. ” He also hung a white plastic chair, a reference to Clint Eastwood’s conversation with a chair during the Republican convention that year. “This minority, she was out front,” he said. She later called him and threatened to turn him into the F. B. I. “I said, ‘For what?’ She says, ‘For that chair.’ I said, ‘Darling, as you can see, it’s a white chair.’ And she hung up on me. ” “The pendulum swung so far toward political correctness that you can’t do anything without offending someone,” he said.

874,France Identifies 2nd Man Who Attacked Church and Killed Priest - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   The French authorities on Thursday identified a second man who stormed a church in Normandy and killed an    priest as he celebrated Mass. The Paris prosecutor’s office identified the man as   Nabil Petitjean, 19. It was not clear how he knew the other killer, Adel Kermiche, also 19, who lived near the church, the Église St.  in St.    a   suburb of Rouen. Both were of Algerian ancestry. They were shot dead by the police after the assault on the church on Tuesday, which also left an    parishioner severely wounded he is in stable condition. The Islamic State released videos on Wednesday in which the two young men pledged allegiance to the terrorist group before the assault, which killed the Rev. Jacques Hamel. Mr. Petitjean was born in St.    in Lorraine in northeastern France, but grew up in    in the southeast. He attended a high school there, the Lycée Marlioz, and his father lives in Montluçon, a town in central France, north of  . Mr. Petitjean flew to Turkey on June 10 but was stopped at the airport, before he reached the   desk, when he was seen talking with someone who was on the   list, according to a Turkish official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He left Turkey the next day, and was placed on a blacklist, as a precaution, the following week, and the French authorities were immediately notified, the official said. The Paris prosecutor’s office said on Thursday that Mr. Petitjean came to the attention of the police on June 29. On July 22  —   four days before the attack  —   a foreign intelligence agency sent his picture to French intelligence services, but without a name or description, the office said. Interviewed by French reporters, Mr. Petitjean’s mother, who was identified by news agencies as Yamina Boukessoula, expressed astonishment. She said he had last spoken to her early this week. She said: “He said, ‘Don’t worry, get some sleep, everything is O. K.’ He had a soft voice. He sounded well. It wasn’t worrisome. He has friends, like everyone else. ” The mother told reporters, “Daesh is not part of his language,” using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. She said that her son had been visiting a cousin in northeastern France and that she had no idea how he had ended up in St.    the town in Normandy where the attack occurred, although he appeared to have relatives in Normandy. “I was a good mother,” she said. “I was always there for my children, maybe even too much. Malik doesn’t have psychological problems. He’s like all    with ambition, with plans. He’s smart. ” Mr. Kermiche had been detained for nearly 10 months after trying, twice, to enter Syria, but he was released in March over the objections of prosecutors. He was made to wear an electronic ankle bracelet, forbidden to leave his local department of   required to report to a probation officer once a week and ordered to live in his parents’ house. He was allowed free movement from 8:30 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. on weekdays the attack on the church occurred at 9:25 a. m. The killing of the priest has elicited condemnation worldwide. On Thursday, the French Council of the Muslim Faith urged Muslims to attend Mass on Sunday morning, to “again express solidarity with and compassion for our Christian brothers. ” President François Hollande has again found himself confronting the specter of Islamic State terrorism  —   a rampage in Nice, on the evening of July 14, Bastille Day, which killed 84 people, followed by the attack on the church in Normandy just 12 days later  —   as the nation’s mood has increasingly turned somber. On Thursday morning, Mr. Hollande met with lawmakers to discuss the possibility of establishing a National Guard of volunteer reservists, including retired gendarmes, to help protect the nation. The plan, which he first floated in November, “is not meant to replace public forces, but to back them up and reinforce them,” Mr. Hollande said at a ceremony to open a highway in southwestern France. Mr. Hollande’s government declared a state of emergency in November. It was extended after the attack in Nice, giving the police and prosecutors expanded powers. But he has resisted calls by political rivals, including former President Nicolas Sarkozy and the leader of the   National Front, Marine Le Pen, for even more drastic constitutional and legal changes. On Thursday, Mr. Hollande reacted angrily to a comment a day earlier by Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee for president of the United States, who, in response to the killing of the priest, said that “France is no longer France. ” Mr. Hollande retorted: “France will always be France. It never gives up, because it still bears ideals, values, principles that are recognized worldwide, and it’s when you lower your standards that you are no longer what you are. That’s something that may happen to others, on the other side of the Atlantic. ”",0
875,DREAMers Arrested in Nationwide Gang Crackdown,"Federal immigration officials arrested nearly 1, 400 gang members in a nationwide   operation, including illegal immigrants gang members who had protected status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. [Altogether, 1, 378 gang members were arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, 1, 098 of which already have federal or state criminal charges against them, according to a news release.   of the members had pending murder charges against them, while another seven were facing rape allegations. The other 280 were arrested for being in the U. S. illegally.  Three of the gang members arrested in the ICE operation had protected status as illegal immigrants under the   DACA program. Since DACA’s inception, more than 1, 500 illegal immigrants have had their protected status revoked after they were found to be involved with a gang or committed a crime. DACA recipients are given protection by the federal government and since the Trump Administration has not ended the program, experts like Mark Krikorian have previously said that 800 new permits for protected DACA status can be granted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) every day. “They’re still processing these work permits,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas at the time. “That’s got to end at the absolute minimum. ” Additionally, of the 1, 478 gang members arrested, 10 of them had crossed the U. S.  Brder as unaccompanied minors. Of those 10, nine were confirmed gang members and eight of those 10 were   specifically. Most recently, Breitbart Texas reported on the continued resettlement of foreign unaccompanied minors into    regions of the U. S. despite experts pointing to evidence that this process allows foreign crime syndicates to flourish. Since the beginning of the Fiscal Year, October 1, 2016, 651 unaccompanied minors were placed in Nassau County, which is home to one of the largest growing   gang population’s in the U. S. In neighboring Suffolk County, which has a widespread   gang problem in Brentwood and Central Islip, approximately 915 have been resettled in the region.

876,Maxine Waters: American Public ’Getting Weary’ That Trump Not Impeached Yet - Breitbart,"Sunday on MSNBC’s “AM Joy,”  Rep. Maxine Waters ( ) said the public was “getting weary” that Democrats have not done enough to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump.  Partial transcript as follows: REID: Congresswoman,  on the subject of being more aggressive, you have openly talked about the fact that this president has put himself in a position where impeachment is on the table but your party, the Democratic party is very reluctant, The New York Times has an article out last week about how hesitant Democratic leadership, in particular, are to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment. In closing, why do you suppose that is? WATERS:  I don’t know what the reticent is but I know this, that the American public is getting weary of all of these actions without enough being done by the elected officials who they elected to represent them.  I believe that this man has done enough for us to determine that we can connect the dots, that we can get the facts that will lead to impeachment. I believe there was collusion. I think we have enough information about the meetings, the about the lying about those meetings to help us to understand that something was going on. There was an interaction there. And certainly I believe it was collusion, but if they just do their work and do their job, they will find out it was collusion. And I believe this president should be impeached. I don’t care what others say about ‘it’s too soon, we don’t know, we think.’ I think that they’re letting the American public down by not delving deeper into what is going on with Jared Kushner and this back channeling, about the lies and his failure to disclose he had had these meetings, the same thing with sessions, failure to disclose about the meetings.

878,Deported Italian Mobster Caught Sneaking Across U.S.-Mexico Border,"A previously deported Italian mobster has been arrested trying to illegally enter the U. S. by sneaking across the porous border with Mexico. The man had originally been deported after serving time in federal prison in connection with drug trafficking and violent assaults. [The arrest took place near the border city of Nogales, Arizona, where U. S. Border Patrol agents arrested Salvatore Marciante as he tried to sneak into the country. After the arrest, agents were able to search Marciante’s criminal history and confirmed that he had been a permanent legal resident who had been living in New York until his convictions in 1995, when he lost his legal status. After serving several years in U. S. prison he was deported to Italy.   According to federal court records obtained by Breitbart Texas, Marciante is a citizen of Italy who had traveled to Mexico in order to enter the country through Nogales, Arizona. Marciante had been deported on September 1, 2004 from New York. Currently he is facing illegal   charges in the federal courthouse in Tucson, Arizona.    Marciante was originally named in a   indictment filed in 1994 accusing him and 12 other members of the Italian mafia of distributing and trafficking narcotics in New York. Many of the documents listed in the court proceedings remain sealed by the court. Available court documents revealed that federal agents arrested Marciante on September 15, 1994, and on October 6, 1994, and a federal judge set his bond at $1 million. While in prison, Marciante and several other members of the same group were further charged in a separate indictment in connection with a series of armed robberies targeting various restaurants in New York. The indictment was filed in June 1999, while Marciante was already in prison for the drug charge. For unknown reasons, the criminal indictment and many of the court documents remain sealed by the court. By April 2000, Marciante pleaded guilty to various counts in connection with the charge of interference of commerce by violence in connection with the robberies. For that case, Marciante was sentenced to serve more than five years in prison however the prison term was set to run concurrent with the previous case.

879,Leaked Audio: Hillary Clinton Pushed “Rigging” Palestine Elections in 2006,"Email 
A bombshell of new audio is exposing Hillary Clinton for the immoral, politically motivated opportunist that she is. Now the question is, will this impact her race for the White House? 
Some ten years ago (more recent than Donald Trump’s now infamous “locker room talk” recording) in September of 2006, Hillary Clinton was running for reelection to the Senate when she sat down to speak with the editorial board of the Jewish Press. The sit-down was recorded, but the full conversation had never been released, until now. One of the editors present during the interview spoke with the Observer this week and played them the 45-minute long tape of the conversation with Clinton. 
Below is what is likely the most important disclosure of the conversation, and it provides reason for American voters to worry. It also proves that Donald Trump is not some crazy conspiracy theorist for expressing concern about the Democrat Party trying to “rig” the 2016 election. 
While talking to the Jewish Press, Clinton commented on the 2006 election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (where terrorist organization Hamas won control of the Palestinian government) and expressed her belief that allowing the election was a huge mistake, but if they were going to allow it… then the US government should have rigged the election to suit their needs. 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” 
Yes, you just heard correctly. A sitting US Senator, and the future Secretary of State and then presidential candidate just argued that we should have rigged the election, thereby disallowing the right of the Palestinian people to choose their own leaders. 
While Hamas is a terrorist organization and they are horrible, murderous thugs whose ideology we must stamp out… the comments should raise this question in our minds – if Hillary Clinton is willing to rig an election in Palestine, why wouldn’t she do the same here if she could? This realization that Clinton is not beyond “fixing” the results of an election, should make all of the other recent evidences of massive voter fraud all the more concerning. 
Well known election fraud expert John Fund has written article , after article , after article and even books chronicling voter fraud in the U.S. 
Fund wrote extensively, for instance, of the 2008 election that put Al Franken in the U.S. Senate for the State of Minnesota. The 312-vote victory Franken eked out, Fund wrote , was not a happy result of just enough votes but a result born of massive vote fraud. 
Other reporters have written of vote fraud, of course. Take the report in the Washington Free Beacon that revealed that 141 U.S. counties have more people registered to vote than they even have residents eligible to do so! 
These charges have been building for at least 20 years and over the last few months they have shifted into high gear. But we don’t have to stick to recent history to find people complaining about voter fraud. Only eight years ago when he was first running for the White House, even Barack Obama was heard complaining about rampant vote fraud in the U.S… 
And then there is the new series of undercover videos by Jame O’Keefe’s Project Veritas which has revealed Democrat operatives admitting that they routinely engage in voter fraud in order to win elections by hook or crook. 
Please make sure to read the full Observer story about the 2006 interview with Hillary Clinton. There are a few other remarkable observations made about some of Clinton’s comments – like her willingness to speak with world leaders no matter the current political climate between our countries and Clinton’s seeming approval of “an eye for an eye” interactions between Israel and Hamas.

880,How the Iranian-Saudi Proxy Struggle Tore Apart the Middle East - The New York Times,"Behind much of the Middle East’s chaos  —   the wars in Syria and Yemen, the political upheaval in Iraq and Lebanon and Bahrain  —   there is another conflict. Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a struggle for dominance that has turned much of the Middle East into their battlefield. Rather than fighting directly, they wield and in that way worsen the region’s direst problems: dictatorship, militia violence and religious extremism. The history of their rivalry tracks  —   and helps to explain  —   the Middle East’s disintegration, particularly the   sectarianism both powers have found useful to cultivate. It is a story in which the United States has been a supporting but constant player, most recently by backing the Saudi war in Yemen, which kills hundreds of civilians. These dynamics, scholars warn, point toward a future of civil wars, divided societies and unstable governments. F. Gregory Gause III, an international relations scholar at Texas A  M University, struggled to name another region that had been torn apart in this way. Central Africa could be similar, he suggested, referring to the two decades of interrelated wars and genocides that, driven by meddling regional powers, killed five million. But in the Middle East, it is just getting started. Saudi Arabia, a young country pieced together only in the 1930s, has built its legitimacy on religion. By promoting its stewardship of the holy sites at Mecca and Medina, it could justify its royal family’s grip on power. Iran’s revolution, in 1979, threatened that legitimacy. Iranians toppled their authoritarian government, installing Islamists who claimed to represent “a revolution for the entire Islamic world,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. The revolutionaries encouraged all Muslims, especially Saudis, to overthrow their rulers as well. But because Iran is mostly Shiite, they “had the greatest influence with, and tended to reach out to, Shia groups,” Dr. Pollack said. Some Saudi Shiites, who make up about 10 percent of the population, protested in solidarity or even set up offices in Tehran  —   stoking Saudi fears of internal unrest and separatism. This was the opening shot in the sectarianization of their rivalry, which would encompass the whole region. “The Saudis have looked at Iran as a domestic threat from the   from 1979,” Dr. Gause said. Seeing the threat as intolerable, they began looking for a way to strike back. They found that way the next year, when Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded Iran, hoping to seize   territory. Saudi Arabia, Dr. Pollack said, “backed the Iraqis to the hilt because they want the Iranian revolution stopped. ” The war, over eight years of trench warfare and chemical weapons attacks, killed perhaps a million people. It set a pattern of   struggle through proxies, and of sucking in the United States, whose policy is to maintain access to the vast oil and gas reserves that lie between the rivals. The conflict’s toll exhausted Iran’s zeal for sowing revolution abroad, but gave it a new mission: to overturn the     regional order that Tehran saw as an existential threat. That sense of insecurity would later drive Iran’s meddling abroad, said Marc Lynch, a political scientist at George Washington University, and perhaps its missile and nuclear programs. The 1990s provided a pause in the regional rivalry, but also set up the conditions that would allow it to later explode in such force. Saudi Arabia, wishing to contain Iran’s reach to the region’s minority Shiite populations, sought to harden   rifts. Government programs promoted “  incitement in schools, Islamic universities, and the media,” Toby Matthiesen, an Oxford University scholar, wrote in a brief for the Carnegie Endowment. These policies, Dr. Matthiesen warned, cultivated sectarian fears and sometimes violence that would later feed into the ideology of the Islamic State. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a Saudi ally. The United States, after expelling the Iraqis, established military bases in the region to defend its allies from Iraq. This further tilted the regional power balance against Iran, which saw the American forces as a threat. Iraq’s humiliating defeat also spurred many of its citizens to rise up, particularly in poorer communities that happened to be Shiite Arab. In response, Dr. Gause said, “Saddam’s regime became explicitly sectarian,” widening   divides to deter future uprisings. That allowed Iran, still worried about Iraq, to cultivate allies among Iraq’s increasingly disenfranchised Shiites, including militias that had risen up. Though it was not obvious at the time, Iraq had become a powder keg, one that would ignite when its government was toppled a decade later. The 2003   invasion, by toppling an Iraqi government that had been hostile to both Saudi Arabia and Iran, upended the region’s power balance. Iran, convinced that the United States and Saudi Arabia would install a pliant Iraqi government  —   and remembering the horrors they had inflicted on Iran in the 1980s  —   raced to fill the postwar vacuum. Its leverage with Shiite groups, which are Iraq’s largest demographic group, allowed it to influence Baghdad politics. Iran also wielded Shiite militias to control Iraqi streets and undermine the   occupation. But sectarian violence took on its own inevitable momentum, hastening the country’s slide into civil war. Saudi Arabia sought to match Iran’s reach but, after years of oppressing its own Shiite population, struggled to make inroads with those in Iraq. “The problem for the Saudis is that their natural allies in Iraq,” Dr. Gause said, referring to Sunni groups that were increasingly turning to jihadism, “wanted to kill them. ” This was the first sign that Saudi Arabia’s strategy for containing Iran, by fostering sectarianism and aligning itself with the region’s Sunni majority, had backfired. As Sunni governments collapsed and Sunni militias turned to jihadism, Riyadh would be left with few reliable proxies. As their competition in Iraq heated up, Saudi Arabia and Iran sought to counterbalance each other through another weak state: Lebanon. Lebanon provided the perfect opening: a frail democracy recovering from civil war, with parties and lingering militias primarily organized by religion. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited those dynamics, waging a new kind of proxy struggle “not on conventional military battlefields,” Dr. Gause said, but “within the domestic politics of weakened institutional structures. ” Iran, for instance, supported Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political movement, which it had earlier cultivated to use against Israel. Riyadh, in turn, funneled money to political allies such as the Sunni prime minister, Rafik Hariri. By competing along Lebanon’s religious lines, they helped drive the Lebanese government’s frequent breakdowns, as parties relied on foreign backers who wanted to oppose one another more than build a functioning state. With Iran promoting Hezbollah as the nation’s defender and Saudi Arabia backing the Lebanese military, neither had a full mandate, and Lebanon struggled to maintain order. As the foreign powers escalated their antagonism, Lebanon’s dysfunction spiraled into violence. In 2005, after Mr. Hariri called for the withdrawal of   Syrian troops, he was assassinated. (Hezbollah has long been suspected.) Another political crisis, in 2008, culminated with Hezbollah overpowering Sunni militias to seize much of Beirut. Saudi Arabia requested United States air cover, according to a WikiLeaks cable, for a   force to retake the city. Though the intervention never materialized, the episode was a dress rehearsal for the turmoil that would soon come to the wider region. When the Arab Spring toppled governments across the Middle East, many of them Saudi allies, Riyadh feared that Iran would again fill the vacuums. So it rushed to close them, at times with force. It promised billions in aid to Jordan, Yemen, Egypt and others, often urging those governments to crack down. After   protesters rose up in Bahrain, a Saudi ally whose Sunni king rules over a majority Shiite population, Saudi Arabia sent 1, 200 troops. In Egypt, Saudi Arabia tacitly supported a 2013 military takeover, seeing the military as a more reliable ally than the elected Islamist government it replaced. As Libya fell into civil war, it backed a   general who was driving to consolidate control. Though Iran has little influence in either country, Saudi Arabia’s fear of losing ground to Iran made it fight harder to retain influence wherever it could, analysts believe. Syria, an Iranian ally, reversed the usual dynamic. Saudi Arabia and other   Sunni states steered money and arms to rebels, including Sunni Islamists. Iran intervened in turn, sending officers and later Hezbollah to fight on behalf of Syria’s government, whose leaders mostly follow a sect of Shiism. Their interventions, civil war scholars say, helped lock Syria in the   stalemate that has killed over 400, 000. The United States has struggled to restore the region’s balance. President Obama has urged Iran and Saudi Arabia “to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace,” he told The Atlantic. But Dr. Lynch called this plan for “a   equilibrium” between the Mideast powers “ . ” The nuclear agreement with Iran, instead of calming Saudi nerves, hit on fears that “the United States wants to abandon them in order to ally with Iran,” Dr. Lynch said, calling the belief “crazy” but widespread. Mr. Pollack said he often heard Sunni Arab leaders express this as a metaphor. “They would say, ‘What is wrong with you people? You have this good, loving, loyal wife in us, and this crazy mistress in Iran. You don’t understand how bad she is for you, and yet you endlessly run off to her the moment that she winks at you,’” he recounted. The White House looked for other ways to reassure Saudi leaders, facilitating arms sales and overlooking Saudi actions in Egypt and Bahrain. Then came Yemen. A rebel group with loose ties to Iran ousted the   president, deepening Riyadh’s fears. Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign that inflicted horror on civilians but accomplished little else. The assault receives heavy American support, though the United States has few interests in Yemen other than counterterrorism and sometimes criticizes the campaign. In exchange, Riyadh acquiesced to the Iran deal and began to follow Washington’s lead on Syria. But the underlying proxy war remained. Asked when the   struggle might cool, Mr. Pollack said he doubted that it would: “Where we’re headed with the Middle East is the current trend extrapolated, with more failed and failing governments. ” In Yemen, this is already “reorganizing Yemeni society along sectarian lines and rearranging people’s relationships to one another on a   basis,” Farea   an analyst, wrote in a Carnegie Endowment paper, which cited similar trends across the region. Continued crises will risk sucking in the United States again, Mr. Lynch said, adding that no American president was likely to persuade Saudi Arabia or Iran to stay out of regional conflicts that it saw as potentially existential threats.   Donald J. Trump will enter office having echoed Saudi Arabia’s view of the region. Iran “took over Iraq,” he said at a rally in January. “They’re going to have Yemen. They’re going to have Syria. They’re going to have everything. ” Mentioning both the   and Hillary Clinton, Dr. Gause said he doubted that any administration could reset the Middle East’s power struggles. “I do not think that the fundamental problem of the region,” he said, “is something that either Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton could do that much about. ”",0

882,"L'influence des USA et de l'Otan dans les rapports de l’UE avec la Chine, Manlio Dinucci","L’influence des USA et de l’Otan dans les rapports de l’UE avec la Chine par Manlio Dinucci Intervenant dans un forum international, le géographe italien Manlio Dinucci synthétise son analyse des armes dont les États-Unis se sont dotés pour dominer l’ensemble du monde. Cet article est d’autant plus important que c’est cette domination clairement assumée, cette organisation unipolaire du monde, que la Syrie, la Russie et la Chine mettent aujourd’hui en cause les armes à la main.
Réseau Voltaire | Rome (Italie) | 27 octobre 2016 Je vais tout de suite au nœud de la question. Je pense qu’on ne peut pas parler de relations entre Union européenne et Chine indépendamment de l’influence que les États-Unis exercent sur l’Union européenne, directement et par l’intermédiaire de l’Otan.
Aujourd’hui 22 des 28 pays de l’UE (21 sur 27 après la sortie du Royaume-Uni de l’UE), avec plus de 90 % de la population de l’Union, font partie de l’Otan, reconnue par l’UE comme « fondement de la défense collective ». Et l’Otan est sous commandement US : le Commandant suprême allié en Europe est toujours nommé par le président des États-Unis d’Amérique et tous les autres commandements clé sont aux mains des USA. La politique étrangère et militaire de l’Union européenne est ainsi fondamentalement subordonnée à la stratégie états-unienne, sur laquelle convergent les plus grandes puissances européennes.
Cette stratégie, clairement énoncée dans les documents officiels, est tracée au moment historique où la situation mondiale change à la suite de la désagrégation de l’URSS. En 1991 la Maison-Blanche déclare dans la National Security Strategy of the United States : « Les États-Unis demeurent le seul État avec une force, une portée et une influence en toute dimension —politique, économique et militaire— réellement globales. Il n’existe aucun substitut au leadership américain ». En 1992, dans la Defense Planning Guidance , le Pentagone souligne : « Notre premier objectif est d’empêcher qu’une quelconque puissance domine une région dont les ressources seraient suffisantes pour engendrer une puissance mondiale. Ces régions comprennent l’Europe occidentale, l’Asie orientale, le territoire de l’ex-Union Soviétique et l’Asie sud-occidentale ». En 2001, dans le rapport Quadrennial Defense Review —publié une semaine avant la guerre USA/Otan en Afghanistan, aire de première importance géostratégique à l’égard de Russie et Chine—, le Pentagone annonce : « La possibilité existe qu’émerge dans la région un rival militaire avec une formidable base de ressources. Nos forces armées doivent conserver la capacité d’imposer la volonté des États-Unis à n’importe quel adversaire, y compris États et entités non-étatiques, de façon à changer le régime d’un État adverse ou occuper un territoire étranger jusqu’à ce que les objectifs stratégiques états-uniens soient réalisés ».
Sur la base de cette stratégie, l’Otan sous commandement US a lancé son offensive sur le front oriental : après avoir démoli par la guerre la Fédération Yougoslave, de 1999 à aujourd’hui elle a englobé tous les États de l’ex-Pacte de Varsovie, trois de l’ex-Yougoslavie, trois de l’ex-URSS, et sous peu elle en englobera d’autres (à commencer par la Géorgie et l’Ukraine, cette dernière étant de fait déjà dans l’Otan), en déplaçant bases et forces, y compris nucléaires, toujours plus près de la Russie. En même temps, sur le front méridional étroitement relié à celui oriental, l’Otan sous commandement US a démoli par la guerre l’État libyen et a essayé d’en faire autant avec celui de la Syrie.
Les USA et l’Otan ont fait exploser la crise ukrainienne et, accusant la Russie de « déstabiliser la sécurité européenne », ils ont entraîné l’Europe dans une nouvelle Guerre froide, voulue surtout par Washington (aux dépens des économies européennes à qui les sanctions et contre-sanctions ont porté préjudice) pour casser les rapports économiques et politiques Russie-UE néfastes aux intérêts états-uniens. C’est dans la même stratégie qu’entre le déplacement croissant de forces militaires états-uniennes dans la région Asie/Pacifique dans une fonction anti-chinoise. L’U.S. Navy a annoncé qu’en 2020 elle concentrera dans cette région 60 % de ses forces navales et aériennes.
La stratégie états-unienne est focalisée sur la mer de Chine Méridionale, dont l’amiral Harris, chef du Commandement US pour le Pacifique, souligne l’importance : c’est là que passe un commerce maritime d’une valeur annuelle de plus de 5 000 milliards de dollars, dont 25 % de l’export mondial de pétrole et 50 % de celui du gaz naturel. Les USA veulent contrôler cette voie maritime au nom de celle que l’amiral Harris définit comme une « liberté de naviguer fondamentale pour notre système de vie ici aux États-Unis », en accusant la Chine d’« actions agressives en mer Chinoise Méridionale, analogues à celles de la Russie en Crimée ». Pour cela l’U.S Navy « patrouille » la mer de Chine Méridionale. Dans le sillage des États-Unis arrivent les plus grandes puissances européennes : en juillet dernier la France a sollicité l’Union européenne pour « coordonner la patrouille navale de la mer Chinoise Méridionale afin d’assurer une présence régulière et visible dans ces eaux illégalement réclamées par la Chine ». Et tandis que les États-Unis installent en Corée du Sud des systèmes « anti-missiles » mais en mesure de lancer aussi des missiles nucléaires, analogues à ceux installés contre la Russie en Roumanie et bientôt en Pologne, en plus de ceux qui sont embarqués sur des navires de guerre en Méditerranée, le secrétaire général de l’Otan Jens Stoltenberg reçoit le 6 octobre à Bruxelles le ministre des Affaires étrangères sud-coréen, Yun Byung-se, pour « renforcer le partenariat de l’Otan avec Séoul ».
Ces faits et d’autres encore démontrent qu’en Europe et en Asie la même stratégie est à l’œuvre. C’est la tentative extrême des États-Unis et des autres puissances occidentales de maintenir la suprématie économique, politique et militaire, dans un monde en forte transformation, dans lequel émergent de nouveaux sujets étatiques et sociaux. L’Organisation de coopération de Shanghai, née de l’accord stratégique sino-russe, dispose de ressources et de capacités de travail capables d’en faire la plus grande aire économique intégrée du monde. L’Organisation de Shanghai et les Brics sont en mesure, avec leurs organismes financiers, de supplanter en grande partie la Banque mondiale et le Fonds monétaire international qui, pendant plus de 70 ans, ont permis aux USA et aux plus grandes puissances occidentales de dominer l’économie mondiale à travers les prêts usuraires aux pays endettés et d’autres instruments financiers. Les nouveaux organismes peuvent en même temps réaliser la dédollarisation des échanges commerciaux, en ôtant aux États-Unis la capacité de décharger leur dette sur d’autres pays par l’impression de papier monnaie utilisé comme devise internationale dominante.
Pour maintenir leur suprématie, toujours plus vacillante, les États-Unis utilisent non seulement la force des armes, mais d’autres armes souvent plus efficaces que celles proprement dites.
 Première arme : les dits « accords de libre-échange », comme le « Partenariat transatlantique sur le commerce et les investissements » (TTIP) avec l’UE et le « Partenariat Trans-Pacifique » (TPP) dont le but n’est pas seulement économique mais géopolitique et géostratégique. C’est pour cela qu’Hillary Clinton qualifie le partenariat USA-UE de « plus grand objectif stratégique de notre alliance transatlantique », en projetant une « Otan économique » qui intègre celle politique et militaire. Le projet est clair : former un bloc politique, économique et militaire USA-UE, toujours sous commandement états-unien, qui s’oppose à l’aire eurasiatique en ascension, basée sur la coopération entre la Chine et la Russie ; qui s’oppose aux Brics, à l’Iran et à tout autre pays qui se soustraie à la domination de l’Occident. Comme les négociations sur le TTIP ont du mal à avancer à cause de divergences d’intérêt et d’une vaste opposition en Europe, l’obstacle est pour le moment contourné avec l’ « Accord économique et commercial global » (CETA) entre le Canada et l’UE : un TTIP camouflé étant donné que le Canada fait partie du NAFTA avec les USA. Le CETA sera probablement signé par l’UE le 27 octobre prochain, pendant la visite du Premier ministre canadien Trudeau à Bruxelles.
 Seconde arme : la pénétration dans les pays cible pour les désagréger de l’intérieur. En s’appuyant sur les points faibles qu’a tout pays en mesure diverse : la corruption, l’avidité d’argent, l’arrivisme politique, le sécessionnisme fomenté par des groupes de pouvoir locaux, le fanatisme religieux, la vulnérabilité de vastes masses à la démagogie politique. En s’appuyant aussi, dans certains cas, sur un mécontentement populaire justifié quant à la conduite de leur gouvernement. Instruments de la pénétration : les soi-disant « organisations non gouvernementales » qui sont en réalité la main longue du département d’État et de la CIA. Celles qui, dotées d’énormes moyens financiers, ont organisé les « révolutions colorées » dans l’Est européen, et ont tenté la même opération avec la soi-disant « Umbrella Revolution » à Hong Kong : qui visait à fomenter des mouvements analogues dans d’autres zones de la Chine habitées par des minorités nationales. Les mêmes organisations qui opèrent en Amérique Latine, avec l’objectif premier de subvertir les institutions démocratiques du Brésil, en minant ainsi les Brics de l’intérieur. Instruments de la même stratégie : les groupes terroristes, type ceux armés et infiltrés en Libye et en Syrie pour semer le chaos, en contribuant à la démolition d’États entiers attaqués en même temps de l’extérieur.
 Troisième arme : les « Psyops » (Opérations psychologiques), lancées à travers les chaînes médiatiques mondiales, qui sont définies ainsi par le Pentagone : « Opérations planifiées pour influencer à travers des informations déterminées les émotions et motivations et donc le comportement de l’opinion publique, d’organisations et de gouvernements étrangers, afin d’induire ou renforcer des attitudes favorables aux objectifs préfixés ». Avec ces opérations, qui préparent l’opinion publique à l’escalade guerrière, on fait apparaître la Russie comme responsable des tensions en Europe et la Chine comme responsable des tensions en Asie, en les accusant en même temps de « violation des droits humains ».
Manlio Dinucci, et son épouse, Carla, devant la maison natale de Mao Tsé Toung, en 1965. Une dernière considération : ayant travaillé à Pékin avec ma femme dans les années Soixante, contribuant l’un et l’autre à la publication de la première revue chinoise en langue italienne, j’ai vécu une expérience formatrice fondamentale au moment où la Chine —libérée depuis à peine quinze ans de la condition coloniale, semi-coloniale et semi-féodale— était complètement isolée et non reconnue par l’Occident ni par les Nations Unies comme État souverain. De cette période restent imprimées en moi la capacité de résistance et la conscience de ce peuple, à l’époque 600 millions de personnes, engagé sous la conduite du Parti communiste à construire une société sur des bases économiques et culturelles complètement nouvelles. Je pense que cette capacité est également nécessaire aujourd’hui pour que la Chine contemporaine, qui est en train de développer ses énormes potentialités, puisse résister aux nouveaux plans de domination impériale, en contribuant à la lutte décisive pour l’avenir de l’humanité : la lutte pour un monde sans plus de guerres dans lequel triomphe la paix indissolublement liée à la justice sociale.

884,The MSM's twisted war language: Our 'sieges' and theirs,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:12 UTC © Alice Martins/The Washington Posy View of a heavily damaged neighborhood in Kobane, Syria, which had been targetted by a series of US-led coalition airstrikes. The hypocritical Western heart beats for all except those the US Empire drowns in blood . [1] ""In Syria almost everybody is under siege to a greater or lesser degree,"" observes the Independent's Patrick Cockburn. [2] Most people, however, think the only siege in Syria is the one imposed on (East) Aleppo by Syrian and Russian forces. But siege as a form of warfare is hardly uniquely embraced by the Syrian Arab Army and Russian military. On the contrary, the United States and its allies have been practicing siege warfare in the Levant and beyond for years, and continue to do so. It's just that US-led siege warfare has been concealed behind anodyne, even heroic, labels , while the siege warfare of countries Washington is hostile to, is abominated by Western state officials crying crocodile tears. Here's how the deception works: Sieges of cities controlled by Islamic State, carried out by US forces and their allies, are called rescue operations, or campaigns to liberate or retake cities—never sieges. Other sieges— the ones carried out by Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria , Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly Al Nusra, which, herein, I'll call Al Qaeda for convenience— are ignored altogether (which might suggest something about the relationship of Al Qaeda's Syria affiliate to the United States.) And a particularly injurious form of siege— economic sanctions — is presented as a separate category altogether and not siege warfare at all. But sanctions, imposed by rich countries , such as the United States and those of the European Union, on poor countries, such as Syria, are a modern form of siege, and have been called sanctions of mass destruction, in recognition of their devastating character. In the Levant, the sieges which are identified as such by Western state officials , and in train, by the Western mass media, are sieges of cities controlled by Al Qaeda, carried out by Syrian forces and their allies. These sieges —which cause hunger, kill civilians, and destroy buildings— are denounced in the West as ferocious attacks on innocents which amount to war crimes. ""Russia's bombardment backing the siege of Aleppo by Syrian government forces,"" notes the Wall Street Journal , ""has created a humanitarian crisis."" [3] A UN Security Council resolution—vetoed by Russia—has called for an end to Russian bombing of Aleppo. British foreign minister Boris Johnson has mused openly about war crimes indictments against Syria and Russia. Yet US campaigns to drive Islamic State out of Manbij, Kobani, Ramadi, Fallujah, Baiji and Tikrit, and now Mosul, have also caused hunger, killed civilians, and destroyed buildings. Unlike the Syrian military's siege of East Aleppo, these campaigns have been celebrated as great and necessary military victories, but have, themselves, created vast humanitarian crises. Cockburn observes that the ""recapture"" of ""cities like Ramadi, Fallujah, Baiji and Tikrit...would scarcely have happened without the coalition air umbrella overhead."" [4] That is, the cities liberated by Iraqi forces and their US patron were bombed into submission, even though civilians were trapped inside. Iraqi ground forces only moved in after these cities were left in ruins by coalition airstrikes and Iraqi artillery bombardment, as mopping up forces. © Ali al-Mashhadani, Reuters Market in Ramadi destroyed by US coalition airstrikes Rania Khalek, writing in the Intercept , points out that ""U.S.-backed ground forces laid siege to Manbij, a city in northern Syria not far from Aleppo that is home to tens of thousands of civilians. U.S. airstrikes pounded the city over the summer, killing up to 125 civilians in a single attack. The U.S. replicated this strategy to drive ISIS out of Kobane, Ramadi, and Fallujah, leaving behind flattened neighborhoods."" [5] To recover Ramadi from Islamic State, Iraqi forces surrounded and cordoned off the city. [6] In addition, the US led coalition bombarded Ramadi with airstrikes and artillery fire. [7] The bombardment left 70 percent of Ramadi's buildings in ruins. The city was recovered, but ""the great majority of its 400,000 people"" were left homeless. [8] Iraqi forces also besieged the city of Fallujah, preventing most food, medicine and fuel from entering it. [9] Militias ""prevented civilians from leaving Islamic State territory while resisting calls to allow humanitarian aid to reach the city."" [10] This was done ""to strangle Islamic State"" [11] with the result that civilians were also ""strangled."" Inside the city, tens of thousands endured famine and sickness due to lack of medicine. [12] Civilians reportedly survived on grass and plants. [13] Many civilians ""died under buildings that collapsed under"" artillery bombardment and coalition air strikes. [14] © US Defense Department The US-led coalition has been bombarding Mosul for months. The current campaign to recover Mosul is based on the same siege strategy US forces and their Iraqi client used to liberate Ramadi and Fallujah. US and allied warplanes have been bombarding the city for months. [15] Iraqi forces, aided by US Special Forces, are moving to cordon it off. ""Some aid groups estimate that as many as a million people could be displaced by fighting to recapture the city, creating a daunting humanitarian task that the United Nations and other organizations say they are not yet ready to deal with."" [16] Writer and journalist Jonathan Cook commented on the utter hypocrisy of Westerners who condemn the Syrian/Russian campaign to liberate East Aleppo from Islamist fighters while celebrating the Iraqi/US campaign to do the same in Mosul. Targeting the British newspaper, the Guardian , beloved by progressives, Cook contrasted two reports which appeared in the newspaper to illustrate the Western heart beating for all except those the US Empire drowns in blood. Report one: The Guardian provides supportive coverage of the beginning of a full-throttle assault by Iraqi forces, backed by the US and UK, on Mosul to win it back from the jihadists of ISIS - an assault that will inevitably lead to massive casualties and humanitarian suffering among the civilian population. Report two: The Guardian provides supportive coverage of the US and UK for considering increased sanctions against Syria and Russia. On what grounds? Because Syrian forces, backed by Russia, have been waging a full-throttle assault on Aleppo to win it back from the jihadists of ISIS and Al-Qaeda - an assault that has led to massive casualties and humanitarian suffering among the civilian population. [17] Aleppo’s rebels, members of the Al Qaeda derived Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. Central to Western propaganda is the elision of the Islamist character of the Al Qaeda militants who tyrannize East Aleppo. This is accomplished by labeling them ""rebels,"" while the ""rebels"" who tyrannize the cities the United States and its allies besiege are called ""Islamic State,"" ISIL"" or ""ISIS"" fighters. The aim is to conjure the impression that US-led sieges are directed at Islamic terrorists, and therefore are justifiable , despite the humanitarian crises they precipitate, while the Syrian-led campaign in East Aleppo is directed at rebels, presumably moderates, or secular democrats, and therefore is illegitimate. This is part of a broader US propaganda campaign to create two classes of Islamist militants—good Islamists, and bad ones. The first class, the good Islamists , comprises Al Qaeda and fighters cooperating with it, including US-backed groups, whose operations are limited to fighting secularists in Damascus, and therefore are useful to the US foreign policy goal of overthrowing Syria's Arab nationalist government. These Islamist fighters are sanitized as ""rebels."" The second class, the bad Islamists , comprises Islamic State. Islamic State has a mbitions which make it far less acceptable to Washington as an instrument to be used in pursuit of US foreign policy goals. The organization's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, aspires to lead a caliphate which effaces the Sykes-Picot borders, and is therefore a threat, not only to the Arab nationalists in Damascus—an enemy the organization shares in common with Washington— but also to the US client states of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, which Islamic State attacks. The US objective in connection with Islamic State is to push the organization out of Iraq (and out of areas in Syria that can be brought under the control of US-backed fighters) and into the remainder of Syria, where they can wear down Arab nationalist forces. Syria's ""moderates""—the ""rebels""—if there are any in the sense of secular pro-democrats, are few in number. Certainly, their ranks are so limited that arming them, in the view of US president Barack Obama, would make little difference. The US president told New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman that his administration had ""difficulty finding, training and arming a sufficient cadre of secular Syrian rebels: 'There's not as much capacity as you would hope,'"" Obama confessed. [18] Obama's assessment was underscored when ""a US general admitted that it had just four such 'moderate' fighters in Syria after spending $500 million on training them."" [19] Veteran Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk dismissed the idea of the ""moderates"" as little more than a fantasy. ""I doubt if there are 700 active 'moderate' foot soldiers in Syria,"" he wrote. And ""I am being very generous, for the figure may be nearer 70."" [20] Elizabeth O'Bagy, who has made numerous trips to Syria to interview insurgent commanders for the Institute for the Study of War, told the New York Times' Ben Hubbard that my ""sense is that there are no seculars."" [21] Anti-government fighters interviewed by the Wall Street Journal found the Western concept of the secular Syrian rebel to be incomprehensible. [22] To be clear: Syrian and Russian forces are waging a campaign to liberate East Aleppo from Islamists, whose only difference from Islamic State is that they're not a threat to the US client states, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. It's ""primarily al-Nusra who holds Aleppo,"" US Department of Defense spokesperson Colonel Steve Warren said on April 25, referring to Al Qaeda. [23] Other militant Islamist organizations, including US-backed groups, are also in Aleppo, intertwined with, embedded with, sharing weapons with, cooperating with, and acting as auxiliaries of Al-Qaeda. Author and journalist Stephen Kinzer, writing in the Boston Globe , reminds us that: For three years, violent militants have run Aleppo. Their rule began with a wave of repression. They posted notices warning residents: ""Don't send your children to school. If you do, we will get the backpack and you will get the coffin."" Then they destroyed factories, hoping that unemployed workers would have no recourse other than to become fighters. They trucked looted machinery to Turkey and sold it. [24] The Invisible Sieges While sieges imposed by US-led forces are hidden by not calling them sieges, sieges imposed by Washington's Al-Qaeda ally are simply ignored. ""Only three years ago,"" notes Fisk, the same Islamist fighters who are under siege today in East Aleppo, ""were besieging the surrounded Syrian army western enclave of Aleppo and firing shells and mortars into the sector where hundreds of thousands of civilians lived under regime control."" [25] Fisk observes acidly that the ""first siege didn't elicit many tears from the satellite channel lads and lassies"" while the ""second siege comes with oceans of tears."" [26] © Delil Souleiman/Agence France Presse Wreckage of Manbij in the wake of US coalition airstrikes, June 23, 2016 To the ignored Al Qaeda-orchestrated siege of West Aleppo can be added ""the untold story of the three-and-a-half-year siege of two small Shia Muslim villages in northern Syria,"" Nubl and Zahra. Those sieges, carried out by Al-Qaeda against villages which remained loyal to Syria's Arab nationalist government, left at least 500 civilians dead, 100 of them children, through famine and artillery bombardment. [27] The ""world paid no heed to the suffering of these people,"" preferring to remain ""largely fixed on those civilians suffering under siege by (Syrian) government forces elsewhere."" [28] And then there's the largely untold story of the 13 year-long siege imposed on a whole country, Syria, by the United States and European Union . That siege, initiated by Washington in 2003, with the Syria Accountability Act, and then followed by EU sanctions, blocks Western exports of almost all products to Syria and isolates the country financially. This massive, wide-scale siege plunged Syria's economy into crisis even before the 2011 eruption of upheavals in the Arab world [29]—demonstrating that Washington's efforts to force Syrian president Bashar al-Assad to step down began long before the Arab Spring. The roots of US hostility to Assad's government are found in the danger of its becoming ""a focus of Arab nationalistic struggle against an American regional presence and interests"" [30] - another way of saying that the Arab nationalist goals of unity, independence and socialism, which guide the Syrian state, are an anathema to the US demand—expressed in the 2015 US National Security Strategy—that all countries fall in behind US global ""leadership."" Under US siege warfare, unemployment shot up, factories closed, food prices skyrocketed and fuel prices doubled. [31] ""Syrian officials"" were forced ""to stop providing education, health care and other essential services in some parts of the country."" [32] Indeed, so comprehensive was the siege, that by 2011 US ""officials acknowledged that the country was already under so many sanctions that the United States held little leverage."" [33] Western siege warfare on Syria has blocked ""access to blood safety equipment, medicines, medical devices, food, fuel, water pumps, spare parts for power plants, and more,"" [34] leading Patrick Cockburn to compare the regime change campaign to ""UN sanctions on Iraq between 1990 and 2003."" [35] The siege of Iraq—at a time when the country was led by secular Arab nationalists who troubled Washington as much, if not more, than the secular Arab nationalists in Syria vex Washington today—led to the deaths, though disease and hunger, of 500,000 children, according to the United Nations. Political scientists John Meuller and Karl Meuller called the siege a campaign of economic warfare amounting to ""sanctions of mass destruction,"" more devastating than all the weapons of mass destruction used in history. [36] When the West's siege warfare on Arab nationalist Iraq ended in 2003 it was immediately resumed on Arab nationalist Syria, with the same devastating consequences. According to a leaked UN internal report, the ""US and EU economic sanctions on Syria are causing huge suffering among ordinary Syrians and preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid."" [37] Cockburn notes that ""Aid agencies cited in the report say they cannot procure basic medicines or medical equipment for hospitals because sanctions are preventing foreign commercial companies and banks having anything to do with Syria."" [38] ""In effect"" concludes the veteran British journalists, "" the US and EU sanctions are imposing an economic siege on Syria as a whole which may be killing more Syrians than die of illness and malnutrition in the sieges which EU and US leaders have described as war crimes.""

885,Open Borders Groups Gird for H-1B Fights,"The open borders lobby is bracing for a fight with President Donald Trump’s administration over the   foreign guest worker program, which opponents say is discriminatory against American workers. [In a piece by the Hindustan Times, a newspaper based out of India, open border proponents with the Indian group “Immigration Voice” are decrying the Trump Administration’s expected effort to not defend an   rule that allows   foreign guest workers’ spouses to also work in the U. S.  Sudarshana Sengupta, who is specifically cited by Immigration Voice, is currently in the U. S. on an   visa, which is given to spouses of   workers as they await green cards. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime opponent of massive foreign guest worker programs, did not immediately defend the open borders lobby in a Washington court case, Immigration Voice denounced the move. The Washington court case was filed by Save Jobs USA, an organization comprised of IT workers who have been fired from their jobs after being replaced by cheaper, foreign workers under the   program. “The recent statements from the government present an unacceptable risk for Immigration Voice members that the department of justice might decide after 60 days to adopt the position of Save Jobs USA,”   of Immigration Voice Aman Kapoor wrote in a statement. Immigration hawks at NumbersUSA say the open borders lobby appears to be opposing every position the Trump Administration holds on immigration. “I think that the advocacy groups are going to scream and yell about any single thing that anyone proposes that is not open borders,” NumbersUSA Government Affairs Director Rosemary Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “They’ve decided that it’s in their interest to fight everything Trump wants to do. ” Jenks said the “coalition” between the business community, who wants continued cheap, foreign labor, and the Hispanic advocacy groups, who want to see higher levels of illegal and legal immigration, will continue as a united front in order to give the illusion that they care about workers and business. “The business community doesn’t really have much stake in chain migration issues,” Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “And the advocacy groups like La Raza don’t have a lot of stake in the foreign guest worker issues. They’re going to look like they’re defending the interest of business in order to keep that coalition going. ” Trump and Sessions’ positions on foreign guest worker programs remains highly popular with the American public, as only 30 percent of Americans said in a recent poll that the   visa was necessary, Breitbart Texas reported. The vast majority of Americans also said the number of   visas allotted every year to companies should either be kept on level or decreased. Only 23 percent of Americans said the number of   visas given out should be raised. John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.",0
886,Report: Things Finally As Bad As Trump Claims - The Onion - America's Finest News Source,"Report: Things Finally As Bad As Trump Claims Close Vol 52 Issue 44 · Politics · Politicians · Election 2016 · Donald Trump 
WASHINGTON—Following Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the general election early Wednesday morning, political experts confirmed that conditions in the United States are now finally as bad as the Republican nominee has long claimed. “Though we had previously been able to dismiss Trump’s proclamations as mere hyperbole and scare tactics, the United States now definitively meets the criteria of being the declining superpower that Trump has described for the past 17 months,” said Georgetown University political science professor Ronald Leidecker, adding that, as of tonight, the nation no longer commands the same respect among world powers it once did, and our country’s greatest days most definitely lie in its past, just as the Republican has asserted. “Our economy is, since about 10 p.m yesterday, on the verge of collapse, and when it comes to foreign relations, we have foolishly made ourselves vulnerable on multiple fronts, putting the very existence of everything our nation holds dear at risk. In the words of Donald Trump, our country is a disaster.” Once again echoing the pronouncements of president-elect Trump, Leidecker noted that we sadly won’t be able to rely on Washington to change anything, as our political system is largely run by self-serving, power-hungry factionalists who don’t have the best interests of common Americans at heart.

887,‘Trump Unveiled’ Reveals the Big Con of Donald Trump’s Presidential Run,"‘Trump Unveiled’ Reveals the Big Con of Donald Trump’s Presidential Run Posted on Nov 1, 2016 
By John K. Wilson ( OR Books ) 
Editor’s note: The following is an excerpt from “Trump Unveiled: Exposing the Bigoted Billionaire,” by John K. Wilson. “Trump Unveiled” is published by OR Books. Click here for details. 
With his casino background, Trump is an expert at attracting gamblers, people who are willing to throw the dice with the irrational hope it will make their lives better. Trump understands how to recruit gamblers—by evoking hope and concealing facts. A casino doesn’t tell you that you’re likely to lose; a casino tells you that anything can happen, and you might just win, and what the hell, you’ll have some fun along the way. That’s the appeal of Trump’s campaign: take a chance on me, and I’ll give you everything. 
In fact, Trump literally promised “everything” to his followers. Trump promised workers in Michigan, “I’ll get you a new job; don’t worry about it.” If the cost of supporting Trump is so small (a mere vote) and the potential economic benefits are so great (a new job, economic prosperity, and global dominance), why not go for Trump? Trump is the cheapest lottery ticket you’ll ever buy. And even if the odds that he’ll keep his word are very small, why not take a gamble on Trump? 
This explains why Trump is so committed to denouncing America. He claims (despite all the evidence to the contrary) that the economy is a disaster, that the unemployment rate is really 42 percent, that everything is terrible, and that only he can make America great again. If you’re trying to recruit a gambler, you need to make them feel like normal life is boring and miserable. Trump tells America that their lives are horrible, and even though it’s factually not true for the overwhelming majority, they begin to wonder if he might be right. Everyone can imagine being richer and happier, and that’s precisely the core appeal of gambling. 
As Trump the real estate developer put it: “I play to people’s fantasies. ... The more unattainable the apartments seemed, the more people wanted them.” Trump is applying the same principles to politics: Trump is presenting a fantasy of what people want from a president, and the more unattainable and unrealistic his promises are, the more people will want him even if they know they are being irrational. 
Trump’s own lavish lifestyle serves his message. Trump loves to have rallies at airport hangers; it’s not just the convenience of flying in and out quickly. The true appeal of it to Trump is that it reminds his audience how incredibly wealthy he is: he has a giant plane with his name on it. Trump is telling supporters, I’ve got a plane. Do you? Vote for me, and who knows, maybe you will. Might Trump’s ostentatious display of extreme wealth turn off potential voters who are angry at financial inequality and the rigged system that favors the rich? The opposite is true: Trump is telling them the system is rigged and they’re right to be angry at the rich, but Trump is the only one who can offer the salvation of getting rich yourself. Trump University was another form of shafting suckers gambling on Trump. Give Trump thousands of dollars to learn his secrets, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll get really rich, too. 
Trump also understands that the best way to bring people to a casino is with a distraction, and the best kind of distraction is a fight. A big boxing match attracts crowds who stick around to toss some coin at the casino. And so Trump is always provoking fights: with his opponents, with protesters, with the media, with Twitter critics, with anyone and everyone who irritates him. Distraction is essential to any casino. You want bright lights and noisy machines, free drinks and sexy waitresses. You want fancy palaces with shimmering chandeliers. You want the customer paying attention to everything except the fact that it’s all a giant, flashy scam. As the slogan of the Trump Taj Mahal says, “Excitement Returns.” Distractions make people more willing to gamble. In an environment of calm analysis, rational thinking tends to prevail. 
Trump explained his approach to The Apprentice: “I rant and rave like a lunatic and the crazier I am, the higher the ratings.” This is also Trump’s approach to his presidential campaign, because it is his way of life. 
Casinos are a legal con. The gamblers always lose, collectively, and everyone knows that. But individuals can sometimes win. The key for any casino is to convince gamblers to imagine that they will be the exception to the odds. They don’t even have to believe something so irrational is likely, they just have to hope. 
Trump is gambling on the idea that he can convince the voters that the world they live in is a rigged game. They keep trying to play fair, and they get screwed. Trump is promising to play this rigged game, but says he will rig it on behalf of America. Nobody thinks Trump is an honest person; but the more he lies, the more his supporters can imagine that he’s going to lie for us. He’s going to be a lying son of a bitch, but he will be our lying son of a bitch. He’s a con man working for us to take the rest of the world’s money after they stole it from us. 
The trick of Trump’s con is that he implicitly admits to being a con man. Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal, could easily have been titled The Art of the Con. The book is full of examples of how Trump misleads (“truthful hyperbole”) and manipulates people to take advantage of them. Trump has bragged, “I’ve taken advantage of the banks probably more than any other human being on earth.” To Trump, conning people is a credential. 
As a con artist, Trump believes in nothing but himself. Only a con artist could propose the largest tax increase on the wealthy in human history just a few years ago and now propose the largest tax cut on the wealthy in human history while simultaneously claiming that he’s going to make the rich pay more. Trump will say anything to get elected. 
Trump has only a few consistent positions he has held for decades. Because Trump is a con artist, he will never believe in free trade. The concept of mutually beneficial agreements is alien to him; someone is always taking advantage of someone else in Trump’s world. You’re either the con artist or the victim. 
The fact that Trump is a con artist does not mean he is plotting as president to steal a trillion dollars and run off to a remote island. Trump, after all, is a narcissist who dreams of being president and imagines himself the greatest leader in history. But Trump can never escape his con artist instincts. He is unable to change, and incapable of self-criticism. He will govern as a con artist, as someone who deceives and manipulates and seeks to control everything around him. As a con artist, Trump imagines that everyone is organizing a con as well, which leads to his conspiratorial thinking. Only the naïve fail to understand they’re the victim of a con. 
Casting a vote is as easy as buying a lottery ticket, and it’s free, too. Why not take a chance that Trump can deliver what he says, even if you know he can’t? The odds are against you, but hope matters more than probabilities. As the Powerball ad slogan says, “anything’s possible.” 
Trump once said, “My life is like a game of poker.” As a gambler, Trump knows how to take risks with other people’s money. But he shows a dangerous tendency to follow instinct rather than reason. The only hope for Trump to emerge victorious is if he can convince the American people to be the same kind of gambler he has been. 
Donald Trump is a pathological liar, a sexist pig, a hateful racist, a corrupt businessman, a pandering populist, a conspiracy nut, and a vicious bully. Trump’s cynical narcissism explains why he wants to be president, but his political success reflects much deeper problems in America: the inequality of wealth that makes a man like Trump so powerful, the celebrity-obsessed media that gave Trump an uncritical platform for his ideas, and the failure of our political system to address America’s flaws, which has allowed a bigoted demagogue to seize control of the Republican Party.",0
888,Will WeinerGate Expose Darker and Dirtier Secrets Than We Imagined?,"
Another day, another scandal…but this one might turn out to be the most damaging so far.
On October 28, FBI director James Comey informed the Senate Judiciary Committee via letter that the agency would be re-opening its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
Comey wrote:
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation … I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.
Later that day, The New York Times provided an intriguing update:
Emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server were found after the F.B.I. seized electronic devices once shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, federal law enforcement officials said Friday.
The F.B.I. is investigating illicit text messages that Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The bureau told Congress on Friday that it had uncovered new emails related to the Clinton case — one federal official said they numbered in the thousands — potentially reigniting an issue that has weighed on the presidential campaign and offering a lifeline to Donald J. Trump less than two weeks before the election.
Now, Weiner is reportedly cooperating with the FBI…and gave them a laptop that he shared with his estranged wife…which means no warrant is necessary to search that particular device.
Is it possible that he will get some sort of deal based on an agreement to testify?
One can’t help but wonder what the FBI is going to find on that laptop. There are a reported 650,000 emails to scour through. It will take weeks – possibly longer – to sort through them, and the election is just days away.
There’s a particularly disturbing rumor circulating about the emails…
Rumors stirring in the NYPD that Huma's emails point to a pedophila ring and @HillaryClinton is at the center. #GoHillary #PodestaEmails23 pic.twitter.com/gkEH5oL269 
— David Goldberg (@DavidGoldbergNY) October 30, 2016 

I would not report this unless I was 100% sure – known this source 15+ years
— Greg Hilliard (@UnityActivist) October 31, 2016 

Now, to clarify again – this IS just a rumor – unsubstantiated as of now. 
And it sounds preposterous…until you consider that child sex rings among the powerful elite have been reported for years. Bill Clinton has been linked with a convicted billionaire pedophile named Jeffrey Epstein , who pimped out underage girls to powerful men. Flight logs show that Clinton was a frequent flyer on the registered sex offender’s infamous jet.
In May, Fox News reported :
…flight logs showing the former president taking at least 26 trips aboard the “Lolita Express” — even apparently ditching his Secret Service detail for at least five of the flights, according to records obtained by FoxNews.com.
…trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.
Conchita Sarnoff of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking and author of a book on the Epstein case told Fox:
Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile. Why would a former president associate with a man like that?
Also from Fox:
Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Why didn’t Epstein face harsher punishment?
Remember, he’s a billionaire with friends in high places.
More shocking details from Fox:
The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prepared charging documents that accused Epstein of child sex abuse, witness tampering and money laundering, but Epstein took a plea deal before an indictment could be handed up.
On Sept. 24, 2007, in a deal shrouded in secrecy that left alleged victims shocked at its leniency, Epstein agreed to a 30-month sentence, including 18 months of jail time and 12 months of house arrest and the agreement to pay dozens of young girls under a federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child sexual abuse.
In exchange, the U.S. Attorney’s Office promised not to pursue any federal charges against Epstein or his co-conspirators.
Florida attorney Brad Edwards, who represented some of Epstein’s alleged victims, is suing the federal government over the secret non-prosecution agreement in hopes of having it overturned. Edwards claimed in court records that the government and Epstein concealed the deal from the victims “to prevent them from voicing any objection, and to avoid the firestorm of controversy that would have arisen if it had become known that the Government was immunizing a politically-connected billionaire and all of his co-conspirators from prosecution of hundreds of federal sex crimes against minor girls.”
Oh, but there’s more . According to the pilots’ logbooks, which surfaced in civil litigation surrounding Epstein’s crimes, this happened in 2002…
…Clinton, his aide Doug Band, and Clinton’s Secret Service detail are listed on a flight from Japan to Hong Kong with Epstein, Maxwell, Kellen, and two women described only as “Janice” and “Jessica.” One month later, records show, Clinton hopped a ride from Miami to Westchester on a flight that also included Epstein, Maxwell, Kellen, and a woman described only as “one female.”
Why hasn’t Donald Trump added Bill’s Epstein ties to his arsenal against Hillary? He’s brought up the women who have accused Bill of sexual assault and rape.
Why would he leave out Epstein?
Probably because Trump also knows Epstein – very well, actually – as reported in a 2002 New York magazine profile titled Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery :
Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
Trump’s name and contact information is in Epstein’s black book – but so are the names and contact information for MANY other prominent and influential people, including Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia, Tony Blair, former Utah governor and Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, Senator Edward Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, David Koch and Pepe Fanjul, according to a report by Vice .
In 2010 , Epstein pled the Fifth when asked by a lawyer representing one of Epstein’s victims about his relationship with Trump:
Q: Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?
A. What do you mean by “personal relationship,” sir?
Q. Have you socialized with him?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Yes?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?
A: Though I’d like to answer that question, at least today I’m going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.
Both Trump and Epstein are named in a lawsuit for the rape of a 13-year old girl who is using the name Katie Johnson that allegedly occurred at a “sex party” way back in 1994, but the veracity of the case has yet to be determined. Judge Ronnie Abrams has scheduled an initial status conference in the civil lawsuit for December 16 in a New York district court.
Trump has vociferously denied the accusations. Epstein, an associate of the UK’s Prince Andrew who was convicted of underage sex crimes in Florida in 2008, has also denied the allegations. A lawyer for the Trump Organization told the Guardian in July: “This is basically a sham lawsuit brought by someone who desires to impact the presidential election.”
Edwards, who has represented Epstein victims, spoke with Johnson and declined to take her case, as The Daily Beast reported:
Concerning Trump’s involvement in Epstein’s illicit affairs, Edwards said he hadn’t seen any evidence that would implicate the GOP nominee and described Trump as “extremely helpful and honest,” during questioning.
In 2014 , another young woman filed a lawsuit claiming that Epstein used her as a sex slave for his powerful friends—and that she’d been at parties on his private island with Bill Clinton.
Epstein also reportedly donated money to the Clinton Foundation – even after he was convicted.

Back in July, a 4chan user by the name of FBI Anon shared some inside information, which was then posted on Reddit .
When asked if Hillary sold weapons and favors from the State Department for cash to our enemies, FBI Anon replied : “Weapons, favors, intelligence, and people.” 
When asked what the Clinton Foundation does, FBI Anon replied: “Sold intel, favors, and people to anyone willing to pay.” 
Regarding a possible Hillary indictment, FBI Anon said , “There is enough for her and the entire government to be brought down. People do not realize how enormous this whole situation actually is. Whether she will be or not depends on how much info about others involved gets out, and there are a lot of people involved.” 
More quotes from FBI Anon:
“The real point of interest is the Clinton Foundation, not the email server. We received the server from Benghazi, then from the server we found data on the CF. Then we realized the situation is much worse than previously thought.” 
“The DOJ is most likely looking to save itself. Find everyone involved in the Clinton Foundation, from its donors to its Board of Directors, and imagine they are all implicated.” 
(Could this be why the DOJ tried to stop the investigation into the Clinton Foundation?)
“My message to you and everyone on this board is do not get distracted by Clinton’s emails. Focus on the Foundation. All the nightmarish truth is there. The emails will pale in comparison.” 
More, from page 2 :
When asked if the people leading the investigation are blackmailed pedophiles: “No. The people under the magnifying glass do have an affinity for children.” 
When asked what would happen if all of the information regarding the Clinton Foundation was released to the public: “Total chaos. The government would be exposed at every layer, who pays who, who buys what, and no one has yet asked about the human trafficking bits I have been laying out.” 
When asked if members of Congress own strip clubs and have their own sex slaves?: “Epstein.” 
“Pedophiles and sex traffickers everywhere. Many politicians trade girls like cattle.” 
“BC (Bill Clinton) is a confirmed pedo.” 
“Sex rings are popular in all governments, but pedophilia is primarily in British parliament & Saudi Arabia, and that’s why HRC and BC love foreign donors so much. They get paid in children as well as money. Dig deep and you can find it. It will sicken you.” 
Of course, all of this could be fabricated by a person pretending to have inside information. We may never know the truth. But if these claims are true, they are deeply disturbing.

In August 2015, Trump made an interesting prediction…
It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary’s private illegal emails. Huma’s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 3, 2015 

What will the emails (and perhaps other information) on Weiner’s devices reveal?
Will it be more revelations regarding play-for pay schemes, election rigging, or email-scrubbing?
Or will something more sinister be uncovered?
Hillary has called for the FBI to release details about the latest probe to the public “Immediately.”
Could that be because she knows they WON’T publicize the information if it would bring down MANY of her government colleagues and cause mass chaos and disruption?
Time will tell.
It would be something, though – wouldn’t it – if both Clintons were brought down by misbehaving weiners?
Oh, and speaking of perverted folks…
Two days ago, during an interview with Michael Smerconish of CNN, Creepy Uncle Joe Biden learned, on live TV, that the new emails being reviewed by the FBI are related to the investigation of Anthony Weiner. Watch his response.

889,Wallonia caves in? Belgium reaches secret EU-Canada trade deal compromise,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:45 UTC © Yves Herman / Reuters The Belgian government has reached a deal with the Wallonia region on the free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada, according to Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. Michel said ""an agreement"" was found after a last minute round of negotiations with Belgium's French-speaking community who have been holding up the deal. Brussels has not released the details of the compromise. The signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) was cancelled on Thursday after the deal was blocked by Wallonia's regional parliament. Comment: Belgium's Wallonia region defying EU Junker's CETA trade deal Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was forced to cancel Thursday's trip to Brussels as the negotiations had stalled. Wallonia premier Paul Magnette said the region was not opposed to an EU trade deal with Canada. However, he insisted the secret arbitration scheme allowing corporations to sue governments had to be dropped from the agreement. Regional leaders in Wallonia voted 46 to 16 against CETA over fears of job losses due to cheaper farming and industrial imports. CETA promises to eliminate tariffs on 98 percent of goods immediately after ratification and also encompasses regulatory cooperation, shipping, sustainable development and access to government tenders. CETA's supporters say the deal would yield billions in added trade through customs and tariff cuts and other measures facilitating business ties. Opponents claim the trade deal will only benefit the wealthy and large corporations. For CETA to be ratified, all 28 European Union countries have to agree the treaty. Until now, Belgium has been the main obstacle to the free trade deal. ""All parliaments are now able to approve by tomorrow at midnight. Important step for EU and Canada,"" Michel tweeted.",0
890,Trump’s election breaks chains of political correctness,"Trump’s election breaks chains of political correctness By Ben Tanosborn   Ben Tanosborn 
One likely winner to come out of the 2016 US presidential election: accuracy in polling. Obviously not past but future polling! 
Donald Trump, from the start of his campaign to capture the presidency, harangued his followers during the rallies with such unrestricted language that they felt liberated, able to speak out their minds without any fear of repression or recrimination. Well, at least not in the safety and camaraderie of their rallies; although also aware that politically correct America frowned on such openness, leaving them with a bi-forked tongue when applied to people who would likely judge, or categorize them . . . and that definitely applied to pollsters. 
One suspects that as much as 10 percent of the actual Trump vote came out of what we could call correctness-hiding, making total mockery of most pollsters. As a pertinent note I might add that while a student in operations research, I had a professor (Anant Negandhi, UCLA) who then claimed that polling involving issues with sociopolitical subjectivity was for the most part worthless because of the difficulty in modeling a survey which would correctively identify and quantify both the causal and intervening variables. Over a generation later, that difficulty has not really changed; nor has the need of pollsters to make a living, which may push them to sell smoke and mirrors to a well-funded political establishment. 
My own observation in weighing the impact of Trump’s campaign on his followers, most particularly those in the construction trades, has been one where from the start of the campaign, and solidly after Trump’s winning the Republican candidacy, these people who had expressed racial and ethnic bias with some trepidation were now doing so with little angst, as if their speech now had society’s imprimatur and they had been godfathered by Donald Trump. 
After the cataclysmic misreading by a polling industry that has reverted from a science to an art . . . lagging miles behind the weather predicting science, one would expect the rigidity of science to take a critical role. So, of necessity if wishing to survive, the entire industry must undergo a true and complete overhaul. And that would be one positive result from this election: accuracy in polling. 
Now that Trump has become president-elect, to be escorted to the White House by a Republican Congress . . . and a conservative-in-waiting Supreme Court, will the specter of political correctness exit from American life? Not likely; but rest assured that there will be a great degree of accommodation for the 26 percent of American bigoted patriots (bigopats). [Read my article of June 16, 2016: Bigopats: ‘ Undocumented’ Largest Group in American Politics . ] 
To say that America is divided is a mini-characterization of incredible proportions that we, as a nation, will have incredible difficulty in overcoming . . . and perhaps never will. First, we must cope with the surreal realization that this United States of America isn’t at all represented by Kansas being a dream away from Oz. The results from this last election have told us the naked truth about our nation; a truth that most Americans would like to keep under wraps: that more than a divided country split in two or more political camps, America is really a fallen Humpty Dumpty fragmented economically, socially, and politically in a way that it will take a Herculean effort to be able to put it back together again. An effort that requires drastic change: both political and institutional. 
Once upon a united America, we insist in telling ourselves, we were the land of promise and hope; the great experiment in humankind: economic opportunity, the American dream, the mythical melting pot, freedom, dignity and self-realization. But we seem to forget, that it was the economic wellbeing in the America of generations past that did provide the glue that kept our multi-part Humpty Dumpty (diverse America) sitting smilingly on the wall, looking condescendingly over the rest of the world. 
Globalization has melted that glue; and economic change for that symbolic American middle class, whether coming from the Right (Trump) or the Left (Sanders), is unlikely to improve their lot. But at the end of the day, neither would have that middle path that Hillary Clinton would have walked. 
The establishment Detestables have lost the Toilet Bowl to Trump’s Deplorables . . . we either grin and bear it; or, for the lack of a better plan, get ourselves dirty fighting Trump’s Movement . . . certifiably a bowel movement in this last Toilet Bowl. Copyright © 2016 Tanosborn

892,Iran Warns President-Elect Trump Not To Mess With Their Sweetheart Nuclear Deal From Obama,"  Iran Warns President-Elect Trump Not To Mess With Their Sweetheart Nuclear Deal From Obama President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would “set fire” to the deal.   23, 2016 Extending U.S. sanctions on Iran for 10 years would breach the Iranian nuclear agreement, Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said on Wednesday, warning that Tehran would retaliate if the sanctions are approved. The U.S. House of Representatives re-authorized last week the Iran Sanctions Act , or ISA, for 10 years. The law was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran’s energy industry and deter Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. The Iran measure will expire at the end of 2016 if it is not renewed. The House bill must still be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama to become law. Iran and world powers concluded the nuclear agreement, also known as JCPOA , last year. It imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear program in return for easing sanctions that have badly hurt its economy. Obama Announces a Historic Nuclear Deal with Iran: 
So the same guy who said you could “keep your doctor” and “keep your plan” now says this deal will solve the problem. Do YOU believe him? We sure don’t. “The current U.S. government has breached the nuclear deal in many occasions,” Khamenei said, addressing a gathering of members of the Revolutionary Guards, according to his website. “The latest is extension of sanctions for 10 years, that if it happens, would surely be against JCPOA, and the Islamic Republic would definitely react to it.” The U.S. lawmakers passed the bill one week after Republican Donald Trump was elected U.S. president. Republicans in Congress unanimously opposed the agreement, along with about two dozen Democrats, and Trump has also criticized it. Obama’s deal with Iran “worst treaty since Chamberlain”: Lawmakers from both parties said they hoped bipartisan support for a tough line against Iran would continue under the new president. President-elect Trump once said during his campaign that he would “rip up” the agreement, drawing a harsh reaction from Khamenei, who said if that happens, Iran would “set fire” to the deal.

894,The Moon that Fell from Heaven,"The Moon that Fell from Heaven page: 1 link There is an intriguing text from Anatolian myth with regards to the Moon falling from Heaven; The Moon God fell from the sky and fell upon the gate complex, but no one saw him. The Storm God sent rain after him; he sent rains after him. Fear seized him; anxiety seized him. The god Hapantali went there. He stood beside him and uttered over him the words of a spell. The goddess Kamrusepa looked down from the sky and said: ""What in the world has happened here? A good question from Kamrusepa there then, but the text is fragmentary and partial and the matter isn't really explained, so anyway the first question then is were was this gate complex and why couldn't he, the Moon, be seen having landed. My consideration is that the gate complex is that of the Cilician Gates , and that the Moon can no longer be seen as he has infused the Taurus Mountains with Silver. That region did relate to the Silver Mountains as several sources mention and was a major centre for the trade in Silver at Kultepe/Kanes; The essence of the trade was to ship tin, woolen textiles and lapis lazuli to Anatolia to sell it there in order to acquire, directly or indirectly, silver and gold, which was shipped back to Assur. Tin, essential for the Anatoian production of bronze was imported in Assur from Susa, perhaps by Elamite caravans, and ultimately originated from Central Asia. Assyrian trade colony at Kanes There are a great many tablets related to this trade recovered from Kultepe, on these sometimes can be seen the Taurus bull that bears upon it's back the Silver Mountain. Also seen beneath on that example is the Scorpion which was likely also an ideogram based upon the Cilician gates and greater region, also the symbol of Ishara the Goddess of the Silver Mountain and related to concept idea of the Moon within the Underworld, her symbolic metal silver and purity through refinement, the Temple of Ishara being at Kanes or Nesi to the Hurrians. There were a great many ideas bound up within this symbolism then, including in Cosmological terms the entrance into the underworld being above Taurus in Gemini, and it's opposite point of emergence in Scorpio, according to the inter-section point of the Galactic and Ecliptic planes. Were this gets interesting is that there is a Hurrian myth that relates to a conflict in the primeval period named The Song of Silver involving their tutelary God Tessub and his ongoing issues with Kumarbi, God of Destiny; Among Tessub, the Sun God of the Sky, Sauska Nineveh's Queen, and all the gods, no one worships him, although his power is greater than their power. His word is greater than their words, his wisdom is greater than their wisdom, his battle and his g1ory are greater than theirs. It is Silver the Fine of whom I sing. Wise men to1d me the story of the fatherless boy. It did not exist. Long ago Silver's Father had disappeared. And they do not know his sp1endor. Heroic men ran to battle. Abundance did not exist. And grain did not grow only hunger The Songs of the Kumarbi cycle can contain veiled allegory regarding ethnic disputes such as i outlined here with regards to Byblos and Ebla, it is likely the same in this case, conflict with the region of Nesa and the Silver Mountains, this however relating to a much earlier period, potentially also this relates to conflict from the Heavens as Silver could be named Kubbabar-Anzu as noted here the association with Anzu in conflict with Tessub relating to the same with Ninurta in the Sumerian mythos, and that seemingly from Anatolia. The identification of Silver as DUMU also correlates with the Sumerian notion of the Divine child as Damu, often seen as the basis for the cult of Dumuzid, were it was also the case that the City of Dumuzid, Bad-Tivira, was the centre of the Sumerian metallurgy industry. Silver is described in this text as a wannumiyas DUMU, which means a child whose father is dead or missing. Hittitologists generally translate this as ""orphan,"" Silver's consternation at being told by the orphan boy that he too was an orphan need not mean that he was discovering this for the first time. The Song of Silver again is fragmentary but does seem to involve Silver at some point establishing his power; Silver seized power with his hands. Silver seized the spear. He dragged the Sun and Moon down from heaven. The Sun and the Moon did reverence. They bowed to Silver. The Sun and the Moon began to speak to Silver: O Silver, our lord, do not strike/kill us! We are the luminaries of heaven and earth. We are the torches of what lands you govern. If you strike/kill us, you will proceed to govern the dark lands person-ally."" His soul within him was filled with love.He had pity on them In dragging the Sun and the Moon down from Heaven again it could be considered that is what had infused the Mountains with Gold and Silver, but also it could relate to the establishment of the cults of Allani and Ishara at the time of silver, the spiritual qualities brought down to Earth. Hopefully in the future more complete accounts of these texts will emerge as they are most intriguing and almost completely overlooked apart from specialists in the field, which is a pity as they are more interesting than most. edit on Kam1031300vAmerica/ChicagoThursday2731 by Kantzveldt because: (no reason given)",0

896,"Assad’s Lesson From Aleppo: Force Works, With Few Consequences - The New York Times","BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   For months, the bodies have been piling up in eastern Aleppo as the buildings have come down, pulverized by Syrian and Russian jets, burying residents who could not flee in avalanches of bricks and mortar. And now it is almost over, not because diplomats reached a deal in Geneva, but because President Bashar   of Syria and his foreign allies have won the city. Cold, hungry and scarred by the deaths of loved ones, tens of thousands of civilians and fighters are awaiting buses to take them from their homes to uncertain futures. It is not the first victory that Mr. Assad has secured with overwhelming force in the Syrian conflict. But his subjugation of eastern Aleppo has echoed across the Middle East and beyond, rattling alliances, proving the effectiveness of violence and highlighting the reluctance of many countries, perhaps most notably the United States, to get involved. President Obama, on Friday at his final news conference of the year, acknowledged that the nearly    war in Syria had been among the hardest issues he has faced, and that the world was “united in horror” at the butchery in Aleppo. But Mr. Obama  —   who came into office committed to reducing America’s military entanglements in the Middle East  —   also defended his decision not to intervene more forcefully. To do otherwise, he said, would have required the United States to be “all in and willing to take over Syria. ” The recent developments in the Syrian conflict send a message to autocratic leaders in the region and elsewhere that force works  —   and brings few consequences, said Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. The lesson for the victims of that force is that they are on their own. “Everybody has been watching helplessly as this conflict unfolds,” Ms. Yahya said. “They are watching civilians being massacred mercilessly and all they can do is tweet about it and sign petitions. ” This is the Middle East that   Donald J. Trump will face upon taking office next year, a region where jihadists have erased borders, Russia is ascendant, Iran has extended its reach through powerful militias and American allies are questioning how much they can rely on Washington. Mr. Trump has articulated no comprehensive policy for the region, other than underlining his support for Israel and suggesting he could work with Russia against the Islamic State, perhaps establishing “safe zones” in Syria  —   an apparent contradiction since Russian jets have bombed civilian areas. But the fallout from Aleppo highlights the dynamics that are likely to shape the region throughout his term. Analysts have begun to add Aleppo to the list of places where humans have failed to stop tragedies committed against other humans, as in Grozny, Rwanda and Srebrenica. The comparisons are not perfect, but can be instructive. Most estimates put the death toll in the Rwandan genocide much higher than that of the entire Syrian war, although the killing in Rwanda happened much faster, giving foreign powers less time to react. The siege and bombardment of Aleppo, on the other hand, came after years of conflict in which Mr. Assad’s forces attacked protesters, dropped exploding barrels on rebellious communities and used chemical weapons on their own people. What is more, because of smartphones and the internet, the Syrian conflict has arguably been better documented than any armed conflict in history. But that has still failed to bring about accountability. “Aleppo is now the symbol of how far we have retrenched,” said David M. Crane, a veteran international war crimes prosecutor and a professor at the Syracuse University College of Law. “It is part of a worldwide move away from a global village. Countries are turning back into themselves. ” While acknowledging the current weakness of international justice, Professor Crane has been working throughout the Syrian conflict to compile evidence of possible war crimes against different parties in hopes that they will one day be held to account. “I really do believe that over time we will be able to move forward,” he said. “International justice is not going away. ” By way of example, he mentioned Charles G. Taylor, the former president of Liberia, whom Mr. Crane helped put behind bars in an international trial many years after he had committed his crimes. The Syrian conflict did not begin as a civil war but as a popular uprising aimed at ousting Mr. Assad. He responded to protests with gunfire, detentions and torture. Many in the opposition took up arms to defend themselves and fight back, drawing support from Gulf countries, Turkey, the Syrian diaspora and the United States. The conflict escalated from there, as Mr. Assad sought help from Russia and Iran. As the state receded and chaos spread, jihadist movements established themselves, attracting recruits with religious fervor and ample funding, fueling accusations by Mr. Assad that his opponents were terrorists. Over time, as the space for civil activism narrowed, that claim became increasingly true, giving Western nations another reason not to intervene. Mr. Obama denounced Mr. Assad as an illegitimate leader but kept American forces out of the battle to oust him. He argued that the United States could not resolve the conflict and that Syria was not a core American interest. Even when Mr. Assad deployed chemical weapons, crossing a “red line,” Mr. Obama did not bomb Syria, angering the opposition and allies like Saudi Arabia, who felt he had further empowered Mr. Assad. Instead, Mr. Obama made a deal with Russia to rid Syria of chemical weapons. But the war metastasized, spawning new horrors that increasingly affected the United States and its allies. The Islamic State seized territory in Syria and Iraq, declaring a caliphate and inspiring attacks from Bangladesh to San Bernardino, Calif. And the violence sent waves of refugees into Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey and let loose a flow of migrants whose arrival in Europe has undermined its unity and stability. All those shocks contributed to the environment in which the siege and battering of eastern Aleppo could take place, changing the course of the conflict. Mr. Assad’s seizure of Aleppo will leave the opposition with no control in any of Syria’s major cities, possibly signaling its end as a political force that can pressure the government to negotiate. “The Assad regime has won the strategic war,” said Hassan Hassan, a resident fellow from Syria at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy in Washington. “Psychologically, the opposition is no longer seen as a force that can break Bashar  . ” Other leaders have paid attention to how he did it. “The Assad playbook now is that you can crush your people you can destroy cities you can attack with chemical weapons you can enable extremists  —   and the international community will stand by and not do anything,” Mr. Hassan said. “That is a precedent for dictators who feel threatened by their populations. ” But Mr. Assad’s seizure of Aleppo does not mean the end of the war. Gulf states like Qatar have said they will continue to back the rebels, and many analysts predict that the movement will become a prolonged insurgency. Mr. Assad’s surprise loss of the ancient city of Palmyra last week to the Islamic State indicates that his fighters are stretched thin. Also converging in Aleppo is the region’s rising sectarian split. As the rebels have been adopted by Sunni powers such as Saudi Arabia, Mr. Assad has deepened his reliance on Shiite militias who receive support from Iran. Bolstering Mr. Assad’s troops in Aleppo were fighters from Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Shiite militiamen from Iraq and elsewhere who viewed the battle in religious terms. Many Syrians, including in   parts of Aleppo, will be happy when Mr. Assad takes back the whole city because they see him as a symbol of a unified state or because they distrust the rebels for accepting support from foreign powers. Others will just be glad the fighting has stopped. For some, the war’s greatest casualty has been the ability of Syrians to live together. Samir Altaqi, a surgeon and former member of the Syrian Parliament who now directs the Orient Research Center in Dubai, said he now avoids images of Aleppo, where he grew up and began his career. “I don’t bear to look too much at this footage because it would mean a full moral collapse, and I would become too extremist,” he said. His interactions with younger Syrians who have lived through the war have scared him, he said. “My impression is that these people have no more distance from death,” said Mr. Altaqi, who is in his  . “They are sorry to be alive because all their beloved people are dead. ” He recalled his youth in Aleppo decades ago, when his family had Jewish and Christian neighbors and a “mercantile attitude” pervaded the city. “I remember how we never asked about the religion of our neighbors and friends,” he said, even when a son or daughter brought home a potential mate. “What will happen to all of this history?” he asked.",0

Upon hearing the jury's decision, Marcus Mumford, one of Ammon Bundy's attorneys, demanded his client be released, even shouting at the judge. That prompted U.S. marshals to tackle Mumford to the ground and use a stun gun on him a number of times before arresting him, the Tribune reported.U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said she was not able to release Bundy because he faces federal charges in Nevada, his home state, related to an armed standoff with federal Bureau of Land Management agents at his father Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 .As reported by KATU , the armed standoff began Jan. 2 and lasted nearly six weeks. The incident brought new attention to the long-running issue of too much federal ownership of lands in the American West. The confrontations at the refuge earlier this year and on Cliven Bundy's ranch in 2014 essentially reignited arguments between private citizens – mostly ranchers – and the federal government that stem from the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s, when Western states like Nevada attempted to wrestle more control of their own territory from the federal government .As noted by The New York Times the federal government owns nearly half of the land – 47 percent – in the West.The Tribune noted that even the defendants' attorneys were shocked by the acquittals.""It's stunning,"" said Robert Salisbury, an attorney for defendant Jeff Banta. ""It's a stunning victory for the defense. I'm speechless.""The U.S. Attorney in Oregon , Billy J. Williams, said in a statement that his office stood by its decision to prosecute the seven defendants.""We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a Court, publicly tried, and decided by a jury,"" the statement said. 'When the jury hears the story, I expect the same result' The Oregon case was, in a sense, an extension the tense standoff between federal officials with the BLM and other authorities, and the Bundy's two years ago in Nevada. Cliven, Ammon and Ryan Bundy are all scheduled to go on trial for that standoff early next year.It's not clear what the outcome of the Nevada trial will be. Federal attorneys have said they don't feel like the outcome in Oregon will have any effect whatsoever on the Nevada trial.But defense attorneys involved in the Nevada trial aren't so sure. Daniel Hill, an attorney for Ammon Bundy , says the Oregon acquittal bodes well for his client and the other defendants, all of whom are facing felony weapon, conspiracy and other charges, the Tribune reported.""When the jury hears the whole story,"" he told The Associated Press , ""I expect the same result.""

899,Report: Google Faces Fine of up to $9 Billion in EU Antitrust Case - Breitbart,"Google could be facing a $9 billion fine from the European Union (EU) following a   investigation into the search engine. [“The EU competition authority accused Google in April 2015 of distorting internet search results to favour its shopping service, harming both rivals and consumers,” reported the Independent on Friday. “The US company has in the past rejected the charges, saying that regulators ignored competition from online retailers Amazon and eBay. ”  The Independent continued to claim in their report that “Fines for companies found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules can reach 10 per cent of their global turnover, which in Google’s case could be about $9bn of its 2016 turnover. ” “Apart from the fine, the Commission will tell Google to stop its alleged   practices but it is not clear what measures it will order the company to adopt to ensure that rivals get equal treatment in internet shopping results,” they explained. “The regulator could set out general principles or specific instructions for Google to follow, said an observer. ” Google has previously been accused of rigging and changing their search results in their favor, most notably during the 2016 U. S. Presidential Election. Autofill suggestions about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s health were censored, despite the popularity in searches, as well as other search suggestions which conveyed negative messages about Clinton, including “Crooked Hillary. ” During an investigation, users discovered that every other popular search engine featured these popular search suggestions apart from Google, who were major backers of Clinton’s campaign. Last year, WikiLeaks founder and editor Julian Assange claimed that Google was “directly engaged in Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Negative search suggestions about other candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz were not similarly censored. In September, Google was also accused of manipulating the search results for “Jihad” to promote a post from the Islamic Supreme Council defending Jihad as a “misunderstood concept,” while in April the search engine announced that they would be further manipulating results to combat “fake news” and “hate speech. ” Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

902,Gretchen Carlson Suit Aims at Retaliation Over Discrimination - The New York Times,"In the complaint that Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, filed this week against Roger Ailes, the network’s chairman, one thing stands out above all: the overtness of the sexual harassment that Ms. Carlson says she endured. “I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago and then you’d be good and better and I’d be good and better,” Mr. Ailes told her last year, according to the complaint. And yet the legal case Ms. Carlson has built is based largely on her claims of Mr. Ailes’s retaliation against her for standing up to him, not the underlying discrimination. “Definitely the primary complaint is that she has been retaliated against by rebuffing his demands, complaining about discrimination,” Nancy Erika Smith, Ms. Carlson’s lead lawyer, said in an interview. In fashioning their arguments this way, Ms. Carlson and Ms. Smith epitomize a stark trend in discrimination cases over the last decade or two: More and more workers are bringing retaliation claims, and those claims, in turn, often determine the outcome of their cases. So pronounced is this practice that proving retaliation has sometimes displaced attempts to remedy the discriminatory treatment itself, a development that concerns some legal experts. “A lot of companies would find it easier to deal with the problem of retaliation, as opposed to addressing these underlying problems of harassment  —   denying promotions, paying lower wages because of sex,” said Peter   of the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. According to data compiled by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, charges of retaliation linked to discrimination claims more than doubled from 1997 to 2015, to just under 40, 000, overtaking charges of racial discrimination, which had previously been the most common E. E. O. C. charge. One reason for the trend may be a pair of Supreme Court rulings in the late 1990s that prompted employers to enact policies that encourage workers to come forward when they believe they have suffered discrimination. But, of course, any uptick in workers speaking up also creates more risk that their bosses will retaliate against them for doing so, said Carolyn Wheeler, a longtime E. E. O. C. lawyer now at the firm Katz, Marshall  Banks in Washington. In recent years, the commission has also made a priority of combating retaliation, Ms. Wheeler said, for the simple reason that it can fulfill its mission only if “people aren’t afraid to bring discrimination to the attention of the agency. ” Perhaps most important, however, is the fact that it is often easier to win a retaliation claim than a case about the original discrimination, and it has become more so in recent years. The Supreme Court in 2006 made it easier to prove that an employer’s response was serious enough to constitute retaliation, instead of being able to win only when an employee suffered an unambiguously harsh consequence for speaking up, like being fired. Anything that might well have discouraged a reasonable person from coming forward, like a schedule that makes it tough to care for one’s children, could suffice. Ms. Smith, the lawyer in the Carlson case, adds that retaliation claims can be more intuitive, because the desire to punish an accuser is almost universal. By contrast, discrimination claims may involve comments or actions that not everyone will view as hostile or demeaning. “I do think it’s absolutely true that it’s easier for juries to get retaliation,” she said. “It’s easier for even men to understand retaliation in a case. Maybe women might understand more how damaging this environment is. ” There is evidence to support this. Cynthia Calvert, a discrimination lawyer and senior adviser at the Center for WorkLife Law in San Francisco, recently reviewed 4, 400 cases involving workers who believed their employers had discriminated against them because of their role as caregivers, such as mothers of newborns. Ms. Calvert said that although many employees would file both discrimination and retaliation claims, “not infrequently, the discrimination claim would be dismissed in summary judgment, but the retaliation claim would remain. ” “The end result,” she said, “is that we probably have more verdicts and settlement on retaliation than on the underlying claim. ” In one  prominent case in May, a sheriff’s sergeant in Sacramento won an award of more than $3 million when the jury found that her superiors had retaliated against her for complaining of discrimination. The discrimination claims had been dismissed. (Other lawyers note that retaliation claims can fail when the alleged retaliation comes a considerable time after the plaintiff first complained of discrimination, so this approach is hardly bulletproof.) The trend has its downsides, however, if the goal is to root out and address actual discrimination. “The whole point of this is, if there’s wrongdoing in a workplace, you want to make sure an employer understands what it is and corrects it so that it doesn’t go on in the future,” Ms. Calvert said. If the focus is primarily on retaliation, “you’re not getting that effect. ” In the extreme situation, aggressively policing retaliation but setting a dauntingly high bar for many types of discrimination claims could have the odd effect of making it relatively easy for workers to confront their employers while giving those employers little incentive to change certain corrosive practices. It would be akin to protecting corporate and government   while leaving intact barriers to prosecuting corruption. To truly root out discriminatory behavior, many experts say, it must become easier for victims to gain redress legally. For example, courts frequently require plaintiffs to show that a similar employee was treated differently  —   say, a woman claiming that she was denied promotion because of gender discrimination would need to show that a similarly productive man with the same duties and qualifications received the promotion. But such airtight comparisons frequently do not exist, particularly at smaller companies. More broadly, courts grappling with discrimination cases are often laboring under a standard that favors direct evidence  —   like explicitly sexist or racist comments  —   that emerged almost two generations ago. In those days, bias was frequently overt. Today, biases tend to be more subtle and unconscious, like employers believing they are treating different workers equally even when they are not. “‘We don’t hire people like you’ was the world of the 1960s and 1970s, and the courts came up with ways of proving discrimination of that sort,” said Ms. Wheeler, the former E. E. O. C. lawyer. “That doesn’t help very much for plaintiffs today. ”",0
903,Google Launches AI Program to Detect ’Hate Speech’ - Breitbart,"Google has launched a new AI program called Perspective to detect “abusive” comments online in an effort to crack down on hate speech. [Publications such as The New York Times, The Guardian, and The Economist are testing the new software as a way of policing comments sections, according to the Financial Times.  “News organizations want to encourage engagement and discussion around their content, but find that sorting through millions of comments to find those that are trolling or abusive takes a lot of money, labour and time,” said Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, the Google social incubator that built the tool. “As a result, many sites have shut down comments altogether. But they tell us that isn’t the solution they want. ” Perspective is available to all publications that are currently part of Google’s Digital News Initiative, which includes The Guardian, the BBC and The Financial Times. In theory, the software could also be utilized by social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter. Twitter has recently attempted to impose stricter rules on users in an attempt to reduce supposed harassment on the platform. CJ Adams, a product manager at Jigsaw, discussed the adaptability of their program, saying, “We are open to working with anyone from small developers to the biggest platforms on the internet. We all have a shared interest and benefit from healthy online discussions. ” Perspective is used to filter and compile comments on websites for human review. In order to learn what exactly counts as a “toxic” comment, the program studied hundreds of thousands of user comments that had been deemed unacceptable by reviewers on websites like The New York Times and Wikipedia. “All of us are familiar with increased toxicity around comments in online conversations,” said Cohen. “People are leaving conversations because of this, and we want to empower publications to get those people back. ” Apparently Perspective cut the review time of comments on The New York Times in half, allowing reviewers to check twice as many comments thanks to Perspective’s comment filtering abilities. Speed is paramount to Paragon, Jigsaw’s Chief Research Scientist Lucas Dixon said: “Their goal is to be able to [improve] review speed by 10x, so the project is ongoing. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

904,Why Polls Showing Hillary in The Lead Are Useless And Misleading [CARTOON],"You are here: Home / political cartoon / Why Polls Showing Hillary in The Lead Are Useless And Misleading [CARTOON] Why Polls Showing Hillary in The Lead Are Useless And Misleading [CARTOON] October 29, 2016 Pinterest 
Robert Gehl reports that with less than ten days to go, Donald Trump appears to be surging with likely voters across the country. 
Despite an onslaught of negative coverage from all corners of the media, the Republican Presidential candidate has gained on Hillary Clinton in the latest poll from The Washington Post and ABC News. 
Hillary still holds a 48-44 percent edge over Trump, but that is up from 38 percent support for Trump in the last week alone, fueled by support is shoring up among political independents and hard-core Republicans. He has made up ground among white people – with a 30-point advantage among whites without a college degree, up from a 20 point advantage. 
Trump saw his biggest gains among political independents, favoring Trump by a 12-point margin in the latest tracking poll, 49 to 37 percent, after giving Clinton a narrow edge in late last week. Neither candidate has maintained a consistent lead among independent likely voters in Post-ABC polling this fall. 
Despite the surge in Trump’s popularity, still six in ten voters expect Hillary Clinton to win anyway. The same poll found that only 30 percent thought Donald Trump would prevail. This plays into the Trump narrative that the vote is somehow “rigged” in favor of Clinton and no matter how much support he has, Trump would never ascend to the presidency. 
Sizable minorities of likely voters express concerns about fraud and inaccuracy at the ballot box, though worries about both have declined in the past month. Fewer than four in 10 voters now say voter fraud occurs very or somewhat often (37 percent), down from 47 percent in early September. Studies of voter fraud have found that it is very rare. 
In a separate question, the share of voters saying they do not have confidence votes will be counted accurately dipped from 33 to 28 percent, while the percentage saying they are “very confident” rose from 31 to 43 percent. 
Seven in 10 Trump supporters say voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, including 34 percent who think it happens “very often.” And Trump voters are split on whether votes will be counted accurately across the country, with 50 percent at least somewhat confident and 49 percent “not too” or “not at all” confident. 
While Trump voters’ concerns about fraud and vote counting have not changed significantly since last month, Clinton supporters expressed growing confidence in the election process. The share of Democrats who are “very confident” the vote will be accurately counted has grown from 45 percent last month to 70 percent in the new Post-ABC poll. And while more than 1 in 5 Democrats last month thought voter fraud occurs at least somewhat often, that has fallen to slightly more than 1 in 10 in this week’s poll. 
The poll was conducted with a sampling of 1,775 adults and has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 2.5 percentage points.",0
905,Why Last-Second Lane Mergers Are Good for Traffic - The New York Times,"The orange highway sign with black letters holds a familiar warning: “Lane closed ahead. ” What do you do? If your instinct is to immediately get out of the lane that will be closing, you may think you are being courteous to fellow drivers by reacting early  —   but in reality you could be slowing traffic, experts say. It may sound like a breach of etiquette to wait until the last minute to merge, but traffic engineers and transportation departments in several states are promoting that exact move, sometimes with mixed results as they try to overcome drivers’ ingrained habits. The maneuver is known as the late merge  —   or zipper merge, for the way that cars taking turns getting into a lane resembles the teeth of a zipper coming together. The move, in which drivers in dense,   traffic remain in the lane that will be closed and then pull into the other lane at the merge point, helps ease congestion and drivers’ frustrations, experts said. As Tom Vanderbilt, the author of “Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What It Says About Us),” noted, “Merging late, that purported symbol of individual greed, actually makes things better for everyone. ” Colorado started to promote the late merge during a highway project more than 10 years ago. Signs were posted, starting two miles from the point of the lane closing. The first signs read, “Use both lanes during congestion. ” The next signs said, “Use both lanes to the merge point. ” When the lane was ending, the last signs read: “Take turns. Merge here. ” The result? A 15 percent increase in the volume of cars moving through the work zone and a 50 percent decrease in the length of the line, K. C. Matthews, a traffic specifications and standards engineer at the Colorado Department of Transportation, said in an interview last week. The approach is effective in   traffic  and it allows drivers to take advantage of the lane that is about to close. In     traffic, there is less need to rely on the late merge, officials said. A work zone engineer for the Kansas Department of Transportation, Kristi Ericksen, said in an email that officials would customarily expect in work zones to see “large differences in the speed of traffic (nearly at a standstill in one lane and highway speeds in the adjacent lane) and road rage (rude gestures, eliminating gaps, lane blocking). ” Since the late merge was introduced, the queues for those two types of lanes are about half the length officials expected, and drivers take turns at the merge point, she said. “As for traffic flows, the data suggests that while the speeds are lower and the travel time may not be shorter, traffic continues to move and is predictable,” she wrote. “In other words, the travel conditions are more reliable, which has its own set of benefits. ” But when people apply their “  sensibilities” to their driving, the late merge can be harder to manage, Mr. Vanderbilt, the author, said in an interview last week. For instance, a person would be considered rude if he or she walked to the head of a line of customers waiting for a bank teller. A driver in a free lane who zipped to the merge point and then tried to cut in could be judged similarly. Some drivers then take it upon themselves to become traffic monitors, enforcing societal norms and straddling the lanes to block those who might try to get ahead, he said. “In a car moving at a certain speed, when the moment comes to make a quick decision, we may become more interested in getting into a battle for progress,” he said. When the Minnesota Department of Transportation tried to promote the zipper merge, officials found that some drivers in the lane that was going to end kept pace with the car next to them “whether acting out of perceived courtesy or a sense of vigilante justice,” Mr. Vanderbilt wrote in his book. The result was confusion and congestion. Quoting the puzzled Minnesota transportation officials, Mr. Vanderbilt wrote, “For some unknown reason, a small number of drivers were unwilling to change their old driving behaviors. ” Officials report mostly positive feedback from drivers about the late merge, though some occasionally take a dim view of it. Mr. Matthews recalled a Federal Highway Administration official who was in her own vehicle and driving through a   construction zone in Colorado. She was excited to see a zipper merge in action and zoomed to the merge point in the lane that was to end. Another driver, who was apparently not as impressed as she was, threw a burrito at her car, he said.",0
906,"In Macau, Skipping the Casinos, but Embracing the Past - The New York Times","As we bumped along in the No. 25 bus on Estrada do Istmo, it was impossible not to notice the Venetian Macau, a mountain of steel and glass, shining in the distance in the afternoon sun. Opened in 2007, it’s home to one of the largest casinos on earth. And it’s not alone: Of the 10 biggest casinos in the world in 2014 (based on revenue) a staggering eight were in Macau, a tiny region on the southern coast of China, where over half a million people are packed into fewer than 12 square miles. But I wasn’t there to gamble. Following a precedent I’d established in my very first Frugal Traveler column, when I toured Las Vegas without going to the famed Strip, I was determined to break the shell of Macau’s opulent exterior and see what lay beneath the surface. During a quick   trip, taking the ferry across the Pearl River Estuary, I found it was the perfect place for a getaway from the noise and intense urban compactness of Hong Kong. Owing to its colonial past, Macau, with its cobblestone streets, old Catholic churches and narrow alleyways, has an almost European feel to it, along with an interesting local cuisine that fuses Portuguese and Chinese flavors. And my focus, naturally, was putting this trip together without causing undue strain on my budget. Macau was one of the first Asian settlements to be forced into the yoke of European colonization and the last to shed it, achieving full independence from Portugal in 1999. As with Hong Kong, China administers Macau but employs a somewhat     approach. There are no visa requirements for Americans staying in Macau fewer than 30 days (you will need to bring your passport). The TurboJet ferry ride from Hong Kong (150 to 200 Hong Kong dollars for an economy fare, about $20 to $25) is reasonably quick and comfortable. Ferries leave from various spots in Hong Kong regularly, so if you miss one, there’s no need to worry. (Be more cautious when you’re leaving Macau  —   it’s easier to end up on the wrong ferry.) My attack plan was simple: to see as much as I could, by foot and by public transportation. Macau is traditionally divided into three sections: the peninsula and the islands of Coloane and Taipa. (A fourth “region” of land reclaimed from the ocean, Cotai, now connects Coloane and Taipa and is the home to many of the newer casinos.) I particularly had my eye on rustic Coloane Village in the south. Though I had no plans to indulge in the casinos, one lesson I’ve learned in my travels is that where there’s gambling, cheap rooms follow  —   it’s how they lure you in. I was able to land a very comfortable, relatively luxurious room at the Sofitel on the western side of the peninsula for 650 Hong Kong dollars, a little over $80. Close to the center of the city, it was an ideal   point. I was able to check another essential off the list by walking to Yin He Dian Xun (roughly, Galaxy Telecommunications) and purchasing a   SIM card from a very helpful young woman for 50 Macanese patacas (about $6). Ah, yes, the currency. The Macanese pataca and Hong Kong dollar are separate currencies but virtually interchangeable in Macau. Change will sometimes come in patacas, sometimes in Hong Kong dollars. A dollar is, however, slightly more valuable than a pataca. If you’re considering making a big souvenir purchase (like gold or jade jewelry, which is plentiful on the main drag of Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro) either use a credit card with no foreign transaction fee, or walk into a bank to exchange for patacas  —   I was able to do both without difficulty. Senado Square, within walking distance of my hotel, was a good place to begin exploring. Beautiful old yellow and pink pastel buildings with arched doorways and green shuttered windows frame the historic square, which is paved with small tiles. It was a perfect place to stroll and enjoy the egg tart I’d purchased for 9 dollars from Koi Kei Bakery. The egg tart is one of Macau’s signature delicacies, a local interpretation of the Portuguese pastel de nata  —   perfectly creamy custard with a pleasantly caramelized top, encased within a delicate, flaky pastry cup. Another distinctive item is the pork chop bun. I stopped into the celebrated Tai Lei Loi Kei, a nearly    Macanese chain, and paid 48 dollars for a small,   pork chop that had been slapped somewhat unceremoniously onto a buttered white roll. Fortunately the meat was simply seasoned and well cooked (just be careful not to break a tooth). In addition to its cuisine, Macau has memorable architecture. Catholic influence is still very much present, at least aesthetically. St. Dominic’s Church, a beautifully restored,     structure, is free to enter, as is a   art museum housed in the church’s bell tower. I looked over the icons and relics of the church on display, including beautiful old wooden carvings. Other worthy architectural attractions include the Ruins of St. Paul, a grand stone facade that is one of the few remaining pieces of a   complex. While there, I made the steep hike up to the adjacent Fortaleza do Monte, which provided an excellent view of the city. I could walk to the ruins and St. Dominic’s from my hotel, but despite Macau’s compact size, not everything is walkable. I would not recommend driving in Macau, nor riding one of the city’s ubiquitous scooters. I found a bike rental shop called Si Toi in Taipa that charged 20 dollars per hour (only $2. 50, remember) but I ultimately decided on the bus: I found it cheap and fairly reliable. Unless you have something called a Macaupass (which I did not, and purchase locations are annoyingly scarce) you will need coins. Lots of coins. And they don’t make change on the buses, so get used to walking around with a pocketful of patacas. (Local businesses and banks can help you make change if you’re hard up.) I hopped the 26A bus to Coloane, eager to see the rustic, more peaceful side of Macau. (A quick note on signage: Every official sign in Macau will be in both Portuguese and Chinese. I found this somewhat curious, as I didn’t hear a word of Portuguese my entire stay. I asked Neal, a server at the cute Cafe Cheri, if he spoke Portuguese or knew anyone who did. “Well,” he hesitated, “No, not really. ” Did anyone in Macau speak Portuguese? “Yes, I think in some restaurants. ”) Coloane Village was quiet, almost sleepy, when I hopped off the bus by the roundabout near Eanes Park. It was, in other words, exactly what I was seeking. I began walking north up the coast, stopping for another excellent   egg tart at Lord Stow’s Bakery. Colorfully painted houses stood on stilts in the bay, China a mere 1, 000 feet to the west. Fishermen hung their catch outside their homes, and every now and then there was the distinctive clack of   tiles. I wound my way down Avenida de Cinco de Outubro, in the shade of   ficus rumphii trees with aerial roots, like banyan trees. I eventually found myself in a beautiful cobblestone plaza with a fountain on one end and the beautiful, bright yellow Chapel of St. Francis on the other. I dined al fresco at Cafe Nga Tim on a   dish of rice and curried prawns and watched evening set in. The casinos? Didn’t need them. They do provide a useful benefit, though: When it came time to head back to the ferry terminal, I happily used the hotel’s free shuttle bus.",0
907,"In Montreal, an Ungainly and Unloved Christmas Tree - The New York Times","MONTREAL  —   The idea was to celebrate Montreal’s coming 375th anniversary with a Christmas tree bigger and grander than the famous one at Rockefeller Center in New York. Instead, downtown Montreal wound up with something only Charlie Brown could love. “It’s a bit of an eyesore,” said Noor Malick, who has a view of the tree from her office window. “It’s horrible, it’s completely awful,” said Georges Malouin, who was passing through the   Christmas market where the tree is displayed. “I’m so surprised. I saw it on the internet but now, live, it looks very  —   cheap. ” “It’s quite sad, really,” said Michaela van den Berg, a visitor from England whose husband, Jos, compared the tree to a matchstick. “Maybe it’s a joke. ” People certainly are laughing, both in the streets and online. The tree has two mock Twitter accounts, one mainly in French and one in English. Mélanie Joly, the federal minister of Canadian heritage who, among other things, oversees the national holiday decorations in Ottawa, tweeted that she loved the Montreal tree, but she added a winking emoji. A classic specimen, the tree is not. Its trunk is crooked, for one thing. And its other shortcomings are painfully obvious to  . “It doesn’t have a top. It looks like it’s missing branches it’s kind of ” Pierre Bourcier said after snapping a photo with his phone. And then there are the ornaments: The tree is covered with red plastic inverted triangles topped by green maple leaves, the logo of the Canadian Tire retail chain, which supplied its white lights. A small child standing at the base of the tree this week stumped her father by asking why it “looked like a store. ” How did a holiday celebration became a municipal punch line? Chalk it up to (perhaps too much) ambition, inadequate financing and Murphy’s law. “We have good intentions,” said   Pelletier, one of the principals of Sapin MTL, the company that came up with the idea of rivaling New York’s tree. “But the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and we had problems. ” Sapin MTL is in the business of     Christmas trees, and it proposed the big one as a promotional gimmick. Mr. Pelletier said the company had a more majestic, shapely tree in mind. It researched the typical height for recent Rockefeller Center trees  —   74 to 76 feet  —   and found a   in Ontario that Mr. Pelletier described as “amazing. ” But its narrow height advantage vanished in early November when Rockefeller Center announced that its 2016 tree would be a   Norway spruce. Mr. Pelletier and his partners then had less than a month to come up with a new, taller rival, and they appealed to the public, which suggested about 100 candidates. The balsam fir they chose came from the Eastern Townships of Quebec, near the border with the United States. “It’s not perfect, but it’s authentic and it’s a real tree that you find in the forests of Quebec,” Mr. Pelletier said. “We’re not pretending this is the most amazing, beautiful tree in the world. ” Facing a Nov. 30 deadline for unveiling the tree, the Sapin crew had to hurry. The tree was harvested, placed on a special flatbed truck and brought to Montreal under police escort within 72 hours. But a tight schedule and a tight budget meant that some corners were cut  —   and so was the tree. Somehow, the tree that reached the   section of St. Catherine Street where the market is held measured just 88 feet tall, six feet short of the one in Rockefeller Center. Mr. Pelletier’s brother Philippe, another principal in the company, said a bit sheepishly on Friday that they had simply settled for the tallest tree they could find in time. And there was no time or money to give it the extensive arboreal spa treatment that the New York tree gets all the workers could do was reattach, sometimes rather obviously, a few of the larger branches that had broken off in shipping. As for the decorations,   Pelletier said his company’s responsibility ended once the tree was in its bare steel stand on St. Catherine Street. Jane Shaw, a spokeswoman for Canadian Tire, said the company had not required the logo ornaments in exchange for donating the lights. She called them “a gesture from the organizers” of the Christmas market. The skinny, misshapen and widely unloved tree does attract some expressions of appreciation. Many seem to be of the ironic variety often reserved for   horror movies. But some seem sincere. As a reporter was interviewing Mr. Pelletier in the market, a woman interrupted to say the tree was “beautiful,” before swiftly walking away. This year’s debacle hasn’t deterred Mr. Pelletier. He said his company was determined to make sure that Montreal truly outdoes New York next year, now that his fellow citizens have had their fun at this year’s tree’s expense. “I think we can celebrate the Christmas magic and stop saying it’s ugly, ugly, ugly,” he said, as a family posed for a photo in front of the tree. “Now in Quebec, there’s Cirque du Soleil, Celine Dion and the naughty fir  —   we prefer that to ‘ugly.’ ‘Naughty’ is better. ” Gesturing up at the tree, he said: “Look at him.

Its Juno spacecraft made its fifth      dive of Jupiter on March 27, its eight instruments gathering data on the planet’s interior as it accelerated to 129, 000 miles per hour. On each flyby, the public nominates and then votes on the atmospheric features Juno’s camera should record. This time, one of the winning targets was a boundary between two atmospheric regions. The bluish streak on the right is part of a persistent storm. Juno snapped this image 7, 900 miles from the planet. This week, NASA released an image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which is in orbit around Earth. The distance, 415 million miles, is the closest that Earth gets to Jupiter, which makes it a good time for Hubble to perform a    survey of the solar system’s largest planet. The space telescope is able to discern features on Jupiter as small as 80 miles across. “We can map out the full planet,” said Amy A. Simon, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. who led the observations. “On a first glance, the Great Red Spot is still strikingly colored. It stands out quite well. ” Dr. Simon said that Jupiter’s atmosphere appears to be more turbulent than in the past couple of years. “That’s telling us something about the deeper atmosphere,” she said. “We’re going to be analyzing this over the next few months. ” Because the Hubble observations roughly coincided with Juno’s flyby, scientists will be able to match the   with a wider view of the planet. “We could do a    there and help out Juno at the same time,” Dr. Simon said.",0
909,"Trump’s Labor Pick, Andrew Puzder, Is Critic of Minimum Wage Increases - The New York Times","  Donald J. Trump on Thursday chose Andrew F. Puzder, chief executive of the company that franchises the   outlets Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. and an outspoken critic of the worker protections enacted by the Obama administration, to be secretary of labor. “Andy Puzder has created and boosted the careers of thousands of Americans, and his extensive record fighting for workers makes him the ideal candidate to lead the Department of Labor,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mr. Puzder, 66, fits the profile of some of Mr. Trump’s other domestic cabinet appointments. He is a wealthy businessman and political donor and has a long record of promoting a conservative agenda that takes aim at President Obama’s legacy. And more than the other appointments, he resembles Mr. Trump in style. He seems to delight in bashing elites  —   he complained that “big corporate interests” and “globalist companies” were supporting Hillary Clinton in the presidential election  —   and is prone to the occasional streak of political incorrectness. On policy questions, he has argued that the Obama administration’s recent rule expanding eligibility for overtime pay diminishes opportunities for workers, and that significant minimum wage increases would hurt small businesses and lead to job losses. He has criticized paid sick leave policies of the sort recently enacted for federal contractors and strongly supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, which he says has created a “  restaurant recession” because rising premiums have left people with less money to spend dining out. Speaking to Business Insider this year, Mr. Puzder said that increased automation could be a welcome development because machines were “always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a    or an age, sex or race discrimination case. ” And on the political incorrectness front, Mr. Puzder’s company, CKE Restaurants, runs advertisements that frequently feature women wearing next to nothing while gesturing suggestively. “I like our ads,” he told the publication Entrepreneur. “I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis. I think it’s very American. ” Richard L. Trumka, president of the A. F. L. . I. O. said Mr. Puzder was “a man whose business record is defined by fighting against working people. ” As labor secretary, Mr. Puzder would oversee the federal apparatus that investigates violations of minimum wage, overtime and worker safety laws and regulations. According to a Labor Department database, many Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. stores have been investigated over the past 15 years, and some have been fined or ordered to pay back wages, though most of the cases appear to have been at stores owned and operated by franchisees, not CKE itself. Such investigations are relatively common in the   industry. Matthew Haller, senior vice president for public affairs and communications at the International Franchise Association, of which Mr. Puzder is a board member, said Mr. Puzder saw “a role for government to provide advice to employers, rather than simply deterrence by ‘gotcha’ enforcement,” an allusion to the Obama Labor Department’s enforcement of laws and regulations in the   industry. Mr. Haller and other allies of Mr. Puzder said that those who took the time to look beyond his most provocative statements would find the wisdom of a man who has toiled on labor issues for years. “His position on the minimum wage is more nuanced than people want to give him credit for,” Mr. Haller said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s middle ground” on the overtime rule, he added. “He’s a business person, a deal maker. ” There is some evidence to support that view. In a Wall Street Journal   article after his comments on automation, Mr. Puzder wrote that humans remained important “to assure smooth experiences” for customers. In an appearance on Fox Business in May, he said that he was “not opposed to raising the minimum wage rationally I’m opposed to raising it to the point where   workers,   Americans, young people, minorities, are losing the jobs they need to get on the ladder of success. ” Though he did not explain what a “rational” increase would entail, he opposed the Obama administration’s efforts to raise the federal minimum wage to $10. 10 from $7. 25, where it has stood since 2009. That is far below the $15 per hour that many advocates have called for and that a variety of cities and states have enacted in recent years, albeit on a gradual timetable. Economic research suggests that an increase to the vicinity of $10. 10 per hour would have little or no effect on employment in much of the country, though the impact could be larger in     areas. Mr. Puzder has raised concerns about the effects in those regions. On other issues, Mr. Puzder has taken   positions that leave less room for negotiation. Perhaps most prominent is the   joint employer doctrine that the Obama administration and its agency appointees have put forth in recent years. Under that doctrine, large companies that have franchises or hire other companies as contractors are more likely to be held liable for violations of employment laws by those contractors or franchisees. Parent companies typically argue that they have no legal responsibility in these cases. Mr. Puzder has been unambiguous in his disdain for the new standard. As labor secretary, there are certain immediate steps he could take to undo it, though there are some applications, like to the law governing unions, that would require action by the National Labor Relations Board or federal courts to overturn. Perhaps the biggest question surrounding Mr. Puzder is how he would be perceived as a wealthy chief executive charged with looking out for workers’ interests. According to a 2012 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Puzder’s base salary that year was more than $1 million and his total compensation over $4 million, down from more than $10 million the year before. “Annual base salaries should be competitive and create a measure of financial security for our executive officers,” the filing said. During the 2016 election cycle, Mr. Puzder and his wife gave more than $300, 000 to Mr. Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee. But for all his populist rhetoric, his previous political contributions  —   as well as his positions on most business issues and regulations, and his reading habits  —   suggest he is more of an orthodox Republican than Mr. Trump. Before backing Mr. Trump, he donated to the campaigns of Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Rick Perry, Scott Walker and Jeb Bush, and he helped shape Mitt Romney’s economic plan in 2011. When asked to provide some insight into what Mr. Puzder was like away from the job, Mr. Haller said he was an avid reader who loved Ayn Rand, the libertarian novelist. According to a 1989 article in The St. Louis   Mr. Puzder helped draft a Missouri law banning most abortions at public facilities and requiring doctors to test the viability of fetuses starting at 20 weeks. But according to another   article, after his   accused him of domestic violence, he offered to resign from a task force convened by Gov. John Ashcroft to study a Supreme Court decision upholding the law. Mr. Puzder, who declined to comment for this article, eventually did resign from the task force, but he denied the allegations. The Trump transition team forwarded a recent letter from his   declaring that she had been “counseled then to file an allegation of abuse. ” She added, “I regretted and still regret that decision, and I withdrew those allegations. ” “You were not abusive,” she said.",0
910,Nico Rosberg Takes Formula One Drivers’ Title Despite Lewis Hamilton’s Win in Abu Dhabi - The New York Times,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates  —   Lewis Hamilton may have won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday, and he may have won 10 races this season compared to nine victories for his Mercedes teammate, Nico Rosberg. But Rosberg, who finished the race in second place, not only won the 2016 world drivers’ championship, having earned 5 points more than Hamilton this year, but he also proved that he deserved that title, and above all, that it is still possible in the cutthroat world of modern Formula One to win with the style and grace of a gentleman. After conceding the drivers’ title to Hamilton during the past two seasons, and even losing when they were teammates in   as children, Rosberg finally beat his nemesis. “It feels like I’ve been racing him forever,” Rosberg said of Hamilton. “He has always managed to just edge me out and get the title, even when we were small in  . He’s an amazing driver and one of the best in history, so it’s unbelievably special to beat him because the level is so high. ” It was not just the manner in which Rosberg succeeded, and his generosity in praising his teammate, but also the contrasting style with which Hamilton lost the title, that defined this final duel of the 2016 season. With just 12 points between them before the race, and Rosberg leading the series, Hamilton, who started from the pole position  —   with Rosberg starting second  —   had to win the race and hope that Rosberg failed to finish second or third. There was widespread speculation before the race that Hamilton would use dirty tactics by trying to hold his lead to the first corner, and then drive slowly in order to force Rosberg into a battle with the drivers who were behind him  —   notably those from Red Bull and Ferrari, who started from third to sixth. “That’s not really ever been my thought process,” Hamilton said before the race, adding that it “wouldn’t be very easy or wise to do so. ” But it was exactly what Hamilton did, driving at one point as much as nine seconds slower per lap than he had in qualifying for the pole, and despite his Mercedes engineer regularly telling him to speed up as the team feared it could lose the victory. But even before that point, Rosberg had also fallen victim early in the race to another similar tactic from a competing team, after Max Verstappen in one of the Red Bull cars moved ahead of him after his pit stop, and Verstappen slowed to block Rosberg and help the other Red Bull driver, Daniel Ricciardo, to catch up from behind Rosberg. At that point, Rosberg had to contemplate that he might end up behind both of the Red Bull drivers, with Hamilton winning the race and the title. “The feelings out there in the battle with Max, unreal,” said Rosberg, looking both emotionally and physically exhausted. “I hope I don’t experience that many times again. ” He then proved what a gutsy and precise driver he is when his engineer told him that he absolutely had to pass Verstappen as soon as possible. He did so with a brilliant and brave move on Lap 20 of the   race, despite the knowledge that Verstappen has been criticized all season as a dangerous and unpredictable driver to pass. Rosberg then set several fastest laps of the race and caught up to Hamilton again, showing that he was in full control of his car and himself. But a bigger trial lay ahead in the final laps of the race: As predicted, with Rosberg less than a second behind him, Hamilton drove as slowly as he could in order to push Rosberg into Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari, who was catching him, and Verstappen. Hamilton’s engineer continuously requested he speed up. But Hamilton kept his car as slow as possible, even answering, for an employee of a racing team, insubordinately. “Right now, I’m losing the world championship,” Hamilton said with two laps remaining. “So I’m not bothered if I’m going to lose the race. ” Rosberg had a card of his own to play, of course, had he decided to act like drivers such as Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher in similar situations in the 1980s and 1990s, who all settled titles with knockout crashes into their own teammates. But before the race, Rosberg had said he would only do everything within the rules to win. And after the race, he said he never considered trying to pass in unrealistic circumstances. There was a certain justice that dawned after the race about Hamilton’s tactic, as Vettel repeated twice that he could not have made an attempt to pass Rosberg because Hamilton was actually too close in front of Rosberg, and any leap past Rosberg might send Vettel into a collision with Hamilton’s car. Under immense pressure throughout the season, Rosberg did everything he had to do to hold his advantage  —   Hamilton led the series for a period of only four midseason races  —   and Rosberg did so despite Hamilton’s efforts, both in words and on the track, to impose his will. Paddy Lowe, the technical director of the Mercedes team, explained why he felt there was no question that Rosberg deserved to win the title. “For me, it’s about not just winning races, it’s about sustaining that energy, sustaining that commitment, sustaining that nerve throughout a championship,” Lowe said. “And it all came down to this race today, and he did it, and that is the mark of a real world champion. ” But it was Rosberg’s own contrasting, and worthy, behavior that impressed the most. Despite Hamilton’s tactics on Sunday, and the media grilling them both over its ethical merits, Rosberg refused to say a bad word against Hamilton. “You can understand the team’s perspective, and you can understand Lewis’s perspective  —   so that’s it,” said Rosberg, closing the debate. Hamilton, however, was unrepentant. “I don’t think what I did was dangerous, so I don’t think I did anything unfair,” Hamilton said. “We are fighting for a championship, so I controlled the pace. That’s the rules. ” It was all a stark contrast to the early years of the series, when it was possible for one driver to hand his car to another driver of the same team, as Peter Collins did for Juan Manuel Fangio in 1956 in the final race, handing his own chance at winning his first title to Fangio, who ended up claiming his fourth. But Rosberg has perhaps learned his lessons from a driver from another age as well, as he became only the second son of a Formula One world champion  —   after Graham and Damon Hill  —   to win the title himself. His father, Kéké, won the title while driving for the Williams team in 1982, and after only a single victory that season. “I hope my dad survived that race,” Rosberg said of his victory. “I haven’t seen him yet. I’m sure it was pretty intense for him, so I hope he’s O. K. ”",0
911,What a Sensory Isolation Tank Taught Me About My Brain - The New York Times,"“Take off your clothes, step into the pod and shut the top. And be really careful not to get any of the salt in your eyes. ” Those were the instructions I was given recently just before I entered a sensory isolation tank in Seattle. Finally, I would have my chance to see what it would be like to be a brain in a jar. Lying in a supersaturated solution of magnesium sulfate  —   better known as Epsom salts  —   cranked up to body temperature, I pulled the top down over me and pushed the button to extinguish the violet light illuminating the pod. Cut off from the world of sensory stimuli, my brain had free rein to invent any experience it had up its sleeve. So I floated in pitch blackness and waited for a profound experience to wash over me. This is what adherents paid $89 a pop to feel. I’d heard it was better than meditation, yoga and drugs  —   perhaps because it promised nirvana without any effort or side effects. But I felt nothing. After some time, I became acutely aware that I could not feel my body, which I suppose was the whole point of depriving the brain of any connection to the physical world. I started to slowly move my hands and legs to reassure myself they were still there. Check. I had a vivid image of my phantom body I knew intellectually that it was present, but couldn’t detect it in the normal sense. Just then, I made the error of letting my head drop too low in the salt broth and got some into my eyes. The sting was immediate and distinctly unpleasant. The brief period of nothingness had ended, and over the next few minutes, my mental state moved from curiosity to boredom to annoyance. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. My stomach rumbled. My brain was bombarded with all kinds of physical sensations. I was beginning to feel sympathy for pickled fish. Instead of a transcendent excursion into an altered consciousness, sensory deprivation had hilariously underscored the primacy of my body it was almost a purely physical experience from start to finish. It was like being at a meditation retreat with a runny nose. My brain was simply incapable of escaping the signals my body was sending it. When the hour was up, I showered and came down to the receptionist to pay. There were three women there who were   like me, and they all looked blissful. “How was it?” one of them dreamily asked me. Not wanting to be a downer, I replied that it was lovely and interesting. At least it was half true. The experience made me wonder about a question that has never let go of me: Are you more than your brain? Hardly a week goes by, it seems, without an enthusiastic report in the popular media about intriguing neuroscience research linking some human behavior to the function of a particular brain circuit. So you might hear that the insula  lights up when you’re sad, another region when you’re happy and still another when you’re enjoying a drink or an orgasm. For some reason we love to hear our mental experiences described in the language of neuroscience, yet what does it actually add to our understanding of ourselves to learn that our brain shows activity when we think and feel one thing or another? By itself, not a lot, except to encourage the erroneous and simplistic idea that the brain is an independent sovereign, calling all the shots. Of course, the brain gives rise to our mind, which then tries to understand and manipulate the very neural apparatus that brought it about. It gives me a headache just thinking about it. Some very smart neuroscientists and philosophers like to say that the very notion of mind is an illusion, a trick of the brain  —   something they have been carrying on about for rather a long time. Don’t get me wrong. I’m a neuroscience junkie. But we are not just a brain in a jar we are also bodies, and what we do with those bodies can influence the brain. You can easily alter your thinking and mood by manipulating your body: by, for example, injecting your forehead with Botox, shining light into your eye, exercising  —   or floating in an isolation tank. In the end, whether or not we are more than our brain is less important and less interesting than the fact that our brain does not just give orders it takes them, too. An isolation tank can turn the body weightless and invisible, but your brain knows better.",0
912,Chelsea Handler Botches Tweet Attacking Trump’s Grandchild,"Talk show host Chelsea Handler tweeted a joke mocking President Donald Trump’s unborn grandchild Monday afternoon, but appeared to misspell the word “genes,” leading Trump’s sons to reply with the correct spelling. [“I guess one of @realDonaldTrump’s sons is expecting a new baby,” Handler tweeted. “Just what we need. Another person with those jeans.

Let’s hope for a girl.  —   Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017,  Handler had apparently attempted to use the word “genes. ” Donald Trump Jr. replied to Handler’s post to correct the mistake, writing: “Jeans? ?? I guess I’m not at all surprised  …     but really? !?! #genes” Jeans? ?? I guess I’m not at all surprised  …     but really? !?! #genes https:  .   —   Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 20, 2017,  A short time later, Eric Trump  —   who announced earlier Monday that he and wife Lara are expecting a boy in September  —   also replied to correct the tweet and remind Handler he is expecting a son. Somewhat ironically, Handler mocked Melania Trump’s English skills in a recent interview at Sundance, during which she said she would never interview the First Lady on her Netflix talk show. “No. Melania? To talk about what? She can barely speak English,” she told Variety in January. The First Lady, who was born in Slovenia, reportedly speaks five languages. Handler apologized for the spelling error in a   tweet Monday evening, saying she was a “little stoned. ” Sorry about spelling mistake. I meant ”genes,” not ”jeans.” I’m a little stoned. What’s your excuse?  —   Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) March 20, 2017,  The    Chelsea star  —   who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race  —   has been a vocal critic of Trump since well before the November election. In April, the comedian posed   with the phrase, “Trump is a butt hole” scrawled across her back. “It’s always a good thing to be able to look at somebody and be like, ‘That’s the worst thing that could happen,’” she told Variety in September. “And I think we should keep him in the spotlight. Not as president, obviously, but, you know, as The Apprentice or whatever that show is called. ” In January, Handler led the Women’s March on Main in Park City, Utah, a sister march of the larger   Women’s March on Washington that occurred simultaneously in the nation’s capital. “Women are under a   political assault, and I intend to fight back with all my might against a Republican president, a Republican Congress, and the radical, religious right who are drooling to defund Planned Parenthood health services nationwide,” she wrote in a guest column for the Hollywood Reporter at the time.

913,Report: Trump Moves to Own Tax Reform Plan Without Speaker Paul Ryan - Breitbart,"Politico reported Thursday that President Donald Trump, chastened by his experience pushing for the failed Ryancare bill, is moving forward on tax reform with is own economic team in the lead —  not Speaker Paul Ryan ( ):[Just on Thursday, President Donald Trump huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, senior strategist Steve Bannon,    and consigliere Jared Kushner and staffers from the National Economic Council and Treasury to delve into the various policy   and ways to structure a plan. The key takeaway: The White House is not outsourcing these details to anyone, including the speaker of the House. The report said White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed this new dynamic at Friday’s news briefing: “The president will put out principles, I’m sure, in terms of what his goals are and drive this as the process moves forward. ”  A   paper, obtained by Politico and developed during the presidential transition, is the central blueprint for the president’s tax reform program —  and it would push Ryan’s own Border Adjustment Tax off the table. The president is expected to propose cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent combined with a wiping out of the tax code’s catalog of tax loopholes and deductions Congress created to ameliorate the 35 percent rate for business profits. Another part of the plan is to simply the individual tax rates, again by lowering the rates and removing specialized deductions. Trump’s corporate and individual tax reforms are significant, but no way near the revolutionary changes contained in Ryan’s Border Adjustment Tax, which shifts $1 trillion in annual tax burden onto exported goods and exporters. That fight has already been going on behind the scenes, as domestic manufacturers and retailers line up allies and resources as they contest for who will be on the hook for   of the federal government’s annual revenues. Ryan read Capitol Hill Republicans into his   schedule that would carry on through Labor Day at the GOP lawmakers’ policy retreat held in Philadelphia in the last week of January. The schedule called for the House to focus on overturning President Barack Obama’s   regulations through the Congressional Review Act, while the Senate focused on confirming the first wave of Trump administration appointees. March was dedicated to the    of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. In April, the Senate would confirm the president’s choice to fill the Supreme Court seat made vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, and the House would tackle reforming the tax code —  a process coupled with the approval of the fiscal year 2018 budget that would consume both chambers. In Philadelphia, Ryan had not yet revealed that he would hijack the    of Obamacare with his own bill that fell short of what Republicans had expected and had promised voters in every political cycle since Obamacare became law in 2010. The Ryancare bill alienated conservatives and frightened moderate Republicans hesitant to cast a politically risky vote for a bill that might not pass the Senate. In the end, the speaker pulled the Ryancare bill from the House floor March 24, nearly 15 minutes from the roll call that would have meant its certain defeat. If Ryan had a working majority in the House, he would be the man driving the agenda, he but does not have that majority, so the White House is moving forward with its own agenda and its own ideas. The aborted American Health Care Act has been portrayed as a defeat for the president, who rallied for the bill in   events outside of Washington and behind closed doors at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Now that things have settled, it appears that instead of a setback for the president, the failure of the speaker’s health care legislation was really Trump’s liberation. During the 2016 presidential cycle, Ryan created “The Better Way” agenda as a parallel campaign platform, so that he and his allies could campaign for themselves without mentioning the president’s name nor offer him support. Now, Trump has found his own better way.",0
915,AG Jeff Sessions Unveils Program to Accelerate Deportation of Imprisoned Illegals - Breitbart,"U. S Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Department of Justice are introducing measures to accelerate the deportation of imprisoned illegal aliens with the announcement of a new immigration program on Thursday. [The Institutional Hearing Program (IHP) will seek to reduce the bureaucratic processes involved in deportation by using   hearings to determine the fate of illegals once they have served their sentence.  The program includes giving more Bureau of Prisons contract facilities the power to undertake deportation proceedings, installing the required technology, and introducing new uniform intake policy between a DOJ office and U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “We owe it to the American people to ensure that illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes and are serving time in our federal prisons are expeditiously removed from our country as the law requires,” Sessions said in a statement announcing the plan. “This expansion and modernization of the Institutional Hearing Program gives us the tools to continue making Americans safe again in their communities,” he continued. Earlier this week, Sessions said that cities refusing to comply with federal immigration law, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, risked losing federal tax dollars. “I strongly urge our nation’s states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce immigration laws and to rethink these policies. Such policies make their cities and states less safe. Public safety as well as national security are at stake and put them at risk of losing federal dollars,” Sessions said at a White House press briefing. The warning comes amidst a nationwide crackdown enforcing immigration policy as part of Donald Trump’s wider immigration reforms. As well as plans to hire 15, 000 new Immigration and Customers Enforcement (ICE) agents, the Department of Justice is now publishing a weekly list all 118 localities refusing to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policy, as well as crimes committed by illegal immigrants within them.

916,Former US Attorney for DC: New Hillary Email Probe Was Result of ‘Revolt’ Inside FBI,"Former United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova suggested Friday James Comey’s reopening of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails was the product of a “revolt” inside the FBI. 
While speaking with WMAL’s Larry O’Connor , diGenova was asked what Comey meant by saying newly discovered Clinton emails from Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin’s devices “appear to be pertinent” to the FBI’s prior investigation. 
“It tells me that the original investigation was not thorough, and that it was an incompetent investigation,” diGenova said, “otherwise they would have discovered this — and I’ll tell you why.” 
“These were found on the phone that was used by Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin,” he said. “Why was that phone not looked at originally?” 
“There could be one explanation: Huma Abedin may have denied that any other phone existed, and if she did, she committed a felony. She lied to the FBI just like General Cartwright, and if she did, she’s dead meat, and Comey knows it, and there’s nothing he can do about it.” 
diGenova continued: “And why this letter was sent today was very simple: the agents came to Comey yesterday, they told him about the evidence, and he said oh ‘S’, and realized that his goose was cooked, that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent, and he knew that the agents running the Weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress.” 
“And I’ve also been told something very significant, it’s been reported that those laptops [belonging to Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson] were destroyed, they were not, and the reason is the FBI agents refused to do it.” 
diGenova went on to say he believes “there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now.” 
“He sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau,” he said. “Comey sent this letter today because he had to. He has no moral authority inside the agency right now, he’s a joke, he’s a laughingstock of the agency, and among former FBI agents, he has become an anathema.”

917,How Keeping Up Appearances Ruined a Former Dallas Banker - The New York Times,"At age 67, Thomas C. Davis should be enjoying all the perks of a long and distinguished career at the pinnacle of Wall Street and the Texas business elite. These include golfing at the prestigious Dallas Country Club and Preston Trail Golf Club, where he was a member trips to Las Vegas and golf tournaments on the private jet he   and fractional ownership of two professional sports teams, the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Stars. What he faces instead is the prospect of 20 years or more in federal prison and millions of dollars in fines. Last month, Mr. Davis pleaded guilty to 12 felonies for a brazen insider trading scheme in which he leaked a stream of confidential information about the   Dean Foods while he served as the company’s chairman. When questioned by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, he lied, compounding his securities fraud by committing perjury. And after the F. B. I. agents left, he took a prepaid cellular phone he had used to leak the information and threw it into a creek near his Dallas home, destroying evidence and obstructing justice. Mr. Davis’s crimes have received relatively little attention, in part because of the blaze of publicity that accompanied the flamboyant professional sports gambler William T. Walters, who was accused of being his   and the   Masters golf champion Phil Mickelson. (Mr. Mickelson wasn’t charged but netted nearly $1 million from the Dean Foods tips and agreed to forfeit the proceeds plus interest.) Mr. Walters pleaded not guilty last week to 10 felony counts. What led to Mr. Davis’s actions? His plea hearing, coupled with the S. E. C. and criminal complaints, and interviews with people who know him, offer some clues. For one thing, Mr. Davis was so desperate for money he even took from a charity. According to the S. E. C. Mr. Davis ran a charity that raised money for a Dallas shelter for battered women and children. The charity, tax records show, was Shelter Golf Inc. which held an annual     golf tournament at Preston Trail to benefit Genesis Women’s Shelter  Support. The event typically raised over $400, 000 and, after expenses, contributed about $300, 000 a year to Genesis. Mr. Davis was a   and trustee of Shelter Golf the golf legend Lanny Wadkins was one of five other trustees. According to the S. E. C. in August 2011, Mr. Davis told his assistant to write him a check for $100, 000 on the charity’s account, which he then used to cover an overdraft in his personal checking account of $80, 000. “This $100, 000 check resulted in a significant shortfall in the amount available for donation to the battered women’s shelter,” the S. E. C. said in its complaint. “Davis first delayed the charity’s donation to the shelter and later wrote a check for a partial amount only after prompting by the shelter leader and promising another $100, 000 by the end of the shelter’s fiscal year. ” Mr. Davis eventually repaid the $100, 000 using money he had obtained as part of the insider trading scheme. Many of his former colleagues on Wall Street were stunned by the charges against the distinguished   Mr. Davis, a Harvard Business School graduate and a Navy veteran, who, in contrast to Mr. Walters and Mr. Mickelson, both known gamblers, was seen as a pillar of the business establishment. In addition to his long tenure on the Dean Foods board, culminating in being named chairman in 2013, Mr. Davis served on at least nine other corporate boards, including Triton Energy, Suiza Foods, and the   Colonial Bank (now owned by BBT Financial). He was chief executive of the Concorde Group and a founder of Bluffview Capital, both investment firms. Before that, he was a managing partner at Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette, where he was head of banking and corporate finance for the southwestern United States and handled many mergers and acquisitions. He left after Credit Suisse acquired the firm in 2001. As someone actively involved throughout his career in confidential deals, Mr. Davis would have been acutely aware of insider trading law. “This was a shock,” said John C. Coffee Jr. a professor and expert on insider trading at Columbia Law School who has written about the failure to charge Mr. Mickelson. “He, of all people, should have known better. ” But the annals of insider trading are filled with people who knew better, from Ivan Boesky to Rajat Gupta. What’s perplexing is their motives. Like Mr. Davis, they were already rich and successful beyond most people’s dreams. At his plea hearing last month, Mr. Davis said he knew that his actions were “wrong and unlawful” but otherwise shed little light on why he turned to insider trading. But clearly, he needed money, despite his years of bonuses as a highly paid investment banker and his lucrative directors’ fees. According to the S. E. C. ’s complaint, by April 2010 Mr. Davis was in “desperate” financial straits. He owed the I. R. S. $78, 000. His brokerage account was heavily margined, and he had run up tens of thousands in credit card debt. He owed $550, 000 to one of his investment funds. Mr. Davis sought salvation in gambling and in Mr. Walters, whom he met decades earlier on a golf course. The two often played together, especially when they were both living in Southern California. The insider trading scheme began around June 2008, when Mr. Davis tipped Mr. Walters to Dean Foods’ coming earnings. It isn’t clear who came up with the idea, but Mr. Walters, an active investor, often expressed an interest in how Dean Foods was doing. There was no explicit agreement for Mr. Davis to share in any proceeds from Mr. Walters’s trading. Rather, as Mr. Davis put it at his plea hearing, “I expected that I would receive personal benefits in the form of business opportunities and a potential source of capital. ” As Professor Coffee put it, “This is a perfect example of a favor bank, which is exactly how Wall Street works. ” However vague the terms of their deal, they clearly knew that what they were doing was wrong. Mr. Walters gave Mr. Davis a prepaid cellular phone for use when conveying inside information and told him to use the code “Dallas Cowboys” when referring to Dean Foods, the government asserted. Mr. Davis finally came knocking in April 2010, when he met with Mr. Walters in Las Vegas and asked for money. Mr. Walters arranged a loan of $625, 000, which solved the immediate demands of the I. R. S. and his investment firm. But his spending continued. In just one month, March 2011, Mr. Davis ran up gambling losses of $200, 000 at one Las Vegas casino. He owed $178, 000 for the private jet. And he had to cover the $100, 000 he had taken from the charity. (The overdraft had occurred when the casino cashed in his “markers” after Mr. Davis failed to make good on the gambling losses.) This time Mr. Walters guaranteed a $400, 000 line of credit for Mr. Davis, who promptly drew down $350, 000 of it. And Mr. Davis repaid Mr. Walters’s $625, 000 loan, with interest. Mr. Davis ultimately received over $1 million in “loans” from Mr. Walters, most never repaid. As it turned out, that was a pittance compared to the $43 million in profit Mr. Walters reportedly reaped from Mr. Davis’s tips  —   a sum Mr. Davis learned of only in the course of the investigation. Despite Mr. Davis’s reputation as a skilled deal maker, that will surely rank as one of the worst insider trading deals in history, and it may help explain why Mr. Davis is now cooperating with the government against Mr. Walters. A lawyer for Mr. Davis, Thomas M. Melsheimer at Fish  Richardson in Dallas, declined to comment. The government has shed little light on Mr. Davis’s motive, other than that he needed money. The S. E. C. said he did little to adjust his expensive lifestyle after leaving Credit Suisse in 2001. He experienced a sharp drop in his income, went through an expensive divorce soon after and suffered big investment reversals during the 2008 financial crisis. None of that is a crime. Mr. Davis is hardly alone in trying to maintain the illusion of wealth and prosperity even as his personal finances veered out of control. But after a lifetime of success, Mr. Davis was too proud and too embarrassed to admit any of this and turn to his wealthy friends and fellow golf club members, though many would have been willing to help, according to a person close to him. (This person and others insisted on anonymity because the situation involved a pending criminal matter.) “Some people would risk anything rather than suffer that kind of personal embarrassment,” Professor Coffee said. “And once you’ve decided you’re willing to risk anything, you can get into deep, deep trouble. ”",0
918,Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis,"Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Sesame Seeds for Knee Osteoarthritis 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
Ever since the 1920s, doctors have been injecting arthritis patients with gold. Evidently, “gold-based medicines have been in use for thousands of years,” and remarkably, are still in clinical use as so called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs—meaning they can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. 
Unfortunately, such drugs can be toxic, even fatal, causing conditions such as gold lung, a gold-induced lung disease. “Although its use can be limited by the incidence of serious toxicity,” injectable gold has been shown to be beneficial. But maybe, some researchers suspected, some of that benefit is the sesame oil that’s injected, which is used as the liquid carrier for the gold. 
Sesame seeds contain anti-inflammatory compounds, with names like sesamin and sesamol, which researchers suspect “may serve as a potential treatment for various inflammatory diseases.” But, these were in vitro studies. First, we have to see if it has an anti-inflammatory effect in people, not just cells in a petri dish. But, there haven’t been any studies on the effects of sesame seeds on inflammatory markers in people with arthritis, for example—until now. 
“Considering the high prevalence of osteoarthritis…and since until now there has not been any human studies to evaluate the effect of sesame in [osteoarthritis] patients, this study was designed to assess the effect of administration of sesame [seeds] on inflammation…” And, they found a significant drop in inflammatory markers. But, what effect did it have on their actual disease? 
Fifty patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were split into two groups; standard treatment, or standard treatment plus about a quarter-cup of sesame seeds a day, for two months. Before they started, they described their pain as about 9 out of 10—where zero is no pain, and 10 is the maximum pain tolerable. After two months, the control group felt a little better—pain down to 7. But, the sesame group dropped down to 3.5—significantly lower than the control group. 
The researchers conclude that sesame appeared to have a “positive effect,”“improving clinical signs and symptoms in patients with knee [osteoarthritis].” But, the main problem with this study is that the control group wasn’t given a placebo. It’s hard to come up with a kind of fake sesame seed. But, without a placebo, they basically compared doing nothing to doing something. And, any time you have patients do something special, you can’t discount the placebo effect. 
But, what are the downsides? I mean that’s the nice thing about using food as medicine—only good side effects. Though the results are mixed, there have been studies using placebo controls that found that adding sesame seeds to one’s diet may improve our cholesterol and antioxidant status. And, the amount of sesamin found in as little as about one tablespoon of sesame seeds can modestly lower blood pressure a few points within a month—enough, perhaps, to lower fatal stroke and heart attack risk by about 5%; potentially saving thousands of lives.

920,Pennsylvania Republican Pushing Ban on Private Gun Sales - Breitbart,"Pennsylvania State Rep. Jamie Santora ( ) is pushing a ban on private gun sales nearly identical to the ones Michael   Moms Demand Action pushed in Washington state, Maine, and Nevada. [Santora’s bill would bar the private sales that Americans have enjoyed since the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791 and would require that every sale be processed in front of an agent of the government via a background check.  This means that   Pennsylvanians selling a gun to a fellow hunter, lifelong   or childhood friend would have to seek out a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder and the   buyer would have to pass a background check just as the Orlando Pulse attacker (June 12, 2016) the Aurora movie theater attacker (July 20, 2012) Gabby Giffords’ attacker (January 8, 2011) the Fort Hood attacker (November 5, 2009) and the Virginia Tech attacker (April 16, 2007) did. According to the Delaware County News Network, Santora says his attempt to expand the frequency of background checks is “common sense. ” He said, “We’re not trying to take away Second Amendment rights. Anyone who has a gun should have a background check. ” It should be noted that the following individuals all submitted to background checks in order to acquire their guns: The two   of Santora’s gun control bill are Democrats.

921,"Review: In ‘Warcraft,’ Orcs of a Different Domain, Fighting With Heart - The New York Times","Probably the best way to experience “Warcraft,” a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity, is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isn’t your idea of a good movie time, though, I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the   creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage. But there’s more to movies than narrative coherency, as anyone who has sampled the cinema of Michael Bay or certain art films well knows. There is in this movie, for starters, the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings, lovingly fabricated and ornamented   creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English, citing “Beowulf,” one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance, heroes and monsters that are woven into the “Warcraft” DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper) a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army, a rakish    (Travis Fimmel) a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer). If there’s a mythology here, I missed it, much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkien’s world, with its hobbits and Shire. “Warcraft” by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all, though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also, more surprisingly, offers some   notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell) an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate, Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies, which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world, and other stuff happens elsewhere: Jaws clench, bodies fall, and scenes oscillate  —   ’twas ever thus, genrewise. Even so, despite the incessant clashing and clanging, you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones, the director who, against the odds, has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels, comics and assorted schlock (toys, costumes, a   set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that “Warcraft” is such an obvious bid at brand expansion, which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story. Apparently, branded content (i. e. the characters, their world) was meant to be enough. Whether you see more here will depend on your mileage and patience, though moviegoers habituated to   (and the perfunctory she) pulverizing one another for 100 or so minutes are likely to have greater tolerance for this diversion than others might. As suggested, trying to figure out who’s doing what to whom and why  —   or how orcs dress with such huge hands or how they chew steak with those tusks  —   is often pointless when it comes to spectacles. In cinema’s earliest years, moviegoers thrilled not to stories but what the scholar Tom Gunning calls “the cinema of attractions,” with its   shocks and tricks we’re still getting pummeled, story or no. Mr. Jones doubles down on the action, though without any real shocks (or awe) but he also modestly complicates the question of the monstrous. The orcs in “Warcraft” prove somewhat more psychologically complex than any number of cartoon Hollywood villains  —   they’re sincere, for one  —   and they’re generally better company than the king and his crew. It says something about Mr. Jones’s choices that he gives Durotan so much screen time and that Mr. Kebbell, with the help of the   wizards, makes good use of that time with a nuanced,   turn that evokes   gladiators like Victor Mature. Durotan is a beautiful brute, and all the more human for it. “Warcraft” is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned). Heads pop like grapes and so forth. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.",0

923,"For Those Who Have It All, Charitable Wedding Registries - The New York Times","Christopher and Deirdre Culver met four years ago in Newport, R. I. aboard his yacht, through mutual friends. Their courtship was rooted in their love of the sea and of sailing. One sign that they made a good couple was the experience they had sailing together on his yacht in a race. “He’s very calm,” Ms. Culver said. “He thinks of it as a team effort. We win as a team, we lose as a team. ” Both in their 50s and successful in their own careers, the Culvers felt they needed nothing in the way of gifts when they married two years ago at the American Yacht Club in Rye, N. Y. He is the chief executive of the Health Media Network, a technology company. She is a vice president at Brookside Mezzanine Partners, which provides financing to small and   companies. They decided to put just one item on their registry: a link to Sail to Prevail, a charity that teaches disabled children and adults to sail and in the process imparts life skills. The Culvers’ wedding ended up raising enough money to help the group build an endowment, with some money left over for general operating expenses. “It made a major, significant difference,” said Paul Callahan, chief executive of Sail to Prevail. “We’ve got a   budget and it helped seed that comfortably. ” Technology has made it easier for couples, from millennials to older adults, to replace wedding gifts with charitable donations. Given the vast amount of money spent on weddings in the United States each year, this shift could move the charitable needle in a major way. In 2015, 2. 2 million couples married in the United States, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Last year, couples spent, on average, $35, 000 to cover the costs of their big day, according to the annual survey by the Knot, the wedding website, of its membership. Their guests spent, on average, $127 on a gift if they were family members and $99 if they were friends, according to an American Express survey. Wedding planners and philanthropic advisers say the interest in including a charity on a wedding registry has paralleled the growth of internet registries. In essence, when guests can click online boxes for wine glasses, vases, china sets, silverware and silver picture frames, it is just as simple to add a link to a charity of the couple’s choice. “It’s easy for people who don’t have the dream of a registry for gifts in the traditional way,” said Anthony Taccetta, a wedding and event planner in New York. He said he recently worked with one couple who wanted donations to go to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center in New York and raised over $10, 000. Another couple, who had their dog in their wedding, were able to raise more than $15, 000 for the Humane Society of New York. Lindsay McKay, 37, and James Nero, 38, who are to be married in September in Santa Barbara, Calif. are making the rescue dog that brought them together a focus of their wedding. While they are registered at traditional places like   they are also asking people to make donations to a   animal shelter in Los Angeles. Ms. McKay credits the dog she adopted from the shelter with leading her to slow down in her life  —   she’s a Hollywood costume designer  —   and making herself more open to a relationship. Adding a nonprofit organization to a registry is fairly simple. The Culvers simply put a link on their wedding website to Sail to Prevail. Ms. McKay and Mr. Nero broached the idea with their wedding planner, Beth Helmstetter, who about a year ago started a website called the Good Beginning, to ease the process of charitable   for guests and make gifts trackable the way they are in a regular registry for couples. “What is important to couples is they want to be able to thank people for those donations,” said Ms. Helmstetter, who charges 10 percent of the donation for the service. Since it started last year, some 800 couples have used the platform to set up charitable gift registries, including 10 of her client couples, she said. She hopes to reach $500, 000 in donations by next year. Ms. Helmstetter is not alone. Other websites, including Blueprint Registry, SimpleRegistry and JustGive, allow charities to be added to wedding registries. Of course, for many couples, wedding presents give them their start in life. Those sheets, plates and glasses are practical help in setting up their lives together as much as they are nice gifts. But more affluent couples who can afford to buy what they want or older couples who have already accumulated what they need often face the opposite problem: having two of everything. They may even be preparing to downsize. While it might be easy to dismiss these charitable options as just one more request of guests who may already be spending a lot of money traveling to a wedding, the registries have the potential to be effective and to have a positive impact. “I think there’s a growing awareness among millennials that what you do with your whole life should reflect your values,” said Melissa A. Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors. “Millennials have really pushed this into the forefront. ” For the charities themselves, being given prominent billing on a couple’s wedding day, when their closest friends and family are there, can bring new donors to the cause. “From where I sit, it’s awfully thoughtful and generous,” Mr. Callahan of Sail to Prevail said. “When you do something so special as this at one of the two to three most important days of your life, it sends a message to the people who are close to you. ” Ms. Culver said what made her happiest were the guests who were not sailors and did not know about Sail to Prevail ahead of time. “We got some great bites,” she said. “I wouldn’t care if someone gave $10 or $100. ” Putting a charity on a wedding registry is not without some risk. With some causes, there is the potential to alienate guests. Ms. Berman said making Planned Parenthood the recipient of wedding largess, for example, could risk alienating guests who are opposed to the organization’s mission. “Guests might feel like they’re being told their values are wrong,” she said. “Most people I know who are doing this always offer this as an option. Or they stick to charities everyone is O. K. with or say, ‘some other organization of your choice. ’” If couples still want or need gifts, Mr. Taccetta said, they can incorporate a donation into the party favors. He said he had clients who totaled up what they would spend on party favors  —   generally $5 to $100 per person  —   and made a donation in that amount to their favorite charities. “They just leave a note saying a donation has been made in your name to an organization in lieu of a gift,” he said. “It’s another way to bring a donation into a wedding. ” And it also saves guests from having to cart home a jar full of seashells or other cute but useless mementos.",0
924,THIS IS IT: NYPD Just Raided Hillary’s Property! What They Found Will RUIN HER LIFE • USA Newsflash,"USA News Flash 1 Comment 
As you know, the NYPD confiscated Huma and Antony Weiner’s home devices as part of the investigation into Weiner’s “sexting” with underage girls. 
Well guess what… the cops didn’t stop only with them. They also raider Hillary’s property and guess what they found?! 
An NYPD source just claimed that within the emails on that device, Hillary and Bill are directly implicated ins a MASSIVE child sex/trafficking ring along with their friend, and convicted pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein. (See Below) 
According to the source, 
“…It’s much more vile and serious than classified material on Weiner’s device. The emails DETAIL the trips made by Weiner, Bill and Hillary on their pedophile billionaire friend’s plane, the Lolita Express.” 
“We’re talking an international child enslavement and sex ring“ 
These claims were backed up by other NYPD sources as well: 
Jeff Epstein is a level-3 registered sex offender and the media ignores the fact hat Bill Clinton flew 26 times on Epstein’s private Jet and allegedly visited Epstein’s sex slave island. Now that Hillary has also been directly implicated, the media cannot ignore this any longer! 
The NYPD source makes specific claims about her involvement. He says, “Hillary has a well documented predilection for underage girls, and Mr. Weiner could not bear to see those details deleted.” 
This can very well be the biggest scandal of Hillary Clinton. She is definitely losing the election after this. 
Let’s all share this article everywhere and expose her! The media refuses to cover this, but we will.

925,Feinstein: Gorsuch’s ’Originalist’ Doctrine ’Really Troubling’ - Originalism Would Have Allowed Segregation - Breitbart,"During the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch on Monday, Ranking Member Senator Dianne Feinstein ( ) said she was troubled by Gorsuch’s “originalist” judicial philosophy, and that “if we were to dogmatically adhere to originalist interpretations, then we would still have segregated schools and bans on interracial marriage, women wouldn’t be entitled to equal protection under the law, and government discrimination against LGBT Americans would be permitted. ”  Feinstein said, “Judge Gorsuch has also stated that he believes judges should look to the original public meaning of the Constitution when they decide what a provision of the Constitution means. This is personal, but I find this originalist judicial philosophy to be really troubling. In essence, it means the judges and courts should evaluate our constitutional rights and privileges as they were understood in 1789. However, to do so, would not only ignored the intent of the framers, that the Constitution would be a framework on which to build, but it severely limit the genius of what our Constitution upholds. I firmly believe the American Constitution is a living document, intended to evolve as our country evolves. In 1789, a population of the United States was under 4 million. Today, we’re 325 million and growing. At the time of our founding,   were enslaved. it was not so long after women had been burned at the stake for witchcraft, and the idea of an automobile, let alone the Internet, was unfathomable. In fact, if we were to dogmatically adhere to originalist interpretations, then we would still have segregated schools and bans on interracial marriage, women wouldn’t be entitled to equal protection under the law, and government discrimination against LGBT Americans would be permitted. So I am concerned when I hear that Judge Gorsuch is an originalist and a strict constructionist. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
926,Confrontations Flare as Obama’s Traveling Party Reaches China - The New York Times,"HANGZHOU, China  —   Air Force One had a bumpy landing in Hangzhou on Saturday, but it was nothing compared with what happened after the plane rolled to a stop. As the reporters who traveled to the Group of 20 summit meeting with President Obama from Hawaii piled out and walked under the wing to record his arrival, we were abruptly met by a line of bright blue tape, held taut by security guards. In six years of covering the White House, I had never seen a foreign host prevent the news media from watching Mr. Obama disembark. When a White House staff member protested to a Chinese security official that this was not normal protocol, the official shouted, “This is our country. ” In another departure from protocol, there was no rolling staircase for Mr. Obama to descend in view of the television cameras. Instead, he emerged from a door in the belly of the plane that he usually uses only on   trips, like those to Afghanistan. Witnessing the scene, Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, looked baffled and annoyed. Joined by her deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, she ducked under the rope to make her way closer to the president. The two were immediately stopped by the same Chinese official, who angrily challenged them. Asked later what happened, a diplomatic Ms. Rice replied, “They did things that weren’t anticipated. ” There were further surprises. At the West Lake State House, where Mr. Obama met President Xi Jinping, White House aides, protocol officers and Secret Service agents got into a series of shouting matches over how many Americans should be allowed into the building before Mr. Obama’s arrival. There were fears the confrontation would become physical. “Calm down, please,” an American official said, according to a pool report. A Chinese foreign ministry official said, “Stop, please,” adding, “There are reporters there. ” To some in Mr. Obama’s delegation, it was reminiscent of the rough treatment he received on his first trip to China, in 2009. Then the Chinese refused to broadcast on state television a    meeting packed the hall with Communist Party loyalists and censored an interview he gave to a Chinese publication. At the time, many viewed the treatment as a metaphor for a rising power flexing its muscles with a young president from a superpower in decline. In later visits, the White House has pushed the Chinese for better news media access  —   with some success. In November 2014, the Chinese agreed to have Mr. Xi take questions at a news conference with Mr. Obama in the Great Hall of the People. When I asked Mr. Xi about the Chinese government’s refusal to renew visas for foreign correspondents, including some from The New York Times, he offered a curt lecture. When one’s car breaks down, he said, “perhaps we need to get off the car and see where the problem lies. ” On this trip, there was little threat of reporters making trouble. China has placed tight restrictions on foreign news media coverage of the entire summit meeting. When Mr. Xi took Mr. Obama on a leisurely stroll after dinner on Saturday, Chinese security cut the number of American journalists allowed to witness it to three from the original six, then ultimately to a single reporter. “This is our arrangement,” a Chinese official explained to his American counterpart, according to a pool report. “Your arrangement keeps changing,” the American replied. Asked on Sunday about the conflict, Mr. Obama noted that it was not the first time there had been tension with the Chinese over security and news media access during his travels here. This time, he said, “the seams are showing a little more than usual. ” But Mr. Obama said it had no bearing on the broader relationship. “I wouldn’t   the significance of it,” he said.",0
927,3 Reasons Why You Should Apply For A Job In The Trump Administration,"With the election over and done with, America is turning its attention to the transition from President Obama to President Trump. In barely two months, the Donald will take office, ejecting the Democrats’ coterie of corrupt courtiers and beginning his mission to right America’s wrongs . But President Trump can’t do it alone: he needs good, talented people to work under him and carry out the hard work of making America great again.
That’s where you come in.
The Trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in January. We are officially calling on all ready and able Return Of Kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers. Here’s why you should consider a job in President Trump’s administration (beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige)…
1. It’ll help keep President Trump accountable 
While the media is lying about Trump reneging on his campaign promises, it’s still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word. By staffing his administration with committed nationalists, we’ll make it easier for President Trump to fulfill his political program, as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises. Remember, it was rank-and-file FBI agents who forced James Comey to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton ; a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda.
2. You’ll be able to make history 
Given the momentous task of rebuilding America after eight years of Obama’s perfidy and failure, you almost have a civic duty to help President Trump in his mission. Expecting America to become great again all on its own is delusional; we need to do our part to restore this nation’s glory. By working with the Trump administration, you’ll have a direct role in reshaping America for years—possibly decades—to come.
3. You’ll help trigger the left 
Despite their massive losses in the election—beyond Hillary Clinton’s defeat, the Democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the GOP’s Congressional majority—the leftist mainstream media is trying to order Trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled Bush’s and Obama’s. Right now, they’re freaking out over Breitbart executive chairman Stephen Bannon being appointed as Trump’s chief strategist .
By joining the Trump administration, you’ll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence. Nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power, which they’ve controlled for decades. Watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of Trump’s victory, and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come.
If you think you have the job skills, Return Of Kings highly recommends you apply for a job in Trump’s administration . President Trump may have started the fire, but it’s our job to help the fire rise.

The great irony will not be lost on precious metals investors… 

From Dr. Jeffrey Lewis : 
We live in a world where the yield-starved and tech-savvy conspire in the basement of the underground and unaccounted. While the rise of Bitcoin and the explosion of alternative currencies may become the new scapegoat of behavioral finance, there is nothing quite like the reality of trickle down finance gone wrong. 
Recently, EU officials called for putting safeguards on Internet currency. 
The European Banking Authority called on the EU to develop safeguards for trading platforms. They were also called to start groups to oversee each Internet currency to ensure that no individual can manipulate the integrity of a particular virtual currency scheme and its key components. In the meantime, banks shouldn’t buy, hold or sell virtual currencies. 
They stated: 
“European Union banks should shun virtual currencies such as Bitcoin until rules to prevent abuses are put in place, according to the Bloc.” 
This would be sad if it wasn’t so ironic. 
It is also ironic that one of the other excuses for regulation is that electronic currencies make it harder for regulators to “manage monetary policy”, which is one of the reasons for using alt currencies to begin with to avoid the unintended consequences of intervention. 
The key point is that media and the financial elite see the central banks as regulators and policy makers. 
The 100 year old central banking meme is still very much alive and well. 
On the surface, Bitcoin represents many things. To the precious metals inclined, it is often framed as an alternative or substitute. 
But it is better to view the phenomenon and an anonymous currency with market backing. 
The Bitcoin trading is well advanced. Not only do dozens of exchanges exist, but they are also functioning like their mainstream financial counterparts. 
Yes, similar equities and other paper trading vehicles borrowing Bitcoins is a robust and well entrenched phenomenon. Margin swaps run in excess of $25 million on a daily basis. 
Spin-off currencies are an even more dramatic spectacle. Well in excess of 200 individual currencies, these “software code-backed” instruments are born on an almost weekly basis. Coders, the exchanges, and a handful of insiders collude on the rise and inevitable fall of these new alternative currencies. New crypto currency launches come equipped with the most advanced automated social media marketing tactics. 
The tactics used to launch a new currency are an extension of those pioneered by the penny stock ‘pump and dump’ phenomenon. At least the penny stocks have some form of backing — and not just code. 
Regulation of these markets is a show. 
First of all, regulators do not understand alt currencies anymore than they understand high frequency trading or algorithm. And secondly, while there is certainly a taboo associated with this, there really isn’t much money to go after. 
In addition, the rate in which these new currencies crash and burn (and the relatively small size of the pool) results in an odd form of self or market regulation. Alternative currencies beckon for their own form of backing. 
But speaking of justice and regulation… 
Isn’t it ironic that any fuss should be made over these small markets, when a journey up the chain of modern finance reveals the same corruption and collusion – only worse? 
When you consider that mainstream financial regulators are always one step from rotating into the banks they are charged with regulating, it becomes much easier to fathom the astounding degree of corruption. 
And then there are the precious metals markets. 
Regulators, exchanges, and a small handful of advantaged and well positioned players have access to the greatest ongoing pump and dump scheme imaginable. 
It makes what happens in the alt currencies seem like child’s play – which is some ways it is when you consider the average age of the typical coder copying and pasting the next program into the next new currency. 
The great irony will not be lost on precious metals investors. As the alt currency markets burn themselves out one by one before regulators have a chance to get close, the fuse has been lit on another (largely) limitless electronic experiment gone wrong. As the gold and silver pump and dump becomes recognized for the scam that it is, the desperate search for wealth will become apparent and too late for most.",0

931,Can You Hear Agnes Martin’s Serenity in John Zorn’s Frenzied Music? - The New York Times,"There could not, on first glance or listen, be two artists more different than John Zorn and Agnes Martin. Mr. Zorn, 63, a longtime fixture of downtown Manhattan, is known for composing frenzied, explosive music, riots of psychotically bright colors. Martin  —   who lived alone in the New Mexico desert for decades, died in 2004 at 92 and is currently the subject of a quietly majestic retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum  —   made paintings of serene subtlety. Mr. Zorn stated the obvious question as he walked on Monday morning around the Guggenheim’s rotunda, where a series of his   works will be played on Thursday and Friday evenings. “Crazy John Zorn and Agnes Martin, the spiritual, the saint,” he said. “Where does it connect?” In fact, the connections go back to Mr. Zorn’s teenage years in New York, when he first encountered Martin’s painting “Red Bird,” with faint lines in colored pencil on a   background, at the Museum of Modern Art. “I was completely hypnotized by it,” he said. Martin had by then grown famous for her softly colored grids, but Mr. Zorn found in her art as much passion as precision. “When I look at her work, I don’t see horizontal lines,” he said. “I don’t see a grid. I see a glow. It’s a feeling that’s going on here. ” Walking up to one of the paintings at the Guggenheim, he added: “You see all these minute  —   you could call them mistakes. It’s supposed to be a straight line, but it’s not a straight line. But she accepts those irregularities, the imperfections that make it perfect. That’s improvisation. Playing, and making a mistake, but you keep working with that mistake and it makes it right. ” It’s in that spirit of improvisation that Mr. Zorn, with his grounding in jazz, perceives a connection between his work and Martin’s that transcends their obvious differences. (“I can’t just go to the desert and start writing,” he said. “That’s not who I am. ”) But they share, in his telling, a fundamental focus on their work and a perpetual need for the sensory rejuvenation aloneness brings, whether in the expanses of New Mexico or the chaos of the East Village. “She lived in a desert environment,” he said. “I live in a city environment. My home is a device to enable creativity. It’s my desert, it’s where I’m going to get those receptors open. ” “As crazy as my work may sound,” he added, “even at its craziest, there is a spiritual practice going on in the process. ” Mr. Zorn long ago gave up on the idea of seriously collecting Martin’s work. (One of her paintings sold at auction this year for more than $10 million.) Instead, he has accumulated old posters for her gallery shows. His musical tributes to her began in the 1990s, when he returned to a few hypnotic, sensuous chords he had created as part of a soundtrack for a lesbian erotic film. Playing with the chords, Mr. Zorn stretched them into a   piece that amplified that mesmerizing quality. He hadn’t been thinking explicitly of Martin while composing, but when he finished, he said, he realized, “Oh, this is an Agnes Martin thing. ” “Her work has a hypnotic vibe to it, you know,” he added. “It has introspection. And it flows in a sensual way, and that’s what those chords did. ” “Redbird,” as he called the piece, moves forward in a long series of calm yet ominous downbeats and their comet trails of resonance, sprinkled with slight rustles of percussion and the smoky undercurrent of a jazz club. The general stillness quivers with the expectancy of a long Morton Feldman work when “Redbird” came out, some summed it up as “Zorn does Feldman. ” Translating the order of the chords in “Redbird” into the duration of hits on four bass drums, he created the booming “Dark River,” and released the two works together. When the Guggenheim was planning its Martin retrospective (a traveling exhibition that, since the summer of 2015, has visited museums in London Düsseldorf, Germany and Los Angeles) officials there, having heard “Redbird,” asked Mr. Zorn if he would perform it live. He demurred, believing that the piece, intended to be heard solely in recorded form, wasn’t meant to be revived in person. But he surprised the museum by offering to write something new instead  —   and for free. (Mr. Zorn said that he does not accept commissions, preferring to follow the timetable and subject matter his inspiration dictates.) At the time, he was mulling a piece for the American Brass Quintet. While he usually composes scores in full, all at once, this time he started with a simpler harmonic progression, which he wrote down on a   staff. (Think of piano music.) When it was done, though, it somehow didn’t seem like a brass piece: It felt, instead, like a work for harp. That became “Praise,” which surrounds a harpist with electronics and percussion. Just as Mr. Zorn considers “Dark River” a précis of “Redbird,” so is “Praise” a précis of “Blue Stratagem,” the piece he eventually made for the brass quintet, featuring the same harmonic motion. Both new works will have their premiere at the Guggenheim this week, alongside “Dark River” and “Curling” (1977) one of the   “game pieces” that Mr. Zorn created early in his career. “Redbird” will play over speakers as the audience tours the exhibition after the concert. It is not the first time Mr. Zorn has occupied a major museum in recent years. This downtown doyen, once an enfant terrible and now an established master, was celebrated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on his 60th birthday in 2013, as performances of his work sprawled through  the building, an experience that, for this art lover, was, “  ” he said. “I’m still naïve enough,” he said as he looked closely at a Martin, “to believe that a few marks on a piece of paper can change the world. ”",0

933,"Iraqi Forces Enter Western Mosul, in Fierce Battle Against ISIS - The New York Times","BAGHDAD  —   Iraqi forces trying to reclaim Mosul penetrated the western part of the city on Tuesday, retaking a bridge and several public buildings during heavy clashes with the Islamic State militants, officials said. Civilians reported that the bombardment and gunfire were the heaviest since Feb. 19, the beginning of the operation to retake the western part of the city  —   the country’s   where roughly a million people are trapped and living in desperate conditions. Soldiers recaptured a branch of the central bank, an archaeological museum that jihadists ransacked after taking the city in 2014, and the Hurriya Bridge, which crosses the Tigris River in the center of the city, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, a military spokesman, said by phone. “We will never stop until we liberate Mosul entirely,” he said. Lt. Gen. Raed Shakir Jawdat, the chief of the federal police, said that security forces had also retaken a government compound. A statement from the   coalition forces assisting the Iraqis gave a similar account of their progress. The museum was a focus of worldwide attention after it was seized by Islamic State militants, who used sledgehammers and drills to smash artifacts in its collection. The destruction horrified scholars around the world. Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir   a spokesman for an elite unit of Interior Ministry troops, said that the buildings retaken from the Islamic State included a courthouse where militants had carried out whippings, stonings and beheadings, as well as a building where militants had thrown people to their deaths. “The liberation of the government compound is a step forward for our forces, a vital motivating position for us,” General Muhammadawi said in an interview. “The international coalition’s airstrikes and drones have played a major role in accelerating the liberation of the city. ” It was not yet clear how lasting the gains would be. Although soldiers raised the Iraqi flag over the government compound, in the Dawasa neighborhood, they were later forced to retreat under heavy fire from Islamic State militants, The Associated Press reported. The museum remained within the range of Islamic State snipers, making it vulnerable to a counterattack. Social media accounts associated with the Islamic State reported that militants had set off three suicide bombs during the offensive. Though the military advances were tenuous, government forces said that Tuesday represented a critical moment in their weekslong offensive to retake western Mosul. The fighting, which included recapturing most of the city’s airport, has not been easy. It took Iraqi forces more than three months to gain control over eastern Mosul, and casualties there were heavy. Prime Minister Haider   and the chief of staff of the country’s armed forces toured the headquarters of the operations command responsible for the offensive, just outside Mosul, on Tuesday to “review the progress of security forces,” according to a statement. The Hurriya, or Freedom, Bridge is the second of five bridges to be retaken by government forces.   airstrikes damaged all five bridges last year in a bid to isolate the militants in Mosul. Mosul fell to the Islamic State in June 2014, along with large parts of the country’s north and west. It is the largest Iraqi population center still wholly or partly in the militant group’s control. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Tuesday that about 46, 000 people had been displaced from their homes in Mosul since Feb. 19  —   including 13, 350 on Friday alone  —   in the highest continuous displacement of civilians since October. “All people displaced from western Mosul have been accommodated either with family members or in camps or emergency sites, where they receive a tented plot, basic household supplies, hygiene kits and   food rations,” the United Nations office said. Camp construction and the installation of water and sanitation services are underway south of Mosul, the office added. Since Feb. 19, the office said, more than 500 people have been treated for   wounds, including 15 people who were hospitalized in Erbil, a   city east of Mosul, for treatment after an apparent   attack. Many in eastern Mosul lack drinking water, officials have warned, and many in the southern and western parts of the city are drinking untreated water, which could lead to the spread of diseases.",0

In a truly shocking twist, the Supreme Court of Austria has decided to acquit the Iraqi man, ""that may not have realised the 10-year-old Austrian boy did not want to be sexually abused by him."" Amir, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna in December 2015, as part of a trip to encourage integration, when the incident occurred.  
Europe - if you can't stand up for your children, who will? Of course there is the fact that Western Europe has supported the US in their violent destruction of the Middle East over the past 20 years. Is it a guilty conscience that seems to appease the blatant criminal activity on behalf of some newcomers? Or are they Soros puppets implanted into the judicial system that are at work? 
Russia is a multicultural and multi-religious society, and has been for 1000 years. The law applies to everyone equally - whether you're a Crimean Tatar or a Slavic Russian - every Russian citizen is 'native' as such and subject to the same protocols.

935,"In Rolling Stone Defamation Case, Magazine and Reporter Ordered to Pay $3 Million - The New York Times","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.  —   A federal jury on Monday ordered Rolling Stone and one of its writers to pay $3 million in damages to a University of Virginia administrator over a discredited article two years ago about a supposed gang rape at the university. The jury in Charlottesville, Va. had already decided on Friday, after a   trial, that Rolling Stone Wenner Media, its parent company and Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the author of the article, were all liable for defamation in a case that centered on faulty reporting and a failure to apply basic   in editing. After deliberating for less than two hours on Monday, the jury of eight women and two men decided that Ms. Erdely was liable for $2 million of the total, and Rolling Stone and Wenner Media for $1 million. In her suit, filed in May 2015, the administrator, Nicole P. Eramo, had asked for $7. 5 million in damages. The jury found that assertions made in the story, as well as public statements made after publication by Ms. Erdely and Rolling Stone, were made with “actual malice,” the legal standard for libel against public figures. To meet that standard, a publisher must be found to have known that the information it published was false, or to have had reckless disregard for the truth. Rolling Stone has not said whether it would appeal the verdict. Scott Sexton, a lawyer for Rolling Stone, said on Monday that according to its agreement with Ms. Erdely, the company was obligated to cover “all liability arising out of the article. ” Ms. Erdely and her legal team declined to answer questions after the decision was read. In its decision, the jury made no distinctions about what portion of the damages was tied to the article and what was tied to other comments made by Ms. Erdely and Rolling Stone after publication. Outside the courtroom on Monday night, Deborah J. Parmelee, a teacher who was the jury forewoman, read a brief statement from the jury that said, in part: “With careful consideration of the facts in evidence for determining damages, the jury made its determination. We were proud to execute our civic duty. ” Ms. Parmelee declined to answer any further questions about the case. The article, “A Rape on Campus,” was published in November 2014 and intensified national attention on sexual assault of college students. But the article was soon called into question for its reliance on a single source, identified only as Jackie, in describing a brutal gang rape at a fraternity party near the grounds of the university, which was founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819 and is steeped in tradition. After a report by the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism reprimanded Rolling Stone for failing to take fundamental steps to verify Jackie’s account, and after the Charlottesville police said they had found no evidence that an episode like the one described had occurred, the magazine retracted the article and removed it from its website. Ms. Eramo, the former associate dean of students, sued for defamation, saying that she had been made out to be the “chief villain” in the article, which portrayed the university administration as being indifferent to the threat of sexual assault on campus. In one of the story’s most scalding passages, Jackie said that Ms. Eramo had told her, “Nobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school. ” Testifying on Monday in the damages hearing, Ms. Eramo wept repeatedly as she recounted personal and professional difficulties after the article was published. She spoke of a loss of   and a change of her job at the university. Some members of the jury could be seen dabbing tears during Ms. Eramo’s testimony. Rolling Stone’s lawyers pointed out that since the article was published, Ms. Eramo has gotten two raises, and her salary is now set at $113, 000 a year. They also noted that a report from the United States Department of Education backed up the magazine’s general findings by criticizing how the University of Virginia handled sexual assault cases. David Paxton, a lawyer for Rolling Stone, also stressed how much the article had already damaged the magazine’s reputation. “This has been a badge of shame,” he said, “for Rolling Stone and Ms. Erdely. ” But Ms. Eramo found that response wanting. “It took two years and all this to get an apology,” Ms. Eramo said, gesturing around the courtroom. “And I still don’t believe it is a real apology. The regret I see is that they’re in the position they’re in today. ”",0

937,"Taiwan, Italy, Joe McKnight: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump spoke with the president of Taiwan, a striking break from decades of diplomatic practice that could cause a major rift with China. He was back in New York after Thursday’s victory tour in Indiana and Ohio. Emotions are still raw from the campaign, evidenced during an angry debate between top strategists from the campaigns of Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton. In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Mr. Trump’s supporters filed legal challenges to stop recount efforts. _____ 2. Mr. Trump will inherit an unusually strong economy, with the official unemployment rate, 4. 6 percent, at its lowest level in more than nine years. Employers added 178, 000 workers in November, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate. Housing prices are up, consumer confidence is high and the American economy grew by a healthy 3. 2 percent during the third quarter. But millions of workers continue to feel the recovery has passed them by. _____ 3. We’ve taken a closer look at the complications Mr. Trump will face in fulfilling some of his campaign promises. On immigration, his plan to deport millions of immigrants could be stalled by courts that are already crippled by a backlog of more than 520, 000 cases. And if he follows through on punishing countries he deems guilty of unfair trade, American manufacturers who rely on imports to build their products could be hurt as well. _____ 4. A jury in Charleston  signaled that it was within a single vote of convicting a white former police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man. Video of the shooting, which showed Michael Slager, above left, firing shots at Walter Scott as he fled after a traffic stop last year, rocketed into the national consciousness. “I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict,” a single, unidentified juror wrote in a letter to the judge. “We may never reach a unanimous decision. ” _____ 5. A man arrested in the fatal shooting of Joe McKnight, above, a former N. F. L. player, was released without charge, sparking outrage on social media. Law enforcement officials in Louisiana, where the shooting happened on Thursday, said it might have been spurred by a “possible road rage incident” and remained under investigation. McKnight played for the New York Jets before the team cut him in 2013. _____ 6. Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, may be the next leader crushed by the wave of populist anger that has upended political establishments in Europe and the U. S. Mr. Renzi has vowed to resign if voters reject a measure to overhaul the country’s constitution in a referendum on Sunday. Polls indicate that the measure may fail, largely because of disillusioned young voters. In West Africa, voters in Gambia ousted a strongman who had reigned for 22 years. _____ 7. Friday marks one year since a married couple attacked public health employees in San Bernardino, Calif. killing 14 and seriously injuring 22 others. For survivors, like Amanda Gaspard, above with her parents, the long road to recovery has been complicated by repeated denials for medical care. Because the shooting was a workplace attack, a restrictive workers’ compensation system is responsible for their coverage. _____ 8. A tournament that bills itself as the Super Bowl of double dutch will have its 25th anniversary on Sunday in Harlem. The schoolyard game, which was adopted and perfected by black girls in urban American communities after World War II, has fallen out of favor in the neighborhoods where it was born. But its appeal has spread abroad: Teams from France and Japan will be competing this weekend. _____ 9. For the first time in more than 100 years, the Metropolitan Opera in New York is performing a work composed by a woman. The opera, “L’Amour de Loin” (“Love From Afar”) by Kaija Saariaho, above, debuted this week with a female conductor, Susanna Malkki, as well. Ms. Malkki became only the fourth woman to take the podium in the company’s history. _____ 10. Finally, let us introduce you to the participants of this year’s Ms. Senior America Pageant, a celebration of women of a certain age  —   “between 60 and death,” one contestant joked.

938,"Shiite militia says it is close to Tal Afar, which Turkey has warned is off limits","Trump rape accuser skips press conference, citing threats ‹ › GPD is our General Posting Department whereby we share posts from other sources along with general information with our readers. It is managed by our Editorial Board Shiite militia says it is close to Tal Afar, which Turkey has warned is off limits By GPD on November 4, 2016 By Rudaw ERBIL, Kurdistan Region – The Shiite-led Hashd al-Shaabi militia said Thursday that its forces are 15 kilometers from Tal Afar, a Turkmen town that Turkey has warned the militia to stay clear of. “The Hashd al-Shaabi are continuously advancing and we are just 15 kilometers from Tal Afar” and nearing the Mosul-Raqqa road, Karim Nuri, spokesperson of the Hashd al-Shaabi, told Rudaw. He said he hoped that “in a few hours” his forces will be in control of the Mosul-Raqqa road, a critical supply line for the two ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria. Nuri said the Iranian-backed Hashd had not received any air support from the coalition, which had from the outset opposed any role for the militia in the Mosul offensive. Tal Afar, north of Mosul city, is a predominantly Turkmen town that was captured by ISIS two years ago when the group captured large swathes of land in the north. Turkey has warned Hashd forces from entering Tal Afar, for fear the Shiite militia would brutalize the town’s population, which is divided between Sunnis and Shiites. Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country opposed any Hashd presence in Tal Afar. “Tal Afar is a very sensitive issue for us. We definitely do not regard it [Hashd involvement] positively in Tal Afar and Sinjar. I already told this to officials clearly,” Erdogan said Saturday. “Tal Afar is a totally Turkmen city, with half Shiite and half Sunni Muslims. We do not judge people by their religious affiliation, we regard them as Muslims,” he added, “But if Hashd al-Shaabi terrorizes the region, our response would be different.” Related Posts: No Related Posts The   GPD   19 Reads Filed under World  ",0
940,Brother of Clinton’s Campaign Chair is an Active Foreign Agent on the Saudi Arabian Payroll,"Free Thought Project – by Claire Bernish 
Tony Podesta — brother of the now-disgraced Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, whose files Wikileaks has been publishing — is not only a powerful Democratic Party lobbyist, but a registered foreign agent receiving a hefty monthly paycheck from the nefarious government of Saudi Arabia. 
No — as tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist as it might sound — that scenario is the absolute truth. 
In 1988, John and Tony Podesta formed the Podesta Group and have used their bigwig party-insider status to lobby and influence government policies — while, at various times, simultaneously holding positions of power — which has created a number of glaring conflicts of interest. 
According to the March 2016 filing made in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, Tony Podesta is an active foreign agent of the Saudi government with the “ Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court ,” and acts as an officer of the Saudi Arabia account. 
At this point, the web of pay-for-play between the Washington, political heavyweights, and foreign governments comes lurching into the spotlight. 
For starters, the Podesta brothers’ lobbying firm receives $140,000 every month from the Saudi government, which, in no uncertain terms — and despite a status as privileged U.S. ally — wages a bloody campaign of censorship, murder, suppression, human rights abuse, and worse against its civilian population, while bombing hospitals, schools, and aid convoys in neighboring nations. 
John Podesta previously served as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, founded the think tank Center for American Progress (which oh-so-coincidentally touts the need to reframe Saudi Arabia’s hopelessly tarnished image), counseled President Obama, and now chairs Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
Tony Podesta acts as a foreign agent for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia — lobbying to influence government policy in favor of the Kingdom — while also contributing to and bundling for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
Think about that for a moment. 
One brother uses the influence of money to both affect United States foreign policy and infuse the Clinton campaign with cash — while the other wields the influence of power as a political insider for the same entities. 
As the Washington Post reported months ago in July, Tony Podesta’s lobbying efforts “raised $268,000 for the campaign and $31,000 for the victory fund.” 
“The Saudis hired the Podesta Group in 2015 because it was getting hammered in the press over civilian casualties from its airstrikes in Yemen and its crackdown on political dissidents at home, including sentencing blogger Raif Badawi to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ‘insulting Islam,’” Alternet reported . “Since then, Tony Podesta’s fingerprints have been all over Saudi Arabia’s advocacy efforts in Washington DC. When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.” 
Notably, the Saudis’ reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up — concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. 
Additionally, Tony Podesta’s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 — ironically revealed by Wikileaks’ publishing of his brothers personal communiques — in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: 
“Hi all – we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. 
“I do want to push back a bit (it’s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)… and how do we explain to people that we’ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won’t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.” 
To which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], 
“Responding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada can’t give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama.” 
As the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaign’s image with potentially controversial donors — while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash — becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, 
“Where do we draw the line though?” 
Elias suggests a particularly intricate solution: 
“If we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary’s time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary’s past campaigns specifically. 
“Put simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. 
“As a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this – we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I’m just offering this up as a middle ground.” 
Mook eventually decides plainly, 
“Marc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don’t really get you anything…that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So…in a complete U-turn, I’m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?” 
All of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect — despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime — the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. 
Tony Podesta’s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by year’s end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. 
“Saudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington,” Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . “That spans both what you’d call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.” 
That broader audience — the American public — has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. 
As The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable — including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. 
Although this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House — who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. 
The system isn’t rigged — it’s performing exactly as intended — and always will as long as the vote validates its existence. Read more at http://thefreethoughtproject.com/clinton-podesta-campaign-saudi-arabia/#gYcjBFazk755MGcp.99 Share this:",0
941,‘We Must Fight Them’: Trump Goes After Conservatives of Freedom Caucus - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump launched a vengeful tirade against conservatives in his own party on Thursday in an attempt to   health care talks and show that he remains a force to be feared in the looming battles over the budget, a tax overhaul and infrastructure. In an early morning Twitter attack, Mr. Trump singled out members of the House Freedom Caucus, which scuttled his health care overhaul last week. “The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don’t get on the team,  fast,” he wrote. “We must fight them,  Dems, in 2018!” He continued on Twitter throughout the day, naming individual members of the caucus, likening them to Democrats and urging other Republicans to “fight them” in the 2018 midterm elections if they do not back his agenda. But the Republican upstarts hardly cowered in the face of Mr. Trump’s criticism. They struck back, some of them ridiculing the president, using his own taunting and confrontational social media style. “Stockholm Syndrome?” Representative Tom Garrett of Virginia asked on Twitter, suggesting that the president had become captive to the Republican establishment he attacked during the campaign. “It’s a swamp not a hot tub. We both came here to drain it. #SwampCare polls 17%. Sad!” wrote Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who often sides with the caucus on votes, mocking the president’s    campaign pledge. This was the moment when Mr. Trump, riding a wave of populist anger, was supposed to be at his most fearsome  —   enforcing discipline on his fragmented party. But in the wake of last week’s stunning defeat of legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, which further eroded his already flagging poll numbers, Mr. Trump has made an abrupt shift from courting his party’s most conservative lawmakers to hurling threats at them, a vivid illustration of his difficulties uniting a   Republican Party. “Intimidation may work with some in the short term, but it never really works in the long run,” said Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who opposed the health overhaul pushed by the White House and written by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Trump and his team believe the Twitter attacks will   his   leverage in coming negotiations. It also has the added virtue of allowing the most expressive of presidents to give voice to his anger. And they were not done out of impulse. Mr. Trump’s advisers have become more involved in his   Twitter feed in the last few weeks, ever since his impetuous, conspiratorial posts about President Barack Obama’s supposedly wiretapping his phones touched off a   controversy. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, has counseled a tough tone with the rebels, instructing his staff to use Twitter as a rhetorical prod to keep the party in line. Dan Scavino, an aide who controls Mr. Trump’s official White House Twitter account, recently moved into Mr. Bannon’s West Wing office, where he closely monitors social activity by and about the president, according to two officials. A handful of people have always had access to Mr. Trump’s personal Twitter account, but in the weeks since the president’s accusation against his predecessor, there has been a stricter imposition by aides to make sure there is a strategic imperative behind his posts, according to two people briefed on the process. The cannon blasts at the House Freedom Caucus followed nearly a week of the president’s stewing about the debacle over his failed health care effort. He did not take the loss especially well. His aides quickly began discussions about reopening negotiations that would at least demonstrate a commitment to what in the past has been one of his party’s most urgent priorities. The House Freedom Caucus came away from the health care fight feeling emboldened, and Mr. Trump’s senior advisers are now mindful of the need to slow any momentum the group has going into other legislative battles, including the budget fight just four weeks away. The health care bill that the many House members rejected was extremely unpopular. Only 17 percent of Americans  —   and 41 percent of Republicans  —   supported the proposal, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last week. Presidents  —   from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Mr. Obama  —   have said they would campaign against rebels in their own parties, and the threats have mostly been empty. Mr. Trump seems especially   to follow through, senior Republicans say. Beyond blustery Twitter messages, he has so far not shown even a willingness to take them on. In the mostly conservative House districts where Mr. Trump could target lawmakers, voters are likely to be more in sync with their representatives, who felt that the rollback of the law did not go far enough, than their president, who simply wanted a win. When Mr. Sanford, fresh off helping torpedo his party’s health care bill, showed up at a Berkeley County Republican meeting in South Carolina on Saturday, he was met with applause and praise. “It’s fairly banal,” said Representative David Schweikert, Republican of Arizona and a member of the caucus, said of Mr. Trump’s attack. “We are used to it. It goes with the job. He is not the first president who has attacked us, just the first from our own party. ” If the back and forth between Mr. Trump and the House   inflamed tensions between the president and some of his most loyal, if not exactly ideologically aligned, congressional supporters, it bound the president more closely to Mr. Ryan, reinforcing the most unlikely of shotgun political marriages. “I understand the president’s frustration,” Mr. Ryan told reporters on Thursday when asked about the president’s morning Twitter attack. “I share frustration. ” All week, the White House lurched between battering conservatives and trying to win them over. On Wednesday  —   about 18 hours before Mr. Trump’s Twitter blast  —   senior officials invited two dozen leaders from conservative groups for a   session to plot a path ahead. Participants, who were instructed by the organizers of the event not to divulge details of the meeting, or even the groups attending, described the hourlong session as a welcome but long overdue policy discussion. It included a candid, polite airing of complaints that they have been largely left out of the loop on major administration decision making, according to people who attended. The meeting, put together by Mr. Trump’s conservative outreach director, Paul Teller, at the request of conservatives, included representatives of the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Limited Government and Judicial Watch, all of whom were critical of some administration policies, including the health bill. Thomas Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch  —   a conservative legal advocacy group that successfully sued the Obama administration for the release of Hillary Clinton’s State Department emails  —   made a pointed pitch for the release of all documents pertaining to Russia’s interference in the election campaign controversy, according to people who attended the session in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building beside the White House. Mr. Fitton, the participants said, told Mr. Teller that the president needed to be committed to a policy of extreme transparency about contacts between Russian government officials and Trump associates during the 2016 campaign, including Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s   . He also asked Mr. Teller and other administration officials present to more rapidly approve   Freedom of Information requests about Russia and other topics  —   likening the   on legally mandated disclosure to what he said was the Obama administration’s flouting of immigration laws. An activist in attendance said that Mr. Teller nodded, took notes and was noncommittal. Mr. Trump’s targeting of the Freedom Caucus came on a day of an unexpected change in his senior staff. Katie Walsh, a deputy to Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, announced her sudden departure after less than three months on the job to work for a “super PAC” allied with Mr. Trump. The White House offered no explanation for the timing of her departure.",0
942,"ISIS Kidnaps, Kills at Least 30 Civilians in Afghanistan","Locals Say as Many as 42 May Have Been Killed in 'Revenge' Attack   26, 2016 Share This 
Underscoring the group’s growing presence around Afghanistan, ISIS has launched a mass kidnapping and execution in Afghanistan’s Ghor Province today, rounding up and shooting dozens of civilians who were gathering firewood in the hills. 
The victims were nomads from the Kuchi group, and while it was initially thought the attack might’ve been part of an ethnic conflict in the area over sheep ownership, it has since been attributed to ISIS, who officials say has a growing presence in the area and a bone to pick with the Kuchi. 
That the victims were nomads is making it hard to nail down exactly how many people were killed, with official reports saying it was at least 30, and locals saying as many as 42 were missing and presumed to have been killed in the attack. 
Ghor is far afield from the areas ISIS has been previously reported to have a major presence in Afghanistan. Early on they were claimed to be confined to the Nangarhar Province, but have also set up some territorial possessions in the far south.  ",0

945,"Spared by Gunman in Charleston, Churchgoer Describes Night of Terror - The New York Times","CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   Polly Sheppard, a    retired nurse and longtime stalwart of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, dived under a table as the gunfire began and did the only thing she could think to do: She prayed aloud. She could see the bullet casings skittering across the floor of the fellowship hall and the young man’s boots approaching. Dylann S. Roof told her to “shut up,” then asked menacingly if he had shot her yet. “I said ‘no,’” Ms. Sheppard testified on Wednesday, as the final witness in the guilt phase of Mr. Roof’s federal trial on 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death. “And he said, ‘I’m not going to. I’m going to leave you to tell the story. ’” She did, in a panicked call to a 911 operator that night, and again on Wednesday, when she described the events to a courtroom crowded with family members of the nine parishioners Mr. Roof is accused of killing in a massacre on June 17, 2015. After Ms. Sheppard finished testifying, the prosecution rested, and Mr. Roof’s defense lawyers followed suit after declining to call any witnesses. With their eyes on the sentencing phase of the death penalty trial, the lawyers have tried to make suggestions of Mr. Roof’s mental incapacity, but have been allowed little leeway by Judge Richard M. Gergel. Before the defense rested, Judge Gergel, of Federal District Court, summoned Mr. Roof to the bench, placed him under oath out of the jury’s presence and asked if he wanted to testify in his own defense. Mr. Roof, 22, with pale white skin and a distinctive   haircut, said he did not. Judge Gergel has scheduled closing arguments for Thursday, and jurors are then expected to begin deliberations. If Mr. Roof is convicted  —   a virtual certainty, as he confessed in a recorded F. B. I. interview and left a trail of incontrovertible evidence  —   the jury will return in January to hear more evidence and decide whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison. Mr. Roof, who offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life term, plans to represent himself during that phase. He also faces capital murder charges in state court in a trial scheduled to begin on Jan. 17. Over six days, federal prosecutors presented the jury with an array of technical evidence that established the timeline of Mr. Roof’s plot, but they bookended their case with Ms. Sheppard’s testimony and that of her friend and fellow survivor, Felicia Sanders, who appeared as the opening witness. Guided gently through questioning by an assistant United States attorney, Julius N. Richardson, Ms. Sheppard humanized the nine victims. There was the Rev. Daniel Lee Simmons Sr. known as “Dapper Dan,” who always wore a fedora and usually led the Bible study. She spoke of Ethel Lee Lance, who cleaned the church with “a woman’s touch” and loved the song “One Day at a Time. ” Tywanza Sanders had a “big smile,” and his   Susie Jackson, was “a very sweet lady. ” The Rev. DePayne   “could sing like an angel. ” Cynthia Hurd, a librarian, had a soft spot for Zora Neale Hurston. And the Rev. Sharonda   the tall, graceful track coach, could preach like nobody’s business. Ms. Sheppard said she attended the Bible study that night only because her    friend, Myra Thompson, was leading it. She sat near the back because she planned to sneak out early, but Ms. Thompson kept an eye on her. At some point, Ms. Sheppard testified, nodding toward Mr. Roof, “the young man at the table over there joined us. ” She said the church’s pastor, the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, asked Mr. Roof if he was there for the study session, handed him a Bible and a pamphlet about the night’s lesson, and offered him a chair. Usually, Ms. Sheppard said, the group would end with a prayer adapted from Genesis: “The Lord watch between me and thee when we are absent from another. ” But as they rose for the benediction, the gunman began firing, she said. Mr. Pinckney was the first to be shot. Ms. Sheppard said she first thought the explosions had come from the church’s aging wiring but then heard Ms. Sanders scream, “He’s shooting!” She reached for Ms. Lance’s cellphone and, after initially pressing the wrong buttons, managed to dial 911. “He shot the pastor,” she told the dispatcher during a recorded call that was played in court on Wednesday. “He shot all the men in the church. ” Soon after, she told the dispatcher, “There’s so many people dead, I think. Oh, my God. ” When the gunman finally left the building, Ms. Sheppard checked the pulse of Mr. Pinckney and another victim. She found none. Mr. Roof, who confessed that he had planned to kill himself if confronted by the police at the church, fled in his car into the sweltering South Carolina night. He was captured the next day in North Carolina. The evidence that prosecutors presented against him included GPS data showing he had visited the church’s neighborhood six times in the six months before the attack and telephone records showing he had called the church four months before. They also have used Mr. Roof’s writings, photographs and possessions to depict him as a racial extremist. Jurors heard, for instance, that he had downloaded a history of the Ku Klux Klan in August 2014, and that investigators found in his bedroom a pillowcase cut into a triangular shape, perhaps to represent a Klan hood. Prosecutors presented photographs Mr. Roof had taken of the Confederate battle flag when it flew on the grounds of the State House, before its removal in July 2015 in response to the shootings. They had a witness read aloud a white supremacist manifesto that Mr. Roof had posted online. They also showed chilling footage of Mr. Roof’s preparations for his assault on the church, including surveillance video of his purchase of a Glock . 45 caliber handgun and   ammunition. Mr. Roof also recorded himself, wearing a black muscle shirt and reflective sunglasses, practicing with his    pistol, expressionlessly firing shot after shot. But on the final day of testimony, prosecutors turned away from Mr. Roof’s planning and back to its consequences. A forensic pathologist, Dr. S. Erin Presnell, described the findings of autopsies that showed the nine parishioners had been struck at least 60 times. Then Ms. Sheppard, a bright pink scarf draped around her neck, mounted the witness stand. She plucked a tissue or two from a nearby box, and told her story for about 40 minutes. There was no   from Mr. Roof’s lawyer, David I. Bruck. “Ms. Sheppard, I’m so sorry,” he told her softly. “I have no questions. ”",0
946,War on Saturated Fats Has Harmed People in Poor Countries Who Shunned Traditional Fats Like Coconut Oil,"War on Saturated Fats Has Harmed People in Poor Countries Who Shunned Traditional Fats Like Coconut Oil Making traditional coconut oil in Liberia. 
by Paul Fassa Health Impact News 
One of the most pervasive dangerous food myths has been the lipid hypothesis or theory of heart disease. It proclaims that eating foods containing saturated fats are the root cause of obesity and heart disease. It has prevailed for over a half-century and is only now beginning to deteriorate. 
It was originally created by University of Minnesota researcher Ancel Keys with his “ Seven Countries Study” that spawned the lipid theory of heart disease. This theory claims that saturated fats create cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries and induces heart disease and heart attacks. 
What followed was recommendations by the USDA to condemn saturated fats like the tropical oils, and recommend instead the new expeller-pressed polyunsatured seed oils developed after World War II from US cash crops like soy and corn, which are heavily subsidized by taxpayers to keep prices artificially low and dominate the world market in edible oils. 
In the pharmaceutical world, the lipid theory of heart disease spawned the most profitable drugs of all time, statin drugs, designed to artificially lower cholesterol, a substance needed in our body and without which life would be impossible. 
The new lipid theory of heart disease got Ancel Keys on the 1961 cover of Time Magazine. Yet in 2014 Time issued their mea culpa for falling for Ancel’s bogus report and claims with a featured titled “ Eat Butter: Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong .” Many doctors and nutritionists echoed Ancel in condemning saturated fats, but “new science” has demonstrated the lipid theory is wrong and unscientific. 
But this proclaimed “new science” has been here all along, before Ancel Keys report and the subsequent McGovern led Senate Committee, the Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs final 1977 report that contained a few valid dietary points, but vilified saturated fats and salt. 
The USDA and FDA followed the Committees’ dietary advice and made the lipid theory official and more popular – an “everybody knows” type of common knowledge that really wasn’t true. It is simply a case of politics and money over real science. 
Only after a half-century of low and no fat food like substances had created more obesity and did nothing to rein in heart disease control in the marketplace that the saturated fat cholesterol myth began to erode, thanks to internet sites that publish real dietary science like Health Impact News and their website CoconutOil.com . 
“It’s Easier to Fool People than Tell Them They’ve Been Fooled” – Mark Twain 
Very few want to hear that his or her time and energy was invested in a bogus claim, even claims detrimental to one’s health. Better to think that the “authorities” have their backs and they’re doing the right thing. This is a major reason falsehoods all too slowly surrender to truth. 
The effort to reduce cholesterol with dangerous statin drugs has made a lot of money, maybe more than any other type of drug on the market. But its successful function is actually harmful in addition to its “side effects.” A plethora of new and old science supports cholesterol as a very vital substance for creating hormones, producing vitamin D from sunlight, cell walls, and brain and nervous system tissue. 
The high cholesterol count fears persist along with the notion that consuming saturated fats is behind it all. The officially supported no or low fat food propaganda supports a processed food industry that delivers foods and beverages with high amounts of added sugars or high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) added to processed grain carbohydrates stripped of their natural nutrients. 
Unpopular but real science points to those added sugars and HFCS as the primary source of obesity, metabolic dysfunction leading to diabetes, and arterial inflammation leading to heart disease. 
The trans-fats of cheap processed hydrogenated vegetable oils replacing healthy saturated fats contained in butter and coconut oil adversely affect cellular function and structure. Folks do get fatter and unhealthier with these cheaper substitute fats that are ubiquitous in the standard American diet (SAD). 
These oils are peddled for their lower prices and longer shelf lives. But their longer shelf lives are meaningless. They do not preclude processed vegetable oils’ inherent toxicity. (Source) 
Processed foods containing these partially hydrogenated oils have contributed more to obesity, diabetes, and declining heart health than pure saturated fats, which if untainted promote health in all those areas. But the misinformation is still official thanks to key decision makers’ vested interests within the USDA and FDA. (Source) A Study Explaining Fat Disinformation’s Worldwide Worsening Health and Economic Woe 
The most obvious harm done by the false propaganda against saturated fats in traditional foods are with regions that relied heavily on saturated fats for centuries, especially edible tropical oils such as coconut oil prior to the lipid hypothesis or theory’s dogma that permeated and replaced their traditional diets. 
A recent paper, “Coconut oil and palm oil’s role in nutrition, health and national development: A review,” was published in the September 2016 Ghana Medical Journal (GMJ). 
This report points out the obvious, among those wary of government and medical propaganda, without reservation: 
… anti-tropical oil campaigns in the United States were conducted more for economic gains than for genuine concerns of the health of the Americans [Emphasis added]. Sadly, this adverse publicity of tropical oil in the United States, has spread worldwide, even to countries in the developing world, with heart disease prevalence far lower [prior to the lipid theory] than that of the United States. 
Furthermore, in the developing world, this adverse publicity is characterized by pressure from all fronts including governmental agencies and health professionals (including nutritionists) to reduce consumption of oils such as palm and coconut oils. (Source) 
The paper goes on to detail the nutritional benefits of saturated fats, called saturated because they are saturated with hydrogen, and the different types of saturated fats according to the lengths of their carbon atoms. 
While considering that long chain fatty acids could be a triglyceride storage issue for those with digestive issues, the paper mentions how long chain fatty acids’ slow conversion to energy enhances their nutrient absorption. 
Then the paper explains short and medium chain fatty acids’ ability to be rapidly converted to energy, focusing on coconut oil’s medium chain fatty acids’ health benefits and rapid conversion to usable energy within a body’s cells, especially restoring proper brain cell metabolism. 
This attribute has been a boon for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological diseases, as explained in Health Impact News . (Source) 
So what have we induced by going along with the lipid theory embraced by the USDA, FDA, mainstream nutritionists, and the medical profession’s acceptance of blockbuster (high sales revenue) pharmaceutical statin drugs? 
The real answer has been more obesity, diabetes, and heart disease with an epidemic surge of neurological diseases, especially those related to dementia. 
This study explains a similar impact among those third world or developing nations in West Africa, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere that had embraced consuming and cooking with saturated fats as a staple in their diets for centuries. Regional Economics Also Adversely Affected 
Prior to “Westernizing” their diets somewhat, their low levels of obesity, heart disease, and neurological disorders were areas of curiosity and envy. Now those populations are catching up to American and European non-infectious disease rates. 
Also, the fact that most of developing or third world regions used their own edible oils for centuries were now more dependent on importing American and European processed edible oils has destabilized their local food and agricultural economies. 
Medium chain triglyceride (MCT) fatty acids that are unheated or chemically untainted, such as virgin palm and coconut oils. 
Even the so called “French paradox,” the fact that France’s heart morbidity and obesity was low despite diets rich in saturated fats, was explained away by Western medical media’s assertion that their drinking wine with small traces of heart healthy resveratrol allowed the French to imbibe high fat diets with impunity. 
This was mainstream media national news a very few years ago. Never mind that the truth could be too shocking for our food and medical industries to handle. Resveratrol levels from wine are actually insufficient for protecting the heart against any imagined damage from saturated fats, unless one wants to pass out drunk with every meal. 
Ignoring the lipid theory despite authority supported dogma will lead to better health for those who wish to cancel their subscription to it. Read and listen to the few medical practitioners who have countered that dogma instead. (Source)

947,"Democrats, With Garland on Mind, Mobilize for Supreme Court Fight - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Senate Democrats have one particular judge’s name in mind as they await the identity of President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee: Merrick B. Garland. Democrats and their allies remain furious that Senate Republicans refused to even consider Judge Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to the high court, with 10 months remaining in Mr. Obama’s second term. That deep resentment is certain to color their handling of Mr. Trump’s choice just as it has contributed to their resistance to moving quickly on Mr. Trump’s cabinet selections. All indications are that they see the forthcoming nomination as a chance to take a strong stand against the new president, since they still have the power to filibuster a Supreme Court choice  —   at least for now. “I haven’t seen the names,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and a veteran of multiple Supreme Court fights. “But when they had a consensus person with Merrick Garland, every single Republican who raised their hand and solemnly swore before God to uphold the Constitution refused to follow the Constitution and even have a hearing. ” Top Democrats say they don’t intend to play “tit for tat” with the nomination. But they say they will insist on what they consider to be a mainstream candidate capable of securing at least the 60 votes needed to thwart any filibuster. Otherwise, they promise to do whatever they can to block the nominee. “We are not going to do what the Republicans did,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, “but if the candidate’s out of the mainstream, I can tell you I will fight and my caucus will fight tooth and nail against them. ” The chief reason that Democrats will not do what the Republicans did is that they can’t  —   Republicans remain in the Senate majority, which last year enabled them to refuse to even schedule a hearing and now gives them control over the confirmation process. But unlike with cabinet nominees, Democrats could still employ a filibuster against a Supreme Court pick, because the high court was excluded from a 2013 change engineered by Democrats to thwart filibusters against   nominees. If Democrats hold out, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will no doubt come under pressure to wipe out the possibility of filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. Given the steps Republicans were willing to take to hold open the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia, Democrats believe Senate Republicans might choose to eliminate that filibuster power, too. “All the signals are there is no limit to what they are capable of doing to give the big special interests behind them control of the court,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. But Republicans are already differentiating their handling of Mr. Garland’s nomination from whatever is to come with the announcement by Mr. Trump. They argue that the situations are not comparable, given the timing of the presidential election. “There’s a big difference between not approving a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of a highly contested presidential election, and the beginning of a   term,” Mr. McConnell said on Tuesday, noting that Republicans did not filibuster Supreme Court nominees in the first term of either President Bill Clinton or Mr. Obama. Mr. McConnell took pains on Tuesday to note that both Republicans and Democrats were invited to the White House to discuss the coming nomination with Mr. Trump as part of the requirement for seeking the Senate’s advice and consent. Many Republicans and their conservative allies would prefer not to abolish the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees, knowing that it could come back to haunt them by allowing a future Democratic majority a free hand  —   essentially the same reason Democrats left high court nominees out of the 2013 change. It is also unclear whether Republicans would even have the votes to do so through a simple majority vote on an arcane procedural maneuver. But the question will hang over the entire confirmation fight and could force a showdown. If the Democrats filibuster, “ then I guess we’ll see what steps need to be taken at the time,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, a member of the Republican leadership. “But I think the one thing that we’re committed to is getting a Supreme Court justice confirmed. ” Democrats say that one result of the stalemate over Judge Garland is that it has shown that the Supreme Court can function, though imperfectly, without a full complement of nine members, relieving the party of some guilt for keeping the court   if it comes to that over a Trump nominee. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, said Democrats were also galvanized by the turnout at last weekend’s protests. He said it would serve as a unifying force for Senate Democrats. “That swell of people and strength and spirit at the marches we had Saturday showed us we have the American populace on our side,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “They understand the importance of the Supreme Court to those issues that brought them to the streets, principally women. ” Mr. Blumenthal said the selection of a nominee by President Trump would “put a face and a voice” on the Supreme Court battle. But for now, the face and voice most Democrats are putting on the coming clash are those belonging to Judge Garland.",0
948,Comment on 4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Aren’t Dairy by 4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Aren’t Dairy – Collective Evolution | APG Editorial,"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesn’t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says “cow’s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.” It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better “milk” products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where it’s coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks aren’t the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients — they’ve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances you’ve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you don’t mind the taste. It’s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cow’s milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If you’re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but it’s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning there’s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. “ Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.” The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks don’t. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but it’s always good to check exactly where you’re getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. It’s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A",0
949,"Harry Reid BLASTS Comey For Misconduct, Drops Bombshell: FBI Is Sitting On Russian-Trump Info","  
The decision of FBI Director Comey to go public with a supposed ‘bombshell’ investigation into new Hillary emails was welcomed by Trump as the mainstream media recklessly reported on this total dud of a controversy. It basically dominated the news cycle all day and probably will until we all cast out our vote next Tuesday (or November 28th if you support Trump.) 
But the politically motivated and reckless actions of Comey have many outraged, including Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid 
Senator Reid appeared with Clinton today to push back against the “inappropriate,” “unprecedented,” and “puzzling” move by FBI Director James Comey to suddenly go public with new emails. Roughly two months removed from retirement, Reid is waging an all-out war on Comey as he claims a “disturbing double standard” took place in the FBI’s decision to publish this misleading announcement while essentially ignoring Trump. 
Reid pointed specifically to information the FBI allegedly has that ties Trump to Russia – information Reid says they have intentionally sat on in order to not hurt the candidate’s chances of being elected. 
He expressed his ire in a blistering letter to Comey. Here’s a key passage: 
Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another. I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act, which bars FBI officials from using their official authority to influence an election. Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law. 
And it’s not as though one can accuse Reid of being blindly partisan since he previously defended Comey when Republicans tried to filibuster his nomination and subsequently delay his confirmation. Reid wrote: 
“I believed you to be a principled public servant.” 
The actions of Comey were indeed politically motivated as he desperately wished to be loved again by law & order conservatives. But Reid just opened up a whole new can of worms.

952,Will the next US president be a psycho lesbian? (plus 2 breaking news videos),"By Tom Leonard with pictures and captions added by Lasha Darkmoon 
Hillary Clin­ton faced an up­set in her run for the White House two days ago af­ter the FBI an­nounced a fresh probe into her emails. In­ves­ti­ga­tors will examine new mes­sages to see whether she sent clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion on a private server. Just ten days be­fore Amer­i­cans go to the polls, the Demo­crat candidate’s bid to be­come the first woman US pres­i­dent may be de­railed if it is de­cided she should face crim­i­nal charges. ‘I AM INNOCENT!’ Recent Polls sug­gest Mrs Clinton will trounce Repub­li­can ri­val Don­ald Trump, who has been strug­gling to fight al­le­ga­tions about grop­ing women. But Mrs Clin­ton will now be forced on the de­fen­sive her­self in the fi­nal days of their vi­cious elec­tion bat­tle. FBI di­rec­tor James Comey had rec­om­mended ear­lier this year that the Department of Jus­tice not press charges over emails sent by Mrs Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state un­der Barack Obama. But he said ‘re­cent de­vel­op­ments’ had prompted him to take an­other look. The agency has ob­tained new emails from an un­re­lated case that ‘ap­pear per­ti­nent’ to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, said Mr Comey. A ju­bi­lant Mr Trump hailed the dra­matic de­vel­op­ment of a re-opened investigation as ‘big­ger than Water­gate’, a ref­er­ence to the cor­rup­tion scan­dal that brought down Richard Nixon. ‘Bigger than Watergate’ The con­tro­versy has weighed heav­ily on the cam­paign, chal­leng­ing Mrs Clinton’s key con­tention that – un­like her opponent – she would be a safe pair of hands in the White House. Mr Comey an­nounced in July that the FBI’s 12-month investigation into Mrs Clinton’s con­tro­ver­sial email traf­fic while secretary of state was over. She was crit­i­cised for us­ing a pri­vate email server rather than the of­fi­cial system to trans­mit clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion, but escaped prose­cu­tion. In a harshly-worded crit­i­cism of her ‘ex­treme care­less­ness’ and ‘gross negligence’, Mr Comey said it was pos­si­ble that hos­tile for­eign govern­ments had gained ac­cess to her poorly-pro­tected ac­count. He also flatly con­tra­dicted var­i­ous Clinton claims al­though – in ex­plain­ing why he had not rec­om­mended pros­e­cut­ing her – he ac­cepted there was no evidence she had in­ten­tion­ally jeop­ar­dised state se­crets. The scan­dal has been bran­dished by Repub­li­cans as ev­i­dence of Mrs Clin­ton’s dis­hon­esty and in­com­pe­tence. Mr Comey informed Congress by let­ter that his agency had ob­tained new emails. They will be re­viewed to see if they are sig­nif­i­cant and if new ac­tion against Mrs Clin­ton is re­quired. Mr Comey did not give a time­frame for how long this in­ves­ti­ga­tion will take. The orig­i­nal FBI probe found that of 30,000 emails Mrs Clin­ton handed over to the State Depart­ment, 110 con­tained in­for­ma­tion that was clas­si­fied at the time she sent or re­ceived them. How­ever, an­other 33,000 emails went miss­ing. They were pre­sumed to have been per­ma­nently deleted but newly re­leased FBI notes sug­gested they still ex­ist in sev­eral locations and could be re­cov­ered. It is un­clear whether any of these are in­volved in the new FBI in­quiry. Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said the newly dis­cov­ered emails were taken from the elec­tronic de­vices of se­nior Clin­ton aide Huma Abe­din and her dis­graced hus­band An­thony Weiner dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the lat­ter’s ‘sex­ting’ of girls. ANTHONY WEINER AND HUMA ABEDIN 
LD : Huma is a Palestinian and rumored to be Hillary Clinton’s lesbian lover. Weiner is a Jewish sexual pervert who, incidentally, is passionate about gun control. He wants women to be disarmed, it has been said, so that sexual predators like himself can attack them more easily. 
Weiner, a for­mer Demo­crat con­gress­man for New York, be­came em­broiled in a se­ries of scan­dals over ex­chang­ing sex­u­ally ex­plicit text mes­sages with a string of women. 
He sep­a­rated from Miss Abe­din, vice chair­man of the Clin­ton cam­paign, in Au­gust. 
It is un­der­stood the FBI is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Weiner af­ter it was re­vealed that he had been sex­ting a high school stu­dent who was 15 at the time. Mr Trump re­acted with de­light to Mrs Clin­ton’s 11th-hour elec­tion night­mare. 
Ad­dress­ing a ju­bi­lant crowd in New Hamp­shire, Trump said: ‘Hil­lary Clin­ton’s cor­rup­tion is on a scale we’ve never seen be­fore. We must not let her take her crim­i­nal scheme into the Oval Of­fice.’ Mr Trump had pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised the FBI and Depart­ment of Jus­tice for not bring­ing charges against his elec­tion opponent. His run­ning mate, Mike Pence, called on the FBI to im­me­di­ately re­lease all the emails per­ti­nent to the investigation, adding: ‘The Amer­i­can peo­ple have a right to know.’ The Repub­li­can vice pres­i­den­tial can­di­date told a rally in Penn­syl­va­nia, that he and Don­ald Trump ‘com­mend the FBI for hav­ing the courage to re­open the case’. Chants of ‘Lock her up!’ came even be­fore Mr Pence ref­er­enced the FBI investigation. Mrs Clin­ton ig­nored shouted ques­tions from re­porters about the new FBI investigation as she walked off her plane in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most se­nior Repub­li­can in Congress, said she had be­trayed Amer­i­cans’ trust for han­dling ‘the na­tion’s most im­por­tant secrets. HOT NEWS!

953,Critics See Efforts by Counties and Towns to Purge Minority Voters From Rolls - The New York Times,"SPARTA, Ga.  —   When the deputy sheriff’s patrol cruiser pulled up beside him as he walked down Broad Street at sunset last August, Martee Flournoy, a    black man, was both confused and rattled. He had reason: In this corner of rural Georgia,   are arrested at a rate far higher than that of whites. But the deputy had not come to arrest Mr. Flournoy. Rather, he had come to challenge Mr. Flournoy’s right to vote. The   Hancock County Board of Elections and Registration was systematically questioning the registrations of more than 180 black Sparta citizens  —   a fifth of the city’s registered voters  —   by dispatching deputies with summonses commanding them to appear in person to prove their residence or lose their voting rights. “When I read that letter, I was kind of nervous,” Mr. Flournoy said in an interview. “I didn’t know what to do. ” The board’s aim, a lawsuit later claimed, was to give an edge to white candidates in Sparta’s municipal elections  —   and that November, a white mayoral candidate won a narrow victory. “A lot of those people that was challenged probably didn’t vote, even though they weren’t proven to be wrong,” said Marion Warren, a Sparta elections official who documented the purges and raised an alarm with   advocates. “People just do not understand why a sheriff is coming to their house to bring them a subpoena, especially if they haven’t committed any crime. ” The county attorney, Barry A. Fleming, a Republican state representative, said in an interview that the elections board was only trying to restore order to an electoral process tainted earlier by corruption and incompetence. The lawsuit is overblown, he suggested, because only a fraction of the targeted voters were ultimately scratched from the rolls. “The allegations that people were denied the right to vote are the opposite of the truth,” he said. “This is probably more about politics and power than race. ” But the purge of Sparta voters is precisely the sort of electoral maneuver that once would have needed Justice Department approval before it could be put in effect. In Georgia and all or part of 14 other states, the 1965 Voting Rights Act required jurisdictions with histories of voter discrimination to receive   preclearance before changing the way voter registration and elections were conducted. Three years ago, the Supreme Court declared the preclearance mandate unconstitutional, saying the blatant discrimination it was meant to prevent was largely a thing of the past. But since the Supreme Court’s    ruling in the   case, Shelby County v. Holder, critics argue, the blatant efforts to keep minorities from voting have been supplanted by a blizzard of more subtle changes. Most conspicuous have been state efforts like voter ID laws or cutbacks in early voting periods, which critics say disproportionately affect minorities and the poor. Less apparent, but often just as contentious, have been numerous voting changes enacted in counties and towns across the South and elsewhere around the country. They appear as Republican legislatures and election officials in the South and elsewhere have imposed statewide restrictions on voting that could depress turnout by minorities and other   groups in a crucial presidential election year. Georgia and North Carolina, two states whose campaigns against   voter fraud have been cast by critics as aimed at black voters, could both be contested states in autumn’s presidential election. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a leading   advocacy group, said that before the Supreme Court’s Shelby County ruling, discriminatory laws and procedures had been blocked by the preclearance provisions. Now, she said, “We’re seeing widespread proliferation of these laws. And we are left only with the ability to mount slow, costly    challenges” to their legality. Conservative critics of the Voting Rights Act say that is as it should be  —   that the federal government has no business usurping the role of elections monitor that citizen advocates have long and effectively played in other states. “Now every jurisdiction in the country must be treated equally in our courts when election issues are at stake,” said Edward Blum, the director of the Project on Fair Representation, a nonprofit legal program. The local voting changes have often gone unnoticed and unchallenged. A June survey by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund found that governments in six former preclearance states have closed registration or polling places, making it harder for minorities to vote. Local jurisdictions in six more redrew districts or changed election rules in ways that diluted minorities’ votes. Alabama moved last year to close 31 driver’s license offices, almost all in rural areas with large   populations, as a   measure. After lawsuit threats and complaints that the closings would severely curtail local voter registration, the state chose to open the offices at least one day a month. Gov. Robert J. Bentley, a Republican, has strongly denied that the closings were racially motivated. In Hernando County, Fla. Cleveland and Watauga Counties in North Carolina Baldwin County, Ala. and elsewhere, elections officials eliminated or moved polling places in largely minority districts a state court overturned the Watauga County closure. The Republican majority in North Carolina’s General Assembly redrew the political districts last year in Wake County, whose main city is Raleigh, concentrating black voters in the city center into a single voting district. (A   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that map unconstitutional.) In Pasadena, Tex. officials eliminated two District Council seats in largely Hispanic areas in 2014 and replaced them with   seats chosen largely by white voters. Hispanic voters have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to undo the change. In   County, Ga. in February, the elections board moved a polling place in a predominantly black neighborhood from a gymnasium that was being renovated to the county sheriff’s office. Officials changed the location to a church after a petition drive legally forced a reversal. While those changes took place in states that once were wholly or partly under Justice Department supervision, other restrictions have been adopted by mostly Republican legislatures and election officials in states never cited for voting discrimination. Wisconsin’s unusually stringent photo ID law is the object of a federal lawsuit. A South Dakota county is in litigation over equal access to its polling places for Native Americans. The effect on voter turnout is impossible to measure, but Ms. Clarke of the Lawyers’ Committee offers one barometer: So far in the 2016 primary election cycle, an election hotline run by the committee and others has fielded more than 22, 000 questions and complaints from voters. That is more than 10 times the number received by this point in 2012, although those presidential primary contests were considerably less pitched than the current ones. Georgia has seen a litany of changes in  —   and challenges to  —   voting procedures since the Shelby County decision. A federal lawsuit accuses that state of illegally purging its voter rolls in a recent   period, the 372, 000 voters scrubbed from the rolls exceeded the number of new voters who were added. The chief elections official, Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, has called the suit frivolous. Mr. Kemp, a Republican who has crusaded against what he called the threat of voter fraud, has investigated   drives by   and predominantly black groups. A 2014 criminal inquiry into a group that had registered 85, 000 new voters, many of them minorities, found problems with only 25 of the registrants, and no charges were filed. Several counties have been sued over redistricting plans that dilute minority voting influence. But perhaps none of the battles is more striking than the one in Hancock County, about 100 miles southeast of Atlanta, where three in four of the roughly 10, 000 residents are black. The racial divide here is deep and prolonged the white mayor of the county seat, Sparta, made headlines in 1970 after responding to black citizens’   protests by equipping the town’s   police force with submachine guns. By the 1990s, the Justice Department had invoked its preclearance authority to block measures that it said would weaken minority representation on the Sparta City Council, but political control of the county was frequently split. By last year, black politicians ran Sparta, a white majority controlled the Hancock County commission, and a furious contest was underway between black and white slates to control the next Sparta administration. The   Hancock County Board of Elections and Registration was controlled by three white members  —   the chairwoman, appointed by a local judge, and two members appointed by the Hancock County Republican Committee  —   one of whom, curiously, is a Democrat. According to documents filed in a federal lawsuit in nearby Macon, the board began taking steps last August that seemed destined to tilt the playing field to the white slate’s advantage. The board first proposed to close all but one of the county’s 10 polling places, a move the N. A. A. C. P. and other minority advocates argued would disenfranchise rural blacks who could not travel long distances to vote. Board members eventually chose to eliminate just one predominantly black precinct. But around the same time, they began to winnow the county’s roll of registered voters, ordering an aide to compare the registrants’ stated addresses with those on their driver’s licenses to spot voters who had moved after registering to vote. By October, a month before the city election, the board and a private citizen who appears to have worked with its white members had challenged the legality of 187 registered voters in Sparta. The board removed 53 of them, virtually all    —   roughly one of every 20 voters. As a “courtesy,” court papers state, county sheriff’s deputies served summonses on the targeted voters, commanding them to defend themselves at election board meetings. Some did, and were restored to the rolls. Others reacted differently to a police officer’s knock on their door. “A lot of voters are actually calling to say they no longer wish to be on the list, so now we have people coming off the list who no longer want to vote,” Tiffany Medlock, the elections supervisor for the Hancock County elections board, told a Macon television reporter in late September. “It’ll probably affect the City of Sparta’s election in a major way. ” Mr. Warren, an   who is Sparta’s elections registrar, bought a   video camera and began videotaping the county elections board’s meetings. His evidence helped lead the Georgia N. A. A. C. P. the Lawyers’ Committee and other advocacy groups to sue the county elections board, demanding that voters struck from the rolls be restored unless the county could prove they were ineligible. A federal judge agreed. So far, 27 of Sparta’s 53 disenfranchised voters have been reinstated the rest have yet to be located. Hancock County officials insist they did nothing wrong. In depositions this summer, the three white elections board members said their purge of Sparta’s voter rolls not only was correct, but that they would do it again. But Julie Houk, an attorney handling the case for the Lawyers’ Committee, said the plaintiffs were determined to ensure that they do not. She said they plan to seek an injunction against future purges  —   and their lawsuit demands that the Justice Department reimpose preclearance reviews in the county until   elections are a reality.",0

956,Indiana Parents Lose Their Baby and 2 Years of Their Lives in Jail for “Abuse” They Say Never Happened,"Indiana Parents Lose Their Baby and 2 Years of Their Lives in Jail for “Abuse” They Say Never Happened Laura Gellinger and Dylan Day with baby Jackson. Photo used with permission from the family. 
by Health Impact News/MedicalKidnap.com Staff 
An Indiana couple watches their mailbox with dread, waiting for the papers they hope will never come – papers saying that their young son has been adopted out. 
Laura Gellinger and Dylan Day haven’t seen their son in over 2 years, after they took their then 3 month old baby to the hospital for a minor injury and were subsequently accused of child abuse. They each spent 2 years in jail and are currently on probation after their son was found to have multiple fractures in various stages of healing. For some reason, the family alleges that they were not shown the x-rays. According to Laura’s mother Jamie Gellinger: 
They didn’t show us proof of anything! 
A family history of osteoporosis, on both sides, was ignored, and there was only minimal testing for any other possible medical explanation for baby Jackson Day’s alleged injuries. There are reportedly numerous issues with the way the case was handled, as well as arguably inadequate representation, and a family has been torn apart in the meantime. 
Could this be a case of innocent parents being unjustly accused, and imprisoned, for something that they didn’t do? Laura’s parents believe so, and Laura and Dylan maintain that they don’t know what actually happened, and that they never hurt their baby. 
The fact that they had no explanation for the fractures discovered by the hospital was apparently used against them. However, parents with children with brittle bones generally had no previous indication of any problems, and thus have no explanation for something they didn’t know was happening. Too often, they find that the doctors that they look to for help would sooner accuse them of abuse, rather than search for a medical explanation. 
Courts and judges across the U.S. are increasingly overturning Shaken Baby abuse convictions, as most of these cases do not present the science against “Shaken Baby Syndrome,” and the medical evidence that can support injuries apart from parental abuse. 
See: University of Michigan Law School Awarded $250K to Learn How to Defend Shaken Baby Syndrome Cases 
This story from Indiana shares many details in common with other stories that Health Impact News has covered where innocent parents were falsely accused of abuse when there are legitimate medical conditions that caused the injuries to their children. 
Local media published the side of the story that Child Protective Services presented. Dylan Day and Laura Gellinger would like the opportunity to tell their side of the story – a side that has never been heard publicly, but which leaves many unanswered questions, and challenges the integrity of the investigation that led to the loss of their son and to their imprisonment. 
Here is their story: 
Laura and Dylan were young, just 19 and 20 when Jackson was born. They had never been in any trouble with the law and had no history of any kind of violence. Laura has always loved babies, and had dreams of becoming a nurse one day. According to Greg Gellinger, Laura’s father, the couple lived in a nice mobile home near her parents, and were excited about preparing for the arrival of their little one. Excited about the upcoming arrival of their little one. Photo source: Day family. 
During her pregnancy, Laura reports that she took Prilosec for heartburn during mid-pregnancy. Her vitamin D levels were reportedly low. 
Prilosec is a Proton Pumb Inhibitor (PPI) often used as an antacid. We asked a clinical radiologist if Prilosec during pregnancy could contribute to brittle bones in the baby. 
The known consequences are many including reduced absorption of Calcium, Magnesium, B12, vitamin C, copper. The bones can be affected by nearly all of these deficiencies (except B12). This is very well known. 
Since infant metabolism is different than maternal, what do we know on the outcomes to fetus? Almost nothing. While there are many studies which claim there are no problems with PPI use in pregnancy, none actually measured bone quality in any meaningful way, thus were only recording severe congenital defects. 
In a nutshell, there is biological plausibility that use in pregnancy is a sign of nutritional deficiencies and can further result in fragile bone states to mom and fetus. 
Jackson was born at 41 weeks after an induced labor led to an emergency cesarean section on March 6, 2014. He weighed 7 lbs, 11 oz. Formula and Vaccines 
Though Laura attempted to breastfeed, she says that didn’t go well, and Jackson was put on formula. During his first few months, he was healthy and happy except for some issues with gas. He spit up a lot and showed symptoms of reflux, which is a sign of vitamin D deficiency. Doctors recommended Mylicon drops, and his formula was changed several times. Typically, he only cried when his diaper was being changed or when he had gas. 
Laura kept all of the doctor and WIC appointments. Jackson got all of the recommended vaccines according to the typical schedule. At 2 months of age, he received 8 vaccines in one day. Sweaty Head – Missed Sign of Rickets 
Baby Jackson sweated a lot at night, especially around his head and back. Laura says that he would often soak through his pjs, and they had to put him to sleep in a short-sleeved onesie because he would sweat so much. Laura and Dylan just assumed he was hot-natured. 
However, a sweaty head is a classic sign of rickets, discussed in the older textbooks. It is often overlooked, but Dr. David Ayoub discussed the symptom in an interview with Dr. Mercola: 
I would be very concerned if a baby is perspiring heavily at night, especially around the face, head, and neck. They’re described as soaking their pillows. They had to change the sheets, because they’re so wet. That’s one of the odd, lesser-known signs of infantile rickets. Trip to Hospital has Disastrous Results 
The family got him a swing, and he loved it. Sometimes, he would pull a leg up and rest it on the tray of the swing. Laura says that she noticed a bump on his ankle that she assumed came from the swing, so she called the doctor’s office about it on Friday, June 14. They left a message, but didn’t hear back from the doctor’s office that day, so they planned to take him in the following Monday to check on it. Photo courtesy of the family. 
Meanwhile, there was a family reunion on Saturday. It was Father’s Day weekend. After a long day of being loved on by various relatives, Jackson went down for a nap with his pacifier. He was 3 months old and was teething at the time. He was a bit fussy and fighting sleep, turning his head back and forth as he lay on his tummy. 
A short time later, Laura says she heard him crying and checked on him. She was alarmed to see blood around his mouth and on the sheet where his head was. Laura’s mother Jamie went with Laura and Dylan to take him in to Reid Hospital in Richmond. 
None of them were prepared for what would happen next. 
They learned that the frenulum on the baby’s upper lip was torn. The medical records describe the “abrasion” as “small” and “superficial,” and they note that 2 teeth were just beginning to emerge. A nurse reportedly reassured the family that she had seen injuries like this, from teething or fussy babies moving their heads back and forth on the bed with a pacifier in their mouth. 
What the family didn’t realize was that the state of Indiana has a policy that a report must be filed with the Department of Child Services any time that there is an injury of any kind to a child’s face or head: 
Child Protective Services was, indeed, called, and social worker Amy Benton came to the hospital. When Laura began crying, her mother Jamie says that she walked her outside to get some air while Dylan held the baby. X-Rays and Hospital Chaos 
On their way out, Jamie overheard 2 nurses in the hallway discussing another case in horrified whispers. There was allegedly another baby boy at the hospital the same age as Jackson, and the nurses were shocked at the bruises and multiple broken bones in the baby. 
Shortly after that time, the emergency room doctor, Dr. Jamie Brummett, ordered a full skeletal survey for Jackson. This is the typical protocol when child abuse is suspected. The family thought that it was only going to be one or two x-rays. 
Jamie describes the atmosphere at the hospital that night as “chaotic.” Dylan reports that he took his son into the room for the x-rays. He noticed that there were already 2 sets of x-rays hanging up in the room that were from someone else. It appeared to be from a child, he says. He also reports that the nurses were having problems with the machines, and had to keep re-doing the x-rays. His son’s x-rays were then printed out in the room, so by the time they left the room, there were x-rays from 2 different people in the room.

Shortly after, Dr. Brummett and the social worker met with the parents and grandparents and informed them that Jackson had multiple fractures in various stages of healing, including some ribs, and broken arms and legs. The family was stunned, and both Laura and Dylan began crying. They still don’t understand how some of the fractures were supposed to be several weeks old, but no one had seen any signs of them during any of the previous doctor visits and WIC visits. Jackson had not acted like he was in any pain, and there were no bruises on the baby. Laura says there were: 
None at all. That’s what makes no sense. There was never any abnormal crying, either. 
There was nothing that precipitated this. That’s what we couldn’t understand. There is something that is not right. I know I didn’t hurt my child, and my boyfriend didn’t hurt my child. 
Immediately, Dylan asked for testing to be done, because osteoporosis runs in his family. His sister had been diagnosed with it as a teenager. It is also on Laura’s side of the family, and Laura’s mother has been diagnosed with osteoporosis. Those concerns were reportedly dismissed. Dr. Jamie Brummett. Should doctors have the power to put parents in jail and destroy families simply based on x-rays? Image source. 
Dr. Brummett allegedly told the social worker and the detective that the fractures were due to non-accidental injury. The family reports that, after she made that statement, the investigators never looked further or checked for any alternate explanation. Investigators reportedly had multiple theories, but all of them involved accusations of abuse: Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS), the baby was yanked, or jerked, or maybe it was from being swaddled too tightly. Or the parents squeezed the baby. “Consistent with Non-Accidental Injury,” But Also Consistent with Other Medical Conditions 
The fractures were reportedly consistent with non-accidental injury, but, as Health Impact News has reported many times, multiple unexplained fractures are also consistent with numerous medical conditions, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, infantile rickets, vitamin D deficiency, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and even vaccine damage. A hallmark of good medical care is careful investigation to rule out other medical conditions before accusing a parent of abuse, but all too often, that is not what parents find when they take their children to the emergency room. 
See related articles, including another recent story from Indiana: 5 Children Kidnapped from Family in Missouri When Baby with Low Vitamin D Found with Broken Bones 
There are more stories just like these, and they often read like they all came from the same script. Most involve parents who take a child to the emergency room for one thing, only to have their child be subjected to full skeletal x-rays. Someone discovered multiple fractures in various healing stages that no one ever previously suspected, and the parents have no explanation. The child is then taken from their family, and other possible medical conditions are ignored. Many of the families learn later that their child did, indeed, have some type of brittle bone or other medical condition. 
Others, like Laura Gellinger and Dylan Day, are never given the opportunity to find out if there is a medical condition. Once Reid Hospital’s Dr. Brummett identified the fractures as abuse, the family says that no one even entertained other possibilities. 
Laura and Dylan were taken to the police station and interrogated late into the night. The detective reportedly believed Laura abused the baby because, even though they had occasional babysitters, she was the one with the baby most of the time. They were scared to death, with good reason. Their son was placed into foster care the next day – on Father’s Day. 
They didn’t have an explanation, because the young parents, who were 19 and 20 at the time, didn’t know what had happened. Experts assert that a baby with a brittle bone condition can break a bone with something as innocent as a diaper change or change of clothes. It doesn’t take much, because their bones are so fragile. They recalled an incident where a dog had jumped on the baby when he was 2 to 3 weeks old. They wondered if he could have hurt his leg on the swing. Dylan says that every possibility they came up with was rejected. Baby Jackson at his 2-month checkup. Before that night at the hospital, no one mentioned any possibility of abuse. Photo supplied by family. 
Lack of explanation for injuries is seen by the child abuse industry as being evidence of abuse, when, in some cases, it simply means that there is a medical explanation that the parents have neither the knowledge nor the experience to know, and that the doctors they turn to for help refuse to differentiate between abuse and legitimate medical conditions. Lack of explanation is seen as proof of guilt. 
They asked to see the x-rays, but Detective Tom Legear reportedly told them that, by law, they don’t have to show them the x-rays, and that it was up to DCS to show them the x-rays if they wanted. Laura and Dylan were never permitted to see the x-rays. 
For the first 2 weeks after Jackson was placed into foster care, his parents were permitted to visit him 3 times a week for 2 hour visits. During that time, DCS took Jackson to Riley Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis to be evaluated by a Child Abuse Specialist. 
On July 1, 2014, about a half dozen police cars came to Dylan and Laura’s home and the couple was arrested. They have not seen their baby since then. Parents not Adequately Defended in Court 
Their case went to court. Public defenders were appointed for Laura and Dylan, but the family does not believe that they were adequately represented. Greg Gellinger, Laura’s father, referred to the whole court system when he told Health Impact News : 
They’re all in cahoots with each other. The public defenders are a joke in this town. 
He reports that his daughter’s public defender told him and his wife that he had such a big caseload that he didn’t care whether or not Laura and Dylan did it or not. On one occasion, Laura reportedly went to see him in his office about her case, but he had a ballgame playing and paid no attention to his client. 
To this day, the senior Gellinger beats himself up for not being able to afford a good attorney. He feels like he let his daughter down: 
I knew neither one of them done it. I thought we had a good case, but the public defenders didn’t do anything. 
He said that social worker Amy Benton approached him at the courthouse, telling him not to take it personally. Greg was incredulous: 
What if it was your daughter and you knew she didn’t do it? 
This isn’t simply the rantings of an emotional father upset that his child was arrested. There are a number of anomalies in the way that the case was reportedly handled, which cast serious doubts on their guilt. 
The attorneys never obtained the x-rays or any more medical records than those that the parents already had. The family was told that they have no right to see the x-rays. To this day, there has only been one occasion that any family member has seen any x-rays, but they have no way of knowing if the x-rays are actually of Jackson’s bones. 
There were only a couple of x-rays used in court, but there was no name on the x-rays. Based on the experience that Dylan had in the hospital, he has no way of being assured that the x-rays he saw in court belonged to Jackson. They could easily have been mixed up with those of the other child who was in the hospital the same night. 
The attorney challenged the x-rays due to the lack of a name on them, but the court reportedly allowed them, simply based on the word of the doctor. Grandmother Jamie with baby Jackson. Photo courtesy of the family. 
The question arises: did Jackson actually have any broken bones? Laura’s mother told Health Impact News that they have never actually see any evidence that Jackson ever sustained any injuries, besides the torn frenulum, which she sees as easily explainable. 
Detective Tom Legear allegedly told the family that the hospital ran a standard blood test to rule out a bone disease, but again, no one in the family or their attorneys has ever seen it. To the family’s knowledge, that simple test is the only test that was reportedly performed. 
There is another test that could be performed, but the judge reportedly decided that it would cost too much money to order that test. Social Workers Make False Statements 
At one point, social worker Amy Benton accused the parents of not ever taking Jackson to the doctor or vaccinating him – facts that were easily proven incorrect. She had allegedly pulled the records of a different baby with the same name. 
Another time, a DCS supervisor, Karen Bowen, reportedly talked about “bruises all over his body,” but, again, that was another baby, not Jackson. Medical records from the night in question clearly state that no bruising was noted. 
Amy Benton alleged that the baby’s pacifier caused Jackson’s mouth injury, but several family members recall seeing her throw the pacifier away in the trash at the hospital. When the judge asked where it was, she reportedly said that Detective Legear had it. Neither were able to produce the pacifier. 
Benton also allegedly told the court that the couple didn’t have adequate shelter or food or clothing. Greg and Jamie assert that this was never true, and that the detective and social worker went to the home and photographed furniture, food, diapers, and other supplies. 
However, they don’t know what happened to the photos, because they were not presented in court. Their mobile home is “really nice,” according to the the Gellingers. This is just one more example of the DCF system painting an alternate picture of reality to the court, one which makes the family look much worse than they are. 
The family says that the detective and the judge agreed that, since Laura and Dylan were 1st time parents, they probably lost patience with their baby and hurt him, an assumption which the young parents vehemently deny. 
The court reportedly was never told that both sides of the family have brittle bone conditions. 
Local media reported that Dr. Brummett said that the baby weighed 10 lbs at 3 months, but should have weighed closer to 13 lbs. This is an error. The medical reports state that he weighed 5.56 kg on the night of June 14, which translates 12.26 lbs, not much under 13 lbs. Parent’s Coerced into Plea Bargain 
Once Dr. Brummett testified to the court, the court-appointed attorneys advised their clients to accept a plea deal, telling them that DCS always uses her, and once they use her, they always win. 
It’s a done deal. 
Laura Gellinger and Dylan Day were originally charged with battery, but that was dropped because there was no evidence that they themselves had hurt Jackson. The occasional babysitters allowed for the possibility that someone other than the parents hurt the baby. 
There was a charge for neglect of a dependent for failure to get medical treatment, but because they took him to the E.R., that charge was dropped. 
However, Laura and Dylan report that they felt bullied into accepting the charge of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury, alleging their responsibility for his being hurt in their care. That was the plea bargain. They were sentenced to 10 years in prison, with 5 suspended, and 3 of those years as probation. Laura Gellinger and her adoring baby before the accusation of child abuse. Photo courtesy of the family. Other Prisoners Believe in Laura’s Innocence 
They are currently on probation after each served 2 years in prison. Laura was released on April 1, and Dylan came home on May 7. 
Laura spent the first 13 months of jail in solitary confinement as protective custody. She went into the general population after requesting to be removed from solitary confinement, and, as feared, she was initially harassed and bullied. She reports that they “laid off” harassing her after she let other prisoners see the evidence. They could see that something wasn’t right. She says that her bunkmate was in tears after reading the medical reports: 
You don’t belong here. 
Laura recalls that the other prisoners once called her to the TV because the Dr. Phil show was covering a story that was very similar to hers. In early March, just before Laura’s release, Dr. Phil aired his coverage of Marty Coleman’s case – a brittle bones story that Health Impact News first brought to public attention after local media inaccurately painted the mother out to be a monster. 
See story: 
Laura’s bunkmate crocheted a scarf for Jackson, but Laura has not had an opportunity to give it to him. She doesn’t know if that will ever happen. Home Now, Hoping for a Miracle 
Both Dylan and Laura are home now, and they are still together. Their parental rights to their son have been terminated. They tried to appeal the TPR decision, but report that the request was denied because they still have no explanation for how the injuries occurred. 
They have been told that their son is being adopted out and that papers could arrive in the mail at any time. Laura recently contacted us, saying: 
I have been searching and searching to find a doctor or someone to please help me prove my innocence and get my child back … Please help! 
They haven’t seen their son since he was 3 months old. The grandparents have been completely cut off as well from their grandson. The only hope they can see of reversing the decisions that have been made is for them to take their case to the state Supreme Court, but that would require money for an attorney, money that they don’t have. According to Laura: 
I’ve lost my child. I’ve lost 2 years of my life – for something I didn’t do.

957,The Rolling Stones Paint It Blue on Their New Album - The New York Times,"Beverly Hills, Calif.  —   More than five decades after they started, the Rolling Stones are a rock institution still running on intuition, impulse and chemistry. “Blue  Lonesome,” their new album, arrived as a happy accident  —   or, as Keith Richards said with his piratical cackle, “as if we’d been ordered to do it from some higher being. ” It started as a break from their own material, then suddenly turned into a   throwback: the Stones returning to their   days as a   cover band, knocking out songs live in the studio and recording an entire album in three days. “Blue  Lonesome” is the first studio album the Stones have made since “A Bigger Bang” in 2005 it’s due for release on Dec. 2. Talking about it put smiles on band members’ faces in an   string of interviews last month at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, a few days after the band’s jubilant set at the first weekend of the Desert Trip festival in Indio, Calif. “This album,” said the drummer, Charlie Watts, “is what I’ve always wanted the Stones to do. It’s what we do best and what we did when we first got together. ” In conversation, they play   roles: Mr. Watts as   and supportive, the guitarist Ronnie Wood still treating himself as a new band member (he joined in 1975) Mr. Richards as the    roots music fan and Mick Jagger as the extrovert and  . “Blue  Lonesome” is not the batch of new   songs that the band has been laboring over intermittently for years between bursts of touring, like the Latin American tour that concluded with an unprecedented concert in Havana and that has been the subject of two documentaries: “Olé Olé Olé” and “Havana Moon. ” In recent years, the band has tried to follow up on touring momentum with recording sessions. But the new songs, Mr. Jagger said with a frown, currently add up to “half an album. ” Mr. Wood said new songs need time to settle in. “It’s like putting it on top of the strainer and seeing what soaks through by the time you come back to them again,” he explained. “The lumps that are left on top after time has gone by, that’s what you make your dough out of. ” He added, “It wouldn’t surprise me if we recut them all again. It’s one of those things. ” Instead, “Blue  Lonesome” is a set of a dozen blues songs that were originally recorded, mostly in the   by titans like Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter and Jimmy Reed. It was the breakthrough era of electric Chicago blues: a modernized, urbanized, amplified update of music from the Deep South. “These guys were basically inventing,” Mr. Richards said. “They had nothing to fall back on. They’d got these new guitars and amplifiers. They were all feeling their way through it. So there’s a feeling about that particular period of the blues which we could identify with, because you could hear the guys egging each other on and wondering where it’s going to go. ” The style was barely a decade old when it changed the lives of the English teenagers who would become the Rolling Stones, along with a generation of musicians worldwide. The rest is rock history, as the blues has been transplanted, revamped, venerated, repeatedly rediscovered and sometimes plundered, with its ideas ricocheting across cultural and geographical divides long before the more recent discussions about cultural appropriation. The blues became one of the foundations of rock, though its influence has been waning in recent decades. “Sounds have changed,” Mr. Jagger said. “What makes you excited now is not the same. In music, everything’s different. But the blues still have something about them that’s really good. I love all kinds of music, and I still listen to the blues. ” The songs for “Blue  Lonesome” were all on his iPod. Half a century on, playing vintage blues songs is an act of preservation and reclamation  —   and for the Rolling Stones, who have always been careful to credit their sources, a matter of continuity. “We’ve known these songs for 50 years,” Mr. Jagger said. “It is a learned idiom. It’s like me singing in Italian. If I’d been doing that for 50 years, you wouldn’t ask me, ‘How do you feel about singing in Italian?’ I don’t feel anything about singing in Italian, I always sang in Italian.’ It works most of the time. It’s like, you just have to go with it and suspend disbelief. “To me it’s a homage to all those people that we’ve always loved since we were kids,” he added. “I can see why people might find it vaguely not correct, but we’ve always done it. And the artists themselves, they never objected. ” “Blue  Lonesome” was recorded nearly a year ago, on the spur of the moment. While planning for recording sessions, Mr. Richards recalled, he emailed Mr. Wood, urging him to learn “Blue and Lonesome” by the   singer and harmonica player Little Walter. “If Keith says something like that, there’s a reason for it,” said Don Was, the Stones’ longtime  . “I don’t think he meant, ‘Go do this because we’re going to do a blues album.’ More like, ‘Let’s apply the principles of “Blue and Lonesome” to what we’re doing here. ’” The sessions took place in December at British Grove Studios, a West London complex owned by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. There, the Stones were recording together in a large open room with a setup generally used to record classical music: a tall,   contraption called a Decca tree, which uses overhead microphones to capture what a conductor hears. (The tree was devised at Decca Records, the Stones’ first label British Grove also has a vintage Decca mixing console, Mr. Was said.) It was a deliberately   configuration: not layering isolated instruments, but demanding an    live approach. The band was “a little unsure of the studio and the sound of it,” Mr. Richards recalled. So it fell back on the blues. “I looked at Ronnie and said, ‘Let’s put a hold on this new stuff while we try and figure things out and get the room warmed up. O. K.: ‘Blue and Lonesome.’ “And it comes out that suddenly the room’s opened up and the sound is there,” Mr. Richards continued. “And then, ‘That was damned good, man!’ Mick turns around and says, ‘Let’s do Howlin’ Wolf’s “Commit a Crime”’  —   and it really just led from there. No preplanning, no real instigation. Suddenly Mick just jumped on this train that he’s so good at. ” Mr. Richards recalled thinking: “Keep rolling, keep rolling! I don’t care how many you do  —   just catch it while the man’s in the mood. ” He laughed. “It just bloody happened. That was the amazing thing and the beauty of it,” he said. At the end of the first session, the Stones had recorded five songs. “No one said, ‘We should do a blues album,’” Mr. Was said. “It’s like, when a guy’s throwing a   you don’t talk to him about it in the middle of the game. ” Still, Mr. Was suggested that Mr. Jagger choose more songs band members who didn’t know them learned them over a weekend. With further serendipity, Eric Clapton was also at British Grove, doing some mixing, and in the next session he ended up sitting in on two songs, joining the improvisational weave of guitars. Mr. Richards was happy to, as he said, “Just roll it, decide later what to do with it,” he said. “It was only at the end, when we’d got 12 tracks and Don Was and I were talking together, and Mick was there and he was saying, ‘This is an album. You can’t chop this up. ’” Mr. Wood recalled, “I got a text from Mick saying, ‘The blues tracks are really sounding good.’ And I thought, is this from the Jagger that I know? Because he never, never says that things are happening well. ” Mr. Jagger described the album as “an exercise in sprezzatura”  —   a term for hiding skillful effort behind seeming nonchalance. “You’ve got to concentrate, but it can’t sound like it’s difficult. And it doesn’t,” he said. The Stones tucked lifelong blues scholarship behind the kick and yowl of the music. As they delved into individual songs, the band praised the   studio musicians who forged the Chicago sound: guitarists like Howlin’ Wolf’s sideman Hubert Sumlin (with whom Mr. Richards shared regular jam sessions) and drummers like Freddy Below and Earl Phillips. “When I was doing my song choices, I was thinking about tempos, moods, keys, different emotions,” Mr. Jagger said. But feel came first. “They’ve still got to blow you away a bit. They’ve still got to be exciting. ” The songs on “Blue  Lonesome” are, deliberately,   choices rather than   war horses. The Jimmy Reed song, for instance, isn’t “Big Boss Man” but the spooky, echoey, melancholy “Little Rain. ” From Howlin’ Wolf, Mr. Jagger chose two tales of fierce, comic romantic strife and churning rhythm: “Just Like I Treat You” and “Commit a Crime. ” Little Walter’s songs  —   there are four on the album  —   fell naturally into Mr. Jagger’s vocal range and gave him a chance to play lots of harmonica. Many of the songs elude the regularity of   blues they add or skip beats, start vocals in unexpected places, lurch and leap.     have often flattened out those quirks, but the Stones maintain them. “It’s not like rock music or programmed drum music,” Mr. Jagger said. “It pulsates in a very weird way, where each bar is different. And that’s what’s interesting about this kind of music when it’s played properly. It has a swerve, and it has a dynamism about it. ” Mr. Jagger also noted that while the songs were recorded almost entirely in real time, the final mixes were painstaking. “I just looked back at the original records, and we wanted some of these moods,” he said. “Every track is different. We all thought it was going to be easy but it wasn’t. ” Still, after more than a decade between albums, “Blue  Lonesome” may have loosened up the Stones for their own new songs. Sessions for the next studio album are still in progress. “We did things after we’d done this and I’d say, ‘O. K. just play it! It’s only got three chords, just play it, stop thinking about it,’” Mr. Jagger said. “‘Just imagine this is a blues. ’”",0
958,Uber Extends an Olive Branch to Local Governments: Its Data - The New York Times,"The   company Uber and local governments often do not play well together. Uber pays little heed to regulation while city officials scramble to keep up with the company’s rapid deployment and surging popularity. But now, with a new   product, Uber is offering a tiny olive branch to its municipal critics. The company on Sunday unveiled Movement, a   website it hopes will persuade city planners to consider Uber as part of urban development and transit systems in the future. The site, which Uber will invite planning agencies and researchers to visit in the coming weeks, will allow outsiders to study traffic patterns and speeds across cities using data collected by tens of thousands of Uber vehicles. Users can use Movement to compare average trip times across certain points in cities and see what effect something like a baseball game might have on traffic patterns. Eventually, the company plans to make Movement available to the general public. If urban planners embrace the data, that could work toward a future Uber has long dreamed of, one in which the company’s transportation options are woven into municipal planning. “Our relationships with cities have typically been uneven, but there are a lot of places around the world where Uber and the cities we operate in have the same goals,” Andrew Salzberg, head of transportation policy at Uber, said in an interview. “We operate better in a world that has policy grounded on data. ” The collected trip data is made anonymous and aggregated, Uber said, which it hopes will assuage user privacy concerns. That data, Uber said, will most likely be much more reliable than what is typically used by urban planners, many of whom hire   agencies to study traffic patterns over time. Often, that data is expensive, and it can be out of date by the time it is analyzed. Uber argues that its data is more reliable because all of its drivers use smartphones equipped with accelerometers and global positioning technology. One challenge for Uber: improving upon the rocky partnerships it forged in the early,   data sharing deals it struck two years ago. In a widely publicized move in January 2015, Uber announced a deal with the city of Boston in which the company planned to share some anonymous data, with many of the same urban planning aspirations it has today. But that deal quickly soured. Boston officials said the agreement was not practical for city planning and development because it restricted what agencies the city could share the data with and because the data came only in quarterly batches. Boston city employees also grew frustrated with the lack of useful data being shared and Uber’s seeming lack of understanding of how to deal with city governments. “The totality of Uber and Lyft drivers in Boston represent what is effectively the addition of another transit line,” Jascha   chief information officer at Boston’s Department of Innovation  Technology, said in an interview. “The fact that we’re dealing with a whole new line that we don’t have data on and can’t integrate it into our planning is sort of ridiculous. ” Uber seemed to take the criticism to heart. After the Boston partnership, the company created a   team to develop an approach to sharing data with city planners across the world. Led by Jordan Gilbertson, a product manager at Uber, that project eventually became the new website, Movement. City officials said that they appreciated user data privacy concerns but that they also hoped to see more useful information from Uber. Mr.   shared a list of detailed requests that could aid future urban development, like demand patterns around   tenant housing, locations with likely potholes and the most common pickup and   locations. Uber maintains that it plans to release more data to cities over time as it rolls out the Movement tool to a wider audience of researchers and to the public. But the company said it would balance that demand for information with concerns about user privacy and the need to protect competitive data that could prove valuable to rivals like Lyft, Hailo and Grab, which are vying for riders across many of the same markets. “Ideally, we’ll someday find what that middle ground looks like,” Mr.   said.",0
959,"Wilders: Put Dutch First, Not ’Brussels, Africa and Asylum Seekers’","Geert Wilders, the Eurosceptic,   migration candidate who heads the insurgent Party for Freedom (PVV)  has blasted incumbent head of government Mark Rutte as a “prime minister for foreigners” urging voters to put the Netherlands first in a fiery debate. [“I say to all Dutch people at home, when you go to vote on Wednesday, if you want to put our country up for sale and ensure that our money goes to asylum seekers, Brussels and Africa instead of our own people, vote for the VVD”  —   the political party which Rutte heads.  Wilders also called on Rutte to expel Turkey’s ambassador, after the country’s authoritarian president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan denigrated the Dutch as “Nazi remnants” and threatened the Netherlands with “harsh retaliation” for preventing Turkish government ministers from staging a political rally in Rotterdam. Wilders said anything less would be “an insult to us and our police officers” after Turkish migrants and dual nationals rioted in support of their native country’s Islamist president. But Rutte ruled the measure out. “It’s the difference between tweeting from the sofa and running a country,” he said, in reference to the robust message to Turkish rioters which Wilders broadcasted in the wake of the unrest. 🇳🇱🇹🇷 Geert Wilders’s message to Turks: ”You are not welcome here!”    #Turkey #Rotterdam pic. twitter.   —   Keith Walker (@KeithWalkerNews) March 12, 2017,  “You are no Europeans, and you will never be,” he said. “An Islamic state like Turkey does not belong to Europe. All the values Europe stands for  —   freedom, democracy, human rights  —   are incompatible with Islam. “Turkey voted for Erdoğan, a dangerous Islamist who raises the flag of Islam.

962,Two Powerful Earthquakes Strike Central Italy,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by Carol Adl in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments 
Two powerful earthquakes struck central Italy on Wednesday, causing fear among residents still rattled by a deadly tremor in August. 
An 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit the Marche region almost two hours after a 5.4-magnitude quake damaged buildings and cut power lines across the area. 
There have been no reports of casualties so far. 
RT reports: 
The latest earthquake occurred 71 km east of Perugia, with United States Geological Survey reporting it as a 6.0-magnitude temblor, and Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology saying it was 5.9-magnitude. M5.9 #earthquake ( #terremoto ) strikes 135 km NE of #Roma ( #Italy ) 13 min ago. Updated map of its effects: pic.twitter.com/LKWAtTLmBe 
— EMSC (@LastQuake) October 26, 2016 
The first earthquake was detected at 7:11pm local time, about 66km to the southeast of Perugia, striking a mountainous part of the Marche region and lasting several seconds.The exact epicenter of the tremblor remains unclear, but it was relatively shallow, at about 9km below ground. 
Within an hour of the first earthquake, there was a series of small but noticeable aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 2.8. 
“We’re in the square, all the lights are out, we can’t see, we’re counting each other to see who’s here, we still don’t know how bad the situation is,” Mauro Falcucci, mayor of Castelsantangelo sul Nera, the small commune closest to the epicenter, told Sky News by phone. “The situation is delicate. It is important to remain calm.” 
The official said that the emergency is exacerbated by a downpour, and intermittent problems with mobile phone communication. 
“It was a very strong, apocalyptic earthquake – people were screaming in the street, and now the lights are cut off,” said Marco Rinaldi, the mayor of Ussita, a community of 400 that was also affected by the initial earthquake. 
A video posted by a Huffington Post journalist shows rubble strewn through the streets of Visso, a commune less than 10 km from the epicenter.

964,Elizabeth Warren Defines Sleazy Hypocrisy,"Financial Markets , Market Manipulation , U.S. Economy Elizabeth Warren , Soros , Wall Street fraud admin 
Look in the dictionary under the term “hypocrisy” and there has to be a picture of Elizabeth Warren. Her latest beaut is sending a letter to Trump criticizing his transition team’s ties to Wall Street. 
Yet, how come Obama never received the same type of letter from her? Obama’s entire cabinet from 2008 to now is riddled with Wall Streeters. By the way, Lizzie, when the AG and former AG have law practices built around keeping Wall Street out of jail, that is a “tie to Wall Street.” I guess it’s a matter of convenience to overlook the fact that both Treasury Secretaries are and were deeply tied to Wall Street. 
Oh. Wait. I almost forgot. What about your beloved Hillary? No Wall Street ties there? You certainly forgot to chat about this when you were campaigning for her. Let me review the facts starting with the fact that Wall Street firms were among her largest campaign financiers. The biggest donor was perhaps the biggest Wall Street criminal: George Soros. Speaking of which, is this guy ever going to die and leave us alone? 
“Do as say, not as I do” seems to be de rigeur for the people and entities who thought Hillary’s presidency was a matter of formality. These people forgot that some segment of the public still pays some attention to the truth. 
Make no mistake, I’m not issuing support for Trump. But someone needs to hold people like Miss Warren accountable. God knows her zombie, slavish supporters won’t. I remain firm in my convictions that: the good news is, Hillary lost – the bad news is, Trump won. Share this:",0
965,Rush Limbaugh: O’Reilly Departure Was Not ’Natural’ - It was a ’Campaign’ - Breitbart,"Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh called Bill O’Reilly’s departure from the Fox News Channel a “campaign,” and not a “natural” event.  Limbaugh pointed to the origin of the story, which was first published in The New York Times and how it may have something to do with an internal struggle of “corporate intrigue” within Fox News. Partial transcript as follows: Why do The New York Times break the story? Out of the blue, they want to do a story on O’Reilly and Fox with whatever number of payouts to women. Where’d this come from? Nothing just comes out of the ether folks. They are not sitting there over at the New York Times waiting for ideas to pop into their head and then one second some reporter,  ‘You know what I think I’m going to do a story on what a sexual harasser Bill O’Reilly is.’ That is not how it happens. The reason that it starts in The New York Times is important is because the second aspect is the corporate intrigue that I mentioned that is also behind this.  It is  —   I don’t work there so there is no quicksand  —  but there is a battle for power going on there between sons of Rupert Murdoch and Rupert. And they are not conservatives my friends. In fact, they are  —   what is the generation before millennials? X? Their friends are all liberal, their wives. One of their wives works for the Clinton Global Initiative. One of the wives when this New York Times story, ‘You can’t keep the man on the air you just can’t this is embarrassing. It’s embarrassing to us, it’s embarrassing to dad company. You can’t do this.’ And the fact that the story ran on The New York Times was such a profound shock, sadness, and embarrassment that they felt that had to do something. That is why the fact that is started on The New York Times is crucial. There is two reason it is important. The Times is not just appearing out of nothing out of the ether. Here’s the timeline, story New York Times. How long did it take before you started hearing about massive advertiser defections,  just a day, right? You think that was natural? No, this was a campaign, folks. That’s why this is so frustrating to me, even after all this time, these campaigns are not immediately spotted for what they are. Therefore, people are not able to deal with them. And this one should have been expected given what’s been going on the last two years there. Tey should have been ready for this. But see the bottom line is they were. Fox is not going to be the way it is for long. There is a massive  —  shakeup coming, and it is generational. It is generational and political. It is like anything else, nothing ever is constantly the same, there is change everywhere. But it has been amazingly easy to sit from a distance and watch this, it’s amazing how easy it appears, at least to me, that this massive and rapid transformation is occurring.

967,"Museum Trustee, a Trump Donor, Supports Groups That Deny Climate Change - The New York Times","The American Museum of Natural History has long been on the front lines of the climate change discussion, as its scientists study the potential damage and its educators try to alert new generations to the dangers of global warming. The depth of that mission is evident in the numerous exhibitions at this Manhattan museum, like the film “Wonders of the Arctic,” which is on view through March 2. “The polar bear has always been the symbol of the Arctic,” the narrator intones. “Now it’s become the face of climate change and the threat it poses. ” But one of the museum’s leaders, a trustee who is also an important donor to the institution, Rebekah Mercer, has been using her family’s millions to fund organizations that question climate change, a cornerstone of the conservative agenda she is advancing as an influential member of   Donald J. Trump’s transition team. In recent years the Mercer Family Foundation  —   which Ms. Mercer operates with her father, the New York investor Robert Mercer  —   has given nearly $8 million to organizations including the Heartland Institute in Illinois, a group that rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. She is also on the board of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that is skeptical of whether human behavior causes climate change. The connection of Ms. Mercer, the museum and the Mercer Family Foundation’s donation history came to light during an analysis by The New York Times of activities by cultural leaders who donated to Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Several of them are board members at New York City arts organizations, including John Paulson at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Mercedes T. Bass at the Metropolitan Opera. But none are as unusual a fit as Ms. Mercer and the American Museum of Natural History. On one level, she is the sort of trustee museums and other nonprofit arts groups compete for: a   donor whose board membership could lead to more contributions. Museums regularly ask major donors to become trustees  —   particularly those as generous as Ms. Mercer, whose foundation has donated at least $3 million to the museum over the past few years. Museum leaders generally do not vet donors and trustees for their personal or political views or apply ideological litmus tests. But more often than not, trustees champion the missions and philosophical underpinnings of their museums. Since Ms. Mercer has only recently emerged as a   player in the Republican Party, bringing her charitable giving new public attention, it’s likely that the museum’s trustees were unaware of her philanthropic history  —   and specifically, her generous funding of organizations on the forefront of climate change skepticism  —   when she joined the board in 2013. About a dozen other trustees at the American Museum of Natural History contacted for comment declined or did not respond. Moreover, institutions with boards as large as the museum’s (which numbers 49) are typically run by a core group of highly active trustees, with others often being less knowledgeable about the detailed backgrounds of fellow members. It is unclear what, if any, influence Ms. Mercer has had at the museum beyond her financial leverage and her power as a board member. Ms. Mercer did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Ellen V. Futter, the museum’s president, declined to comment about Ms. Mercer. But Ms. Futter was emphatic that it is the museum’s scientists, not its trustees, who make decisions about the substance of what is presented at the museum. “The scientists at the museum are the ones who are responsible for the interpretation and presentation of scientific content,” she said. “We’ve done several exhibits on climate change, we’ve done numerous education offerings on climate change,” she added, “and it is the scientists who make all of the decisions about science. ” Ms. Futter would not comment on the calls for Ms. Mercer to step down or what brought her to the board, declining to discuss the activities of a specific trustee. Told of Ms. Mercer’s role on the museum board, several scientists and environmental organizations said that she should resign or be removed from her position because, they said, she was working at cross purposes with its mission. “There is no room for promoters of   on the board of a science museum, let alone arguably the greatest science museum in the world,” said Michael E. Mann, a leader in the climate field who directs the Earth System Science Center at Penn State. He added that Ms. Mercer “has actively funded the climate change denial and disinformation campaign. ” The climate change positions of people surrounding Mr. Trump are being closely scrutinized as he takes office, partly because the   has described climate change as a hoax, and vowed to “cancel” the Paris climate accord and to undo President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. During the campaign, Ms. Mercer was one of Mr. Trump’s biggest donors, eventually joining his   transition team, in which she played a significant part in pushing forward one climate change skeptic for the cabinet: Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general. “She’s certainly a force,” the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top Trump adviser, said. “She’s one of the people whose phone calls get taken. ” Environmental concerns prompted climate scientists and other groups last year to call for removal of the conservative philanthropist David H. Koch from the museum’s board. He stepped down, though the museum said the reasons were unrelated to the protests. Ms. Mercer is not known for publicly speaking out on the climate change issue. But her generous support of organizations that raise doubts about global warming drew criticism from environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. “To politicize science is shameful to politicize the institutions that are designed to foster greater learning is even worse,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said. The museum’s executives “should acknowledge that they have a healthy endowment  —   a steady stream of funding  —   and they should thank Ms. Mercer for her service and talk about a reasonable plan for her to resign,” he said. Jesse Coleman, a researcher with Greenpeace, called Ms. Mercer’s role on the board troubling. “They’re an educational institution and they are trying to present the truth,” he said, “and now they have people in important positions on their board who are actively funding misinformation and they know that. ” In addition to the Heartland Institute and the Heritage Foundation, the Mercer foundation has made significant donations to the Cato Institute and the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, both of which also challenge aspects of climate change. The Oregon Institute, which does research on biochemistry and diagnostic medicine, was   by Arthur B. Robinson, a chemistry professor who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in Oregon and received $15, 000 in campaign contributions from Ms Mercer. In 1997, Mr. Robinson was   of an   piece in The Wall Street Journal, “Global Warming Is a Myth,” which called rising levels of carbon dioxide “a boon for the environment. ” The article was a rebuttal to the Kyoto Protocol, which embraced the existence of   global warming and set goals for worldwide emissions reductions. “There is not a shred of persuasive evidence that humans have been responsible for increasing global temperatures,” the piece said, adding, “So we needn’t worry about human use of hydrocarbons warming the Earth. ” Mr. Robinson also directed the Oregon Institute’s Petition Project, which said “that the   global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment. ” Ms. Mercer has science bona fides, having earned a master’s degree in management science and engineering from Stanford University, where she studied biology and math as an undergraduate. Her father worked for IBM before joining the successful hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies, where he became a chief executive in 2010. Though she briefly worked on Wall Street, Ms. Mercer  —   along with her sisters, Jenji and Heather Sue (their mother is Diana)  —   in 2006 purchased the Manhattan bakery Ruby et Violette, which now operates online. During the recent presidential campaign, Ms. Mercer started as a leading supporter of Ted Cruz, who also argued that the threat of global warming was overstated. She and her husband, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, a managing director at Morgan Stanley  —   they have four children  —   hosted a   for Mr. Cruz in 2015 at their Upper West Side triplex in Heritage at Trump Place. Among the biggest Mercer beneficiaries is the Heartland Institute, to which their foundation has given nearly $5 million. In 2011, Joseph Bast, president and chief executive of the institute, wrote that liberals accept global warming as true because stopping it “requires higher taxes, more income redistribution” and other “policies already on the liberal political agenda. ” “Liberals have no reason to ‘look under the hood’ of the global warming scare, to see what the real science says,” he added. “They believe in global warming because they feel it justifies their ideological convictions. ” Beka Economopoulos is founding director of a mobile project called the Natural History Museum, which in 2015 drafted a letter signed by scientists calling for institutions of science and natural history to “cut all ties” with fossil fuel companies. She said she found it troubling that Ms. Mercer held a governing role at the museum despite her support for groups that oppose its efforts. “How can a science museum reconcile placing a climate denier in a leadership position?” she said. “It’s incomprehensible. ” “In the   era,” Ms. Economopoulos added, “the role of our most trusted institutions of science is more important than ever. ”",0
968,Cecile Richards Credits Planned Parenthood Supporters with Stopping AHCA - Breitbart,"Immediately after the cancellation of the House vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards sent out a fundraising email to her supporters, crediting them with stopping the vote on the bill. [“Paul Ryan and Donald Trump tried forcing through the worst legislation for women in a generation,” Richards says. “They were   on stripping health care from 24 million people, cutting essentials like maternity care, and blocking women from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers. ”  Because people organized and spoke out, tomorrow 8, 118 people will be able to get care at Planned Parenthood health centers across America.  —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 24, 2017,  Great to have so many women’s health experts around the table discussing ending maternity coverage  blocking access to Planned Parenthood. pic. twitter.   —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 23, 2017,  For awhile, Planned Parenthood was touting its “prenatal services. ” Once it was realized what these services were  —   for the most part, “fake news”  —   the abortion chain began boasting about its “maternity care,” largely to justify its more than half a billion dollars annually in taxpayer funding.  “The reality is, Planned Parenthood does zero mammograms, performs less than two percent of women’s cancer screenings in the U. S. offers virtually no prenatal care, yet does over a third of the nation’s abortions  —   887 abortions every day,” says Lila Rose, president of national   group Live Action. Rose’s organization recently released another investigative video in which Planned Parenthood staff members throughout the country are repeatedly heard informing the investigator that their clinics do not offer “prenatal care. ” “Live Action’s recent investigation has shown that women wanting to keep their children who were seeking prenatal care at Planned Parenthoods across the country were consistently turned away, despite Planned Parenthood’s claims that its federal funding goes toward prenatal care,” Rose says. “When subsequently asked, the abortion chain has refused to tell the media how many of its centers actually provide prenatal care. ” In her email message, Richards says to her supporters, “Your strength was far greater than theirs. The unprecedented grassroots energy from you and the entire Planned Parenthood community helped stop this bill from even leaving the House. ” “The incredible support of the Planned Parenthood community just made all the difference in stopping this dangerous bill right now,” she adds. “Our voices together are loud enough to drown out the   politicians  —   and we’ll need you with us for whatever comes next. ”",0
969,When They Switch the Chip On You Won’t Know Who You Are Anymore,"Home | Sci/Tech | When They Switch the Chip On You Won’t Know Who You Are Anymore When They Switch the Chip On You Won’t Know Who You Are Anymore By Dr. Kane Targonen 15/11/2016 18:20:20 
LOS ALAMOS – USA – The immersive qualities of Virtual Reality are only just being rolled out right now, but in a few years every household will have multiple head sets, eventually progressing to mind chips. 

People who have these VR sets are already completely addicted to the sensation of total immersion within another world, and this is the clincher, soon they will not be able to live without their VR headsets. 
The natural progression from an external device, like a pair of goggles is to have a chip implanted into the brain directly which will link up with the synapses and billions of dendrites. These chips are already in use for the severely disabled, however their development is accelerating daily. 
Mapping out every channel and synapse in the human brain is a feat in itself, and they have already mapped out the brains of rodents and smaller creatures. 
“We can upload any scenario directly into your brain, you will feel as if you are there, you will see, smell, and feel every nuance the programmers introduce into the world, you will taste food, you will feel the wind on your cheek, every sensation you feel in the real world can be replicated in the brain directly through the zones activated by the neural implants. 
“This technology will be sold through the premise of perfect memory and data recall. Imagine going to a dinner party and knowing who the head honchos are to schmooze with immediate data downloaded into your brain, imagine being able to speak in any language at the drop of a hat, or recall any text ever written by man at the blink of an eye,” a scientist on the project revealed. 
The next step will no doubt be a jump from the intrusive machinery strapped on to our bodies to the discreet internal implants, and of course with every leap forwards there is always a leap backwards in freedom. You will essentially allow an external force into your own mind. 
Behaviour modification 
“We have apps now for everything, and in the future, you want to fly that Huey, just download the app in thirty seconds and you will be an expert pilot. Yes, it sounds very Matrix, but consider the fact that every six months, the power of computers doubles. We are getting very close now to a point of no return, and the processing power in chips is getting more powerful, yet shrinking in size. We will be able to alter every facet of someone’s behaviour. After the chipping process, you will not be recognisable. 
“This is not one way traffic, and advertisers will be able to beam adverts directly into your brain. If you do not comply with whichever regime or government is in charge, they can not only shut you down, but implant nightmares into your own brain to torture you for your crimes. We can see prisoners in jail, who will be put into states of mind torture lasting thousands of years , this is accomplished by speeding their mind clock to the desired level. Prisoners could therefore spend thousands of years breaking rocks with no end in sight, all in their own minds,” the scientist added. 
Once they’re in your head, that’s it. 
The future will certainly be an interesting place but with the introduction of artificial intelligent systems, sentient machinery and brainchipping, there may be no place for humans to go other than the augmented fashion. Employers will require their staff to be chipped, and all transactions will require biometric approval. Therefore, if you wish to be employed, and eat, you need the chip. Share on :",0
970,U.S. Concedes $400 Million Payment to Iran Was Delayed as Prisoner ‘Leverage’ - The New York Times,"The State Department conceded for the first time on Thursday that it delayed making a $400 million payment to Iran for several hours in January “to retain maximum leverage” and ensure that three American prisoners were released the same day. For months the Obama administration had maintained that the payment was part of a settlement over an old dispute and did not amount to a “ransom” for the release of the Americans. Instead, administration officials said, it was the first installment of the $1. 7 billion that the United States intends to pay Iran to reimburse it for military equipment it bought before the Iranian revolution that the United States never delivered. But at a briefing on Thursday, John Kirby, the State Department spokesman, said the United States “took advantage of the leverage” it felt it had that weekend in   to obtain the release of the hostages and “to make sure they got out safely and efficiently. ” Republicans opposed to the nuclear deal President Obama reached with Iran have described the payment as ransom and a further sign of his administration’s feckless dealings with Tehran. Administration officials have said that the two transactions were negotiated entirely separately over a period of years. That they came together on one weekend reflected a desire on the part of Secretary of State John Kerry and his counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, to set aside a series of disputes, complete the nuclear deal and try to remove irritants from the relationship between two longtime rivals. The acknowledgment by Mr. Kirby on Thursday touched off a torrent of criticism from Republicans. “It was ransom,” said Representative Ed Royce of California, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “We now know it was ransom. And on top of that it put more American lives at risk. And we’ve emboldened Iran. We’ve encouraged them, frankly, to take more hostages and put more American lives at risk of being taken hostage. ” Neither the payment nor the prisoner release was a secret. Mr. Obama announced the financial settlement, and the release of three Americans, on Jan. 17, just as the Iranian nuclear deal reached its “implementation day. ” But for months the administration remained silent on the carefully choreographed timing, apparently fearful of the political blowback of appearing to have paid for the release of the three  —   a Washington Post reporter, a Marine veteran and a pastor. “We do not pay ransom,” Mr. Obama said on Aug. 4. “We didn’t here and we won’t in the future. ” Mr. Kerry said something similar: “The United States does not pay ransom and does not negotiate ransoms. ” But the Iranian press has described the payment as a ransom  —   which fits Tehran’s narrative that it has outmaneuvered the Obama administration. That is also the argument of Republicans, including Donald J. Trump, the party’s candidate for president. At a rally in Charlotte, N. C. on Thursday night, Mr. Trump said that the State Department’s admission vindicated his past accusations that Mr. Obama had lied about the intent of the $400 million payment. In fact, it appears that the money was not a ransom payment sooner or later the United States would have had to pay Iran back for the military goods it never delivered. But in recent weeks a series of stories, chiefly in The Wall Street Journal, established that the planeload of cash sent to Iran that day was timed to ensure that the American citizens, aboard a plane leaving Iran, were released first, before Iranian officials could put their hands on the money. On Thursday, Mr. Kirby conceded that while the deals were negotiated separately, the timing of the final transactions was linked. “As we said at the time, we deliberately leveraged that moment to finalize these outstanding issues nearly simultaneously,” he said. The State Department and the White House, however, said nothing about using the payment as leverage at the time, and on Thursday Mr. Kirby said, “I certainly would agree that this particular fact is not something that we’ve talked about in the past. ” It was a diplomatic maneuver that had some precedents. Often, to get deals done with a minimum loss of face, governments negotiate two or more issues, insisting they are separate. President John F. Kennedy, for example, agreed to move nuclear missiles out of Turkey as part of the 1962 agreement with the Soviet Union to end the Cuban missile crisis, but denied that the acts were linked. They clearly were. Mr. Kirby argued that the timing was beneficial to the United States. “This was a sound decision made in the end game of two separate negotiation tracks,” he insisted. “It’s their money. They were going to get it anyway. ” Mr. Trump got into trouble this month when he described seeing secret Iranian government tapes of the handoff of the $400 million in Iran. His campaign later said he had been mistaken, that he had seen images of a different plane, in Geneva. The original financial dispute arose because of military goods the United States sold to the shah of Iran, but never delivered after the Islamic Revolution and the taking of hostages inside the American Embassy in Tehran in 1979. The mullahs who overthrew the shah demanded back the money Iran had paid. The United States refused.   years ago, Iran and the United States agreed that a commission set up at The Hague would sort out that claim, among others. In recent years it became clear that the United States would lose the case and the only question was how the interest would be calculated. The $1. 7 billion the United States paid included accumulated interest on the original $400 million owed to Iran. Mr. Kirby pointed out that the United States’ paying back only $1. 3 billion in interest rather than the billions more Iran had sought was one of the reasons the January deal was good for the United States. “We were able to conclude multiple strands of diplomacy within a   period, including implementation of the nuclear deal, the prisoner talks and a settlement of an outstanding Hague Tribunal claim, which saved American taxpayers potentially billions of dollars,” he said, a reference to estimates that the United States would have had to pay far more if it lost the case in The Hague.",0
972,Australia Says It Foiled a Terrorist Plot - The New York Times,"SYDNEY  —   A terrorist plot to attack the Australian city of Melbourne with explosives, knives and guns  —   possibly on Christmas Day  —   is believed to have been headed off with the arrest of five people, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday. Mr. Turnbull told reporters in Sydney the group was “ ” and inspired by the Islamic State. Five men, ages 21 to 26, were to be formally charged later Friday, the authorities said. Another man and a woman were also taken into custody, but were later released. According to the police, the plotters had scouted Federation Square, a popular shopping and entertainment district, as well as the Flinders Street train station, Melbourne’s busiest, and St. Paul’s Cathedral, an Anglican church. All three locations are close to one another in the center of the city. The country’s justice minister, Michael Keenan, said the planned attack was imminent and “would have been the most serious in terms of its intent” in Australia. Had it occurred, he added, it would have “caused very significant casualties. ” Andrew Colvin, the commissioner of Australia’s Federal Police, said the arrests had been carried out in overnight raids involving about 400 officers in Melbourne’s northern and western suburbs. “This is a significant disruption of what we would call an imminent terrorist event,” Mr. Colvin said at a news conference in Sydney, held with Mr. Keenan and Mr. Turnbull. “They had moved very quickly from an intention to a capability, a developed capability, including quite progressed plans, we will allege,” Mr. Colvin said. The premier of Victoria State, Daniel Andrews, said in Melbourne: “What was being planned were not acts of faith, they were, in their planning, acts of evil. ” Graham Ashton, the chief commissioner of the Victoria police, said: “The attack we will allege was being planned was going to involve the use of explosives and we have gathered evidence to support that, and the intention to use other weapons, that could include knives and or a firearm. ” Of the five to be charged, four were born in Australia, and one was born in Egypt. “We believe they were ” Mr. Turnbull said. “They’ve been inspired by Daesh or ISIL, that’s our intelligence at the present time,” he added, using alternate names for the Islamic State. The police have disrupted a number of terrorist plots in Australia, and Mr. Turnbull said that, since September 2014, 57 people have been charged as a result of 25 counterterrorism operations. But he added there had been four attacks in the country since then. In an episode that attracted international attention, two people were killed when a gunman took hostages at a cafe in Sydney in December 2014. The gunman was killed when the police stormed the building. Mr. Colvin said the state and federal police, as well as the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, had been monitoring the Melbourne suspects. “We believe that they were narrowing down exactly what their plan was, but that’s all in one very small part” of Melbourne’s central business district, he said. The police, he said, were confident there was no longer a threat to public safety. A series of tough counterterrorism measures were enacted by Parliament this year, including legislation that could keep convicted terrorists in prison after the completion of their sentences, and   control orders to monitor children as young as 14 if they were thought to be involved in, or planning, a terrorist act. Mr. Turnbull on Friday urged Australians to defy terrorists by simply going about their lives. “We are the most successful multicultural society in the world,” Mr. Turnbull said. “That’s because we have a culture of mutual respect. ”",0
973,Oroville Dam: State and Federal Government Share Blame,"No sooner had officials issued an emergency evacuation order for 200, 000 residents living below the Oroville Dam than the political arguments began. Was it the federal government’s fault, for not being attentive enough? Or was state government to blame, for rejecting proposals to raise the dam and spending money on   rail instead? [The San Jose Mercury News has an answer: both are to blame, for ignoring a warning raised in 2005 that the emergency spillway could fail in heavy rain.  The paper reported Monday: Three environmental groups  —   the Friends of the River, the Sierra Club and the South Yuba Citizens League  —   filed a motion with the federal government on Oct. 17, 2005, as part of Oroville Dam’s relicensing process, urging federal officials to require that the dam’s emergency spillway be armored with concrete, rather than remain as an earthen hillside. The groups filed the motion with FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They said that the dam, built and owned by the state of California, and finished in 1968, did not meet modern safety standards because in the event of extreme rain and flooding,   water would overwhelm the main concrete spillway, then flow down the emergency spillway, and that could cause heavy erosion that would create flooding for communities downstream, but also could cause a failure, known as “loss of crest control. ”   …     FERC rejected that request, however, after the state Department of Water Resources, and the water agencies that would likely have had to pay the bill for the upgrades, said they were unnecessary. There will be plenty of   in the days to come. For officials dealing with an emergency situation on Sunday evening, however, it was more important to work together. For now. Joel B.

974,The Daily Traditionalist: Jeff Schoep and the NSM,"Radio Aryan October 29, 2016 
Matthew Heimbach brings us the last show of the week accompanied by Jason Augustus and special guest Jeff Schoep from the National Socialist Movement. Jeff tells us how he has been involved in White Nationalism for around 25 years and reminds us of the sacrifices that many good men have made over that time to promote our cause, being imprisoned or physically attacked for their beliefs. The NSM is a political movement as well as being involved in street activism, so they are involved in a lot of community outreach work. Jeff talks about how their roots go back to George Lincoln Rockwell and the only groups that have legitimate ties to his movement are the New Order and the NSM. He was taught by the people who had learned from him and public service was always a part of what they were doing. 
Jason asks what it was like to be a political skinhead involved in National Socialism and what changes he has seen in his time. Years ago a fight just used to be a fight, but nowadays you can be hit with hate crime charges as well, which can lead to lengthy prison sentences and ruined lives, just for a fistfight that may not have even involved racial politics. You cannot even defend your life any more without being charged with hate crime, as we have seen recently in Britain, where activists have received serious jail time for defending themselves against violent antifa in Kent. Jeff is banned from Britain as well as Matt, not due to any criminal activity but just because his speech is politically incorrect. Matt reminds us that the reason for this is because they have no answer to our talking points. They cannot debate us so they always seek to shut us down. 
The NSM will be taking an important role in the new Nationalist Front alliance with the TWP and Jeff talks about previous attempts to do this before, where good people have tried to broker a peace between the various organisations but due to petty reasons were never able to achieve it. He explains how the main problem has always been personality issues, where people have an issue with someone and then make up stories about them to cause problems. 
The TWP and the NSM will be at a national rally together at the state capital of Pennsylvania on November 5th and all are welcome, especially other organisations. Jeff reminds us that although it is good to be promoting stuff on the internet, real political change has always been made on the streets. He suggests that if people are worried of being caught on camera, they should just wear a hat and sunglasses. Matt points out that he has never met anyone at an event that he has ever then gone on to have problems with on the internet. 
For the last part of the podcast Jeff talks about how he has worked to modernise the NSM, distancing them from German symbols and concentrating on American ones instead. He has taken some flak for this but believes that if we want to win, then we will have to start taking risks, after all, who dares wins.

975,Michael Moore: Joe Blow Will Vote Trump As “Ultimate F–– You to the Elite… A Human Molotov Cocktail”,"Tweet Home » Headlines » World News » Michael Moore: Joe Blow Will Vote Trump As “Ultimate F–– You to the Elite… A Human Molotov Cocktail” 
He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever — or felt pen or touchscreen — and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. Trump’s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. 
From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
A tidal wave is coming. 
Michael Moore, a liberal’s liberal who holds die-hard loyalty to Hillary Clinton, is acknowledging what everyone with a clear head recognizes: that she doesn’t even remotely connect with the average voter, doesn’t understand their problems – and above all, doesn’t care about them. 
Although Moore can’t support Donald Trump, he seems to admire his ability to resonate with the actual problems that the people who formerly made up the middle class are going through – economic and otherwise. Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way. 
This election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough. 
THAT’S what this election is about. 
Right or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system – as Moore calls it, the ultimate “F––– You” ever directed at the system. 
Here’s some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trump’s entire campaign: 
Whether Trump means it or not, it’s kind of irrelevant because he’s saying the things that people who are hurting. And it’s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump. 
“They’re not racists or rednecks, they’re actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.” 
[…] 
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody’s going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician — Republican or Democrat — had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about. 
He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th — Election Day — although they have lost their jobs. Although they’ve been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The car’s been repossessed. They haven’t had a real vacation in years. They’re stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They can’t even get a f**king percocet. 
They have essentially lost everything they had…except one thing. The one thing that doesn’t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote. 
[…] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever — or felt pen or touchscreen — and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
[…] 
They see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump. 
Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trump… 
The enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th. 
Trump’s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. 
And it will feel good. 
What red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldn’t want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault. 
People have been hurting and in decline for eight long years – and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasn’t done a damned thing. And Hillary can’t even pretend. 
The people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will – once and for all – stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge. 
What the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course. On Sale At SD Bullion… This Week Only…",0
976,Jaguars Owner Shahid Khan Opposes Trump’s Immigration Ban - The New York Times,"HOUSTON  —   Commissioner Roger Goodell of the N. F. L. declined to take a public stance last week on President Trump’s executive order temporarily banning visits by citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries, even as leaders in the N. B. A. spoke out against the order. But the owner Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars made it clear Saturday that he was opposed to the ban and said he had been heartened on Friday when a federal judge in Seattle temporarily blocked  the president’s immigration order. “The bedrock of this country are immigration and really a great separation between church and state,” Mr. Khan, 66, said in Houston, the site of Sunday’s Super Bowl. “Even for the country, it’s not good,” he added, explaining that he thought the order could deny entry to some of “the tens of thousands of people who can contribute to the making of America. ” The only Muslim among the principal owners of N. F. L. teams, Mr. Khan came to the United States from Pakistan in 1967, earned a degree in engineering and went on to own    a   car parts business. He became a United States citizen decades ago. Mr. Khan said it was “kind of a sobering time for somebody like me,” in part because he had expected Mr. Trump to moderate his views on immigrants and Muslims once in office. But Mr. Khan said he hoped the courts would provide a bulwark against the president’s actions against immigrants. He said he understood Mr. Goodell’s decision not to make a public statement, to avoid the appearance of “grandstanding” on the president’s action. Instead, Mr. Khan said, the league should see how the issue plays out in court. “We have to look at it based on what can we do to make a difference,” he said. “And right now, there are enough forces in power and play that we have to see how this thing ends up. ” Mr. Khan has been a vocal supporter of a bill in Jacksonville, Fla. that would expand the city’s human rights ordinance to offer more protection for people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Similar laws have passed in other cities in nearly two dozen states. Mr. Khan said that he knew endorsing the bill might alienate some Jaguars fans but that he was willing to risk   cancellations. “I have no remorse over supporting it,” he said of the nondiscrimination bill. Despite his opposition to the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Khan, a registered Republican who said he had voted for Mr. Trump, supports his economic plans, specifically the emphasis on creating manufacturing jobs. Mr. Khan said his company opened or announced plans to build new factories in seven states last year, as well as in China, Mexico and Spain. He has some reservations about Mr. Trump’s approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the United States signed with Canada and Mexico and which took effect in 1994. Consumers over all have benefited from Nafta, Mr. Khan said, and his business could be hurt if the president changes the agreement. But Mr. Khan said he would support changes if they helped create manufacturing jobs in the United States like the ones he had when he arrived a   ago. “In a way, Nafta is like a scrambled egg,” Mr. Khan said. “How do you unscramble an egg? The value chains are so interwoven that it would be very difficult to do that. But government policies force us to look for ways to unscramble it. ”",0

978,"A Piano Man of Many Faces, and Some Stranger Stories - The New York Times","When Midtown Manhattan goes dark after hours, Chicken Delicious edges onto his piano stool at Mimi’s, tinkling some notes to start. He opens to the crowd with his soft Southern accent: “Good evening, everyone. My name is Chicken Delicious. I come from Mississippi. I live on the kindness of strangers. ” This is a reference to his tip jar. Mimi’s at midnight resembles those parties you used to hear about in New York, rowdy affairs of offbeat regulars for whom last call always seems far away. The Italian restaurant and piano bar, which opened on Second Avenue and 52nd Street in 1973, glows invitingly from its street corner in those hours with the warmth of Tiffany lamps. The sign above its bar reads, “What Happens at Mimi’s Stays at Mimi’s. ” Its regulars, mostly over 50, seem to appreciate this nightly time warp, and could themselves be extras from “Midnight Cowboy” or “Taxi Driver”: a Scandinavian brain surgeon who requests Beatles tunes, a Taiwanese man who sings   and hogs the microphone, a woman who keeps saying she needs to get home to her husband but keeps ordering another drink. But for evenings to hum like this at Mimi’s, much depends on Chicken Delicious, 74, who is the conductor of festivities, the metronome to which things swing. Chicken Delicious, a voluminous bald man, started at Mimi’s in 1996, and he may be one of New York’s most eccentric and unsung acts. He is not in guidebooks for tourists, but to those at Mimi’s, he is a kind of Midtown legend, performing every night except Mondays and Saturdays. Liza Minnelli has been known to go see him play. “In a city full of talent, Chicken is an icon,” Anders Cohen, the Scandinavian brain surgeon, said recently at the bar. “When he’s on he’s got the schtick. He’s got the  . And he can play it all. ” His humor is mildly crude and New  . “You used to play football in college didn’t you?” he recently taunted someone. “How did it feel always being the wide receiver? Or were you the tight end?” During a Billy Joel tune, he gave the chorus a Midtown twist: “I’m in a Tudor City state of mind. ” Outlandish masks are part of his act: the pope, a dog, Marilyn Monroe, a   baby, a fairy. He has made hundreds and keeps the collection at his home in Yonkers. He also narrates the tale of a persona in between tunes, one of a shy artistic boy from a fictional town in Mississippi who fled to New York to play the piano and make it big. He has described the town as “not quite Faulkner. ” During his set breaks, he waddles to the kitchen for baked French fries, which he likes blackened. If customers engage him during a break, he may ask for their “numbers” and start notating equations about their luck on a cocktail napkin. But every so often he will offer the details of his own luck. If he does, make sure to pay attention to the ornaments on his wrists and the peculiar sun pendant around his neck. Chicken Delicious’s path from the Deep South to a Midtown piano bar is a classic story of New York reinvention. But his story is stranger than most. He has crossed paths with Yoko Ono and her entourage, had a moment in the New York art world, and he helped create a voodoo love potion so powerful its effects could not be reversed. He was born Lewis Hunter Stowers III in 1943 and grew up in Jackson, Miss. Like the character in his act, he was a shy boy who often felt out of place. Mr. Stowers’s early passion was watercolors, and his paintings (he has scans of his work on his iPad) portray the landscape of his formative years: rickety roadside general stores, crumbling antebellum mansions, a dilapidated bowling alley on the edge of a swamp. He credits his mother, who died when he was 7, with instilling in him a love of piano playing. When he was 5, Mr. Stowers said, he ran away from home to crawl into a pit teeming with alligators. “My parents found me sitting on their heads,” he said. The alligators didn’t touch him, however, which he took as a sign that he was different. He studied art at a Christian college and motorcycled through Europe in his early 20s to, he said, “sleep in fields and eat yogurt. ” In the late 1960s, he started teaching art in New York as his own career as a painter was blossoming the New York Times art critic John Canaday even reviewed him, seeing in his work “echoes of   German romanticism adapted to juvenile (or even infantile) demonism. ” Then in 1969, Mr. Stowers met a mystic named Joseph Lukach and everything changed. This is a period his fans at Mimi’s know little about. The man who would become Chicken Delicious would bear witness to a chapter of occult history. Mr. Lukach was a short and rotund figure who wore   glasses and practiced a blend of   religions like Yoruba, Santería and Voodoo. Mr. Lukach, who died in 1995, never became as famous as the English occultist Aleister Crowley, but in the spheres of   witchcraft, he was considered a powerful witch and healer and counted Ms. Ono among his acolytes. “Witches U. S. A. ,” a popular book in the early 1970s that chronicled America’s occult scene at the time, devoted a full chapter to him. “Despite being    and weighing 200 to 250 pounds, depending upon the current state of his casual attitude toward dieting,” a passage reads, “Joe is as light as a perfectly   dumpling. ” It also said his most prized possession was a “   green Egyptian scarab set in heavy gold” that he wore on the little finger of his left hand. Though his relationship with Mr. Lukach later became troubling, initially Mr. Stowers was in awe of the abilities he saw. When Mr. Lukach was displeased by a pasta dish, he set the cook’s buttocks on fire, Mr. Stowers said, and on a weekend trip to a lake together, Mr. Lukach grew weary watching a   and made him flip into the water by slicing his finger through the air. “‘What are you doing?’ I asked him,” Mr. Stowers said. “‘Target practice,’ he told me. ” Mr. Stowers became Mr. Lukach’s apprentice, and they opened a small botanica together on the Upper West Side. He started managing Mr. Lukach’s meetings with clients, helping sell herbs and potions, and became a skilled palm reader and student of numerology. One of their   products was a love potion they believed was created by the infamous Louisiana Voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau. “He summoned her one night,” Mr. Stowers said. “She arrived and her dress was ruffling in the air. He said he wanted her love spell recipe and would she give it to him. She did. We made it. The ingredients were grisly. We bottled and sold it. “I told customers there is no antidote and they would say: ‘I don’t care. I want this person. I need them.’ Then they would come back six months later saying they wished they could get rid of this person more than anything. ” Mr. Stowers said that he still had some vials left and that they collected dust inside a box in his Yonkers basement. “I will never touch them,” he said. It was an exciting time to be a witch in New York. Conjurers of all kinds would hang out near Astor Place at Weiser Antiquarian, the oldest occult bookstore in America, and they shopped for ingredients for spells at Alberto Rendon’s botanica on 116th Street. On the side, Mr. Stowers became a fixture on the piano bar circuit playing at gay bars like the Painted Pony. “Everyone knew everyone,” Mr. Stowers said. “Not like now. There’s nothing unique about witchcraft in New York today. Everyone who wants to be a witch can say they’re a witch. You used to have to really know what you were doing in that world to be respected by others. ” But potions and incantations were not entirely new to Mr. Stowers. He had been having visions since he was a child. He said he started sleeping in cemeteries in his 20s. “That’s when I started working with the dead,” he said in his car outside Mimi’s recently as he hunted for a parking space. “That was when I started visiting the African spirit world. The gods talked to me. After that, a conga line of the dead started following me wherever I went. ” Mr. Lukach was merely empowering something that was inside him all along. He was finally able to conclude that an African deity named Oshun, who represents love and the arts, had protected him in that swamp when he was 5. “She had been watching me since I was a boy,” he said. Regarding Mr. Lukach, Migene   an author and expert on   religions, said, “It sounds like he was mixing various religions and beliefs and making his own special blend. ” She suggested he had fallen through the cracks of occult history, but added: “I don’t want to pass judgment, but this was a time people were interested in spiritualism. Everyone was looking for enlightenment. Bob Dylan was. The Beatles were. It was a period of  . But he may have been completely sincere in his beliefs. ” Interest in the occult was having a moment in pop culture around the same time. Rock bands like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones were drawn to the dark teachings of Mr. Crowley. Mr. Stowers would enter this cultural moment himself. He and Mr. Lukach, he claimed, were psychics to Ms. Ono in the late 1970s. “She’d send a limo to pick us up and take us to the Dakota,” he said. “As Joseph and her would do readings together, I’d play the theme to ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ right there on John Lennon’s big beautiful white piano. She would call Joseph at all hours of the night if she had a good song idea and ask him, ‘Am I going the right way? ’” Mr. Stowers said he still had Ms. Ono’s “hand prints” from those days stored away in his home. He is mentioned briefly in the controversial 1988   biography “The Lives of John Lennon,” by Albert Goldman. Of a close friend named Sam, Mr. Goldman wrote that one June evening, Ms. Ono “told him that as a step toward his elevation he must go that very night to see a marvelous psychic whose name was Joseph Lukach. He would make a study of Sam and give him potions that would strengthen him spiritually. Sam was taken by limousine to Yonkers, where Joey was living with his companion, Hunter, in a suburban bungalow with a backyard and garage. ” (Ms. Ono did not respond to requests for comment.) By the end of the 1970s, the Yonkers house was filled with altars to deities like Oshun and Anubis, and students of Mr. Stowers and Mr. Lukach would commute from the city on weekends for lessons in their living room. Many of these people are no longer around, but Mr. Stowers remains in touch with a man named Peter, who joined Mr. Lukach’s circle in the late ’70s, and declined to use his surname to avoid association with his past in the occult. He is a veterinarian in Manhattan. “He could do things saints could do,” Peter recalled in a phone interview. “Things that Jesus could do. “We’d go there every week and meet in these groups. Hunter was always there. And he too began to open himself up to the universe and see things like Joseph could. ” But there had long been a darker side to their union. Mr. Stowers has described it as “servitude. ” In his mind, it was no ordinary apprenticeship, but rather a form of   slavery. Soon after they met, according to Mr. Stowers, he was compelled to obey Mr. Lukach, who chose his friends, the relatives he could speak to and even what he could eat. Mr. Stowers slept on the floor and made Mr. Lukach’s clothes by hand. “I was a free bird who was put in a cage for 20 years,” he said. He reflects calmly on this period now. “There is a tradition of a shaman choosing a whipping boy to break him and then remake him,” he said. “I had to be broken. I was lost. I was looking for him. I look back and wouldn’t change one thing about it because I wouldn’t be who I am now. ” Peter reluctantly admitted that Mr. Lukach, when inclined, could use his prowess as a healer for darker biddings. “He could use black magic on those that rubbed him the wrong way,” he said. When asked to elaborate further, he declined and said, “It’s best not to talk about this. ” When Mr. Lukach died in 1995, Mr. Stowers believed the spell of servitude was broken, but their students dispersed, and Mr. Stowers was left alone in the home filled with potions and Voodoo relics, where he still lives. “One of the great sadnesses of Hunter’s life is that none of these people who were supposedly so friendly to him are around anymore,” Peter said. “Once Joseph was gone, the thing that brought everybody there left as well. That is what happens when relationships are based on a desire to touch power. ” But Lewis Hunter Stowers III then started his transformation into Chicken Delicious. He still had the piano gigs, which he said Mr. Lukach permitted him because they brought home money. Over the years, he had kept his act simple: background music with little showmanship. After Mr. Lukach died, however, he suddenly felt like singing one night at a bar in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He did. And he liked it. “I’d never sang before,” he said. “I stood up and sang. I sounded terrible. They laughed at me. But I was finally out of my cage. ” In 1996, he auditioned at Mimi’s. A longtime bartender, Star, remembered his arrival. “When he first came here they said he was too wacky,” she said. “I told them: ‘Nonsense. Let’s hire him. ’” Another bartender, Laurie Bricker, also recalled his start. “Mimi’s will be around no matter who is behind the piano,” she said, “but when Hunter came here, a very special and psychic power arrived with him. ” The masks and the tale of the fictional Mississippi town developed soon after. So did his exotic pendants. “I make them all myself,” he said. “Each one represents a god or goddess I worship. I throw the bones every evening and ask them which I should wear. They tell me if it will be a hard night or if someone will need special care. I’m like a pastor. Each is an omen of how the night will be and what will be needed from me. ” Before a set at Mimi’s last month, Mr. Stowers drove around the block repeatedly in his car. This nightly search for a parking spot has become something of a ritual. “Jesus will help us find a spot,” he said. As he looped around the block, he explained how he took the name Chicken Delicious. First, he became Hunter Blue in 1998, because he dyed his hair blue, then he became Chicken Delicious in 2010, when a spirit told him he was becoming an old man. He said it told him: “Do this and they won’t think of you as an old man. Do this and they will think of you as an old chicken. ” “Now I’m just waiting for my next name,” he said. “I’m waiting for the next step in my evolution. ” At a red light, he offered divinations about my life: “You’ve been a nervous wreck. ” “You’re not an easy person and you will never be easy. ” “You have problems in your romance life. ” Eventually, a red Toyota pulled out in front of Mimi’s. “I told you Jesus would deliver,” he said, pulling into the space. “Some people think this all just fun. But there’s a depth happening. This is a distilling of many years of magic. What I’m doing isn’t obvious, but I find the people who are looking, even if they don’t realize it. ” Mr. Stowers hobbled out of his van, collected a bag of props and headed into Mimi’s, where regulars were gathering. He edged onto his stool. “Good evening, everyone,” he said. “My name is Chicken Delicious. ” He told them he came from Mississippi. “I live on the kindness of strangers. I’m going to show you what it means to follow a passion every day like I have for 74 years. ” Then he put on a mask and started to play.",0

980,FBI Visits Man at His Home After He Films US Postal Distribution Center,"
A copblocker in southern California was visited by two FBI agents at his home after conducting a first amendment audit at a US Postal Central Distribution Center, where he filmed inside and outside of the building as an effort to verify that the right to film was respected in that location.

Felipe Hernandez and fellow auditors began to film one of the controlled entry points at the facility, and almost immediately two US Postal Service Police park their cruisers in front of them, one blockading the sidewalk. They asked questions and paced back and forth, but they eventually left without incident.
After a few minutes, Hernandez walked to another gate to film only to find another individual in an unmarked car following surveilling their activities. However, no further police contact was made and the auditors left.
Nearly two weeks later on October 19, Hernandez filmed two plain clothes agents from the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, one with a clipboard, asking him questions pertaining to his filming of a US mail distribution facility. The agent declares that filming “critical infrastructure” can be considered “suspicious activity,” and that is why he is investigating Hernandez.

Hernandez tells them that he was instructed by his lawyer, who was on the phone at that moment, to not answer any questions. After a few minutes, Hernandez hands one of the agents the cell phone and they speak directly with his lawyer.
The agent tells the attorney that the filming of a US
After a few minutes on the phone with the attorney, the officer is heard saying:
So, we’re done here. If you’re saying that he was videotaping whatever in Los Angeles for whatever reason, and it’s not a terrorism-related activity, then we’re good. They don’t look like terrorists to me, I’ll tell you that.
The agent hands back the phone, and Hernandez says, “You guys be safe,” as they walk away. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

981,Hispanic Crowd Boos Marco Rubio off Stage,"Hispanic Crowd Boos Marco Rubio off Stage Rafael Bernal, The Hill, October 25, 2016 
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took the stage in Orlando at Calle Orange, a Puerto Rican-themed festival, on Sunday when some in the crowd started booing, NPR reported . 
The jeering got louder as the Cuban-American senator, seeking reelection after dropping his presidential bid earlier this year, was introduced. 
And when the emcee asked for applause as Rubio took the same, boos drowned out any supporters in the crowd, NPR added. 
“Thank you for having me today,” Rubio said in Spanish. “I want you to enjoy this day. We’re not going to talk about politics today. Thank God for this beautiful day, and for our freedom, our democracy, our vote, and our country. God bless you all, thank you very much.” 
He left the stage to more boos from the crowd, according to the report. 
{snip} 
Rubio is running against Rep. Patrick Murphy (D), and the latest average of polls in the race shows Rubio ahead by about 3 points. 
Murphy’s campaign seized on the Sunday incident and blasted out video it says shows the booing. It also noted that Murphy attended the festival “with a leader for Puerto Rican communities, Rep. Nydia Velazquez,” while “Marco Rubio was booed off the stage.” 
Rubio’s campaign shared a video with The Hill Monday that it says counters what the Murphy campaign sent out and shows him being greeted enthusiastically as he moves through the crowd. 
{snip} 
Festival attendants said they disapproved of Rubio’s endorsement of Trump, who is deeply unpopular among Hispanics. 
“When we have someone like Trump, who hits our Mexican brothers, our Latino brothers, then you jump on that bandwagon after all that stuff he says not only about you personally . . . as a Latino, you’re a freaking sellout. I would not vote for him if they paid me,” Calle Orange attendant Angel Marin told NPR about Rubio.

982,Fired TV Reporter: I’ve Received Thousands of ’Sexual and Violent’ Threats,"A Philadelphia television reporter who lost her job after she was caught screaming expletives at a police officer outside a comedy club said she is now receiving thousands of “sexual and violent” phone messages and threats. [Colleen Campbell, 28, said she is the one being targeted now after she claimed she was “ruined” when the video of her   tirade went viral and caused her to lose her job as a reporter at PHL 17.  “From the time the video was made public, Ms. Campbell has been the recipient of thousands of lewd and threatening phone calls, texts, messages, and emails ranging from angry, profane, and defamatory insults to deeply disturbing sexual and violent threats,” Campbell family spokesman and attorney Wayne Pollock told the New York Post in a statement. “Ms. Campbell and her family are still sorting out the events of that night. Their highest priority is the health and   of Ms. Campbell. ” Pollock added that Campbell is trying to reach out to the Philadelphia police officer to offer an apology for her behavior. The video showed Campbell verbally lashing out at the officer while the officer just asked her to walk away. “Or what? Or what, motherf —  ker? Lick my a —  hole,” Campbell says in the video. “How about that? F —  king piece of s —  t. That’s why nobody likes f —  king police   …     idiots in this f —  king town. ” Police told Philadelphia magazine that Campbell faces assault charges for allegedly kicking the unidentified officer as well as the doors and windows of the police cruiser multiple times after her arrest. The assault charges are in addition to the charges of resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and disorderly conduct that she already faces. Campbell originally claimed to have consumed two drinks at the comedy club and believes she was drugged. The Post reports that she later admitted to having five drinks, including two shots she consumed before the show and a few drinks she had while bartending at the Devil’s Den in South Philadelphia earlier in the evening.",0
983,Detained Illegal Aliens End 3-Day Hunger Strike,"Illegal immigrants detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, stopped a hunger strike shortly before Easter Sunday. The detainees demanded more money for doing chores, better food, and medical care. [Nearly 750 detainees reportedly refused their meals nearly half of the 1, 500 inmate capacity of the detention center. The hunger strike began earlier in the week on April 10 when some of the male detainees refused their lunches. Some women at the detention center later joined in the protest, the Seattle Times reported.  Protesters planned to fast for at least three days because the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency reportedly does not recognize hunger strikes that are any shorter. All but one detention   had stopped the strike by Saturday morning, said a spokeswoman for ICE. The detention facility was at the center of a publicized hunger strike in 2014 when Time reported that Paulino Ruiz “was sick of eating a boiled potato at every meal. ” He also reportedly claimed to be   with the $   he received for doing custodial chores. He further alleged harsh treatment by detention center personnel. Ruiz is a legal resident who came to the United States at the age of three. He was scheduled for removal by immigration officers after he served prison time for robbery. All but just a handful of inmates stopped their strike after it had gone on for more than a week, Time reported. Breitbart Texas reported in   that more than 60, 000 illegal aliens that were housed in a Colorado detention center are suing the federal contractor who operates the detention center. They allege the facility compelled “forced labor” in violation of federal human trafficking laws and are seeking money damages and restitution. Lawyers for the GEO Group, Inc. counter that no other court has ever recognized trafficking or unjust enrichment claims for cleaning bathrooms, serving meals, doing laundry, and performing other housekeeping duties. There is a supervised program of daily cleaning by all detainees, and GEO implements these requirements “through an   program. ” “Nobody trafficked them there,” the defendant argued in a motion filed with the court which authorized the class action lawsuit.

984,"US, Russia to Meet to Discuss Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty - Alex Gorka","Politics US, Russia to Meet to Discuss Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty 
The US has accused Russia of breaking the INF Treaty and summoned a special meeting, but as of yet Washington has provided no evidence of Russian violations Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation 
The United States has called for a special meeting with Russia over alleged violations of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty - a landmark Cold War-era agreement. 
Washington wants the Special Verification Commission (SVC) to discuss the problems related to the treaty’s compliance. The event is expected to take place in mid-November. The INF set up the Special Verification Commission as a way to deal with disputes surrounding the treaty. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan can also attend the meeting because they housed intermediate range missiles before the disintegration of the Soviet Union and remain parties to the treaty. No SVC meeting has been convened since 2003. 
Russia welcomes the United States' offer. «We have responded positively», said Mikhail Ulyanov, the head of Foreign Ministry's Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Department. 
The treaty, which bans testing, producing, and possessing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 to 5,500 kilometers, eliminated an entire class of missiles from Europe, and set up an extensive system of verification and compliance. 
Two years ago, the United States first asserted that Russia was in violation of the treaty, by developing a missile system that fell within the INF prohibitions. 
Last year, Rose Gottemoeller, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said that Russia risked provoking «military and economic countermeasures» if it continued to stonewall the INF issue. 
The US has not released any specifics about which exactly Russian missile is the source of the violation. It should be noted that if Washington cannot present compelling evidence of the Russian non-compliance, the United States could be seen by the world as the party that killed the INF Treaty. The only thing the State Department has said is that an unspecified Russian ground-launched cruise missile breaches the agreement. 
The issue has been in focus of US media outlets recently. For instance, an article published by The New York Times on October 19 said « Russia appears to be moving ahead with a program to produce a ground-launched cruise missile». 
According to the article, «the concern goes beyond those raised by the United States in July 2014, when the Obama administration said that Russia had violated the 1987 treaty on Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces». On the very same day, The Wall Street Journal chimed in saying «The US is escalating a dispute with Russia over its accusations that Moscow possesses banned missile technology». 
On October 17, two top House Republican chairmen - House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (Texas) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (Calif.) – wrote a letter to the US president saying «It has become apparent to us that the situation regarding Russia’s violation has worsened, and Russia is now in material breach of the treaty». 
Russia, in turn, has accused the US of violating the pact. According to Russia’s officials, the Aegis Ashore missile defense system that the US has activated in Romania and plans to install in Poland represents a violation of the treaty. 
Aegis Ashore uses the naval Mk-41 launching system, which is capable of firing long-range cruise missile. This is a blatant violation of the INF Treaty provisions. 
The treaty bans launchers capable of firing intermediate range missiles. Mk-41s deployed in Europe may launch short and intermediate range cruise missiles deep into Russian territory. A US intermediate range weapon launched from Romania or Poland would require only a short flight time to reach beyond the Urals. Russia has also said that American armed drones violate the treaty. 
The US plans to arm tactical aviation in Europe with modernized B61-12 guided warheads will virtually nullify all the benefits of the INF Treaty from the point of view of Russia’s security. The aircraft could fly from bases in Lithuania, Estonia and Poland to Russia’s largest cities in 15-20 minutes – not that much longer than the flight time of the missiles scuttled by the INF treaty. 
If the US really wants the talks to produce a positive result, all these concerns should be part of the agenda. 
The SVC meeting will take place against the background of Russia’s withdrawal from the plutonium disposal deal with the US because of Washington’s non-compliance, recent movement of nuclear-capable Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad , rising tensions over NATO’s ground forces to deploy near Russian borders in 2017, US withdrawal from the agreement over Syria and apparent disintegration of arms control regime. 
Only political unity among the major global powers can reverse the disintegration process. Non-compliance, technical or material, is not the only problem the INF faces. Russia and the US adherence to the treaty’s provisions does not prevent other countries from efforts to acquire ground-based intermediate range nuclear capability. The treaty should become multilateral. Russia and the US could cooperate in an effort to reach this goal with the help of the United Nations. It may be kind of forgotten today as so many things have happened since then, but in October 2007 Russia and the United States issued a joint statement to call on all countries to join a global INF Treaty addressing the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) of the UN General Assembly. 
Setting the existing differences aside, the parties could revive the process in an effort to involve other states. 
The SVC meeting may become a venue for addressing other issues related to arms control. The concerns are there. Candid talk is the best way to address the burning problems of mutual interest. 
The US has demonstratively refused to discuss the host of problems related to the ballistic missile defense in Europe. 
This stance is erroneous. The US should change its approach to the problem. The two great powers do need a venue for arms control dialogue. The reached agreement to restart contacts within the framework of SVC against the background of US presidential election gives hope that the tide may gradually turn.  ",0
985,"Breaking Silence, Officer Testifies About Killing of Walter Scott - The New York Times","CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The defendant, one of the most vilified police officers in recent American history, stood alone before a judge on Tuesday and made a simple declaration: He would testify in his own defense against the accusation that he had murdered an unarmed black man. Minutes later, that defendant, Michael T. Slager, the North Charleston police officer who shot and killed Walter L. Scott during a traffic stop and foot pursuit, ended nearly 20 months of silence and told a jury that he had been consumed by “total fear” in the moments before he opened fire on April 4, 2015. “I see him with a Taser in his hand as I see him spinning around,” Mr. Slager, 35, said as he described the fatal encounter with Mr. Scott, 50. “That’s the only thing I see: that Taser in his hand. ” But Mr. Slager also conceded that given the benefit of hindsight, the encounter could have ended much differently, with an outcome that did not leave a man dead and a police officer on trial for murder. “Going back 18 months later and looking at everything,” he said, “things could have been different. ” Still, to a prosecutor who was skeptical and sneering during the   Mr. Slager was a lawman with questionable judgment, a selective memory and a finger quick to pull the triggers of his Taser and his handgun. “It seems like you’re not remembering things that are bad for you,” said D. Bruce DuRant, the chief deputy solicitor for Charleston County. Before the jury of 11 white people and one black man, Mr. DuRant accused Mr. Slager of exaggerating the confrontation with Mr. Scott. “You’re starting to make up things as we go along, aren’t you?” he asked. Mr. Slager, who was fired after the shooting, said his recollection of the day was hazy or nonexistent. “I don’t remember everything that happened,” he said. The defense rested its case, and closing arguments were expected Wednesday, after which jurors are to begin deliberations. They will have a trove of evidence to weigh, including a bystander’s recording that showed Mr. Slager firing eight times at Mr. Scott’s back. If found guilty, Mr. Slager could be sentenced to life in prison. The jurors again saw the video,    at some moments, on Tuesday, as the man who recorded it, Feidin Santana, sat in the front row. Mr. Slager insisted that specific facts confirmed by the recording, including that Mr. Scott did not have the officer’s Taser when he was shot, were not apparent amid the stress and commotion of an encounter that occurred after Mr. Scott fled from a traffic stop for a broken taillight. Instead, Mr. Slager said that he thought Mr. Scott was “running for some reason,” and that he felt he was outmatched and “going to lose” the struggle with Mr. Scott. Soon, according to Mr. Slager, Mr. Scott seized the Taser and appeared ready to fire it. “I pulled my firearm, and I pulled the trigger,” said Mr. Slager, who said he suffered from nightmares after the shooting. “I fired until the threat was stopped, like I’m trained to do. ” By the time Mr. Slager squeezed the trigger of his Glock, Mr. Scott was at least 17 feet away, a distance Mr. Slager suggested he did not recognize in the chaos. Mr. Scott, whose family believes he initially fled because of unpaid child support obligations, crumpled to the ground. Not long after the shooting, Mr. Slager dropped his Taser next to Mr. Scott’s body, a decision he could not easily explain on Tuesday, but one that prosecutors view as proof that he was trying to plant evidence to cover up a murder. The murder statute in this state is a decidedly unembellished one: It defines murder as “the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied. ” Although prosecutors have not brought conspicuous evidence of racial animus on Mr. Slager’s part, they have depicted him as an officer who broke the law and local policies, including one that stipulates that “the preservation of life must always take priority over apprehension of criminals. ” Until the Saturday morning when he killed Mr. Scott, Mr. Slager had not fired his handgun while on duty. But to prosecutors, and to a defense team plainly worried about Mr. Slager’s being seen as a rogue officer, his history of using other types of force could be crucial to the jury. Part of that history, first detailed by The New York Times in May 2015, shows that Mr. Slager often relied on his Taser to defuse a situation. In 2014, for instance, he alone accounted for about 4 percent of Taser use by the police force in North Charleston. Under questioning, Mr. Slager denied that his Taser use was a reflection of his temperament. But he did say that Mr. Scott had behaved in ways that heightened his suspicions and fears. Mr. Slager also said that had he known about Mr. Scott’s limited criminal record  —   he was apparently flagged in a law enforcement database as a wanted person with “violent tendencies”  —   he would not have pursued him alone. As Mr. Slager neared the end of his testimony, he became emotional about the aftermath of the shooting. “My family has been destroyed by this,” he said. “The Scott family has been destroyed by this. It’s horrible. ”",0

President Trump brings Little Sisters of the Poor on stage at National Day of Prayer event at White House #NationalDayofPrayer pic. twitter.   —   Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) May 4, 2017,  In his remarks Trump said: We are a nation of believers. Faith is deeply embedded into the history of our country, the spirit of our founding and the soul of our nation,” he added as he thanked the faith leaders. “As we look at the violence around the world, and believe me it’s violent  …    we realize how truly blessed we are to live in a nation that honors the freedom of worship. Today my administration is leading by example as we take historic steps to protect religious liberty in the United States of America. “We will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied, or silenced anymore,” said Trump. “We will never ever stand for religious discrimination. Tolerance is the cornerstone of peace. ” The President then announced his overseas trip and that he will meet with leaders from across the Muslim world in Saudi Arabia. Trump mentioned President Abraham Lincoln’s announcement of a National Day of Prayer. “It’s so great to be doing it in the Rose Garden,” Trump said as he announced the proclamation of this year’s National Day of Prayer. The crowd gave a standing ovation upon this announcement. “Freedom is not a gift from government, freedom is a gift from God,” proclaimed Trump. He referred to the founders of the country who enshrined the freedom of religion in the First Amendment. He spoke of his new executive order on religious freedom. “No American should be forced to choose between the dictates of the federal government and tenets of their faith. ” He spoke of the Johnson Amendment and the impediment it imposes on religious leaders. The President declared, “This financial threat against the faith community is over. ” He said he would sign the EO, adding, “You’re now in a position that you can say what you want to say. ” “No one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors,” said Trump. The President called the Little Sisters of the Poor to the podium and even recognized the lawyers that have been fighting a court case for the group that has faced prosecution for noncompliance with a portion of the Obamacare mandate. The president said to them, “I want you to know that your long ordeal will soon be over. ” “God bless you and God bless America,” concluded President Trump. President Ronald Reagan held observances of the National Day of Prayer in the Rose Garden, as did President George H. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the National Day of Prayer Task Force. President Bill Clinton invited guests for prayer events at the White House on the National Day of Prayer. While President Barack Obama did sign National Day of Prayer proclamations in the standing presidential tradition, he chose “not to personally participate nor host events for the National Day of Prayer at the White House,” according to the NDOP Task Force.

990,Hillary Clinton Supporters Now Calling for a Recount of Votes in Battleground States,"November 23, 2016 By 21wire Leave a Comment 
“The person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened.” 
21st Century Wire says… 
Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party’s ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. 
For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected). 
Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot. 
It’s interesting reading past stories by ‘news’ sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, “Why the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton” which lays out the case of Hillary’s lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. 
“Will Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?” howled CNN’s Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply “Move On,” as they say? 
Of course, we now know that ‘journalists’ like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign . 
As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election… was the mainstream corporate media. 
More form the Guardian… 
The Guardian 
A growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. 
The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton’s campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. 
The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
“I’m interested in verifying the vote,” said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. “We need to have post-election ballot audits.” Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. 
A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan’s center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. 
In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. 
“Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,” he said. 
The developments follow Clinton’s surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election…

991,HBO Scraps Jon Stewart Animated Comedy Series,"HBO has discarded plans for an animated political comedy series from former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. [In a statement Wednesday, the premium cable network said that technical difficulties had derailed the untitled project, which Stewart had been working on since at least the summer of 2016.  “HBO and Jon Stewart have decided not to proceed with a   digital animated project,” the network said in a statement. “We all thought the project had great potential but there were technical issues in terms of production and distribution that proved too difficult given the quick turnaround and topical nature of the material. ” Stewart signed an exclusive   production deal with HBO in November 2015, shortly after retiring from his   stint as host of Comedy Central’s Daily Show. The network said Wednesday that it is currently developing other projects with Stewart. The scrapped project was described as an animated parody of a cable news network, which would have been delivered over the Internet and would have allowed Stewart to comment on    political news in real time. At the Television Critics Press Association summer tour last year, HBO programming president Casey Bloys described the project as being an “  portal. ” The network had initially hoped to have the new project in production during the 2016 presidential race. The news of the cancellation comes as Stewart’s former   colleagues Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee have seen interest in their programs spike under President Donald Trump’s administration. Colbert’s Late Show on CBS earned its first total viewer victory over NBC and Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show this season for the first time since 1995.

992,Sentencing for Murderer of Rare Book Dealer,"This past week, on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016, a judge with the Oxford Crown Court in the United Kingdom sentenced Michael Danaher to life in prison for murdering rare book dealer, Adrian Greenwood. The purpose of the crime was to steal a rare first edition of the book, “The Wind in the Willows.” Danaher argued he killed Greenwood in self-defense, yet it only took two hours to render a unanimous guilty charge. Adrian Greenwood, 42, was found dead after being stabbed 30 times at his Oxford home in April.
Prosecuting Attorney Oliver Saxby told the court that this was a “brutal” murder that included stab wounds to the “chest and neck and a deep wound to his back.” There was also evidence of torture and blunt wounds indicating Greenwood had been “stamped on.” The sentence Danaher received for murdering the rare book dealer was life in prison or no less than 34 years. Saxby explained to the court that Danaher stabbed Greenwood until the knife broke, after which he began beating him. Saxby went on to say that Danaher, “cool as you like, he helped himself to that first edition of ‘The Wind in the Willows,’ and Adrian Greenwood’s phone, and his laptop and his wallet.”
The book is valued at £50,000 but Danaher listed it on eBay for only £2,000 after returning home from murdering Greenwood. Danaher learned that Greenwood was in possession of the book after he tried selling a copy on eBay in August of 2015. Danaher had been planning the crime for some time. He also had a list in an Excel file on his laptop titled “Enterprises” of other wealthy persons who were targets. It included their addresses, the method to be used like “stun gun” and the “expected take” from each target. Next to Greenwood’s name on the list Danaher wrote “Modus: Any!! Expected take: rare books.”
Saxby, the prosecutor, told the jury the wealthy targets on Danaher’s list “exudes a sense of resentment. It is almost as if these people who, because of their wealth . . . deserve to be subjected to what he has planned.” The jury was comprised of four women and eight men. The names on the list included Simon Cowel, Kate Moss, Jeffery Archer and others. About two weeks before Danaher’s attack on Greenwood, he tried to break into wealthy businessman Adrian Beecroft’s house pretending to be a delivery man, but Beecroft’s wife believed the man to be suspicious and “raised the alarm,” which caused Danaher to flee. He later drafted a letter on his laptop to Mrs. Beecroft demanding 200 bitcoin or about £96,000 for leaving them alone. The letter was never sent.
The sentencing handed down by the Oxford Crown Court for murdering book dealer Greenwood over “Wind in the Willows” is perhaps a relief to those who were on his list. The author of the book is Kenneth Grahame and it was published in 1908. “Wind in the Willows” is a children’s book known for its “mixture of mysticism, adventure, morality and camaraderie.” Its text is available online for free as part of Project Gutenberg.

994,Fashion Industry CEO: Supporting Planned Parenthood Is a ‘Civic Responsibility’,"The CEO of the trade association for American fashion designers says supporting Planned Parenthood is a “civic responsibility,” since the abortion business faces the possible elimination of its taxpayer funding. [The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) is launching a collaboration with Planned Parenthood and a campaign to raise awareness of and support for the abortion industry giant with a pink pin that states, “Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood”:  Fashion stands with @PPFA! Check out https:  .  for the full story on our new exciting partnership. #IStandWithPP pic. twitter.   —   CFDA (@CFDA) February 6, 2017,  The pins were designed by The Creative Group, Condé Nast, and will be distributed throughout the industry in time for New York Fashion Week, which begins Thursday, says CFDA. Steven Kolb, CFDA president and CEO,  said supporting Planned Parenthood is a “civic responsibility. ” “Defunding Planned Parenthood will impact millions of Americans,” he added. “We will raise awareness and support this fashion week and show that Fashion Stands with Planned Parenthood. ” According to CFDA, more than 40 designers and brands are participating in the campaign, “including Diane von Furstenberg, Carolina Herrera, Cushnie et Ochs, Public School, Jonathan Simkhai, kate spade new york, Rosetta Getty, Proenza Schouler, Mara Hoffman, Narciso Rodriguez, Milly, Prabal Gurung, Tory Burch, and Zac Posen. ” “We are truly thrilled by the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s show of support for Planned Parenthood at New York Fashion Week,” said Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards in response. “Planned Parenthood has stood defiantly in the face of opposition for a century, and we’re not backing down now. ” “The American people overwhelmingly support our organization and strongly oppose ‘defunding’ care at our health centers,” she continued. “Planned Parenthood’s millions of supporters, including the CFDA, are mobilizing to protect access to reproductive health and rights for everyone, including the 2. 5 million patients we serve, and we will continue to fight to ensure that all people can get the care they need. ” However, a recent Marist poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion, including 40 percent of those who say they are “” and 41 percent of Democrats. The House recently approved the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, a measure that would permanently prohibit taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions and would make the Hyde Amendment permanent across all federal expenditures. “House passage of this legislation is the first step towards fulfilling a promise made by President Trump to keep taxpayers out of the abortion business,” said   Susan B. Anthony President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “He and his administration are working for the American people, not the abortion lobby. We urge the U. S. Senate to follow suit so that this bill can get to President Trump’s desk as soon as possible. ” According to NYMag. com, CFDA board member Tracy Reese said, “So many people stand with Planned Parenthood  —   including designers and entertainers  —   because they and their loved ones have relied on Planned Parenthood for health care, including   care like cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and treatment and sex education. ” “Planned Parenthood is often the only option for this type of care in underserved communities,” she added. “By creating a visually engaging and fashionable pin, we hope to create an organic social media movement promoting awareness and education. ” Planned Parenthood, however, does not provide mammograms, and in  a new video series,   group Live Action is challenging the abortion business’s claim that it provides “  care. ” Live Action’s investigators seeking “  care” contacted 97 Planned Parenthood clinics across the country and were told at 92 of them that “  services” were not available. Similarly, investigators discovered that Planned Parenthood staff members admitted ultrasounds are only done prior to abortions and not for   care. “The reality is Planned Parenthood’s focus for pregnant women is abortion,” Live Action President Lila Rose said at a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday. “It’s not   care. It’s not serving young mothers, promoting them, supporting them it’s abortion. ”   leaders and members of Congress also point out that federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs) provide more comprehensive medical and family planning services than Planned Parenthood to   women and families. Nationally, there are 13, 000 FQHCs  —   a figure that outnumbers Planned Parenthood facilities by 20 to 1. Republicans plan to redirect Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer funding to these thousands of other health centers that do not provide abortion. Planned Parenthood receives more than a   dollars in taxpayer funding annually and performs an excess of 300, 000 abortions per year.",0
995,"Anti-Trump protests are paid and staged, Craigslist reveals","November 12, 2016 348 Ads on Craigslist reveal that paid anti-Trump protesters and Soros-sponsored staged demonstrations are continuing to fuel hate and division. Share on Facebook 
It was reported previously on The Duran that MoveOn – a George Soros controlled NGO, is behind the organization of anti-Trump protests across the country. As the protests continue, however, Craigslist has become an important recruitment tool for some of these organizers, and here is what it reveals: 
Fight the Trump Agenda! We’re hiring Full-Time Organizers 15/hr! – reads a Craigslist ad from Washington CAN in Seattle . Activists are promised Medical, Dental, Vision, 401(k), Paid Vacation, Paid Sick Days, Holidays, and Leave of Absence . 
Washington CAN claims to be the state’s oldest and largest grassroots non-profit with over 35 years of organizational experience. It is unclear whether it has any direct ties to Soros’s MoveOn, but it certainly wouldn’t be a wild assumption to make under the circumstances. 
In another instance, a Craigslist ad exposed paid Anti-Trump protesters being recruited for a staged event in Los Angeles. And this time the Soros link is quite clear and in the open. TruthFeed reports: 
In this case, a Craigslist ad in Los Angeles shows that activists are wanted to block traffic in the heavy traffic intersection of Highlands and Hollywood. 
Here’s an example of a Soros employee literally “posing” as a protester. Not all that “grass roots.” 
Obviously, no one is disputing the fact that there are millions of people unhappy with the election results. Neither is there any doubt that thousands across the the country are protesting genuinely out of emotion and desire to express their discontent. What’s important is that these people realize that they are playing right into the hands of an establishment agenda that doesn’t have America’s best interests in mind. 
The election is over and we have a clear winner. The losing side has conceded, admitting that the election was fair and calling for a peaceful transition of power. For all the smart folks out there this is a clear indication that it’s time to go home, back to school, back to work, back to your daily routine and stop trying to prolong the division and hate that has been eating away at this country for far too long.

996,"Men, Is Exercise Putting a Damper on Your Sex Life? - The New York Times","Men who exercise strenuously may have a lower libido than those whose workouts are lighter, according to one of the first studies to scientifically delve into the relationship between men’s workouts and their sex lives. For years, scientists and active people have debated whether and how exercise affects sexual desire and human reproduction. But most past studies have centered on women. Typically, this research has found that when some female athletes, such as marathon runners, train intensely for many hours a week, they can develop menstrual dysfunctions. These problems seem caused by hormonal imbalances related to physical stress and frequently affect a woman’s interest in sex and her ability to conceive. But such dysfunctions are rare and usually resolve after the athlete lightens her training load. Less is known about the effects of exercise, especially heavy exercise, on men’s libidos and fertility. There have been hints that, in moderate amounts, physical activity increases the male body’s production of the hormone testosterone, which theoretically should ramp up sex drive. Other small studies, on the other hand, have suggested that lengthy and grueling training may blunt the levels of testosterone in a man’s bloodstream both immediately and over the long term. But those studies examined only hormone changes related to exercise, which can be measured easily, and not differences in sexual emotions and behavior, which are tougher to quantify. So for the new study, which was published this month in Medicine  Science in Sports  Exercise, researchers at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill decided to ask active men about their sex lives. They began by developing a questionnaire based on earlier psychological research into men’s sexual behavior that asked, for instance, how often they thought about and engaged in sex. The scientists also created a separate questionnaire with detailed queries about exercise habits, including how often and intensely the men worked out each week. A final set of questions asked about general health and medical histories. Then the researchers contacted running, cycling and triathlon training groups, university athletic departments, and publications targeted at endurance athletes and asked them to alert members and readers to the questionnaires, which were available online. Almost 1, 100 physically active adult men completed all of the questions. Most were experienced athletes who had participated for years in training and competitions. The scientists used their responses to stratify the men based on both the extent and intensity of their workouts. They wound up with groups whose weekly exercise was short, moderately lengthy or quite prolonged, and separately whose weekly exercise was light, moderate or extremely intense. It was possible, of course, for someone to be in the top or bottom of both of these categories, meaning that their workouts were both long and intense or light and short. But the scientists wanted to examine each of those aspects of a workout separately, so did not track such overlaps. They also categorized the men according to their answers about their sex lives, creating groups with relatively high, moderate or low libidos. Finally, they compared the men’s exercise habits to their reported interest and engagement in sex. And there were clear patterns. The men whose exercise routines were moderate or light in intensity or duration were far more likely to report moderate or high libidos than were the men whose workouts were especially prolonged or intense, even after the researchers controlled for age. (Older men tend to report less interest in sex, although not by much.) In effect, strenuous exercise “was associated with lower libido,” says Anthony Hackney, a professor of exercise physiology and nutrition at the University of North Carolina who led the study. Of course, this was a small sample of men who voluntarily chose to complete a personally intrusive survey. It is impossible to know whether they were truthful or representative of the rest of their gender. This type of study also cannot tell us whether too much exercise actually causes low libido, only that the two are linked. And it did not examine why strenuous exercise might dampen libidos. But Dr. Hackney speculates that both physical fatigue and lower testosterone levels after exhausting exercise likely play a role. He and his colleagues hope to soon mount experiments that directly track exercise, hormone levels and libidos to learn more about their interactions. They also aim to learn more about whether the intensity of the workouts or duration has the greater impact on male sex drive. Perhaps most important, he hopes eventually to pin down at what point exercise might start to lower some men’s libidos. Both moderate and light physical activity were associated in this study with relatively high libidos, he points out. “But there does seem be a potential tipping point,” after which more exercise may blunt desire. The necessary studies likely will require years and many cooperative men to complete. In the meantime, he suggests that if someone is worried about whether his training is affecting his sex life, he might try exercising a little less, to see if his libido changes. This advice could be especially important for couples trying to conceive, he says. “Fertility specialists will often ask a woman about whether and how much she exercises,” he says. “Based on our data, we think they should also be asking the man. ”",0
997,Baking Soda & Coconut Oil Can Kill Cancer: Eye-Opening Evidence,"Humans Are Free Baking Soda & Coconut Oil Can Kill Cancer: Eye-Opening Evidence 
A woman diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma skin cancer located on the crown on her head managed to cure it by applying baking soda paste directly on the affected area. 
At first, when her daughter insisted, she refused, but then she decided to give it a try. After three major surgeries, the cancer returned and each time it was even worse, so she decided to trust nature and started using pure cold pressed organic coconut oil instead of water and baking soda . 
Coconut oil has cellular regenerative powers, which is why she applied the thick paste directly onto the affected area. 
Azizo, her daguhter, used only Polysporin Triple 3 Antibiotics, and she applied them only at night. 
You are allowed to use other antibiotic ointment just as a precaution against bacterial infections within the sore area. For instance, you can use colloidal silver soaked cotton as well. 
Once the wound is closed, you can stop using the ointment. Azizo continued applying the combination of baking soda and coconut oil, but she also applied cotton ball soaked in ACV and taped it to the skin. 
As a result, this induced the penetraton of baking soda to the basal cell carcinoma roots beyond the skin’s surface. Yet another even better solution for this purpose is DMSO. 
Azizo continued applying this remedy to her mother for 38 days, and finally, the woman was completely free from skin cancer and the wound healed in no time. 
You can read their story and learn more about the method she used by following this link . 
Even though this skin cancer is nor deadly as melanoma can be, it can still continue spreading on the skin if it’s not properly cured. 
If you didn’t know, tumors only thrive in acidic environments, which makes baking soda an excellent solution since it provides only alkaline environment. 
Dramatic Life and Death Story 
Vernon Johnson, recently divorced and low on cash was diagnosed with stage III prostate cancer, which metastasized into the hip area and soon developed in stage IV. 
He was supposed to be examined about the therapy he needed to undergo in several weeks, when his son suggested him to try several substances that could rapidly alkalize on a cellular level. 
Even though he ordered cesium, it never arrived, so he used baking soda and blackstrap mollases, instead of maple syrup. 
The Trojan Horse sugar should open cancer cells wide so that they could receive the highly alkaline influence of baking soda. This should eventually result in destruction of cancer cells. 
After two weeks of using this natural solution, his bone scan showed that there is no spreading of the cancer. The PSA dropped from 22 to 5 to 1 over the course of his treatment and pharmaceutical prescriptions. 
However, beside his treatment, Vernon started spending a lot of time on sunlight, switched to a healthier plant based diet and did breathing exercises on a regular basis in order to increase the oxygen delivery to the cancer affected area. 
Moreover he wrote a book called “ Vernon’s Dance With Cancer: After the Jolt ”, where he shared his experience with cancer. 
He wrote this book over five years after the original baking soda alkaline producing treatment. Five years later, he is cancer free and he gives lectures about the treatment. 
It should be mentioned that there are certain foods that produce alkalinity in the body, while certain acidic foods such as lemon and limes become alkaline in the body right after their ingestion. Make sure to incorporate baking soda in your life since it is alkaline and produces alkalinity. 
Dr. Mark Sircus is an Italian former physician who is now an alternative health practitioner. Based on his experience as an oncology surgeon, he injects baking soda solution into the blood vessels that feed tumors. 
According to Dr. Simoncini , there is no pharmaceutical anti-fungal that is more effective and safe than baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate. 
Moreover, he also claims that cancer thrives on fungal colonies which also create cancer. His claim resulted in removing of his physician certification in Italy. 
As you can see, baking soda is extremely powerful natural ingredient which should receive more attention and examination, or at least is should be considered as a complementary treatment for severe ailments and a total approach for minor ailments.",0

999,"Trump, Citing No Evidence, Suggests Susan Rice Committed Crime - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said on Wednesday that Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser, may have committed a crime by seeking to learn the identities of Trump associates swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by United States spy agencies, repeating an assertion his allies in the news media have been making since last week. Mr. Trump gave no evidence to support his claim, and current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rice’s actions were unusual or unlawful. The president repeatedly rebuffed attempts by two New York Times reporters to learn more about what led him to the conclusion, saying he would talk more about it “at the right time. ” The allegation by a sitting president was a remarkable escalation  —   and, his critics say, the latest effort to change the story at a time when his nascent administration has been consumed by questions about any role his associates may have played in a Russian campaign to disrupt last year’s presidential election. Since March 4, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that President Barack Obama had “wiretapped” him at Trump Tower during the campaign, the president and his allies have repeatedly sought evidence trying to corroborate that claim, despite flat denials from James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. and other senior intelligence officials. Wednesday’s interview revealed how Mr. Trump seizes on claims made by the conservative news media, from fringe outlets to Fox News, and gives them a presidential stamp of approval and also increases their reach. Last week, some Republican television commentators asserted that Ms. Rice had improperly leaked the names of Trump associates picked up in surveillance of foreign officials. On Sunday, a conservative writer and conspiracy theorist reported, without identifying his sources, that Ms. Rice had been the one to seek identities of the Trump associates. Other conservative outlets picked up the report, and the Drudge Report website, which has been supportive of Mr. Trump, featured the story prominently. White House officials then accused mainstream news outlets of not giving the story proper coverage. The interview with The Times was supposed to be focused on Mr. Trump’s plans for   spending on the nation’s infrastructure. But moments after it began, the president began talking about Ms. Rice. “I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it’s a massive, massive story. All over the world,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s a bigger story than you know,” the president added cryptically, also saying that new information would emerge “in terms of what other people have done also. ” “The Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that,” he said. Turning the subject to Ms. Rice, the president said: “What’s happened is terrible. I’ve never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine. ” Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Rice said, “I’m not going to dignify the president’s ludicrous charge with a comment. ” In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Ms. Rice said she had done nothing wrong. “The allegation is that somehow the Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes,” Ms. Rice said. “That’s absolutely false. ” Normally, when Americans are swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by intelligence agencies, their identities are supposed to be obscured. But they can be revealed  —   or “unmasked”  —   for national security reasons, and intelligence officials say it is a regular occurrence and completely legal for a national security adviser to request the identities of Americans who are mentioned in intelligence reports. Intelligence officials said any requests that Ms. Rice made would have had to be granted by the intelligence agency that produced the report. In most cases, that would likely have been the National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic surveillance of foreign officials. “Requests to learn the identity of a U. S. person were not routine, but also not uncommon,” said Stephen Slick, a retired C. I. A. official who served as the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Requesting that a name be revealed so that officials could “make sense of an intelligence report was a normal part of the daily intelligence rhythm at the White House, State Department, Defense Department and other national security agencies,” added Mr. Slick, who is now the director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin. It could be a crime if Ms. Rice leaked the name of any American wrapped up in the surveillance net, but she flatly denied doing so in her MSNBC interview. “I leaked nothing to nobody, and never have and never would,” Ms. Rice said. The broader issue of how intelligence collected by the national security apparatus is disseminated and used has long been an animating issue for civil libertarians, a point that Mr. Trump made in the interview. Revelations about American programs for intercepting and mining private data made by Edward J. Snowden, a government contractor, proved deeply embarrassing for the Obama administration in 2013. Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would be willing to declassify some of the information that has been at issue. He also did not explain what he believed was unlawful in his estimation. It is not the first time Mr. Trump has made a provocative allegation without providing supporting evidence. One of the most notorious instances of this was his yearslong claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Like his statements about Mr. Obama  —   which he walked away from late in the 2016 presidential campaign  —   Mr. Trump’s claims about Ms. Rice have taken hold in the conservative news media, where she has been a target ever since her press appearances after the terrorist attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya in September 2012. Mr. Trump’s March 4 Twitter message came after reports in conservative news outlets  —   including Breitbart, the website once run by the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   claiming that there had been surveillance of some kind against Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. Mr. Trump was widely criticized for the intemperate post, and he began to ask his advisers about how he might be able to investigate the issue. Weeks later, Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that he had learned of new information that Trump associates may have been surveilled in some way. He rushed to the White House to brief the president, even though it was later revealed that the information had come from White House officials. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cast Mr. Trump’s comments as part of a broader effort by the president to distract from the investigations into Russia’s interference in the election. The committee is running one of the investigations. “He began by accusing President Obama of a crime without any evidence,” Mr. Schiff said. “He’s now moved on to accusing Susan Rice of a crime without any evidence, and this is sadly how this president operates. ” It “would be a terrible way to do business,” Mr. Schiff added. “It’s a worse way to run a country. ”",0

1001,Hillary To Be Arrested?,"October 29, 2016 
Writes Graham Dugas: 
Comey has an insurrection on his hands beyond the ability of anyone to control. These mutinous senior FBI agents have enough dirt to toss Obama, Comey, Hillary and others in jail. They also loathe the idea of being subjected to Clinton in the future as they know they will be forced to perpetrate more cover-ups and stain the bureau even more. They presented Comey and Obama with a choice…“give us Hillary’s head on a platter and we will be silent on Obama’s complicity in federal crimes [effectively a Nixon type pardon by omission of pursuit] and we will allow Comey to quietly be succeeded by a person of our choosing on an incoming Trump Administration.” OR ELSE THEY WILL GO PUBLIC. Comey could have been silent until after the election no matter what they found on Weiner’s laptop because they already have seen ALL the emails including the deleted ones. The fact that Comey is taking this action indicates that his hand is being forced and that he [and Obama] have accepted the terms offered by the insurrectionists in exchange for the face saving terms offered. This also dovetails with Assange saying his next batch [the FBI knows the contents of ALL of Podesta’s emails] will result in the arrest of Hillary. The FBI cannot weather another PR storm revealing them complicit in a cover-up. They also must be proactive and use Hillary’s arrest/indictment/forced withdrawal from the race as a lightning rod to quell a furious public by granting them their ‘pound of flesh’. No one likes Hillary, and don’t think that the Pentagon is going to silently sit still as one of their 4-Star generals get ramrodded for MUCH less than Hillary did. They are aligned with the insurrectionists at the FBI. Comey and Obama’s hand is being forced. Hillary is toast and going to jail. You will know this is true within a few days because the sheriff is about to slap the cuffs on Hillary. Weiner’s laptop is just a cover story. Tags:",0

1004,"Obama Furious After Fed-Up ‘Deplorables’ Drop 41,000-Piece Gift On Him","Obama Furious After Fed-Up ‘Deplorables’ Drop 41,000-Piece Gift On Him   Amanda Shea   Pissed off Patriots (left), Barack Obama deplaning Air Force One (right) 
Barack Obama was at home in the White House when he received a little “gift” from Donald Trump’s fed-up “deplorables,” who interrupted his taxpayer-funded rest and relaxation with 41,000 things he never saw coming. These blunt patriots weren’t messing around, and they sent a clear message to our lame duck president, who didn’t like it at all. 
The leader of the free world hasn’t done much in his two terms of trying, and he’s not about to start now on his way out of office. He has taken the liberty of awarding himself substantial tee time, only reserving his efforts and energy to promote who he hopes to be his successor, Hillary Clinton. As annoying at it is to watch him do nothing, it’s worse to see him take a side to campaign with one candidate while slandering the other, which Donald Trump’s supporters have noticed and are fed-up over it. 
There’s a war happening on our own soil, between sharply divided citizens who are sick of seeing democracy destroyed during this election. While Hillary has everyone from the mainstream media to our president in her pantsuit pocket, patriots are expected to just accept it, along with the skewed results — and don’t want to pay a single dime for our president to spit in our faces any longer as he promotes Hillary on our hard-earned tax money. 
A petition started on StandUnited has received 41,000 signatures from frustrated patriots who are asking Congress to stop paying our president as he plays favorites in campaigning for Hillary. “ We the People demand that Congress withhold President Obama’s salary, pension, travel expenses, etc. for any time he spends actively campaigning for Hillary Clinton between now and the election in November,” the petition on conservative site states. 
While it’s not unusual for the current president to endorse a candidate on their way out of the White House, “Rarely, however, does that same lame duck President spend weeks or even months prior to the November election actively campaigning for his successor,” the petition laments. 
Considering Obama’s salary of about $400,000 a year and the cost of Air Force One at $180,000 for every single hour of flight, the amount he’s siphoning from an already strained budget for a candidate that a mass amount of Americans don’t want in office is astronomical and insulting. Congress probably doesn’t even care about the cash or true conservatives and their petition, since the establishment is for keeping things how they want it at the cost of this Republican candidate who could better the country with change we need.",0
1005,L.A. Marks 25 Years Since Rodney King Riots - Breitbart,"On April 29, Los Angeles marks the 25th anniversary of the riots that engulfed the city in 1992 following the acquittal of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers who were videotaped beating motorist Rodney King. [Three of the four officers were white King, who died in 2012, was black. (Two officers were later convicted in a federal civil rights trial.)  As Bay Area public radio station KQED recalls: Fury over the acquittal  —   stoked by years of racial and economic inequality in the city  —   spilled over into the streets, resulting in five days of rioting in Los Angeles. It ignited a national conversation about racial and economic disparity and police use of force that continues today.   …     The acquittals were announced around 3 p. m. less than three hours later, the unrest began. Residents set fires, looted and destroyed liquor stores, grocery stores, retail shops and fast food restaurants.   motorists  —   both white and Latino  —   were targeted some were pulled out of their cars and beaten. The reaction to the acquittal in South Central Los Angeles  —   now known just as South Los Angeles  —   was particularly violent. At the time, more than half of the population there was black. Tension had already been mounting in the neighborhood in the years leading up to the riots: the unemployment rate was about 50 percent, a drug epidemic was ravaging the area, and gang activity and violent crime were high. During the riots, a white trucker, Reginald Denny, was nearly beaten to death by gang members, and footage of the beating was captured overhead. Four black bystanders intervened and saved Denny by driving him to the hospital. In the years since then, there has been significant improvement in the relationship between the LAPD and minority communities in the city. For that reason, the marches of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014 caught many observers by surprise. During the riots, King pleaded for calm: “I just want to say  —   you know  —   can we all get along?” Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

1006,The De Facto US/Al Qaeda Alliance    : Information," The De Facto US/Al Qaeda Alliance
Exclusive: Buried deep inside Saturdays New York Times was a grudging acknowledgement that the U.S.-armed moderate rebels in Syria are using their U.S. firepower to back an Al Qaeda offensive, reports Robert Parry.
By Robert Parry October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - A curious aspect of the Syrian conflict  a rebellion sponsored largely by the United States and its Gulf state allies  is the disappearance in much of the American mainstream news media of references to the prominent role played by Al Qaeda in seeking to overthrow the secular Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.
Theres much said in the U.S. press about ISIS, the former Al Qaeda in Iraq which splintered off several years ago, but Al Qaedas central role in commanding Syrias moderate rebels in Aleppo and elsewhere is the almost unspoken reality of the Syrian war. Even in the U.S. presidential debates, the arguing between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton has been almost exclusively about ISIS, not Al Qaeda.
Though Al Qaeda got the ball rolling on Americas revenge wars in the Middle East 15 years ago by killing several thousand Americans and others in the 9/11 attacks, the terrorist group has faded into the background of U.S. attention, most likely because it messes up the preferred good guy/bad guy narrative regarding the Syrian war.
For instance, the conflict in Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebels operating primarily under Al Qaedas command is treated in the Western media as simply a case of the barbaric Assad and his evil Russian ally Vladimir Putin mercilessly bombing what is portrayed as the east Aleppo equivalent of Disney World, a place where innocent children and their families peacefully congregate until they are targeted for death by the Assad-Putin war-crime family.
The photos sent out to the world by skillful rebel propagandists are almost always of wounded children being cared for by the White Helmet rebel civil defense corps , which has come under growing criticism for serving as a public-relations arm of Al Qaeda and other insurgents. (There also are allegations that some of the most notable images have been staged , like a fake war scene from the 1997 dark comedy, Wag the Dog.)
Rare Glimpse of Truth
Yet, occasionally, the reality of Al Qaedas importance in the rebellion breaks through, even in the mainstream U.S. media, although usually downplayed and deep inside the news pages, such as the A9 article in Saturdays New York Times by Hwaida Saad and Anne Barnard describing a rebel offensive in Aleppo. It acknowledges: The new offensive was a strong sign that rebel groups vetted by the United States were continuing their tactical alliances with groups linked to Al Qaeda, rather than distancing themselves as Russia has demanded and the Americans have urged. The rebels argue that they cannot afford to shun any potential allies while they are under fire, including well-armed and motivated jihadists, without more robust aid from their international backers. (You might note how the article subtly blames the rebel dependence on Al Qaeda on the lack of robust aid from the Obama administration and other outside countries  even though such arms shipments violate international law.)
What the article also makes clear in a hazy kind of way is that Al Qaedas affiliate, the recently renamed Nusra Front, and its jihadist allies, such as Ahrar al-Sham, are waging the brunt of the fighting while the CIA-vetted moderates are serving in mostly support roles. The Times reported:
The insurgents have a diverse range of objectives and backers, but they issued statements of unity on Friday. Those taking part in the offensive include the Levant Conquest Front, a militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front that grew out of Al Qaeda; another hard-line Islamist faction, Ahrar al-Sham; and other rebel factions fighting Mr. Assad that have been vetted by the United States and its allies.
The article cites Charles Lister, a senior fellow and Syria specialist at the Middle East Institute in Washington, and other analysts noting that the vast majority of the American-vetted rebel factions in Aleppo were fighting inside the city itself and conducting significant bombardments against Syrian government troops in support of the Qaeda-affiliated fighters carrying out the brunt of front-line fighting.
Lister noted that 11 of the 20 or so rebel groups conducting the Aleppo offensive have been vetted by the C.I.A. and have received arms from the agency, including anti-tank missiles.
In addition to arms provided by the United States, much of the rebels weaponry comes from regional states, like Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Mr. Lister said, including truck-borne multiple-rocket launcher systems and Czech-made Grad rockets with extended ranges.
The U.S./Al Qaeda Alliance
In other words, the U.S. government and its allies have smuggled sophisticated weapons into Syria to arm rebels who are operating in support of Al Qaedas new military offensive against Syrian government forces in Aleppo. By any logical analysis, that makes the United States an ally of Al Qaeda.
The Times article also includes a Quote: from Genevieve Casagrande, a Syria research analyst from the Institute for the Study of War, a neoconservative think tank that has supported more aggressive U.S. military involvement in Syria and the Middle East.
The unfortunate truth, however, is that these U.S.-backed groups remain somewhat dependent upon the Al Qaeda linked groups for organization and firepower in these operations, Casagrande said.
The other unfortunate truth is that the U.S.-supplied rebels have served, either directly or indirectly, as conduits to funnel U.S. military equipment and ordnance to Al Qaeda.
One might think that the editors of The New York Times  if they were operating with old-fashioned news judgment rather than with propagandistic blinders on  would have recast the article to highlight the tacit U.S. alliance with Al Qaeda and put that at the top of the front page.
Still, the admissions are significant, confirming what we have reported at Consortiumnews.com for many months, including Gareth Porters article last February saying : Information from a wide range of sources, including some of those the United States has been explicitly supporting, makes it clear that every armed anti-Assad organization unit in those provinces [of Idlib and Aleppo] is engaged in a military structure controlled by [Al Qaedas] Nusra militants. All of these rebel groups fight alongside the Nusra Front and coordinate their military activities with it.
At least since 2014 the Obama administration has armed a number of Syrian rebel groups even though it knew the groups were coordinating closely with the Nusra Front, which was simultaneously getting arms from Turkey and Qatar.
Double Standards
The Times article on page A9 also deviated from the normal propaganda themes by allowing a statement by Syrian officials and the Russians regarding their suspension of airstrikes over the past week to permit the evacuation of civilians from east Aleppo and the rebels refusal to let people leave, even to the point of firing on the humanitarian corridors:
The [Syrian] government and its [Russian] allies accused the rebels of forcing Aleppo residents to stay, and of using them as human shields.
The human shields argument is one that is common when the United States or its allies are pummeling some city controlled by enemy forces whether Israels bombardment of Gaza or the U.S. Marines leveling of Fallujah in Iraq or the current campaign against ISIS in the Iraqi city of Mosul. In those cases, the horrific civilian bloodshed, including the killing of children by U.S. or allied forces, is blamed on Hamas or Sunni insurgents or ISIS but never on the people dropping the bombs.
An entirely opposite narrative is applied when U.S. adversaries, such as Syria or Russia, are trying to drive terrorists and insurgents out of an urban area. Then, there is usually no reference to human shields and all the carnage is blamed on war crimes by the U.S. adversaries. That propaganda imperative helps explain why Al Qaeda and its jihadist comrades have been largely whited out of the conflict in Aleppo.
Over the past few years, U.S. regional allies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, also have shifted their public attitudes toward Al Qaeda, seeing it as a blunt instrument to smash the so-called Shiite crescent reaching from Iran through Syria to Lebanon. For instance, in September 2013, Israels Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, then a close adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the Jerusalem Post that Israel favored Syrias Sunni extremists over President Assad.
The greatest danger to Israel is by the strategic arc that extends from Tehran, to Damascus to Beirut. And we saw the Assad regime as the keystone in that arc, Oren told the Jerusalem Post in an interview . We always wanted Bashar Assad to go, we always preferred the bad guys who werent backed by Iran to the bad guys who were backed by Iran. He said this was the case even if the bad guys were with Al Qaeda.
And, in June 2014, speaking as a former ambassador at an Aspen Institute conference, Oren expanded on his position, saying Israel would even prefer a victory by the brutal Islamic State over continuation of the Iranian-backed Assad in Syria. From Israels perspective, if theres got to be an evil thats got to prevail, let the Sunni evil prevail, Oren said.
Warming to Al Qaeda
As Israeli officials shifted toward viewing Al Qaeda and even ISIS as the lesser evils and built a behind-the-scenes alliance with Saudi Arabia and the Sunni states, American neoconservatives also began softening their tone regarding the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks.
Across the U.S. foreign policy establishment, pressure built for regime change in Damascus even if that risked handing Syria to Sunni jihadists. That strategy hit a road bump in 2014 when ISIS began chopping off the heads of Western hostages in Syria and capturing swathes of territory in Iraq, including Mosul.
That bloody development forced President Barack Obama to begin targeting ISIS militants in both Iraq and Syria, but the neocon-dominated Washington establishment still favored the Israeli-Saudi objective of regime change in Syria regardless of how that might help Al Qaeda.
Thus, Al Qaedas Nusra Front and its jihadist ally, Ahrar al-Sham, faded into the background under the fiction that the anti-Assad forces were primarily noble moderates trying to save the children from the bloodthirsty fiends, Assad and Putin.
Grudgingly, The New York Times, deep inside Saturdays newspaper, acknowledged at least part of the troubling reality, that the U.S. government has, in effect, allied itself with Al Qaeda terrorists.

1007,Cory Booker: ’A Paul Revere Moment’ Is Underway - ’The Russians Are Coming’ - Breitbart,"Wednesday on CNN’s “Erin Burnett Tonight,” Sen. Cory Booker ( ) reacted to President Donald Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey by criticizing Trump for having a “wholly unsatisfactory” response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Booker said what should be a “Paul Revere moment” in which we should be talking about “the Russians are coming,” it has not been. “I think it’s very problematic when you have a president and an attorney general involving themselves at a time in the firing of an individual that was investigating, asking for more resources to investigate, not only to Russia’s attacks, cyberattacks but also people that were part of the campaign  —   as Jeff Sessions was and, obviously, as candidate Trump was,” Booker said. “And so, this really have to get back to the focus of what’s going on right now, which is really a moment in American history where we’ve had an unprecedented attack on our elections and how are we as a nation going to respond,” he continued. “Donald Trump clearly has not taken this seriously, and what should be a Paul Revere moment for our country, where people are talking about the Russians are coming, they’re not intending not only to attack this last election but intending to continue this behavior, what will our response be?  And right now, it’s been wholly unsatisfactory from this administration. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
1008,Rapper Troy Ave Is Shot in Brooklyn - The New York Times,"Troy Ave, the Brooklyn rapper charged with attempted murder after a May shooting at a concert at a Manhattan club, was shot twice on Sunday, the police said. The rapper, whose real name is Roland Collins, was driving a red Maserati around 4:20 p. m. in Brooklyn when an unidentified man approached the vehicle, which was stopped at an intersection at East 91st Street and Linden Boulevard. The gunman fired multiple rounds, the police said. Mr. Collins was struck twice, taking a gunshot wound to the arm and a graze wound to his head. He then crashed his vehicle into a parked car. Mr. Collins went to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he was hospitalized in fair condition. The police are investigating the shooting, though they said they had no description of the gunman. No arrests had been made as of Sunday night. In June, Mr. Collins pleaded not guilty to attempted   murder and other counts in connection with the shooting at the Irving Plaza concert hall in Manhattan. In August, he sued the club and the concert promoter Live Nation, which oversees the club, accusing it of lax security. The shooting occurred at a May 25 show that was to feature the rapper T. I. Before he was able to perform, however, shots were fired in a green room, killing Mr. Collins’s bodyguard Ronald McPhatter, 33, and wounding Mr. Collins and two other people. Security footage showed Mr. Collins firing one shot amid the scuffle. He had been scheduled to appear as a guest of T. I. that night and had entered through a V. I.

1009,"The Results Are In: This Is the Best Sex Toy for Women, Ever : Conscious Life News","PDF 
By Jordan Gray | jordangrayconsulting.com 
Last week I released the article The Best Sex Toy For Men, Ever . And, understandably, my female followers wanted to see an article written with them in mind. Now, I’ve never inhabited a female body in this lifetime, and am ill equipped to say what works best for women. So I enlisted the help of my thousands of female readers by asking them a series of questions. I started by asking them what their favourite sex toy was. There were a few forerunners (all of which are mentioned near the end of this article), but the name that popped up (by FAR) the most frequently was the Magic Wand . Once the winner (by critical mass/popular vote) was established, I dove into the deeper questions. The Magic Wand (which was apparently originally intended to be a massage device) is most often used by women as a vibrator to achieve clitoral and/or combination orgasms. It used to be called The Hitachi Magic Wand, but the product was rebranded to just being called the Magic Wand in recent years. 
The following women that I quoted range in age from 20-60, and they live all around the world. Some of them asked that I used their real names, and others asked that I used a changed/anonymous name. 
Enough with the logistics, let’s get into it. If you’ve ever considered upgrading your sex life with the Rolls Royce of women’s sex toys, then this is the article for you. How Does The Magic Wand Feel? 
“It’s physically impossible not to cum. It’s like being on a roller coaster… when it drops you, your body naturally has to scream. You couldn’t sit there in silence even if you wanted to.” – Jennifer D. 
“Feels intense, for me it’s usually the one I go to for a quicker, more immediate orgasm (like trying to get a quickie in while the toddler naps!).” – Allison D. 
“The intensity is unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced. I haven’t used a different toy since purchasing. Intense, toe curling orgasms that can be as quick or long as you wish. And no batteries!” – Rachel K. 
“The Magic Wand feels VERY intense. What I do is build myself up manually until I am ready for the sensations it produces–I’ve never just gone to it from the start, that would be too much. I use it directly on my clitoris, starting on the low setting. For me, it begins to produce orgasm almost immediately–however, it’s different than using my hand, with a defined peak and decrescendo. 
“The orgasm is instantaneous… the Magic Wand basically ‘forces’ my body onto a higher plane of pleasure. It takes me much longer to reach my peak, which means that I can orgasm for as long as I can handle it!” – Annika C. How Do You Use The Magic Wand? 
“You plug it in, apply the head of it to your clitoris, and begin seeing stars.” – Alisha T. 
“I use it by myself and with my partner. He actually finds it really sexy.” – Kassidy P. 
“I like changing up my position when using it. I like using it while I’m on my knees with one hand on my headboard. Or when I’m standing with the Magic Wand laying flat over the bed so I can prop my leg up and maneuver my body in the right position. I love changing up the position because it reiterates how powerful the toy is. 
Aside from switching up positions, when close to my orgasm, I change the pressure of the toy. Because it is such a powerful vibration, I try to hold it firmer and longer, even after my orgasm is finished. It almost feels torturous and there is something sexy about that. I also find it prolongs the orgasm and builds me up for the next one. The toy is so strong that the immediate reaction is to move it when your body is peaking. I found a lot of pleasure in seeing how far I can take it, holding it in the same position until I’m squirming around uncontrollably. 
Using with a partner is also fun. I love being teased by it – over top of my panties or being tied up so I can’t squirm away when the vibrations get so intense. I think it’s a great toy to use solo and with someone else.” – Rachel K. Any Specific Things That You Have To Consider While Using It? 
“Yes — it is a bit loud so if you have roommates or thin walls, this is something you’ll want to consider when purchasing.” – Erica K. 
“I had an orgasm the very first time I tried to give myself one as a teenager and I’ve been having them ever since. I never EVER had trouble on that front. So, for me, this is something I use if I have a lot of tumescence built up, haven’t been with anyone in awhile, or just need to dull my very high libido for a day or two. I’ll use it maybe once a month, and I’ve gone months without touching it.” – Annika C. 
“Yes. Sometimes the lowest setting on the Magic Wand is still too intense for me, and I use this dial to bring it down considerably.” – Amanda T. Pros And Cons Of The Magic Wand? 
The pros and cons were quite consistent from all of my interviewees across the board. Mainly (pros) that it’s powerful, effective, and durable… and (cons) bulky, has a cord, and not very pretty looking. – Pros Of The Magic Wand 
“The Magic Wand is great for high-intensity direct clitoral stimulation.” – Erica K. 
“It gets the job done, I don’t have to charge it or replace batteries, it’s super effective!” – Allison D. 
“I would say both the pros and cons of this are derived from the fact that it makes you come fast.” – Ostara C. 
“I bring the Magic Wand to every group sex session my partner and I have because it takes the pressure off the guys for having to make a girl (who’s vagina they’ve never met) cum.” – Alexa R. 
“The Magic Wand is responsible for the realization that I can squirt, as well! What I’ve found is that the sensations will build and build, and in order to really reach the peak, I have to ejaculate first. It’s truly out of this world!” – Annika C. 
“Pros for me are that those times when the little vibrator isn’t getting me to an orgasm, the “big guy” usually can. So if I WANT an orgasm and can’t seem to get to it (usually masturbating) I can USUALLY get it with the big guy.” – Lauren A. 
“1) It’s super durable, 2) it’s super powerful so with a dimmer it gives me maximum flexibility since I do have partners who like more intensity than I do, 3) Because it is a fairly well known product, it’s easy to find accessories and attachments that make it more fun, 4) It actually works pretty well as a neck massager.” – Joy D. – Cons Of The Magic Wand 
“The downside is how bulky they are. Not easy for travel.” – Anne R. 
“My biggest thing with it is that it is STRONG. And personally, that’s not always a good thing. When I first got it I would use it over a cloth or something so that it wasn’t directly on my clit. And still I would orgasm and then have not fun tingly clit for ages after.” – Lauren A. 
“It’s a bit medical looking. Part of me wishes they came in fun colours. There’s nothing really “cute” about it.” – Rachel K. 
“I do prefer, for myself, to come more naturally and with something less POWERFUL (it really is very strong) as I like my clit to be sensitive. But sometimes I just want to cum and that’s the toy to do it. But rarely do I use it right against my skin anymore. And when I have to press it really hard against myself, I know I’ll have a sore clit for a few days (and not be able to masturbate again) so I have to want that orgasm a lot.” – Heather S. 
“It’s a little addictive in a way, I find that if I use it too often I’m less sensitive for using my other toys or manual stimulation or even if hubby goes down on me. Also, have to be careful not to get the inside of the white part wet when washing it.” – Allison D. 
“1) It’s big & not cordless so that’s a little inconvenient, 2) without a dimmer switch it’s too intense so might not be for everyone out of box, 3) the wand head is fairly big so if you are someone who likes more precision it’s unwieldy.” – Joy D. 
“The cord may not be long enough. For me personally, it’s not always as intense as I’d like it to be.” – Erica K. 
(Editor’s note: the cord is about 6 feet/2 metres long) Who Would You Recommend The Magic Wand To? 
“I would recommend it to any woman who likes to orgasm.” – Lauren A. 
“I would recommend it to anyone. I don’t have orgasms from penetration so I’d especially recommend it to women who are on the same boat.” – Kassidy P. 
“I’d recommend this to anyone who wants to level up their pleasure and really explore their sexuality independent of a partner, but with the caveat that it’s powerful and you don’t want to become too dependent on it!! I use it independently of a man. I’ve had two rabbits and neither of them came close. I adore a man’s dick so much, there could be no substitute. I think that’s another reason I love the Wand–it’s not like a dick!” – Annika C. 
“I’ve already recommended it to most of my friends (with the exception of the ones who aren’t very sexual/kind of prudish). I would recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful orgasm… this is a fantastic way to achieve that!” – Allison D. 
“I read a lot online before purchasing this. Lots of people said it’s not the best starter toy. I disagree. I think any woman or couple looking to enhance their orgasms would find great value in this toy.” – Rachel K. 
“I would recommend The Wand to anyone: wether you’re new to vibrators or simply new to toys like the wand. Most women consider it their go-to.” – Erica K. Are There Any Specific Attachments You Would Recommend Picking Up With The Magic Wand? 
“I got this dimmer switch for it which makes it way more usable for me personally. I do like it as a toy for play with a partner though!” – Joy D. ",0
1010,Seattle Judge Was Ignorant About Jihad Convictions Prior to Imposing Refugee Reform Ban - Breitbart,"The Seattle judge who temporarily banned the White House’s refugee reform plan acted after mistakenly claiming the federal government has not arrested jihadi migrants from the seven Muslim countries covered by the reform. [But the federal government has arrested and jailed at least 76 people since 2001 from the seven countries covered in the first stage of the president’s reform, which was announced late January.  That fact means there is a huge error in the judge’s rationale for imposing a “Temporary Restraining Order” ban on the president’s popular reform of the expensive refugee and immigration programs. In a hearing before the decision, Judge James Robart told a lawyer from the Department of Justice that the federal government has not arrested people since 2001 from any of the seven countries named in the reform, since the 20o1 atrocity in New York. “How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since  ?” he asked. The justice department’s lawyer replied, “Your Honor, I don’t have that information,” prompting Robart to answer his own question: Let me tell, you, the answer to that is none, as best I can tell. You’re here arguing on behalf of someone that says we have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries and there’s no support for that. But according to a database built by the Senate’s immigration subcommittee, the federal government has arrested and convicted at least 73 people from the seven countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen. The Senate’s database was assembled despite repeated refusals by Obama’s deputies to provide   data to the Senate subcommittee in 2016. However, by reviewing public data, “at least 380 of the 580 individuals convicted of terrorism or   offenses between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014, were born abroad,” the report concluded in June 2016. The committee’s report also added: At least 380 of the 580 were   (71 were confirmed   and the remaining 129 are not known).  Of the 380   at least 24 were initially admitted to the United States as refugees, and at least 33 had overstayed their visas. Additionally, of those born abroad, at least 62 were from Pakistan, 28 were from Lebanon, 22 were Palestinian, 21 were from Somalia, 20 were from Yemen, 19 were from Iraq, 16 were from Jordan, 17 were from Egypt, and 10 were from Afghanistan. A check by Breitbart News shows that the people convicted include five Iranians, 19 Iraqis, two Libyans, 21 Somalians, six Syrians, three Sudanese and 20 Yemenis. That’s a total of 76 people, at least. The committee’s review of arrestees was overseen by Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions,   of the Senate immigration panel. Sessions is expected to become the nation’s Attorney General, and will likely reverse the justice department’s 2016 policy of hiding information about terrorists’ immigration status from the public. A review of the Senate’s data in 2016 by Breitbart News showed that at least 100 men named for Mohammed have been arrested and convicted for   crimes since 2001.  ",0

1012,"Trump Aides Try to Reassure Europe, but Many Are Wary - The New York Times","MUNICH  —   While President Trump has disrupted assumptions about American foreign policy, members of his cabinet have been scrambling to reassure allies that the United States remains a bedrock of support. The trouble is, after four weeks of tumult at the White House, the allies are not sure who to believe. Mr. Trump has questioned the European Union and NATO, spoken admiringly of Russia and upended Middle East diplomacy. His proxies have maintained that the United States is still a deterrent to Russia and China, a credible arbiter in the Middle East and a faithful ally to Europe. The skepticism over who is in charge in Washington was crystallized on Friday at an annual meeting of dignitaries in Munich for a yearly security conference. Germany’s defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, caused ripples when she pointedly expressed appreciation for the American “secretary of defense’s strong commitment to NATO. ” She was referring to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has spent his week in Europe trying to persuade allies that contrary to what President Trump has said in the United States, the country has not soured on the   alliance. Several people at the conference instantly took note on Twitter of Ms. Von der Leyen’s phrasing, including Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Vice President Mike Pence, who arrived in Munich on Friday night Mr. Mattis Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, a few miles up the road in Bonn  —   have all spent much of the week soothing European ears, presenting traditional Republican national security orthodoxy of confronting Russia, supporting NATO and backing democratic institutions. But every time they seemed to be getting traction in convincing skittish diplomats that Mr. Trump was not about to abandon decades of American national security policy, their boss did something in Washington that undercut their work. The result has been confusion among global leaders about whom to believe when it comes to the direction of American national security. The reassuring message Mr. Trump’s subordinates have sought to convey has been further undermined by some of his own Republican critics. Senator John McCain, whose disdain for Mr. Trump is well known, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the Munich conference that Michael T. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser over his Russia liaisons was “something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do. ” The contradictions have abounded. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to abandon a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, asserting that he was not committed to a   solution.   hours later, his United Nations envoy said, “We absolutely support a   solution,” adding that the administration simply wanted a “thinking out of the box” approach about resolving one of the world’s intractable conflicts. The same day that Mr. Trump questioned the   approach, Mr. Mattis was at NATO headquarters telling allies that the commitment of the United States to NATO remained firm. But Mr. Mattis also echoed his boss when he warned that the United States might “moderate” its support if other member countries did not spend more on the military. The next day, still at NATO, Mr. Mattis was back to saying that the American commitment to NATO was unshakable. He said the Trump administration’s “commitment to Article 5 remains solid,” referring to NATO’s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief again, until Mr. Trump held a prolonged and chaotic news conference a few hours later in Washington. “Let’s put it this way, the discrepancy between the president’s news conference and the way his cabinet is trying to reassure Europeans couldn’t be wider,” said Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who was at the Munich conference. Volker Perthes, the head of SWP, a policy research group based in Germany, said: “Mattis speaks of ‘defending the   international order.’ I hope he can explain this to his boss. ” What appeared to rattle people the most about Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday were his attacks on members of the news media assembled before him. Several diplomats said they worried that Mr. Trump was trying to discredit a tenet of American democracy  —   a free press  —   and in so doing, might embolden despots around the world into further challenges to freedom of the press. Struggling to explain how to assess the seeming chaos coming out of Washington, Michael Fallon, Britain’s defense minister, told reporters, “You know, new administrations, you know, can take time to settle down. ” In the crowded lounges and refined tearooms of Munich’s Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where leaders and top officials were mingling, much of the talk on Friday was not about the panels on issues like “the future of the European Union: united or divided,” or “the future of the West: downfall or comeback?” Instead, it was about Mr. Trump’s Thursday news conference, which appeared to deeply unnerve a number of officials. Overheard conversations included one in which one European official said that the United States was now on the list of “risk factors” for Europe, echoing a concern expressed two weeks earlier by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council. German officials joked that American diplomats and civil service organizations could now qualify for German democracy funding  —   money designated for countries with struggling democratic institutions. Several people seemed on edge awaiting what Mr. Mattis would say when he addressed the conference. When he finally approached the lectern, he sounded exactly like numerous other American chiefs who have preceded him. “The   bond remains our strongest bulwark against instability and violence,” he said. “I am confident that we will strengthen our partnerships, confronting those who choose to attack innocent people or our democratic processes and freedoms. ” Mr. Mattis, Mr. Nasr said after the speech, “is the one island of stability. ” But, he added, “the key is that nobody knows the extent of his influence. Right now, we’re tight with   unity, but who knows what to believe?” Ms. Von der Leyen, the German defense minister, used her time at the lectern before Mr. Mattis spoke to deliver a warning to the Trump administration about putting cooperation with Russia ahead of its alliances in Europe  —   or even on the same footing for that matter. “Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “There cannot be a policy of equidistance to allies and to those who openly question our values, our borders and international law. ” Ms. Von der Leyen also criticized Mr. Trump’s efforts to close American borders to refugees from around the world and suspend immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. (Those efforts have been blocked by American courts.) “We should be careful that this fight does not become a front against Islam and Muslims,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “Otherwise, we run the risk of digging ourselves into a deeper grave in which violence and terror only grow further. ”",0
1013,Will China Trigger the Next Global Recession?,"Will China Trigger the Next Global Recession? Current debt level causes grave concern Jing Jin | Mises.org   
China’s debt growth rate has become the focus of some discussions and, fair enough, from comparing the outright levels, it may seem that China can collapse at any moment. 
Daniel Fernandez suggested this in his article “ Has China Reached Its Debt Limit? ” in Mises Wire . In response to the government’s monetary expansion stimulus plan after the 2008 financial crisis, China’s corporate sector did indeed leverage up quickly, followed by an equally fast pace of leveraging in the household sector. However, in order to avoid comparing apples with oranges, we need to take a closer look by putting these numbers into perspective. Using the same data source as used by Fernandez, we find that China’s total debt as a percentage of GDP was 254 percent by the end of 2015. Debt-to-GDP ratio of corporate, government, and household sectors stood at 170 percent, 44 percent, and 40 percent respectively. 
For government and household sectors, both started from considerably low levels until the last administration kicked in a four-trillion yuan (RMB) stimulus plan in 2009. Government debt-to-GDP ratio, which was kept in the mid 30s in the first decade of this millennium, now stood at 44 percent by the end of 2015. Household’s debt-to-GDP ratio was at 11 percent in 2006 and almost doubled to 19 percent in 2007 and then doubled again to 40 percent by the end of 2015. The leveraging up of households happened exactly as the Chinese society was undergoing rapid urbanization as well as when the government launched its 2009 stimulus. 
Apart from the demand for urban housing, Chinese households, with their high savings rate and extra cash in hands, invested in in real estate as a hedge against future inflation. Furthermore, as the stimulus package allowed for easier lending, household debt increased dramatically. However, we must note that although the debt growth rate was high, the absolute debt level of household is still considerably low versus global peers. 
The most disturbing trend is found in the corporate sector, with the debt-to-GDP ratio increased from approximately 110 percent prior to 2009 to 170 percent by the end of 2015. First of all, the level of corporate debt (mostly in the form of bank loans) was high to start with, but is by no means out of the norm for a financial system dominated by the banking sector, whose funding source is mostly deposits. Two figures from Jonathan Anderson’s How To Think About China series provide some insights: 1 
An international comparison of assets of banking system vs. domestic saving rate: 
Breakdown of assets of China’s financial system: 
This point can be further demonstrated by comparing financial asset structures, for example, between the US and China. Obviously bank loans are the dominant funding source of the corporate sector in China, whereas in the US the role of bank loans is far from prominent in comparison with its enormous capital markets, where the corporates can raise both equities and bond financing easily. 
Financial asset structure: US vs. China (2015): 
Data source: The World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, China Central Deposit and Clearing, Co. Ltd. (CCDC), SIFMA 
It is, therefore, not surprising that the leveraging up as a response to government’s stimulus plan manifested itself mostly in the credit extension through the banking system. China’s Flat Yield Curve 
The large role of the banks can also be seen in China’s bond market yields, and one manifestation of this is a flat yield curve . The reason for this is simple: deposits. When banks have more deposits to manage than they can lend out, they invest these deposits into the bond market and usually on the long end to boost yields. This investment strategy (or asset-liability management scheme) bids up the bond prices on the long end, hence pushing down the long-term yields. 
In addition, between allocating deposits to these two types of assets (bonds vs. loans), banks sometimes have incentives to invest in bonds, rather than lending, due to the balancing considerations of corporate demand, credit risks, market liquidity, and yields (that are also subject to interest rate controls that are at final stage of liberalization and the lending rate was completely liberalized only in early 2016). So the yield spread, at current stage, reflects more of the combination of China’s financial structure and capital flows rather than being a good indicator of economic fundamentals. As the government flooded the market with four trillion RMB from the stimulus plan in 2009, bond yields faced downward pressure, more so at the long-term end. Please see the yields of Chinese government treasury bonds at maturity (10 years vs. 1 year) and the spread thereof in the below figure. Wealth management products channel a considerable amount of deposits out of the banking system to capture higher yields outside of banking-sector supervision (in form of trusts, for example), but the amount is still not pivotal enough to change the above explained pattern in a fundamental manner. 
Data source: WIND, CCDC 
China didn’t open up to the outside world until the very late 1970s. Now China provides half of the manufacturing goods and close to half of electronic products in the world and the economy is still growing at around 6 percent. Obviously a good part of China’s production structure has been configured to export, mostly to the developed economies, which are dominated by the service sector. As the global demand in the developed economies lost its momentum, China faces the necessity of reconfiguring its economic structure to better serve its domestic consumers (which stands at 4 times the number of US consumers). This reconfiguration process is surely painful as demonstrated by the empty factories in the traditional export production oriented cities. But to me, this is more of a textbook case of Austrian economics at work. Capital and labor have to be freed up for those productions currently being demanded by the market. And this takes time. Moreover, quick capital formation in the past three decades lifted labor productivity, with which the manufacturing sector needs to be upgraded and the tertiary sector needs to be expanded to serve a more affluent society comparing with more than 30 years ago, so that Chinese consumers don’t have to go to Japan to buy hi-tech toilet lids . A Healthier Skepticism of “Stimulus” 
Needless to say, the current debt level causes concern and the deeper concern is whether debt growth trajectory will continue. Ultimately, whether or not the debt will grow at the rate of post 2008 stimulus phase is a function of how fast the Chinese government runs the money printing press. A recent article on the People’s Daily — the mouthpiece of China Communist Party (CCP) — quoted the diagnosis from an “authoritative figure” on the Chinese economy and its cure. This “authoritative figure” suggested there should be no more money printing to stimulate the economy and that the Chinese should be prepared for a lower growth rate (comparing with its own historical average of 10 percent). Anyone with an understanding of China’s political messaging system would not be mistake it for anything but an opinion handed down from the very top of Chinese leadership. This can be considered a concluding remark on the policy swings for the past several years. 
The Xinhua News Agency, the mainstream media group, recently followed with a commentary suggesting resistance to the use of stimulus plans in the face of slowing growth. Xinhua also warned of a disastrous result if its advice is not followed. Messages like these are refreshing to hear nowadays among the mantra of the stimulus chorus around the world. How China’s policy direction is to be implemented remains to be seen, but at least the insidious effects of stimulus is well recognized by those at the top of the regime and openly represented by mainstream media. In addition, a series of measures to lower tax burdens for corporate and households alike are also being introduced, and the central government is pushing hard for business-friendly deregulations and increasing economic freedom. 
China has its problems; tons of them. China may or may not be the first to blow up in the coming wave of crises, as many people say. No matter whichever the case, I am more convinced that China will be among the first ones to revive — because it has high savings to invest, it has a well-trained labor force with one of the most vibrant, if not the most complete, manufacturing chain, and the manufacturing sector still contributes to over 40 percent of its GDP. It is still in the middle of a rapid urbanization process. It is not yet a welfare state. Chinese people are fully aware of the fact that their safety net is the result of their own frugality rather than government promises. China has the biggest potential market of 1.3 billion people with a rising middle-class that is still increasing in numbers and share in population. Serving them well is one of the biggest business opportunities in the 21st century.

1014,Bombing Kills More Than 140 in Baghdad - The New York Times,"BAGHDAD  —   As celebrations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan stretched past midnight into Sunday in central Baghdad, where Iraqis had gathered to eat, shop and just be together, a minivan packed with explosives blew up and killed at least 143 people  —   the third mass slaughter across three countries in less than a week. The attack was the deadliest in Baghdad in years  —   at least since 2009  —   and was among the worst Iraq has faced since the American invasion of 2003. The bombing came barely a week after Iraqi security forces, backed by American airstrikes, celebrated the liberation of Falluja from the Islamic State, which almost immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Even as fires still blazed Sunday morning at the bombing site, Iraq’s machinery of grief was fully in motion: Hospitals tried to identify charred bodies, workers sorted through the rubble searching for more victims, and the first coffins were on their way to the holy city of Najaf and its vast cemetery, always expanding, where Iraq’s Shiites bury their dead. By Sunday evening, a worker at the cemetery said more than 70 bodies had arrived, and many more were expected on Monday. There were also immediate political repercussions, as the bombing brought an abrupt end to the brief victory lap that Iraq’s beleaguered prime minister, Haider   was enjoying after the recapture of Falluja. Mr. Abadi rose to power in 2014, and the Obama administration had hoped that he could reunite the country after the divisive tenure of his immediate predecessor, Nuri Kamal   whose sectarian policies were blamed for the rise of the Islamic State. Less than two days earlier, two police officers and 20 hostages, many of them foreigners, were killed after gunmen invaded a restaurant in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Islamic State claimed to be behind that attack. In Turkey, the authorities blamed the Islamic State for a coordinated suicide attack on Istanbul’s main airport that killed more than 40 people, although the terrorist group has not claimed responsibility. Many of the victims in Baghdad on Sunday were children the explosives detonated near a   complex of restaurants and stores where families were celebrating the end of the school year, residents said. Ali Ahmed, 25, who owns a shop close to where the bomb went off, said that in the aftermath, knowing how many children were inside a shopping mall that was hit, he had begun yelling: “The kids upstairs! The kids upstairs! Save them!” “But the firefighters arrived too late,” Mr. Ahmed said. Later, he helped carry the bodies of children out of the rubble. He voiced anger at the security forces for failing to stop the bomber, and questioned why the street, which had been closed off earlier in the evening, was reopened around midnight. When Mr. Abadi visited the bombing site on Sunday morning, people threw rocks and shoes at his convoy and yelled, “Thief!” The epithet was directed as much at Iraq’s dysfunctional and corrupt political class as it was at the prime minister. “Thank God I managed to hit Abadi with stones to take revenge for the kids,” Mr. Ahmed said. As those scenes unfolded and with anger swelling in the streets of the capital, many are now sure to wonder how long Mr. Abadi may remain in power at the very least, the chaos is likely to presage the resumption of street unrest that had calmed during Ramadan and the military operations in Falluja. The scenes that unfolded across the city on Sunday were another brutal illustration of the paradox Iraq faces as its security forces  —   and the American military, which is training the Iraqi Army and carrying out airstrikes and raids by Special Forces  —   make gains against the Islamic State. As more territory is won back, the group is reverting to its roots as a guerrilla insurgency, turning Baghdad again into an urban killing field. Assaults like the one early on Sunday, as well as a string of attacks in Baghdad in May that killed more than 200 people in a week, make it difficult, if not impossible, for Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, to make meaningful progress in reconciling Iraq’s majority Shiites with Sunnis. But the ferocity of the attack, and the ease in which the Islamic State is able to carry out mass murder in Baghdad, demonstrate another monumental challenge if the extremist group is driven from areas under its control: Not only will reconciliation be paramount, but any lasting peace will also require a lengthy counterinsurgency campaign that will challenge the Iraqi security forces and, perhaps, require a deepening involvement by United States forces. After Mr. Abadi was forced to retreat with his bodyguards, he issued a statement saying that it was his “moral duty” to visit the site of terror attacks, and that he understood “the feelings and emotions and the actions of some people in their moment of sadness and anger. ” He also declared three days of national mourning for the bombing victims. He said the attacks were an attempt by the Islamic State to erase the jubilation many Iraqis felt about the liberation of Falluja. “I ask that God enable us to defeat terrorism and to protect our people, to have mercy on the martyrs and quickly heal the wounded, and to unite the Iraqis and crown their sacrifices with great victory,” he said. The bombing occurred in the   neighborhood of Karada, a busy district of cafes, shops and hotels, not to mention Mr. Abadi’s childhood home, as Iraqis joyously marked the last days of Ramadan and the upcoming Eid   the     festivity. On Sunday afternoon, dozens of people were still unaccounted for. One man, Omar Adil, said two of his brothers, Ghaith and Mustafa, were missing. Five people from a single family in Sadr City, a poor Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad, were also missing. The Sunni extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was the work of a suicide bomber and had killed a gathering of Shiite Muslims. But Karada is a mixed area where Iraqis of all identities gather to do ordinary things  —   mainly to shop and eat  —   and many Sunnis were killed, too. Abdulkareem Hadi, a shop owner in Karada, said that late Saturday he had to go home briefly, and asked two of his friends to watch his store. On Sunday morning, he was mourning those friends, Saif and Abdullah, who both owned clothing stores near his. “I could not recognize their bodies,” he said. “ISIS says, ‘We kill Shiites,’ but I lost my dearest friends to me in this explosion, and they were Sunnis. ” Officials said on Sunday night that the death toll in Baghdad stood at 143, and that at least 195 were wounded. But that tally may well grow in the days ahead, given that many people were still unaccounted for and that many of the wounded were in critical condition. Hospital officials, accustomed to the gory aftermath of terror attacks, were horrified, saying they had never seen so many charred bodies, and that many of them could not be identified. Abdullabas Ameen, an Iraqi Navy officer from a rural area of southern Iraq, was a patient in one of the hospitals, with shrapnel wounds to his chest and thigh. He came to Baghdad for a military course, and said he had been in a great mood Saturday night, enjoying the cosmopolitanism of the capital, and shopping for Eid. “Those feelings didn’t last for long,” he said. “Suddenly I felt an earthquake, and a huge explosion. I felt myself in the middle of smoke, fire, destruction and screaming. ” He said he had lost a colleague, and then railed against the government for failing to protect its citizens. “The government is completely responsible for this daily bloodshed,” he said. In the weeks ahead, as Iraqis face soaring summer temperatures, a lack of electricity to power   and growing anger over security lapses, many expect a return of street protests. Beginning last summer, a street protest movement gathered steam, demanding that Mr. Abadi root out corruption, end the system of handing out government posts based on sect and improve services. He made several proposals but has been unable to make meaningful changes in the face of opposition from other political blocs worried about losing their influence. The protest movement ebbed and flowed over months, and at various times different factions sought to capitalize on the growing fury of Iraq’s citizens. This year, the powerful Shiite cleric Moktada   who commands a following among millions of the country’s Shiite underclass, tried to seize the movement, and twice his followers stormed Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, the citadel of government. But in their grief on Sunday, the political fallout was far from many Iraqis’ minds. At the bombing site on Sunday, a woman, who had lost her husband and whose two sons were among the missing, was too   to leave the scene. All she could say was, “I don’t want to go to Najaf. ”",0

“STEREOTYPES EXIST FOR A REASON” 
AND EVERYONE DOES IT, SO DON’T ACT LIKE YOU’RE EXEMPT FROM A HEALTHY WAY OF EXAMINING AND PROTECTING YOUR ENVIRONMENT. 
I noticed this subject coming up more than once in the news feed on FB today, that I thought I’d address it, instead of acting like it’s the “Big Elephant In The Room”…The “Elephant” is that ONLY WHITES are to blame for stereotyping and racism, and that BLACKS are the only ones who receive racism, that is so far from the truth, as can be found in any google search on how whites are treated by blacks. Studies have found they are MORE racist than whites and I know why, mainly due to the “Chip That Is ON Their Shoulder”…discussed later. 
Racism and stereotyping exist not only because of the obvious, like ones experiences and their encounters with certain individual types, but also what one has been taught, (right or wrong) or better yet, both experience and what they have taught matches, so how can one NOT come to a solid conclusion? At this point their views are pretty much sealed. Kind of like getting “SAVED” it isn’t enough to know in your head something is true about JESUS and His word, but once the heart agrees, then it’s pretty much sealed. Why are BLACKS (sorry not into being politically correct, no one is calling me an “EUROPEAN AMERICAN”…and REAL Africans hate the comparison…lol, google it) the ONLY ones who CRY RACISM at every turn, at every perceived injustice, at every corrective criticism, at every comment made, at not taking accountability for their actions, etc?….The main reason is…. 
THE VICTIM MENTALITY: Want to read a great book on the subject, Ken Hamblin’s “Pick A Better Country” and “Plain Talk And Common Sense”…I have them both and I use to listen to him when he was on the air and he is right ,and he is as “black” as they get, (color wise) and he is from Harlem. So I trust his and Bill Cosby’s (although, he has tarnished his name now) take on the “VICTIM MENTALITY”. All one has to do is look around them and see it is true. 
As you can see, my focus will be on RACISM against “People Of Color” not against whites, because that is the consensus going around and what I have experienced and others I know have experienced. And before anyone tries to call me a RACIST, I am not! I judge people individually, till you prove the stereotype right, then that only makes me MORE cautious of the next person who comes along. And so far in my 51 yrs of EXPERIENCE, I have learned that “STEREOTYPES EXIST FOR A REASON”. But, like everyone else who has their flaws, such as any white insecure jealous woman, or any man trying to get into my pants, or anyone who exhibits “Unsafe” or “Unhealthy” attributes, I will still give another person, no matter what their race is, the “benefit of the doubt”, although I will say, some more than others. I’m not stupid, or ignorant, it’s called being WISE. It is one thing to respect others and be cordial, it is another to just let anyone into your life, or do business with them. Trust is earned not freely given. . Going back to the “VICTIM MENTALITY”, this is what is HOLDING THE BLACK COMMUNITY DOWN and is why stereotypes and racism exist. Saying it doesn’t, or trying to TWIST or SPIN into existence something that just isn’t true, will not FLY with most who have even half a brain. Common Sense and ones Experience will always trump “POLITICAL CORRECTNESS”. The media doesn’t want you to know the truth as they OMIT or SPIN things, but they can only do so much, because of all the REALITY SHOWS. (uncensored behavior and mentality) and NEWS PIECES that portray a better reality. Sad thing is too many just won’t say anything, they just talk in private about the subject among those liked minded out of FEAR! But truth is truth, so here goes. 
Does anyone else find it interesting that throughout history, many different races, if not all have been slaves, ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery ) yet ONLY BLACKS are left with a “VICTIM MENTALITY?”…don’t get me wrong, what was done to them and any slave at the time or in the past and even now (Are we focused on the 200,000 sex trafficked in Sacramento alone???…of course not!!!) was wrong. I would have to say that the MISTREATMENT and abuse of another is wrong, but slavery was a way of life even going back to the biblical times. When you think about it, we are ALL SLAVES to something. Slavery and bondage are a way of life even when it comes to ourselves. Some are in BONDAGE to their desires and indulgent behaviors, to their insecurities, to their relationships, to their job, to their boss, to their parents, to their children etc. The only “FREE SLAVE”…is one who is a bond servant to Christ and who has follow His Lordship in their life. OK, no rabbit trails, I’ll leave it at that. 
Point is SLAVERY is not as dirty of a word as many would like to think….Like many things in our lives, it isn’t what happens to us that matters, but what we DO with it….sad to say, most, but not all blacks throughout history have chosen to take the NEGATIVE REACTION for their “lot in life”…The “Blame Game” is so unbecoming… and senseless. I don’t care who you are, if one cannot take ACCOUNTABILITY individually for their own actions, in spite of their surroundings and circumstances, then one will naturally FALL PREY to the negativity that comes with that choice. One of my 5 Factors, is 1) ONES OWN SIN. (starts here) John Mcwhorter and Ken Hamblin adequately and articulately explains all the ends and outs of a VICTIM MENTALITY among the black community, way better than I can. All I know is, no other race that has been slaves throughout history has played the “RACE CARD” nor have they proclaimed themselves as “VICTIMS”…none. If anything they OVERCAME and CONTRIBUTED! They banded together (did not destroy each other, black on black crime is extremely high, 90%) and supported each other, financially and in many other ways, to say “WE ARE A PROUD PEOPLE, WE CAN DO THIS” 
More food for thought. I have often wondered, have any of those who feel such an outrage against how the blacks were treated while enslaved (all nationalities throughout history endured the same, blacks are no different) ever thought about what I am about to say? Like I said, we all have choices to go POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in any given situation and to me I would think the black community would be able to “move on”….be THANKFUL for being brought to AMERICA for their future generations after slavery. Look what they were SAVED FROM. (For one America gave them CHRISTIANITY/SALVATION!) 
Who possesses more slaves today than any other group…AFRICA! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Africa so why is it OK, that blacks can enslave blacks, but no other group can? Why is it that blacks can call themselves degrading names, yet no one else can? Why can they kill whites and not be called racist, but if a black is killed by a white automatically they are racist? Why the double standards?…Do they really want to go back to…. 
GENOCIDE, SLAVERY, RAPE an epidemic of AIDS etc. And black women, do you really want to be dominated by a man and treated as property and have your cliterious cut off as a child (without any anesthetic) and live the life of an average African woman….. very hard work, no pleasure, no value, life of servant hood (slavery) always in fear? 
Seriously, what are these”Victim Mentality Type” people fighting for? Do they want to go back to Africa? Of course not, they claim they want to be treated EQUALLY…Well, that sounds fair to me, THEN ACT LIKE IT! 
STOP fitting the “stereotype”, be the one who says, I don’t care what others think of me, if being an “Uncle Tom” or a “Sell Out” is what it takes to be “Equal” then so be it. I will not play victim, I will “Take The Bull By The Horn” be accountable for my behavior and do what it takes legally, ethically, morally and responsibly to “FIT IN!” and if more and more people did that then stereotypes would change. 
I could write more on the subject, but feel this is a good place to stop.",0
1016,Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor,"Home » Headlines » World News » Thank You FBI: The Clinton Email Investigation Has Shifted The Poll Numbers Significantly In Trump’s Favor 
“Worse than Watergate” 
Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump… 

From Michael Snyder : 
Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. 
Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high, a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times, early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points. 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points. 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points. 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points. 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point. 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points. 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead. 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND… 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNNreported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos, the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week.",0
1017,U.S. Rescue Attempt in Afghanistan Missed Western Hostages by Hours - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Navy SEALs led an unsuccessful raid last month to free an American university professor and his Australian colleague who are being held by the Taliban, engaging in a fierce gun battle with dozens of insurgents at a remote compound in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan, American officials said Thursday. The officials said the rescue mission began in the days after the professors, Kevin King, the American, and Timothy Weeks, the Australian, were taken at gunpoint on Aug. 7 from their vehicle in Kabul near the campus of the American University of Afghanistan, where they teach. The officials said the group of SEAL members, backed by Army Rangers, are believed to have missed the men by hours. The Pentagon confirmed in a statement that a raid had occurred to rescue two civilians but said that “the hostages were not at the location we suspected. ” No Americans were killed, but “a number” of insurgents were, it said. On Thursday, Taliban fighters were on the verge of overrunning Tirin Kot, the capital of Oruzgan Province in the south, Afghan officials and local elders said. Dost Mohammad Nayab, a spokesman for the governor of Oruzgan, said that all security posts around the city had been overrun by the Taliban and that the insurgents had started firing on the Police Headquarters and the governor’s compound. “The security forces are engaged with the Taliban inside the city, and fighting is ongoing,” Mr. Nayab said. By late afternoon, however, Mr. Nayab said the situation had improved after NATO airstrikes began targeting Taliban positions. In addition, Gen. Abdul Raziq, the powerful police chief of neighboring Kandahar Province, had arrived with other reinforcements, and the central government had tasked him with leading the cleanup operation, a spokesman for General Raziq said. The SEAL raid, which was first reported by Fox News, was authorized by President Obama, the Pentagon said. “In order to protect the safety of hostages and operational security,” its statement did not specify whom exactly the SEAL members were seeking to rescue or provide any more details about the raid. But days after the professors were abducted in August, the university put out a statement naming the two men and saying they were teaching English to prepare Afghan students to study abroad. The Obama administration has not shied away from launching risky rescue raids, but the record has been mixed. The best known is perhaps the raid by SEALs in 2009 to free a cargo ship captain, Richard Phillips, from Somali pirates, an episode that was made into a movie starring Tom Hanks. In 2012, SEALs freed an American aid worker and her Danish colleague from Somali pirates. But a military raid in July 2014 to free several American and Western hostages held by the Islamic State in Syria failed because the captives had already been moved. That same year, militants from Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen killed an American man and a South African after Special Operations forces tried to free them. The raid in August targeted a Taliban faction known as the Haqqani network. The Haqqanis are among the Taliban’s most capable and violent factions. They have held a number of   Western captives over the years, including Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed in 2014 in a prisoner swap with the United States. The Haqqanis sit atop the Taliban’s lucrative business of kidnapping Westerners and prominent Afghans, most of whom are held for ransom. The kidnappings are usually carried out by   insurgent factions or criminal gangs, who then sell the victims to the Haqqanis. Captives are usually then moved into the Haqqanis’ strongholds in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Once in Pakistan, the hostages are essentially beyond the reach of American and European forces, which can operate across Afghanistan but cannot legally launch raids inside Pakistan. Knowing this, insurgents try to move hostages across the border as quickly as possible, and American and European forces typically scramble in the immediate aftermath of an abduction to rescue the victims before they can be spirited out of Afghanistan. That appears to have been the case in the raid to free the professors, though officials did not say whether they believed that the men were still in Afghanistan or had been moved to Pakistan. Among the Westerners who are still believed to be held by the Haqqanis in Pakistan are a couple who have had two children since they were abducted in 2012. The insurgents released a video of the couple last week, threatening to kill the entire family if the Afghan government executed a senior Haqqani figure it was holding and had recently sentenced to death. The husband, Joshua Boyle, 33, a Canadian, and the wife, Caitlan Coleman, 30, an American, were kidnapped in an area dominated by insurgents in Wardak Province, south of Kabul. Ms. Coleman was pregnant with her first child at the time, officials said. In the video, Mr. Boyle said he had heard reports that the Afghan government was executing Taliban prisoners. “Our captors are terrified of the thought of their own mortality approaching and are saying that they will take reprisals on our family,” he said, according to a transcript of the video released by the SITE Intelligence Group. Ms. Coleman added, “They are willing to kill us, willing to kill women, to kill children, to kill whomever” to end the executions of Taliban prisoners by the Afghan government. She asked the United States to “do anything to change the policies of the Afghan government to stop their policy of executing men. ” A    American from Massachusetts who disappeared in 2014 is believed to be held by the Haqqanis and remains unaccounted for. Last year, the Obama administration overhauled efforts to free Americans held overseas, creating the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, led by the F. B. I. It took that step after facing intense criticism for failing to do enough to save the Americans who were taken hostage in Syria and later killed by the Islamic State.",0
1018,Russian families with children in Europe have no way back to Russia,"Russian families with children in Europe have no way back to Russia 03.11.2016 Finnish human rights activists said that Russian citizen Svetlana Rots had had her two daughters taken away from her. The Russian girls were accommodated in a Finnish private orphanage, but were later distributed between Finnish families. The children were taken away from their mother not to let the woman take the girls out of Finland to Russia. A press release from human rights activists says that Svetlana Rots, a citizen of the Russian Federation, was born in Leningrad (currently St. Petersburg). During the recent years, the woman has been residing in Finland with her family. In November of 2015, the Finnish authorities took the children away from their parents. The Russian mother has been completely isolated from her younger, five-year-old daughter Carolina. The girl holds only Russian citizenship. The girl was taken away from her mother after the police received information saying that the woman could take the girl to Russia. Svetlana's elder daughter Sophia, aged 13, is also a citizen of the Russian Federation only. The girl was seized as well, but the Finnish authorities allowed the girl to communicate with her mother on the phone twice a week for 15 minutes. Print version Font Size It just so happens that Russian citizens can take their children to Finland , but they can not take their children back to Russia as simply an intention to visit the motherland is viewed as an act of kidnapping in accordance with European laws. According to coordinator of Russian Mothers movement, Irina Bergseth , this is not the first incident when Russian citizens in Europe have their children taken away from them just because Russian parents intend to leave the EU and take their children to Russia. ""Today, Russians with kids can enter Europe and can even have a child in Europe, but if a Russian family intends to return to Russia, Europe says that the Russian parents want to ""kidnap"" a child from the EU, so European officials act first to kidnap a child from Russian parents,"" said Bergseth. According to her, European child protection services used to kidnap Russian children mostly from mixed families (Russian-Finnish or Russian-Norwegian ), but presently, the practice has been expanded to the families where both parents are citizens of the Russian Federation. Russian human rights activists assess such incidents as a manifestations of hard core Russophobia . Currently, there is a large-scale campaign in Europe to ""persecute"" Russian families with children. ""It is necessary to set clear rules and procedures to return children, Russian citizens, to their motherland. While these rules and regulations are being developed, the Russian authorities should properly inform Russian families in Europe what they should do, if they had their children seized and taken away from them,"" says Bergseth. Earlier, Russian citizen Victoria Medvedeva found herself in a similar situation in Finland. The woman came to Finland with an intention to work there on a temporary basis. She had three of her children withdrawn from her. The Finnish authorities accommodated the children in a local orphanage. The woman's children - two daughters and a son - hold only Russian citizenship. The children were returned to Victoria Medvedeva after a while, owing to their father's interference. The family intends to leave Finland and return to St. Petersburg. Pravda.Ru Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru",0
1019,Rick Rule – A Look At 2017 And What Sprott Asset Management Is Doing With Our Clients’ Money Right Now,"71 Views November 17, 2016 GOLD , KWN , KWN II King World News 
After the decline in gold and silver, today one of the wealthiest and most street-smart pros in the business spoke with King World News about what they are doing at Sprott Asset Management with their money right now. 
Eric King: “Rick, you had predicted that we would be weak in the metals and mining shares into the end of the year — your thoughts on what’s happening?” 
Rick Rule: “It’s interesting because the markets reversed in the sense that the industrial materials markets, which were weak, have become a bit stronger, while the gold and silver markets, which were strong for the the first 7 months of the year, have become weaker… Continue reading the Rick Rule interview below… Advertisement To hear what billionaire Eric Sprott & Rick Rule are doing with their own money and which $7 billion company John Embry & Dr. Marc Faber oversee click on the logo: 
Rick Rule continues: “ I think a lot of that is due to the emotions and the narrative surrounding the Trump victory. People are trading the narrative that America will be great again, so the U.S. dollar is very strong and gold has weakened as a consequence. There is a sense that between the Chinese Silk Road and the planned infrastructure spending by Trump that this will drive demand for industrial commodities and at the same time this will strengthen the world economy. I think those premises are wrong. 
A Look At 2017 I think 2017 will see one of those unique situations where the dollar moves up as a consequence of the relative strength of the U.S. economy, but I also believe that gold will move higher as well as a consequence of negative real interest rates on a global basis and increasing realization among investors that the debt and deficits of various governments are not sustainable. 
With regards to the industrial metals, I don’t think the demand creation will be there, but I think prices will move higher as a result of supply destruction. This will be a messier phenomenon but one that will generate larger price increases. 
Assuming that people took profits as I advocated in the summer on King World News, I think we will be looking at the same type of reload opportunity that we saw in late 1975 and late 2001 and early 2002. No bull market goes straight up. There are retrenchments that are normal and healthy and right now we are seeing exactly that. 
Here Is What Sprott Asset Management Is Doing The gold and silver mining shares have been hammered and that has created enormous opportunity for investors. We are carefully deploying capital at Sprott Asset Management into private placements with high-quality companies that we believe will experience significant upside moves as the market correction comes to an end. 
Looking at the start of 2017, the elites clearly do not like Trump, and this should create a lot of noise as he moves to push his agenda through Congress. That noise should be extremely positive for the gold market. So while it is possible that gold might remain weak at the start of the year, at some point we will see some real fireworks to the upside in 2017.”

1020,5 Things You Need to Know About 'Sanctuary Cities' | Daily Wire,"5 Things You Need to Know About 'Sanctuary Cities' By: Aaron Bandler November 16, 2016 
With Donald Trump elected to the presidency, one of the policies that will likely come under fire is sanctuary cities, cities with policies that make them safe havens for illegal aliens. The issue became front-and-center during the early portion of the Republican primary when Trump decried the murder of Kate Steinle by an illegal alien in San Francisco, a sanctuary city. 
In response to the election of Trump, leftist city leaders are digging in, officials in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston signaling that they will not cooperate with the federal government's deportation efforts. Here are five things you need to know about sanctuary cities. 
1. Sanctuary cities are a blatant violation of federal law. Some on the left have tried to claim that they're perfectly legal, but this is clearly false. As James Walsh , former associate general counsel of Immigration and Naturalization Services, explains, 8 USC section 1324 ""deals with those persons who knowingly conceal, harbor, or shield undocumented aliens and could apply to officials in sanctuary cities and states."" 
The fact that leftists are digging their heels in on sanctuary cities means they're supporting a form of nullification, an irony not missed by Victor Davis Hanson : 
Much of the rural West opposes the Endangered Species Act. Can Wyoming declare that federally protected rats and bugs are not protected inside its state borders, when such pests obstruct construction of dams or highways? Many conservatives oppose federal restrictions on gun sales. Could Oklahoma City declare hand-gun purchases within its city-limits free of federal firearms statutes? Perhaps Little Rock could ignore a Supreme Court ruling and announce that gay marriage is not legal within its jurisdiction. On what rationale would liberals in California object to such nullifications -- that neither state nor city had the right to ignore a federal law or to obstruct the law enforcement duties of federal officials? 
Trump and the GOP can fight against sanctuary cities by cutting off federal funding and sending in federal agents to mandate the cities to follow the law. 
2. Sanctuary cities undermine law enforcement. Not only do they refuse to cooperate with federal agents in deporting illegals, sanctuary cities make it more difficult for police officers to do their job. Some police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) expressed their frustration with the city's sanctuary city policy to Heather Mac Donald in 2004: 
“We can’t even talk about it,” says a frustrated LAPD captain. “People are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics.” Another LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic, gang-infested district sighs: “I would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about [enforcing the immigration law against illegals].” 
In that 2004 piece, Mac Donald documents how members of the LAPD were able to recognize known gang members, but couldn't do anything to apprehend them until they had committed a crime – despite the fact that they were illegals who repeatedly snuck back into the country. This is the case with other sanctuary cities as well. 
3. Sanctuary cities are ""akin to roulette."" ""The odds suggest that most illegal aliens detained by officials are not career felons and thus supposedly need not be turned over to ICE for deportation,"" writes Hanson. ""On the chance that some of their 10,000 released criminals will go on to commit further crimes in the manner of Juan Lopez-Sanchez, officials then shrug that the public outcry will be episodic and quickly die down, or will at least not pose political problems as great as would come from deporting aliens."" 
But the odds don't suggest this. Hanson notes that according to Mac Donald, ""Two-thirds of all outstanding felony warrants in the city of Los Angeles involved illegal aliens -- as well as 95% of outstanding murder warrants."" 
Additionally, Jessica Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies found that in a nine-month timeframe in 2014, sanctuary cities shielded 9,265 illegals from deportation, 62 percent of which ""had significant prior criminal histories"" and 2,320 of them were subsequently rearrested for new crimes, according to Daniel Horowitz at Conservative Review. 
""There is no telling how many have committed crimes and were never caught,"" writes Horowitz. ""This is just a nine-month snapshot of the devastation from sanctuary policies. As of last year, 69% of them were still at large. So much for not being a flight risk."" 
According to Vaughn , from January 2014 to September 30, 2015, sanctuary cities rebuked over 17,000 detainers, 68 percent of which involved ""individuals with a prior criminal history."" 
Based on these statistics, it would seem that the odds are against the cities' residents who could be harmed by criminal aliens, which makes it no surprise that... 
4. Crime has surged in sanctuary cities. The Daily Wire 's Hank Berrien reported on the following from Louisiana attorney general Jeff Landry: 
According to Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, crime has risen in ""sanctuary cities"" across the nation. 
Landry told the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, that sanctuary city policies ""allow illegals to commit crimes, then roam free in our communities."" Landry’s appearance was prompted by the changed status of New Orleans, where city police are now banned from asking an individual's immigration status. 
Using recent statistics from Los Angeles, another sanctuary city, Landry asserted, “Los Angeles saw all crime rise in 2015: violent crime up 19.9 percent, homicides up 10.2 percent, shooting victims up 12.6 percent, rapes up 8.6 percent, robberies up 12.3 percent, and aggravated assault up 27.5 percent … (sanctuary cities) encourage further illegal immigration and promote an underground economy that sabotages the tax base.""

1021,Farm owner arrested for protesting Dakota Access Pipeline's theft of her land,"Farm owner arrested for protesting Dakota Access Pipeline's theft of her land 
  Vicki Batts Tags: eminent domain , Dakota Access Pipeline , civil liberties (NaturalNews) There have been countless stories across the web that have documented those struggling to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native Americans, farmers, ranchers, landowners and environmental activists have joined together to oppose the pipeline and bring the project to a grinding halt.Just recently, 127 Native American activists were arrested at a construction site near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. Despite the corporate media's attempts to suppress information surrounding the controversial pipeline, concerns about the Dakota Access project have become increasingly visible.However, one issue has remained in the dark: the government's abuse of eminent domain.Eminent domain is what gives the government the right to seize private, law-abiding citizens' properties for public use. Normally this means a road, a school or another public structure that will be used by the citizens of a town or which in some way serves them. However, the government can also seize private land if they can prove that it will provide some sort of ""public good."" This loophole – and yes, it is a loophole – has allowed our government to steal land from taxpayers for years, and then give it to a private citizen or company. Such is the case with the Dakota Access Pipeline.This pipeline is not a public project; it is being conducted by a private company that will profit off their endeavors. And yet, in spite of all the land that will be destroyed and the people whose lives will be disrupted by this project, the government has still seen fit to steal land and give it to the pipeline's creators under the guise of ""public good.""In Iowa, a major conflict between farmers and the government has broken out. You see, the state government is trying to take their land, and consequently, their livelihoods, to make way for the pipeline .The state's decision to hand over land owned by farmers to the Dakota Access LLC has been met with quite a lot of opposition – as it should have. Just last week, Calhoun County farmer Cyndy Coppola was arrested on her own property for protesting the government's usurpation of her own land .Apparently, they expected farmers to idly sit back and watch them steal what they worked so hard for.Cyndy Coppola's arrest has been ignored by the mainstream media, probably because it doesn't align with their narrative that Big Government knows best. An injurious move at best, her arrest highlights everything wrong with the way our government is being run.The theft of privately owned land simply cannot be ignored any longer – it is unconstitutional for the government to give a tax-paying citizen's land to a multi-billion dollar energy company so that they can make even more money. And it won't just be the oil and gas companies that profit off this disgusting display of government; dozens of big banks and investment firms will also be taking home a piece of the pie. Food and Water Watch reported in September than 17 financial institutions loaned Dakota Access LLC a whopping $2.5 billion to launch their project. They noted that banks have also given a substantial number of resources to the Energy Transfer Family of companies, such as billion-dollar credit lines and revolving credits. In total, a staggering 38 banks have given this corporation over $10 billion in loans and credits.How many of those banks do you think have ties to our government? Goldman Sachs is on the list, as are several other infamous industry names.If you think the pipeline is being constructed to better our country, you're wrong. It's being constructed to make money for a group of elitist corporations – and they plan on taking down anyone and anything that stands in their way. Sources:",0
1022,Trump Poised to Lift Ban on C.I.A. ‘Black Site’ Prisons - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the C. I. A. to reopen overseas “black site” prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Barack Obama shut them down. President Trump’s   draft order, titled “Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants” and obtained by The New York Times, would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that Mr. Obama put in place in response to policies of the George W. Bush administration. If Mr. Trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke Mr. Obama’s directive to give the International Committee of the Red Cross access to all detainees in American custody. That would be another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the Geneva Conventions, although statutory obstacles would remain. Mr. Obama tried to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and refused to send new detainees there, but the draft order directs the Pentagon to continue using the site “for the detention and trial of newly captured” detainees  —   including not just more people suspected of being members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban, like the 41 remaining detainees, but also Islamic State detainees. It does not address legal problems that might raise. The draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of C. I. A. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now banned by statute. But it sets up   policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a “hell of a lot worse”  —   not only because “torture works,” but because even “if it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway. ” Elisa Massimino, the director of Human Rights First, denounced the draft order as “flirting with a return to the ‘enhanced interrogation program’ and the environment that gave rise to it. ” She noted that numerous retired military leaders have rejected torture as “illegal, immoral and damaging to national security,” and she said that many of Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees had seemed to share that view in their confirmation testimony. “It would be surprising and extremely troubling if the national security cabinet officials were to acquiesce in an order like that after the assurances that they gave in their confirmation hearings,” she said. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to an email inquiring about the draft order, including when Mr. Trump may intend to sign it. But the order was accompanied by a   statement that criticized the Obama administration for having “refrained from exercising certain authorities” about detainees it said were critical to defending the country from “radical Islamism. ” Specifically, the draft order would revoke two executive orders about detainees that Mr. Obama issued in January 2009, shortly after his inauguration. One was Mr. Obama’s directive to close the Guantánamo prison and the other was his directive to end C. I. A. prisons, grant Red Cross access to all detainees and limit interrogators to the Army Field Manual techniques. In their place, Mr. Trump’s draft order would resurrect a 2007 executive order issued by President Bush. It responded to a 2006 Supreme Court ruling about the Geneva Conventions that had put C. I. A. interrogators at risk of prosecution for war crimes, leading to a temporary halt of the agency’s “enhanced” interrogations program. Mr. Bush’s 2007 order enabled the agency to resume a form of the program by specifically listing what sorts of prisoner abuses counted as war crimes. That made it safe for interrogators to use other tactics, like extended sleep deprivation, that were not on the list. Mr. Obama revoked that order as part of his 2009 overhaul of detention legal policy. One of the Obama orders Mr. Trump’s draft order would revoke also limited interrogators to using techniques listed in the Army Field Manual. But in 2015, Congress enacted a statute locking down that rule as a matter of law, as well as a requirement to let the Red Cross visit detainees. Those limits would remain in place for the time being. Still, the draft order says   Trump administration officials should conduct several reviews and make recommendations to Mr. Trump. One was whether to change the field manual, to the extent permitted by law. Another was “whether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of   alien terrorists to be operated outside the United States” by the C. I. A. including any “legislative proposals” necessary to permit the resumption of such a program. It was not clear whether the C. I. A. would be enthusiastic about resuming a role in detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects after its scorching experience over the past decade. In written answers to questions by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump’s C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, said he would review whether a rewrite of the field manual was needed and left the door open to seeking a change in the law “if experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country. ” Mr. Trump’s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment “as prescribed by U. S. law,” but it makes no mention of international law commitments binding the United States to adhere to humane standards even if Congress were to relax domestic legal limits on interrogations, such as the Convention Against Torture or the Geneva Conventions. Another core national security legal principle for Mr. Obama was to use civilian courts, not military commissions, whenever possible in terrorism cases  —   and to exclusively use civilian law enforcement agencies and procedures, not the military, to handle cases arising on domestic soil. The draft order also signals that the Trump administration may shift that approach as well. In 2012, after Congress enacted a statute mandating that the military initially take custody of all foreign Qaeda suspects, Mr. Obama issued a directive that   waived that rule for most domestic circumstances, such as if the F. B. I. had arrested the suspect and was already in the process of an interrogation. But Mr. Trump’s draft order calls for the attorney general, in consultation with other   officials, to review that directive and recommend modifications to it within 120 days. Many Republicans  —   including Senator Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump’s attorney general nominee  —   criticized the Obama administration’s approach as weak, even though the civilian court system has regularly convicted terrorists at trial while the military commissions system has proved to be dysfunctional. During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he would prefer to prosecute terrorism suspects at Guantánamo  —   including American citizens, although the law currently limits the commissions system to foreign defendants. Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump’s draft order would direct Defense Secretary James N. Mattis, along with the attorney general and the director of national intelligence, to “review the military commissions system and recommend to the president how best to employ the system going forward to provide for the swift and just trial and punishment of unlawful enemy combatants detained in the armed conflict with violent Islamist extremists. ” Tom Malinowski, who was assistant secretary of state for human rights in the Obama administration, said the draft order showed that everyone who thought the office of the presidency or the advice of cabinet secretaries like Mr. Mattis would temper Mr. Trump “is being shown wrong again. ” “He’ll listen to his worst instincts over his best advisers unless restrained by law,” Mr. Malinowski said.",0
1023,Tesla’s Musk Investigated Over SolarCity by Congress,"Tesla’s Musk Investigated Over SolarCity by Congress   16, 2016 
It’s Time to Stop Spending Taxpayer Dollars on Elon Musk and Cronyism … The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee have launched a probe into tax incentives paid to solar companies, according to The Wall Street Journal. The committee probes, led by their respective Republican chairmen, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, have found an appropriate and disturbing target to begin this work. SolarCity, a solar installation company set to be purchased by Tesla Motors Inc., is one of the seven companies named in the initial investigation. –Daily Signal/Heritage Foundation 
Elon Musk is being investigated, but not for the money he’s borrowed to build Tesla – instead it’s over the strange deal he engineered for a company called SolarCity. We’ve written about Musk here, here and here. 
We didn’t understand the deal but thanks to this article, we think we do. Apparently – or so we are informed – Musk engineered it to avoid the foundering of the company. It was headed downhill, so Musk simply decided to buy it to hide its failure. 
Were Musk operating with his own money, he’d have the right to do whatever he wants. But he is using the money of Tesla shareholders for his apparent manipulations. 
What is certain is that Musk is irredeemably PR hungry and always announcing new business gambits or elaborations that tend to obscure the larger facts of his single important business – Tesla, which itself seems to continues as a nearly bottomless cash pit despite its recent announcement of a “profit.” 
So why does Tesla continue to get so much money from various government sources? Basically, in our view, Musk is being employed by the government as a leading proponent of cars that will totally control the driving experience for state authorities. By leading the way, Musk provides a justification for much larger corporate automotive entities to pursue him. 
Nonetheless, no matter how it is dressed up, the idea seems to be to remove driving from individual control. Our guess is that the government will ultimately be in charge of where you go, when and how. Don’t like it? Government will shut off the power to your car and you won’t be able to charge it. Tesla fans would do well to consider the larger ramifications of the technology they are supporting. 
Of course, it won’t only be government. We can see many other wrinkles involved with this technology. Hell, rub an official the wrong way and when you get into your car, it drives you straight to court – or prison. Basically, thanks in large part to Tesla’s hugely funded technology, people will inevitably lose the right and ability to drive where they choose. This is a simple but profound loss. 
More: 
Musk’s SolarCity has become an albatross of waste, fraud, and abuse of tax payer dollars. As legitimate earnings and cash become even scarcer for SolarCity, its entanglement in the Tesla empire suggests that a drastic reckoning not only is imminent, but in fact emboldening Musk to become more outlandish and reckless. 
Notably, SolarCity is run by Musk’s cousins, Lyndon and Peter Rive. During his chairmanship at SolarCity, Musk’s family enterprise has taken in billions of taxpayer dollars in subsidies from both the federal and local governments. 
But the subsidies and sweetheart deals were not enough, as losses and missed projections continued to mount. Ultimately, rather than endure the embarrassment of collapse and further damage to the public image of Musk and Tesla, the cousins conspired to have Tesla simply purchase SolarCity this year. 
The article goes on to point out that “Tesla stockholders [are] being forced to absorb a failing, cash-burning company and pay top dollar to do so.” 
SolarCity has never made a profit despite huge subsidies, and the article goes on to provide a wider context for Musk’s taxpayer support: reportedly some $5 billion in taxpayer support over the past 10 years – or “almost half of Musk’s supposed net worth.” 
The money has been distributed among all three Musk enterprises, SolarCity, Tesla, and SpaceX. “The ride is fueled by a cult of personality in Musk.” 
We don’t know where this investigation will end up – and of course it could exonerate Musk. But, nonetheless, Musk seems a prime example of a power elite meme, someone positioned as a business “genius” in order to reinforce authoritarian goals, especially those having to do with increasing control of travel. 
Conclusion: Musk defenders will point to the quality of his cars as evidence that Musk is legitimate businessman who deserves a good deal of media and financial latitude. But for us Musk is not entirely what he seems.",0
1024,5 Ridiculously Stupid Things Men Keep Doing For Women,"Home This Month Popular 5 Ridiculously Stupid Things Men Keep Doing For Women 5 Ridiculously Stupid Things Men Keep Doing For Women David G. Brown 
David is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel. He despises political correctness, which replaces real, needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal. Though still a young man, he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness, combined with a determination to help make things better. He tweets when there's something worth tweeting here . October 28, 2016 Girls 
Forget the movies that set aloof men against love-seeking women. It is men who are the hopeless romantics much, if not most of the time. And they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them. Though feminism, demographic trends, and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas, men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modern-day princesses. 
Of course, there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors. A time and a place, for example, can be found for defending a woman, most notably your mother or wife, from someone else’s verbal or physical attack. Likewise, sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a high-quality woman who gives long-term value to your life. That said, in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary, time-consuming, resource-draining, and plain self-destructive for a man. 
So, here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women: 1. Fighting for them 
I lost count long ago of the number of times I have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight (usually deserved) against her. A girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant, club or elsewhere, picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron. Along comes Captain-Save-a-Ho, who might not even know the girl, to protect her honor. The expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough, let alone when a man does it of his own volition, without being requested. 
In return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people, the white knight invariably gets a smile, a few words, and perhaps a phone number. From this point onwards, though, the interaction between Mr. White Knight and the Entitled Damsel Who Causes Her Own Distress invariably fizzles out. And it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way. Men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap, too, confusing it with the opportunity to be “alpha” and dominate over another male. The most common outcome, sadly, is that a woman’s very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion. 2. Fighting over them Not only is this bickering usually ill-advised, it is often exactly what she wants. 
This stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap. Whilst competition in life, including between men over women, should be largely encouraged, swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last Sunday’s leftovers on a Saturday, three days after the refrigerator stopped working. 
Remember: a woman can be attractive but, because of her attitude and behavior, have very little long-term value for you. Countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the good-looking girl, it must be worth it. That’s simply not the case in modern times. To boot, a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically low-yield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed. 
At best, the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times, if at all. And if they do manage to secure the girl for a long-term relationship, the pairing usually implodes down the track. The man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms, such as by being draped (divorce raped). 
In the meantime, the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again. Unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul, entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more. Everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves, rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity. 3. Paying for them What are you getting from the transaction with her? And yes, everything is transactional in male-female relationships. 
Unless you are completely sure you have claimed the world’s best girl for yourself (and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances), you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is. This may seem counterintuitive, especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status, achievements, and resources. But we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable. A man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of high-quality and gives him something back in return. On both these counts, most men are paying for dud deals. 
In every long-term relationship I have had, I have put less into the relationship financially, proportionally-speaking. Almost always, even the girl’s gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it. For dates and during casual relationships, too, I pay for a woman’s time about as much as she pays for mine, if not less. 
When relationships end, girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed. What matters, however, is how you conduct yourself overall. Only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her. When patriarchy returns, the male-female dynamic will alter. Before that time, be sure she does her fair share financially. 4. Shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them Meanwhile, he should be do everything else for himself. 
Unlike many other self-destructive behaviors concerning women, this one can be very incremental and hard to spot. It is very easy to procrastinate on your work, final exams, self-development goals, and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a high-quality woman comes along. In fact, nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a drug-like dependency at the beginning of a courtship. In addition to these problems early on, men are apt to continue the shelving of their other, more personal demands after the relationship is well established. 
On a topic I will explore in more detail in another article, there should be certain hours in many days (or simply days in general) in which women do not even enter your mind. Contrast this with your average man, who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl. And often she’s not his girl for much longer, as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind. By devoting yourself to a ho, you become dispensable to a ho, not just psychologically, but physically, financially, and socially as well. Don’t let yourself rot 
Your body, finances, education, and other forms of self-improvement need to be your number one focus. After all, they are the only things you have (or don’t have) 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Individual girls may come and go, but your obligations to yourself remain. Paradoxically, keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place. A man who takes proper care of his money, career, body, and social life gets women. 5. Moving to them, for them Sucker. 
This is the one even my leftwing father warned me about. But it’s something a lot of guys are yet to learn. Like shifting or sacrificing one’s priorities, moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray. Every time I moved to where a girl of mine lived, I did so mostly for myself. Whether to explore a new country for three months, or find a new, refreshing place to get my work done, the relocation benefited me. This is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl. 
Perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her, he’s often left in the lurch. Don’t make this mistake. Either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that don’t revolve around her. If the relationship fails (and most of them do), you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in. Don’t follow the crowd of thirsty males Too many men slave away in a female desert. Girls are not non-existent, but they’re too often low-quality relative to what a man is willing to do for them. 
Snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off, too. You may not indulge in them regularly, but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there. More broadly, we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act. Become part of the solution. 
So what’s just as bad as an entitled woman? A man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation.",0
1025,Press TV: Duff on UN Condemnations of “Moderate Terrorists”,"By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on October 31, 2016 
The UN’s special envoy for Syria has condemned militants’ deadly rocket attacks on residential areas of western Aleppo. 
Staffan de Mistura said, in a statement, the U-N has credible reports civilians have been killed in the attacks. De Misutra blamed the militants for the attacks, calling them relentless and indiscriminate. His reaction came after at least seven civilians, including three children died in Aleppo as a result of the shelling. 
Syrian media say several were also wounded amid relentless shelling by terrorists on civilian targets in Western Aleppo. Foreign-backed terrorists have stepped up attacks across Aleppo, bringing the total number of civilians killed in the past two days to over 40. The Syrian observatory for Human Rights confirmed 14 children are among the dead and another 250 civilians have been wounded in the terrorist shelling. Fighting has stepped up in Aleppo, with around 15 hundred terrorists massing around the western edges of the flashpoint city. Government forces and allied fighters have successfully managed to foil any advance by the terrorists.

1026,The Nemesis and Scourges of the Western World,"Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => 
Without resorting too much to the wisdom of the ancient Greek myths, we have come to believe that states, regimes, movements and people finally will emerge to act as the inescapable agents of the justice leading to the downfall of the Western empire 
‘Nemesis, Winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice’ 
Introduction 
Seven is a winning throw of the dice. But in our civil society, seven now signifies the multi-thong scourge, the whip used by the Western world as its instrument of punishment and, in response; seven signifies Nemesis and her sisters, the inescapable agents of the West’s downfall. 
The seven scourges of the Western world are used against the people of Asia, Africa, Latin and North America. These whips are constructed, wielded and unleashed especially by the US and the UK. 
The seven sisters of Nemesis, the Erinyes, are the Furies who pursue the injustices committed by the Western world against Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Those holding the scourge detest and fear Nemesis and the Furies, but are incapable of destroying them. Try as they might, their whip is in corrupt and feeble hands and, of course, it can only follow their orders: Otherwise, it just twitches and remains immobile, while Nemesis pursues the scourgers of humanity. 
The Seven-Tailed Scourge of the Western World 
The ‘whip’ wielded by the Western world, is used to punish disobedient, ‘rebellious’ people, movements and states. Their multiple lashes have bloodied countless generations and buried millions. 
The seven scourges against humanity are unrepentant in their promotion of ‘Western values’ – visible to the terrified world on the red raw backs of oppressed people, their wounds flayed open by the faceless drones proclaiming their gifts of … freedom and democracy. 
Let us go forward now and describe the pillars holding up the Western empire, the seven-tailed scourge of humanity. 
1. Mexico: The Cartel, the Narco-State, US Bankers and Death Squads 
Over the last two decades, over a quarter million Mexicans have been murdered by the joint forces of the drug cartels, the Mexican State and its death squads, presided over by the US state and backed by its rapacious financial sector. Cartels and complicit Mexican officials prosper because US banks launder their narco-dollars by the billions. On their part, US corporations grow even richer by relocating their plants to Mexico where terrorized workers can be exploited for 1/5 the cost. Amidst the terror and exploitation, over 11 million Mexican workers and family members have fled to the US running from their local scourges, only to confront the US scourge of deportation. Over 2 million have been imprisoned and expelled under Obama. 
2. Honduras and Guatemala: Imperial Wars, Drug Gangs and Narco-Oligarchs 
Destitution and state terror are direct products of US-installed regimes in Honduras and Guatemala. Guatemala’s indigenous majority was ravaged by US and Israeli-trained military battalions and death squads. In their wake, scores of narco-gangs, sponsored by local oligarchs and their own private death squads, have emerged. The Honduran people attempted to elect an enlightened liberal President, and were ‘rewarded’ for their peaceful democratic election with a military coup orchestrated by the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. They further underscore the lesson of ‘Western values’: Scores of human rights activists and peasant leaders have been murdered and the scourges continue unabated. 
3. Colombia: Nobel Prize for Death Squad President 
For the past fifteen years, (2001-2016), the Clinton-Bush-Obama regimes launched the seven-billion-dollar ‘Plan Colombia’ terror campaign against the Colombian people. This scourge was so powerful that over two and a half million peasants, Indians and Afro-Colombians have been driven from their homes and villages while, tens of thousands of peasants, trade unionists, human rights activists and civic leaders have been killed. The notorious narco-President Alvaro Uribe and his Vice President Santos worked with the death squads and the Colombian military under the instruction of over one thousand US military advisers and contract mercenaries as they imposed a scorched earth policy – to consolidate a ‘reign of Western values’. 
In Colombia, the three-tailed scourge of narco-presidents, death squads and the military decimated rural communities throughout that large and populous nation. They finally induced the FARC guerrillas to submit to a ‘peace’ agreement, which perpetuated the oligarchy. The US remains free to exploit Colombia for its military bases against the rest of Latin America, while foreign corporations exploit its mineral riches. For his part in promoting the ‘peace of the dead’, Colombian President Santos received the Nobel ‘Peace’ Prize. 
4. Saudi Arabia: A Household Name Among the Middle East Scourges 
No country in the Middle East has financed, organized and directed terrorism in the Middle East, South Asia, North and East Africa, the former Soviet Union and even North America, than the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It currently scourges the tiny nation of Yemen. Using its ISIS mercenaries, backed by jets, missiles, and logistical support from the UK and the USA, the Saudi despots has invaded maimed and murdered tens of thousands of Yemenis, while hundreds of thousands face starvation in a Saudi-imposed blockade. 
The Saudi billionaire regime bankrolled thousands of terrorists in Syria andIraq, giving billions of dollars of business to US and UK arms manufacturers. Saudi monarchs and their extended clans form a parasitic rentier regime unique in the world: They rely on the skills and labor of imported professionals, workers, household servants, mercenary solders, financial managers and even their praetorian guards. They confine their women behind the veil and closed doors, under the absolute rule of male relatives. They chop off the hands, feet and heads of foreign workers and their own citizens for minor offenses, including ‘blasphemy’, criticism of the king or resisting an employer’s abuse. Saudi Arabia, which is totally dependent on Washington’s protection, has become a scourge especially against Muslim people throughout the Middle East and beyond. ORDER IT NOW 
5. Israel: The Scourge of Palestine and Free People Near and Far 
The Israeli State is the head commanding the tentacles of a far-reaching Zionist Power Configuration operating in the US, Canada, England, France and, to a less degree, in satellite states and institutions. Israel was established on the dispossession and ethnic cleansing of millions of Palestinians from their homes and villages since 1948. For almost 50 years, 600,000 ‘Israeli’ Jews (immigrants given automatic ‘citizenship’ and stolen property based solely on their ‘ethno-religious identity) have illegally moved into what remained of historical Palestine, building exclusive ‘Jews-only’ colonial towns on land ripped from its original inhabitants. The Palestinians are herded into apartheid militarized enclaves and squalid camps. Israel invaded and devastated large parts of Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. They have bombed other nations, like Jordan and Iraq, with impunity. The Israeli state uses a virtual fifth column of loyalist organizations and billionaire financiers in the US and EU who ultimately dictate Middle East policy to the ‘elected’ Western politicians. Presidents and Prime Ministers, Cabinet members and legislators must publicly bow to the increasing demands of the overseas Zionist power structure. This has undermined the will and interests of national electorates and democratic procedures. . All public discourse on this vital issue has been censored because critics of Israel’s influence are subjected to unremitting campaigns of overt coercion, threats, jailing on trumped up charges, vilification and job loss – within their own countries in the ‘democratic’ West. Meanwhile, Israel has sold its much-vaunted expertise in surveillance, torture and counter-insurgency to its fellow scourgers in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico and even Afghanistan. 
6. Egypt: Modern Scourges of an Ancient People 
For decades, Egyptian military dictators have served the Anglo-American Empire and Israel’s ruling colonists in the Middle East, North and East Africa. Generals-turned-’Presidents’ Hosni Mubarak and Abdel Fattah al-Sisi specialized in murdering, torturing and jailing thousands of Egyptian trade unionists, dissident activists, peasant leaders and the restless urban poor. These violently installed Egyptian rulers are expected to collaborate with Israel and trap millions of desperate Palestinians in the world’s largest open air prison – Gaza. Cairo actively collaborates with the US and Israel in subverting the people and institutions of Gaza, Libya, Somalia and Sudan – guaranteeing that none will be functioning, independent modern states. Egypt’s first and only elected president Mohamed Morsi was overthrown by General Sisi and sentenced to twenty years in a military torture dungeon (a virtual death sentence for a 65 year old) by a kangaroo court under the direction of Washington and Tel Aviv. Egypt, once the epicenter for civil democratic expression – ‘the Arab Spring’ – has become the a major staging area for US-backed jihadi terrorists entering Syria. 
7. ISIS, NUSRA Front, Ukraine and Syria: Puppets, Kleptocrats, Fascists and Terrorists 
In this very modern Western world, where democratic values are sold to the cheapest buyer, the US, the UK and the EU shop for mercenaries and puppet regimes in order to scourge their critics and adversaries. 
The West, led by the Grand Scourger Hillary Clinton, bombed Libya and destroyed its entire modern state apparatus. They opened the floodgates to thousands of mercenaries and terrorist-thugs of all colors and stripes to feed off the carcass of what Gadhafi and the modern Libyan state had built over the past 40 years. These criminals, draped in the banners of ‘humanitarian intervention’ or ‘mission civilisatice’, ran amok, killing and ravaging tens of thousands of Libyan citizens and contract workers of sub-Saharan African origin. The tens of thousands of Africans desperately fleeing each year into the Mediterranean are the result of this Western rampage against the Libyan state. The jihadis have moved on… by those who forgot to distinguish between terrorists who support our ‘democratic values’ and those who would attack the West. The West can’t be blamed: Mercenaries change sides so often. 
The ethnic cleansing scourges of the past returned to the Ukraine: as (neo) fascists took power in Kiev, storming the Parliament and forcing the President to flee. Nazi-era banners decorated the streets of Kiev under the approving gaze of the US State Department. Neo-Nazi thugs massacred scores of unarmed ethnic Russian citizens in the port city of Odessa when they set fire to the main trade union hall where the trapped men, women and youths were burned alive or bludgeoned while fleeing the flames. The US State Department had spent a $5 billion dollars to replace an elected government with a pliant regime in Kiev while large parts of the country fell into civil war. The ethnic Russian populations of the industrialized Donbas region resisted and were invaded by an ethnically cleansed and neo-fascist putschist Ukrainian army – under US-EU supervision. The war has cost tens of thousands of lives, a million refugees fled to Russia and a divided failing state now festers in the heart of Europe. Kleptocrats and Fascists in Kiev oversee an utterly bankrupt economy. The destitute citizens abandon the towns and cities; some fleeing to Poland to pick potatoes as their serf ancestors did a century ago… ORDER IT NOW 
Syria has been ravaged by an immense army of mercenary scourges, financed and supplied by the US, EU, Turkey and, of course, Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda had merely to change its battle flags to ‘NUSRA’ and receive the US benediction as ‘moderate pro-Western democrats’ resisting a Baathist Dictatorship in Damascus. In the course of their ‘democratic’ mission they destroyed the ancient, critical cultural and economic center of Aleppo – scourging the Christians and non-jihadi Muslims and other ancient minorities. Over two million Syrians have died or fled the fiery scourge of Anglo-American and Saudi-Turkish terror. 
The Seven Sisters: Nemesis and the Furies Confront the Western World 
The scourges are falling on hard times: East and West, North and South they face their inescapable Nemesis. Their exposed injustices, crimes and grotesque failures herald their inevitable downfall. The seven furies are even emerging in unusual places: 
1. The economic and trade power of China challenges the West throughout world, expanding even into the heartland of the empire. The West’s fear over China’s peaceful economic expansion has led Western political leaders to revive protectionist policies, claiming that barriers against Chinese investors must be raised to prevent takeovers by Beijing. From July 2015 to September 2016, the West blocked nearly $40 billion in productive Chinese investment. This comes after decades of preaching the virtues of foreign investment and the universal benefits of ‘globalization’. Suddenly Western leaders claim that Chinese investment is a ‘threat to national security’ and ‘profits Chinese businesses over Western-owned enterprises’… 
Meanwhile, far from this Sino-phobic hysteria, the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America actively seek greater economic ties with China, to the detriment of US-EU multinationals. Once servile Asian countries, like the Philippines, have declared unfettered US access to frontline imperial military bases in doubt, as they sign favorable multi-billion trade and investment agreements with China. Western imperial ideology about investment and globalization has boomeranged and met its Nemesis. 
2. The Russian Furies: Vladimir Putin 
During the 1990’s, the US plundered Russia at will. Washington imposed a unipolar world, celebrated as the ‘New World Order’. They bombed and devastated former Russian allies like Yugoslavia and Iraq, setting up ethnically cleansed rump states like Kosovo for their huge military bases. Meanwhile, Washington reduced Russia, under the inebriate Yeltsin regime, to a backwater vassal stripped of its resources, its institutions, scientists, and research centers. In the absence of war, the Russian economy declined by 50% and life expectancy fell below that of Bangladesh. The US celebrated this ‘victory of democracy’ over a helpless, deteriorating state by welcoming the most obscene new gangster oligarchs and pillagers and laundering their bloodstained loot. 
The door slammed shut on the pillage with the election of Vladimir Putin and the demise of the Yeltsin gangster-government. Russia was transformed: Putin reversed Russia’s demise: The economy recovered, living standards rose abruptly; employment in all sectors increased, and cultural, educational and scientific centers were restored. Vladimir Putin was elected and re-elected by overwhelming majorities of the Russian electorate despite huge sums of Western money going to his opponents. Russia systematically recovered many strategic sectors of the economy illegally seized by Western-backed Israeli-Russian oligarchs. Even more important, Putin restored Russian statecraft and diplomacy – formulating a strategy for an independent, democratic foreign policy and restoring Russia’s defense capability. The loss of this critical vassal state under its dipsomaniacal Boris Yeltsin shook the US EU-NATO alliance to its very core. 
In the beginning President Putin did not oppose the US-NATO military invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. It went along with the economic sanctions imposed on Iran. It even maintained its cooperation despite a US-sponsored attack by the government of Georgia against South Ossetia killing scores of Russian peacekeepers. In the wake of those destabilizing disasters, what finally led the Russian government to reverse its complicity with the West was the horrific US-financed invasion of Syria where Russian jihadis from the Caucasus were playing an important role as mercenaries, threatening to return and undermine the stability of Russia. This was quickly followed by the US-sponsored putsch in Ukraine, fomenting a civil war on Russia’s frontiers, threatening is vital naval base in Crimea and repressing millions of ethnic Russian – Ukrainian citizens in the industrialized Donbas region. These blatant aggression finally pushed Putin to challenge the expansionist policies of Washington and the EU. 
Putin backed a plebiscite in Crimea and won when its citizens voted overwhelmingly to re-join and preserve the Russian bases. Putin has backed the rebel defense of the Donbas against a NATO-neo-fascist Kiev invasion. 
Putin accepted a request for aid from the Syrian government as it battled mercenaries and jihadis to preserve its national integrity. The Russians sent arms, troops and air support for the Syrian Arab Army, rolling back the Western and Saudi armed terrorists. 
In response to the Washington-EU economic sanctions against Russia over the Crimean plebiscite, Putin signed multi-billion-dollar trade and investment agreements and joint defense pacts with China – mitigating the impact of the sanctions. ORDER IT NOW 
Wherever Washington seeks to seize and control territory and regimes in Eurasia, it now faces the Putin nemesis. In Russia and overseas, in the Middle East and the Caucuses, in the Persian Gulf and Asia, the US meets stalemates at best, and roll-back at worst. 
The CIA-stooge Yeltsin and his cronies were evicted from the Kremlin to the indignation of Washington and the EU. Many of the kleptocrats, politicos, thugs and swindlers fled to their new homes in Langley, on Wall Street, in Washington or set up talk-shops at Harvard. Even the gruesome Chechens had their ‘color-coded’ support center (the CIA-American Committee for Peace in Chechnya) based in Boston. Never in modern history has a country so rapidly transformed from degraded vassalage to a dynamic global power as Russia. Never has the US seen its grand imperial design so successfully challenged in so many places at the same time. 
The Putin Nemesis has become the inescapable agent of the downfall of the US Empire. 
3. The Islamic Republic of Iran became a Muslim-nationalist alternative to the US-Israeli dominated Muslim dictatorships and monarchies in the Middle East. The Iranian Revolutions inspired citizens throughout Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq and Yemen. As a result of its growing influence, Iran was punished by the US and EU with crippling economic sanctions pushed especially by Tel Aviv and its Western agents. Fearful that the Iran’s example would destabilize its control, the US invaded Lebanon, promoted the Israeli invasion and occupation of Lebanon and has backed the terrorist campaign to dismember Syria. The results have been dismal for Washington: Iran continues to support the powerful Hezbollah, a major political and military power in Lebanon. The Saudi’s war against Yemen is largely an ethno-religious campaign to destroy Yeminis who favor independence over Saudi-US control and have Iran’s support. Iraq’s Shia resistance forces are leading the attack against the Saudi-funded ISIS terrorists, with Iranian commanders playing a significant role. 
Hezbollah, Iran’s ally in Lebanon, drove out the Israeli occupation forces and raised the cost of another invasion by Tel Aviv. 
Against all the impotent, corrupt Arab puppets in the Middle East, only Iran has supported the Palestinians. It is the only force capable of retaliating against an Israeli sneak attack – which is why it is demonized. 
Iran is the Nemesis against US plans to conquer and dismember Syria. It has provided arms and volunteers on the battlefield against terrorist mercenaries. 
Iran effectively negotiated a partial lifting of Western sanctions, overcoming Israeli intransigence and securing billion-dollar trade agreements with Germany, Russia and China. It holds the prospects for productive trade and diplomatic deals in the near future – to the howling consternation of its enemies in Washington, Riyadh, London and Tel Aviv. 
For all the efforts by the tentacles of Israel’s fifth column, Iran has survived and emerged as the Nemesis of Anglo-American and Israeli ambitions in the Middle East. 
4. Venezuela became the leading proponent for an independent foreign policy in Latin America. For almost twenty years, US tried repeatedly to overthrow the government in Caracas. They failed: By ballot or by bullet, despite slapping economic sanctions on Venezuela, the US suffered humiliating defeats and failed coups and aborted uprisings. Venezuela remains Washington’s principal Nemesis, thwarting its efforts to make ‘free trade’ pacts and deepen military alliances in Latin America. 
5. Upon taking office in June 2016, the Philippines new president Rodrigo Duterte assumed the lead role of Washington’s most colorful ‘Nemesis’ in Southeast Asia. Under his widely popular presidency, he pivoted to China, promising to sharply reduce joint Philippine-US military exercises in the South China Sea directed against Beijing and, in return, he secured the co-operation of several hundred leading Philippine entrepreneurs in winning an initial $13 billion dollar public-private Chinese investment package for critical infrastructure and trade development.. 
President Duterte has frequently denounced Washington’s interference in his domestic war on drug traffickers – citing the US hypocrisy in its criticism of his human rights record. He has personally held President Obama responsible for meddling in Philippine affairs. Drawing on the history of the bloody US colonial war against the Philippine people in 1898, he holds the US responsible for inciting ethno-religious conflicts in the southern island of Mindanao – Duterte’s home region. 
President Duterte’s declaration of independence from Washington (”I am no one’s ‘tuta’ (puppy dog)”)and his foreign policy priority of ‘pivoting’ from US military domination to regional economic co-operation with Beijing has turned the Philippines into Washington’s prime Nemesis in Southeast Asia. 
6. The resistance of the Yemeni people, mainly ethnic Houthi freedom fighters, against the onslaught of bombing and missile strikes by the Saudi-US-UK air force, has aroused widespread solidarity throughout the Middle East. 
Despite the ongoing massacre of over 10,000 Yeminis, mostly civilians, the Saudi ‘alliance’ has failed to impose a puppet regime. US links with the Saudi dictatorship have undermined its claims of humanitarian concerns for the people of Yemen. The embattled Houthi rebels have secured the support of Iran, Iraq and the majority of people in the Persian Gulf countries. As the war continues, the Saudi’s increasingly rely on military trainers, fighter bombers and logistical experts from the US, UK and NATO to pick the targets and maintain the starvation blockade. Sooner or later the courageous and tenacious resistance of the free people of Yemen against the Saudi overlords will inspire a domestic Saudi uprising against its grotesque and decrepit theocratic-monarchist state. The fall of the Royal House of Saud will bury a major scourge in the Middle East. In a word, the battle for Yemen has become the Nemesis of US-Saudi domination. ORDER IT NOW 
7. Everywhere in the Western world the ruling classes and their media outlets fear and loath ‘populists’ – leaders, movements, electorates – who reject their austerity programs designed to deepen inequalities and further enrich the elite. Throughout the European Union and in North and South America, workers and middle class majorities are on the march to oust the ‘free market’ regimes and restore the ‘populist’ welfare state, with its emphasis on social services, living wages and humane working conditions. 
From the UK to France, Poland to Portugal, China to North America, Mexico to Argentina, the Nemesis and Furies of populist rollbacks threaten to dislodge the scourge held by the bankers, conglomerates and billionaires. Scattered populists may hold diverse ideologies; some may be nationalists, leftists, workers, farmers, petit bourgeois and public employees, indebted students, ecologists or protectionists. All are both united and divided by disparate interests and beliefs. And all are preparing for the inevitable downfall of the empire of the free market and wars. 
Conclusion 
Today the world’s greatest global conflicts have lined up the Imperial West and its frontline scourging allies against the Furies and Nemesis emerging on all continents. These are the inescapable agents of the Empire’s downfall. 
The scourges of the West have been free to plunder the wealth of subject peoples and launch wars, which ravage both ancient and modern states and cultures while slaughtering and dispossessing scores of millions. The West derives its lifeblood through its seven-tailed scourge. Western elites rule through a chain of scourging puppet states with their bloody accomplices, from narco-murderers, Islamists terrorists, death squads to ordinary ‘piecework’ torturers. 
Without resorting too much to the wisdom of the ancient Greek myths, we have come to believe that states, regimes, movements and people finally will emerge to act as the inescapable agents of the justice leading to the downfall of the Western empire. Modern Nemesis and Furies have a dual existence: While bringing down the old order they seek to create alternatives. 
The ’scourgers’ are by their nature specialists in wanton crimes against humanity. Nemesis and her sisters challenge and oust the latter as they construct their own new centers of wealth and power. China, Russia and Iran have gone beyond the role of Nemesis to the West – they are poised to build a new civilization on its ruins. 
It remains an open question whether they can avoid becoming the new scourge against the people and nations who have risen in revolt.",0
1027,Trump Budget: ‘A New Foundation for American Greatness’ - Breitbart,"WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   The Trump Administration released it’s fiscal year 2018 budget entitled “A New Foundation for American Greatness” on Tuesday morning which prioritizes money for defense, border security, law enforcement, veterans and school choice. [Documents previewed on Monday included a summary of the plan.  One document entitled “A New Foundation for a Balanced Budget” stated that this budget “will reverse the damaging trends from previous administrations and restore the American Dream. ” It asserts that under this budget, by 2027 “publicly held debt will be reduced to less than 60 percent of GDP, the lowest level since 2010, when the economic policies of the last Administration took effect. ” Mulvaney reinforced this in a Monday budget preview briefing. He said that the budget will balance in 10 years under this plan, “the concept we put in place is a general, what we call the   plan, which is that every single year we see those reduced by two cents on the dollar, every single year. ” The document emphasizes that there are no cuts to core Social Security benefits and no cuts to Medicare. Another document entitled “A New Foundation for American Jobs” laid out a vision for regulatory, welfare, and tax reform. The summary states that fiscal year 2018 budget projections include the Congressional Review Act resolutions that roll back certain Obama Administration regulations. This, the summary states, will generate “annual cost savings of approximately $600 million to $1. 2 billion per year. ” The budget reforms the federal SNAP program for an estimated combined savings of $193 billion over 10 years. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reforms are estimated to save $21 billion over ten years. The OMB document states that total welfare reforms in the budget proposal will save $274 billion over 10 years. The tax reform element of the budget assumes several reforms laid out in the Trump Administration’s recently released tax reform outline. This includes paring down tax brackets from 7 categories to three, cutting the business tax rate to 15 percent and making many small businesses eligible for the 15 percent rate. A third document “A New Foundation for a Secure Nation” laid out an increase in defense spending and spending on border security immigration enforcement. Defense spending would be increased by $54 billion or 10 percent more than the 2017 CR President Barack Obama signed into law and the 2018 budget cap. Border security and immigration enforcement is allocated $2. 6 billion for “new infrastructure and technology investments in 2018 to give CBP frontline law enforcement officers the tools and technologies they need to deter, deny, identify, track and resolve illegal activity along the border. ” The President’s budget assumes passage of the   American Health Care Act AHCA as well as tax reform, though a tax reform plan is still being formulated. The full plan was posted to the Office of Management and Budget website at 11 a. m. eastern at the same time Director Mick Mulvaney began a briefing on the details. This is a developing story.

1028,EXCLUSIVE - Islamic State Supporters Vow Terror Group Will Retake Mosul as ‘Liberators’,"Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the   anniversary of the terrorist organization’s capture of Mosul, Iraq’s   city. [Despite losing most of Mosul to the U. S.  international coalition, the IS supporters vowed that they would return and take control over the entire city once more.  IS completed its takeover of Mosul from Iraqi forces on June 10, 2014. Over the last eight months, the group has been fighting a difficult battle against Iraqi forces supported by an international coalition led by the United States and has lost control of most of the city except for a few pockets of resistance. Nonetheless, the IS members in the chat room marked the   anniversary, with Abi Aisha Almosulawi writing, “Thank Allah who blessed us with the blessing of Islam. Thank Allah who granted us the Islamic State that rules through Allah’s sharia. The campaign of conquests began here in Mosul and now we’re dealing with a brutal crusader Shi’ite war, but we have not surrendered and will not surrender. We will continue to harm the infidels and continue to disturb their peace even if we lose Mosul three years after liberating it. This isn’t over. We will continue to trust in Allah and the victory he is expected to grant us one day. ” Abi Huzaifa Almosolawi wrote, “Today marks three years since the capture of Mosul and its liberation from the hands of the blasphemous Shi’ites. This glorious conquest that Allah gave his warriors and gave them the opportunity to implement sharia was the beginning of the fulfillment of Allah’s promise to the loyal mujahedeen.    “We may lose the land but we will never lose the desire to enforce holy sharia on every meter in our control. We will return to Mosul again as liberators and we will liberate Baghdad, Syria, Egypt, Palestine and all the land to impose holy sharia. Even Rome will be liberated and when we enter it we will yell Allah is great, with the help of Allah. ” Abi Talha Almagrebi (the Moroccan) wrote, “From the pulpit of the mosque in Mosul, the Caliph Abu Bakr (Al Baghdadi) came out and declared the Caliphate. From here, the land of Mosul. From Mosul, we went forth to liberate Fallujah, Al Anbar and other places. Today we come back to the desert but we do so while clinging to the divine promise. We cling to holy sharia and we won’t compromise with the infidels. The right and justice lies with us. We will come back here as liberators. When we return as liberators, with the help of Allah, we will remember our mujahedeen brothers Abi Ali Alanbari (a senior military commander in IS who was killed) and the Sheikh Abo Mohamad Aladnani (an IS spokesperson who was killed). ” The U.  offensive in Mosul began about eight months ago, with the terrorist group losing most of the city to Iraqi forces except for an area at the western section of the Tigris river. On Saturday, U. S.  Iraqi forces repelled an IS offensive in the Sunni town of Shirqat, just south of Mosul.",0

1030,Interesting & Fun Facts About Stethoscope,"Keywords: medical equipment , Stethoscope facts , stethoscopes history 
When we hear the word “Doctor,” the first image comes in our mind is a person in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck. The stethoscope has become a very common name amongst people thanks to its display in various T.V shows, movies and frequent use of it by doctors. But still, there are many fun facts which other people might not know about stethoscope. So here they are – 
200 years old history – Yes! Stethoscopes are one of the oldest inventions which are still being used across the world by millions of doctors. Rene Laennec in 1819 had invented the stethoscope. It was a wooden instrument and looked quite different from what we see it as now. 
I see your chest – Stethoscope is a Greek word which roughly translates into “I see the chest,” stethos means chest and scope mean examination. 
An Interesting story behind its Invention – When Stethoscope was not invented, doctors would put their ears around the chest of patients and gently tap the chest with fingers. This technique would make female patients little uncomfortable. Rene Laennec was a very shy person. Once he was examining an overweight woman. He found it difficult to hear her hear sounds. To hear heartbeats of that lady, he rolled a quire paper into a tube and placed it on her chest. This inspired him to make the device which we all are familiar with and called stethoscope. 
Google Doodle For Rene Laennec – On February 17th, 2016, Rene Laennec would have celebrated his 235th birthday. To commemorate this day, Google doodle marked his 235th birthday. 
Used To Identify If A Person Is Dead Or Not 
Nowadays stethoscope is used to hear heart sounds and to determine symbols of other diseases. But initially, stethoscope was designed to find out if the person in the hospital is dead or alive. 
It Might Be Replaced Very Soon 
As mentioned, stethoscopes were invented almost 200 years ago and being in use for such a long time shows that how useful and efficient stethoscopes are. However, as the technology is getting advanced every passing day, stethoscopes might be replaced very soon by pocket-sized ultrasonic devices which can perform multiple measurements on patients.

1032,"As China Seeks Bigger Role on World Stage, Xi Jinping Will Go to Davos World Economic Forum - The New York Times","President Xi Jinping of China plans to stride into the snowy   conclave of the world’s financial elite next week, attending the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, the first time a top Chinese leader will put himself into the mix of political leaders and business executives who view themselves as the masters of the global economy. His participation was announced by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday. It is the latest, and in some ways the boldest, Chinese attempt to compete with the United States’ dominant position in world economic and strategic institutions, a   campaign that has been carried out everywhere from the conference rooms of Asian central banks to the waters of the South China Sea to the halls of the United Nations in New York. But it is unclear whether Mr. Xi, who rarely ventures beyond platitudes in discussing the strategies of the world’s second largest economy, can take advantage of this time of transition when the rest of the world is gauging whether the United States is pulling back from global leadership. Mr. Xi may sense an opening during a historic inflection point. He plans to deliver a speech at Davos at a moment when the incoming United States president, Donald J. Trump, has suggested that the United States should withdraw from the traditional superpower role it has played since World War II, including its leadership of a global free trade agenda. In recent years, Davos had come to embody that   agenda  —   a gathering at an Alpine ski resort of some of the world’s most powerful figures in the realms of politics, media and technology. Discussions each year have been set by Western leaders, not Asian ones. But events of the past year brought into sharp focus a rise in populist denunciations of globalization, free trade and inequality in some Western nations, including the United States, with Davos frequently mentioned by critics as a symbol of the root causes of their countries’ ailments. China has benefited greatly from access to international trade markets since its entry in 2001 into the World Trade Organization, and it could now become the most vocal proponent of that system. Mr. Trump campaigned on opposition to the existing global trade system and has denounced China for competing unfairly against the United States. At Davos, Mr. Xi plans to lead a delegation of senior officials, China’s wealthiest entrepreneurs and top executives of   enterprises, including the China Poly Group Corporation, which has ties to the Chinese military. People’s Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper, published an article Wednesday that said China could become the “torchbearer of the open trade system” and boasted that Mr. Xi’s visit “will boost the world’s confidence in global governance. ” His appearance is a logical step in his country’s evolution into a   superpower, a rapid transformation that has been marked by bold symbolic gestures and events in the past decade, including the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing under President Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi’s predecessor. Mr. Xi has carried on that theme with much more aggressive actions, including overseeing construction of military infrastructure in the South China Sea’s contested waters and establishing a regional lending bank opposed by the United States. Premiers of China, including the current one, Li Keqiang, have attended Davos before, but the nation’s president  —   and head of the Communist Party  —   has never been to the gathering. “Clearly it signals that Xi Jinping is now interested in writing both China and himself in a grander way on the global diplomatic horizon,” said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U. S.  Relations at the Asia Society. “He feels it’s time to really come out. Behind that probably is an assumption and wishful thinking that the U. S. is in disarray, Europe is feckless, and so on. ” “He’ll be received almost as the number one citizen at Davos,” Mr. Schell added. Mr. Xi plans to attend Davos on Jan. 17, during a state visit to Switzerland from Jan. 15 to 18, said Lu Kang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to speak at the opening session of the forum, which runs from Jan. 17 to 20. Strong   sentiments erupted last year in the movement in Britain that culminated in the popular vote by British citizens to leave the European Union. But it was Mr. Trump’s election in November that was the apotheosis of the move in the West toward isolationism, and meetings and conversations at Davos  —   whose theme this year is “responsive and responsible leadership”  —   will take place in the shadow of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and rhetoric. “It’s going to be very tempting for China to imagine for itself that it’s gained much more status after this election in a whole array of global endeavors, including trade and on climate change and possibly other issues,” Mr. Schell said. “If the U. S. is going to absent itself more  —   and we don’t know if that’s the case yet  —   nature does abhor a vacuum. When a father grows old, the son is sometimes able to fill the space. ” Victor Shih, a scholar of China’s political economy at the University of California, San Diego, said there are actually some global agenda matters on which China’s influence “might have peaked in the medium term. ” He pointed to China’s push in recent years to have the renminbi counted as an international currency. That has been undermined in the past year by efforts of the Chinese central bank, the People’s Bank of China, to withdraw large quantities of offshore renminbi from circulation. The bank has been doing that in order to try to prop up the value of the renminbi and limit capital flight from China, including the transfer of money to Hong Kong by wealthy Chinese. “The People’s Bank of China continues to claim that renminbi internationalization is important, and of course, at Davos, President Xi may continue to pay verbal homage to that agenda because it would be an important sign of China’s ascendance on the world stage,” Mr. Shih said. “Yet, in the past year, we have seen renminbi deposits outside of mainland China decline by hundreds of billions of renminbi. ” Among the Chinese tycoons expected to attend Davos are Wang Jianlin, founder of the Wanda Group, a property and cinema company, and Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group, China’s biggest   company. They are commonly referred to as the two wealthiest men in China. Both are investing in the United States, and Mr. Ma met with Mr. Trump on Monday at Trump Tower in New York to discuss business opportunities between companies in the two countries. (Within Mr. Trump’s family, his    Jared Kushner, has been involved in personal business negotiations with top Chinese executives.) Some members of the Congress, mostly Republicans, have called for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States, including those by Wanda, which recently bought the AMC movie theater chain and Legendary Entertainment, a film production and financing company.",0
1033,Veterans prepare to join Standing Rock protesters to stop Dakota Access Pipeline,"November 22, 2016 
Indigenous water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site just got assistance from military veterans. 
Between December 4 and December 7, veterans of various branches of the United States armed forces have scheduled a “deployment” to show solidarity and lend support to the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. The event, called “ Veterans Stand for Standing Rock ,” already has 108 confirmed RSVPs on Facebook, and features several high-profile progressive activists who have served in the military, including U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Baltimore police officer-turned police brutality whistleblower Michael A. Wood, Jr . 
“Bring Body armor, gas masks, earplugs AND shooting mufflers (we may be facing a sound cannon) but no drugs, alcohol or weapons,” the event page, organized by Wes Clark Jr., states. 
The Facebook event is already being used to organize logistics for the veterans to come to Standing Rock, complete with rideshare registration and financial assistance for veterans scattered around the country who want to support the protest. 
“My husband is a veteran Army Combat Medic,” wrote Morgan McClure on the event page. “He has been talking about doing this for so long.” 
Clark has also launched a GoFundMe page for the deployment, which he says will be used to provide material and logistical support to all the veterans wanting to join the Standing Rock protest from around the country. As of this writing, approximately $30,000 has been raised toward the $100,000 goal in just 10 days. 
“Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors,” Clark wrote on the GoFundMe page. “Let’s stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. If not us, who? If not now, when?” 
Clark cited the need for veterans to support the indigenous protesters at the pipeline construction site due to the excessive and heavy-handed militarized police response to the protests. 
Here are some of what the protesters at Standing Rock have faced: Mace, sound cannons. sniper guns pointed at unarmed civilians, journalists being shot with rubber bullets, journalists being arrested for covering the protests, attack dogs unleashed on groups including children, elder Natives getting tased and violently arrest[ sic ], protesters marked with numbers and kept in dog kennels after arrest… 
The Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport roughly half a million barrels of crude oil daily underneath the Missouri River, has had construction held up for months as protests continue to grow. Indigenous communities gathering at the construction site say the pipeline has the potential to permanently poison water supplies for millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking, bathing, and farming. Part of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction route have been held up by the Obama administration, though that order has been ignored by pipeline builders. 
“Most civilians who’ve never served in a uniform are gutless worms who’ve never been in a fight in their life,” Clark told Task & Purpose . “So if we don’t stop it, who will?”

1035,Iran’s carpet exports to US at $50mn,"Iran’s carpet exports to US at $50mn Thu Oct 27, 2016 5:55AM Economy Iran says it exported about $50 million of hand-woven carpets to the United States since the removal of sanctions in January. 
Iran says its exports of hand-woven carpets to the United States have reached around $50 million since the removal of sanctions in January. 
Hamid Kargar, head of the Iran National Carpet Center, told Reuters that Iran was under pressure in the US market by rivals such as like India, Pakistan and Turkey during the years that the sanctions were in place. 
Kargar emphasized that the world’s largest buyer imported more than $80 million worth from Iran in 2010, before the trade embargo on the country was tightened. 
He emphasized that a growth in exports of hand-woven carpets will have a positive impact on the lives of the carpet weavers in the country. 
There are almost 1 million carpet weavers in Iran, 700,000 of whom are working full-time, Kargar said. 
Between March and September this year, Iran exported $134 million worth of handmade carpets, or 2,330 tons, to 80 countries, Reuters said. That was a 17.7 percent increase in value and 10 percent rise in weight compared to a year earlier. 
During the sanctions years, Iran partially compensated for its loss of market share in the United States and Europe by finding new buyers in Russia, China, South Africa and some Latin American countries, the report added. It still holds about 30 percent of the global trade in handmade carpets, Kargar further told Reuters. 
Iran shipped its first cargo of hand-woven carpets – globally considered the crown jewel of its handicrafts industry – to the US in February after the sanctions against the country were lifted. 
The cargo was sent to Los Angeles from Hamburg. Loading ...",0
1036,PHOTOS: Latin America Condemns Venezuela’s ’Excessive Use of Force’ Against Protests - Breitbart,"Mexico’s Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday that seven other Latin American nations   a statement condemning “the excessive use of force by Venezuelan authorities against civilians who are protesting government measures that affect democratic stability and cause the loss of human life. ”[Reuters reports that the eight nations denouncing Venezuela’s actions included Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay.  “Costa Rica said late on Thursday it had recalled its   diplomat in Venezuela, charge d’affaires Ana Patricia Villalobos, for consultations,” Reuters adds. Some remarkable images from the Venezuelan protests have emerged, including the video of a Venezuelan National Guard armored vehicle driving into a crowd of protesters. Another striking image shows a protester set on fire after the gas tank of a police motorcycle exploded:  These photos capture the scale of the demonstrations:  Here is an image that captures the painted shields protesters have been creating: Numerous injuries from tear gas used by the police have been reported  …       …     while protesters have equipped themselves with gas masks, and used firebombs against the police.  The latest fatalities include university federation president Juan Lopez, 33, gunned down by an unknown assailant at a meeting in El Tigre, and a    police officer shot during demonstrations in Carabobo. The Associated Press counts at least 37 deaths, 700 injuries, and 1, 000 arrests. Also from the Associated Press comes news that classical music maestro Gustavo Dudamel, one of Venezuela’s biggest celebrities, has spoken out against the socialist government of Nicolas Maduro. Dudamel has previously been criticized as too close to Maduro. “We must stop ignoring the just cry of the people suffocated by an intolerable crisis. Democracy cannot be built to fit the needs of a particular government or otherwise it would cease to be a democracy,” Dudamel wrote in an essay entitled “I Raise My Voice. ” “We owe our youth a hopeful world, a country where we can walk freely in dissent, in respect, in tolerance, in dialogue and in which dreams have room to build the Venezuela we all yearn for. It is time to listen to the people: Enough is Enough,” Dudamel added. The AP reports that his essay was dedicated to    musician Armando Canizales, who was killed during a demonstration on Wednesday. Supporters of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo López held a vigil outside the Ramo Verde jail on Thursday night, following rumors that he had either died or been taken seriously ill. López’s wife Lilian Tintori claimed that a video message sent on Wednesday testifying to his good health was “false,” insisting that “the only proof of life that we will accept is to see Leopoldo. ” On Friday, López’s father and sister also expressed doubts about the veracity of the video evidence provided by the ruling party to prove López is healthy. “We have big doubts about this video and we don’t accept it as proof of him being alive,” his sister Diana López said. The López family’s lawyers wrote to the International Committee of the Red Cross asking it to verify his health and whereabouts through “direct personal contact. ” The lawyers also said they would ask for the Spanish government to launch   prosecutions against Venezuelan officials, beginning with the cases two imprisoned Spanish nationals.",0

1038,Sugar Doesn’t Just Feed Cancer Cells it May Even CREATE Them,"by PAUL FASSA 
First realize that even without being diagnosed with cancer, we all have at least a few cancerous cells floating around in our “inner terrain”. A decent immune system residing in a slightly alkaline or neutral pH inner terrain is able to fend them off and keep them from colonizing into tumorous masses. On the other hand, those who indulge primarily in the SAD (Standard American Diet), which includes lots of factory farmed meat and junk foods saturated with refined sugars or high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which processed foods use even with their non-sweet products to keep you addicted, along with all those refined carbs in refined grain baked products, are adding fuel (literally) to the fire of cancer. 
Mainstream oncology ignores this 1930s Nobel Prize discovery by Otto Warburg, aka the “Warburg Effect”: When normal cells begin to lack oxygen respiration to utilize glucose and nutrients metabolically for cellular energy, they depend on fermenting sugar to thrive without oxygen and become cancerous. 
Yum … ice cream with my chemo! 
Instead oncologists administer chemo IV therapies while giving their patients ice cream and cookies as the poison is injected into them. Big profits from the treatment and selling those toxic drugs at a profit also. “Cancer cells consume sugar about 19x faster than healthy cells.” – Dr. Murray Susser, MD Mainstream medicine refuses to look into diet as a function of potential metabolic dysfunction that helps promote and maintain cancer while asserting genetic disposition as a primary cause of cancer. Their hubris and incredible profits thrive from toxic interventions such as chemotherapy and radiation. The first concern with preventing or eliminating cancer should be what you put into your body. That gives you control over cancer. 

It’s a no-brainer when it comes to avoiding sodas, juices with added sugars, pastries, candies, and processed foods that use processed grains and even add sugar or HFCS to foods that are not even sweet. That’s to keep you addicted even if you can’t taste it. Refined sugar is actually addictive, some claim it’s even as addictive as cocaine. 
A Recent Study That Makes Sugar Carcinogenic 
But now it’s even worse. Green Med Info has uncovered a study that seems to be hidden from the public eye and is certainly not welcome within our orthodox oncology system. It would cramp the food and soda business’s profits if refined sugar is seen as carcinogenic. 
The study, “Increased sugar uptake promotes oncogenesis via EPAC/RAP1 and O-GlcNAc pathways” was published in the 2013-2014 Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI). Because it is a free access journal, you can access the full text, not just the abstract, here . 
I wonder how come this study hasn’t made much of a stir in our sick-care system since it is so accessible. Instead it was dug up by a research scout for Green Med Info. 
It is of course full of biochemical details, which is what medical people are supposed to be familiar with. So for now, let’s be content with a layman’s summary report of their study, which was an in vitro (cultures, petri dishes, and test tubes) study as opposed to an in vivo (animal or human) study. This way they could really play around with and analyze the results with total control. 
Here’s the bottom line of this study: Increased glucose uptake leads to early phases of cancer cell creation while curbing glucose intake reversed cancerous cells into normal cells. In other words, sugar is carcinogenic as well as fodder for already existing cancer cells. 
It’s important to not confuse the enormous amount of refined sugar, table sugar or HFCS, one takes in with sodas and processed foods with naturally occurring sugars and fructose in plant foods, regardless of how high the glycemic index may be. Fruit juices don’t need added sugars, but many fruit juices have sugar added. That’s the type of beverage or food that needs to be avoided. 
But table sugar is refined, and most off the shelf breads and pastries are composed of refined grains that are refined carbohydrates, which become sugar instantly without any compensating nutrition. They are processed out of whole foods to be independent of other compounds that balance natural whole foods to make them beneficial. 
An interesting informative excerpt from the Cancer Tutor: Dr. Tony [Antonio] Jimenez hypothesizes that sugar from Organic Produce may not contribute to cancer cell growth like its adulterated counterpart [refined sugar/HFCS]. He explains that human mammalian cells absorb levorotatory (left spinning) molecules, while cancer cells can only assimilate dextrorotatory (right spinning) molecules. 
Essentially, fruits in their natural state contain left spinning sugars, whereas GMO-influenced fruits consist only of right spinning sugars. Dr. Jimenez concludes that the glycemic index is not nearly as important as the source and lineage of the fruits and vegetables we eat. As an example, Dr. Max Gerson used Carrot Juice as a successful alternative therapy, despite its high glycemic index. An Easy Tip That’s Not So Easy for Many 
So here is the simplicity of it all. Avoid putting adding sugar to your foods and drinks, avoid all sweets and processed foods, even the ones not obviously sweet contain added refined sugars to keep you coming back for more because of its addictive quality. 
This is harder for most than you may think. I met an American woman in Mexico who was advised to return to Texas and have a top cancer hospital determine the status of a mass detected in her gastrointestinal tract. I advised her to lay off sugar because if did turn out to be cancer it would exacerbate her condition. 
She slumped and groaned slightly, indicating the impossibility of such an abstinence for her. I have read enough reports from spouses, friends, and relatives that show many are unwilling to make dietary changes to cure cancer, and whatever therapy they had used did fail probably because of that. 
Many would rather just do what their doctors’ say and eat and drink what they want. And some want the same freedom even while avoiding chemo or radiation. This is especially true among those who use cannabis as a “silver bullet” to treat their cancer. 
Despite all the carcinogenic chemicals that blanket our biosphere, we do have one area that’s in our control – avoiding refined sugars and carbohydrates.

1039,John Kerry Urges Grounding of Military Aircraft in ‘Key Areas’ of Syria - The New York Times,"UNITED NATIONS  —   Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday called for an immediate grounding of all military aircraft in what he described as “key areas” of Syria  —   including where aid is delivered  —   as a   effort to save an agreement with Russia to reduce violence and ultimately halt a war that shows no sign of slowing. Speaking in an unusually pointed and partly unscripted session at a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Syria crisis, Mr. Kerry angrily accused Russia of living “in a parallel universe” and allowing President Bashar   of Syria to extend “the greatest humanitarian catastrophe since World War II. ” On Monday, a convoy of trucks taking aid to the besieged city of Aleppo was destroyed in a deadly airstrike, and American officials said Russia was responsible. The Russians have denied that, and questioned evidence that it was an airstrike at all. The United Nations has not confirmed what struck its trucks. It was a striking change in tone for Mr. Kerry, usually the perpetual optimist, who only 12 days ago had welcomed a   agreement for a reduction in violence, a grounding of the Syrian Air Force, and ultimately the   of the Islamic State and Nusra Front terrorist groups, with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. But beyond Mr. Kerry’s anger was a hard truth: If Russia and Syria reject the idea of a halt in flights, there is little the United States is prepared to do to enforce one. President Obama several years ago rejected the option of creating a   zone to protect refugees, and now, with Russian jets in the air over Syrian airspace, the chances of confrontation are far higher. The doubling down on the agreement, even as it was in tatters, reflected the Obama administration’s assumption that it lacks better alternatives for dealing with the   civil war in Syria that has left roughly a   people dead. But President Obama devoted only a few sentences to the Syria crisis in his address to the United Nations General Assembly this week, and left New York on Wednesday afternoon with no clear path to solve an issue that may well taint the legacy of how he handled the violent aftermath of the 2011 Arab Spring. Mr. Kerry’s demand on Wednesday that all aircraft be grounded was part of an American effort to seek urgent change. The attack on the humanitarian convoy, a war crime, followed an American airstrike on Syrian forces that killed more than 60 people, and which the Pentagon quickly acknowledged was a mistake. Mr. Kerry angrily said Wednesday that it was one thing to err in bombing “people running around with guns on the ground,” and another to strike “trucks in a convoy with big U. N. markings all over them. ” “The eyewitnesses will tell you what happened,” Mr. Kerry said, in a direct confrontation with Russia of a kind rarely seen at the Security Council since the Cold War. “The place turned into hell and fighter jets were in the sky. ” With his new proposal, Mr. Kerry was also making what amounts to an   effort to test Russian intentions in Syria, where the Kremlin has increasingly engaged militarily to defend Mr. Assad. Mr. Lavrov’s spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, who was accompanying him, suggested after Mr. Kerry spoke that the Russians were not enthused by his ideas. “It’s about nothing,” she said. “That was a show. ” In private, senior Obama administration officials acknowledge that the very viability of the agreement with the Russians is in question. Yet none of the players wanted to walk away and concede that the effort had failed. Mr. Kerry said the flight ban should be in “key areas. ” American officials declined to specify them. But they said he was referring to parts of northwest Syria that are in dire need of aid, including cities like Aleppo, where the opposition is prevalent. The flight ban proposal will be discussed Thursday at a meeting in New York of the International Syrian Support Group, a multinational body that is led by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov. A more definitive Russian response to the proposal may come then. One of the crucial American tasks in those cities is to separate Syrian opposition groups that the United States has supported and groups like the Nusra Front, a Qaeda affiliate that now calls itself the Levant Conquest Front. But fulfilling that task has proved far more difficult in Aleppo, for example, than it seemed in the negotiating room in Geneva. While separating the   groups from their tactical alliances with the Nusra Front sounds logical, for the rebels it would often mean abandoning their home territory, leaving Nusra unchallenged and opening their towns to an   bombing campaign. Others groups would have to fight Nusra, something they do not have the capability to do. Rebel leaders say Washington is putting them into a classic bind: The Americans will not give them more support for fear of aiding Nusra, but without more weapons they cannot frontally fight Nusra. The most significant physical movement away from Nusra by   groups, in fact, came when Turkey offered them something in return: real backing to take a border area from the Islamic State that could one day be a safe place for the opposition to try to set up governance that offers a concrete alternative to Mr. Assad. When they did, they were criticized for abandoning the Aleppo front at a time of crisis. The angry exchanges with Russia at the United Nations this week were prompted by the American conclusion that Russian aircraft appeared to have been responsible for the assault on the aid convoy. That is based on extensive satellite photography of the area, and signals intelligence. Russia has denied responsibility but has offered varying explanations of what might have happened, including the possibility that American aircraft bombed the convoy. The United States has said none of its aircraft were involved. The agreement between Russia and the United States, which went into effect Sept. 12, reduced the overall level of violence for a number of days, despite violations in the divided city of Aleppo and other parts of northern Syria held by insurgents opposed to Mr. Assad. But the bombing of the United Nations convoy happened after the Syrian government said it considered the   to be over  —   and to have been unsuccessful. Mr. Kerry was undeterred. “We must move forward to try to immediately ground all aircraft flying in those key areas in order to   the situation and give a chance for humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded,” Mr. Kerry told diplomats at the Security Council. “And if that happens, there’s a chance of giving credibility back to this process. ” The military logic of Mr. Kerry’s proposal is clear. It would eliminate the risk that another aid convoy could be struck from the air because no aircraft could fly over the areas where the assistance was to be delivered. The suggestion was carefully crafted diplomatically as well. Formally it applies to all aircraft that might fly over “key areas,” including those flown by the United States and its partners, but the intent is to prevent airstrikes by Syrian and Russian planes. By urging that the step be taken immediately, Mr. Kerry was trying to avoid the need for   negotiations. “How can people go sit at a table with a regime that bombs hospitals and drops chlorine gas again and again and again and again and again and again, and acts with impunity?” Mr. Kerry said. Mr. Kerry called Mr. Assad “a spoiler” who did not believe in the  . He also urged opposition groups to cut their ties  —   which he called an “unholy alliance”  —   with the Nusra Front, which Mr. Kerry said had no interest in a peace deal. “It’s a moment of truth,” he said. “It raises a profound doubt about whether Russia and the Assad regime can or will live up to obligations they agreed to in Geneva,” he added. The Security Council session began with remarks by Secretary General Ban   who also exhorted diplomats to revive the  . Mr. Ban, who has denounced the convoy attack as an atrocity committed by cowards, also said he was “looking at options” to investigate what had happened. Russia often responds to accusations of wrongdoing with a barrage of explanations that seem intended to sow confusion. A stream of varying accounts about the convoy attack fit that pattern. The latest Russian statement suggested that an American drone flying out of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, where American and NATO forces are based, was aloft in the area and very likely involved. Russian planes neither carried out any strikes where the convoy was hit nor had it any plans for attacks in that area, said a statement from the spokesman for the Defense Ministry.",0
1040,Outside Money Favors Hillary Clinton at a 2-to-1 Rate Over Donald Trump - The New York Times,"Six years after a Supreme Court decision opened vast new channels for money to flow into national elections, Democrats have built the largest and   apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign, defying expectations that conservative and corporate wealth would dominate the race. A dozen different organizations raised over $200 million through the beginning of October and since May have spent more than $110 million on television, digital, and radio ads in support of Hillary Clinton, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission through Thursday. The handful of organizations backing Donald J. Trump have raised less than half that amount, a steep dive from four years ago, when wealthy Republicans poured hundreds of millions of dollars into groups backing the Republican nominee Mitt Romney. The Democrats’ success this year reflects, in part, Mrs. Clinton’s close personal ties to her party’s elite donors and her allies’ willingness to exploit the 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case far more aggressively than President Obama did. But the Democrats are also deeply indebted to one man: Mr. Trump, whose provocations and tirades  —   along with a loud crusade against his own party’s donors  —   have virtually shut off what once promised to be a    spigot of outside money. “Everyone thought that we would be outspent, that there would be significant operations built at the presidential level for the other candidate,” said Guy Cecil, a former Clinton aide who heads Priorities USA Action, the main hub of big Democratic giving. “That obviously hasn’t happened. ” The biggest groups set up or expanded by conservatives since Citizens United  —   including American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, and the network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch  —   are absent from the presidential campaign, focusing instead on protecting Republicans in Congress. “Unlike President Obama four years ago, Clinton embraced the outside money game and shrewdly empowered a single group to carry her message,” said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads and its sister organizations, “in contrast to the boardwalk arcade of groups supporting Trump. ” Citizens United paved the way for independent groups that could raise unlimited amounts of money from unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to spend on elections, as long as they did not coordinate with individual candidates or parties. Republican donors moved quickly to seize on the ruling, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the last three national elections, while Democrats struggled to persuade their donors to invest in “super PACs” at the same scale. Mr. Trump’s rivals for the Republican nomination were backed by an array of super PACs and outside groups set up by their allies and former aides, seeming to set the stage for even greater spending in 2016. But Mr. Trump unexpectedly triumphed, exploiting his knack for free publicity and relying on his own fortune and money from   supporters. In part because of that success, Mr. Trump was slow to incorporate super PACs into his general election strategy. By contrast, Mrs. Clinton began personally courting donors for outside groups almost as soon as she entered the campaign in spring 2015. The Democrats’ tentpole is Priorities USA, a    super PAC that has access to the party’s biggest donors and the implicit blessing of Mrs. Clinton, and is now on track to raise $173 million by Election Day. That is more than any equivalent Democratic effort in history, including the controversial   groups set up by wealthy liberals a decade ago to unseat President George W. Bush. The PAC is closely coordinating with environmental and labor activists and other organizations set up to harness support from veterans,   and Latinos. In   meetings at a Democratic law firm in downtown Washington, officials at Priorities have convened representatives of a dozen super PACs and progressive organizations to carve out   turf and share intelligence from organizers on the ground. Several have pooled money with Priorities USA to purchase television and digital advertising through the same media firms, allowing smaller groups to get better rates. (Other   organizations, including labor unions and a super PAC founded by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, have separately spent significant money on field organizing.) Priorities USA has shared the cost of some major campaigns with Emily’s List, the leading progressive group aimed at electing Democratic women. The super PAC has also given smaller groups access to its digital and video creative studio or shared its own television spots with other organizations to run under their own names. In early October, for example, a super PAC controlled by the Service Employees International Union began a $3 million   campaign targeted at Latino voters in southern Florida and Nevada. The ads, which featured Hispanic families and accused Mr. Trump of bringing “hate, divisiveness and disrespect into our homes,” was originally produced by a team at Priorities USA. Democratic officials said the partnership had yielded better and more authentic advertising and outreach. A group called the Latino Victory Fund, which has run $400, 000 in advertising backed by Priorities, advised the group on how to vary   accents depending on where the ad was running:   Spanish for spots airing around Miami,   accents and word usage for Nevada. “Sometimes we’ve come up with concepts for ads, both digital and television,” said the fund’s interim director, César J. Blanco. “In other instances, Priorities has developed a concept and shared it with us. They’ve shared with us data and polling. It’s been a really great partnership. ” Behind that partnership is an astonishing concentration of liberal wealth. More than   of the total money that groups supporting Mrs. Clinton have raised  —   $133 million  —   comes from just 30 families. Donald Sussman, a hedge fund investor and longtime liberal donor, has donated $19 million to Priorities USA, among the largest amounts any   donor has ever given to a single super PAC. Members of the billionaire Pritzker family, which founded the Hyatt hotel chain, have contributed $14 million to Priorities and other   groups. The liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros has given $13. 5 million, far more than he gave to support Mr. Obama four years ago. As most of the big Republican groups have stayed away from the presidential race, a small constellation of groups run by Trump allies has sprung up in their place, raising $46 million since the beginning of the cycle. The National Rifle Association, one of the few traditional conservative allies to get behind Mr. Trump’s campaign, has put $20 million into a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump and other Republicans. But many of the new Trump groups are getting into the game late, when advertising rates have skyrocketed, and they are competing against one another for donors and turf, sometimes even cannibalizing Mr. Trump’s own  . Another group, Future45, has raised $13 million for ads criticizing Mrs. Clinton, and an affiliated nonprofit group that does not disclose its donors has drawn millions more. But their spending appears targeted at states with competitive Senate races, with the goal of protecting Republicans down the ballot from any damage Mr. Trump might do. Mr. Trump has attracted some generous individual supporters, according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission through last week. The casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have donated $10 million to groups running advertising against Mrs. Clinton. Bernard Marcus, the   of Home Depot, has provided $7 million to a pair of   super PACs. A surprisingly small donor to Mr. Trump is Robert Mercer, a New York hedge fund executive. Mr. Mercer and his family have invested millions of dollars over the years in conservative advocacy groups and media outlets, some of which are now among Mr. Trump’s biggest supporters. But Mr. Mercer has been relatively parsimonious with the cash he has put into a   super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, contributing just $2 million.",0
1041,Fake News: New York Times Targets Breitbart for Reporting Truth - Breitbart,"The New York Times ran a story on Saturday implicating Breitbart News in what it claimed was a misleading effort to state that former FBI Director James Comey had testified under oath that he had not been pressured to stop an investigation. [The Times‘ Jeremy W. Peters  —   normally one of its more credible journalists  —   reported that a tweet by Jack Posobiec led Breitbart News and other conservative outlets to conclude  —   falsely, in its view  —   that Comey had exonerated President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, under oath.  “Mr. Posobiec wrote on May 17 that Mr. Comey, the recently ousted F. B. I. director, had ‘said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation’,” the Times reported. “It mattered little that Mr. Comey had said no such thing. The tweet quickly ricocheted through the ecosystem of fake news and disinformation on the far right, where Trump partisans like Mr. Posobiec have intensified their efforts to sow doubt about the legitimacy of expanding investigations into Trump associates’ ties to Russia. The Times included Breitbart News in that “ecosystem,” citing an article at Breitbart News that mentioned Posobiec’s tweet. But the Breitbart article was careful to note that Comey’s testimony on May 8 had not responded specifically to a question about whether Trump himself had asked him to stop an investigation. It did draw the inference that Comey’s comment could have included Trump  —   but was precise in its language: “Although Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) didn’t specifically ask about Trump in the question she posed to Comey, the inquiry was about whether or not he had experienced having a higher authority stop an FBI investigation. ” The inference is not the only possible one  —   but neither is the inference that the Times prefers to draw against Trump, and to present as established fact. The Breitbart headline also did not specifically mention Trump. Comey did not volunteer any information about Trump during that testimony. He only accused Trump of having asked him to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn  —   by allegedly expressing a “hope”  —   once Comey had been fired. Joel B.

1042,"After Blast, New Yorkers Examine Themselves for Psychological Shrapnel - The New York Times","As detectives scoured every inch of the bomb scene in Chelsea on Sunday, New Yorkers were conducting their own investigations. But theirs were turned inward, as they felt around for the psychological shrapnel that an explosion on a busy city street is designed to release, as damaging in its way as the kind that tears into flesh. A walk around Manhattan revealed glimpses of these inquiries, quiet but as intense as those beneath the emergency klieg lights. Suzie Shapiro got as close as she could to the scene on Sunday. “It’s less scary if you see it,” she said, adding that she had done her best to explain the explosion to her two young children at home. “This is the reality of being a kid right now. ” On an uptown subway on Sunday, a group of   singers performed just as they do every other day, but added as they left the train, “Be safe out there. ” Moments later, the F train bypassed the 23rd Street station near the bomb scene “due to a police investigation. ” The conductor spoke in bored tones over the intercom, as if it were like any other incident. From her apartment a block away from the explosion, the singer Rosanne Cash wrote on Twitter: “We are safe and well. Appreciate the love + concern. ” And another neighbor nearby, Graham Mills, 52, seemed unsurprised. “It was only a matter of time,” he said. “There’s kind of this New York spirit that’s like, whatever. Let’s get on with life. ” Getting on with life in New York has been a work in progress for at least 15 years. In 2010, a car bomb was found in a Nissan Pathfinder parked in Times Square, though it did not detonate. The episode rattled the city even as residents spoke of the proverbial dodged bullet. But the bullet is always out there, as Saturday night reminded everyone. No lives were lost. Had New York dodged another one?    Natalie Wollen did not think so. She said she did not want to leave her Chelsea apartment all day on Sunday, but did so to walk her dog. “I’m still scared,” she said, her lips quivering. She had heard reports, which were later retracted, of a third bomb. “If there were three already, there could be another one,” she said. Another dog walker, Sipho Simela, 31, stepped out into the day, but with a shrug, perhaps more appropriate to his age. “My wife was like, ‘What are you going to do? ’” he said. “And I said, ‘I’m going to walk the dog. ’” Years after Sept. 11, 2001, some New Yorkers still use that day as a guide, a measure for examining anxiety not unlike the   sign outside the scary ride in an amusement park. When something like this happens, they ask themselves, does this day feel as bad as that day, that line on the wall of my psyche? Better? Worse? “I don’t feel anywhere near that kind of intensity,” said Merril Stern, sitting in a Starbucks near the blast site. Similarly, Tyschelle Doucette from Queens was greeted by Mayor Bill de Blasio, and she told him, as if seeking to reassure the leader of a jittery city: “I was here for  . If it’s happening, it’s happening. ” The mayor called her an example to other New Yorkers. For Will Finnegan, 31, a former Marine, the news of the blast brought him back to the   levels he worked in while deployed for five years in Afghanistan, he said. He went to work checking on friends in the neighborhood. “I understand how to mitigate stress and fear,” he said. Likewise, his roommate, Brandon Lanham, 31, who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, said, “I’m almost too calm to a fault. ” He said he found solace in the aftermath of the blast: “I’m assuming it’s someone that wants attention and is an American. It was not well placed. ” For others, the images of the explosion, as seen on television and smartphone screens (a bright flash and people running away, looking back over their shoulders) belonged somewhere else. Somewhere far away. “New Yorkers, we see now, here, what we have seen only abroad,” said James Mitchell, 54, an    driver. “Chickens have come home to roost. ” He thought back to 2001 and found something more troubling in the Chelsea explosion, he said. “It’s different, because the target is more random than specific,” he said. “It really makes me feel that life is getting really cheap in this world. ” Natalie, the    walking her dog, said she was like everyone else born in the past 15 years. “Since we weren’t alive for   we’ve never been alive in a time when we aren’t scared,” she said. “I’ve learned to accept that this stuff is going to happen. ” Downtown, sitting on a bench in the West Village, a    mother, Maria Lugo, might beg to differ. To be a parent in these times is to know fear, she said. She grew up in the Bronx, where “I wasn’t even allowed to go outside and play. ” Now she has a    son. “I am still worried about the bullies, the drug dealers, the killings, the shootings, the stabbings. Plus, I am also concerned about this. ” She is struggling, like so many others, to place the Chelsea bomb in the context of her life and manage the anxiety it brought. “It hasn’t eased up,” she said. “When can you say, ‘You know what? It’s O. K.’? You’re always worried about something. ” Back in Chelsea, across the street from the scene of the blast, a    boy, Aiden Li, gave his account of the event: “I heard the thunder,” he said. “I climbed up on Papa. ” His father, Kyle Li, did not correct him. But he mourned what he said he lost on Saturday night. “Across from my house, that Dumpster is sitting there in pieces,” he said. “And now the whole city looks different to me. ”",0
1043,Resistance: Schwarzenegger Calls for ’Grassroots Revolution’ After U.S. Exits Paris Agreement,"Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a “grassroots revolution” to continue the battle against global warming after President Donald Trump announced Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. [In a video posted Thursday via ATTN, a Los   media company, the actor and former California governor urged citizens and elected officials to “rise up” and save Planet Earth.  “One man cannot destroy our progress, one man can’t stop our clean energy revolution, one man can’t go back in time. Only I can do that,” Schwarzenegger said. “Like all the great movements in human history, our clean future starts with a grassroots movement in our communities, our cities and our states,” he said. “We can’t leave it to Washington to lead. We need to do it ourselves. ” “You see, the people will rise up,” the Terminator star said, adding that “local and state governments will rise up   …     and fill the void you are creating. We need to do it ourselves. ” BREAKING: Arnold Schwarzenegger has a blunt message for Donald Trump. #ParisAgreement pic. twitter.   —   ATTN: (@attn) June 2, 2017,  President Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise Thursday when he announced America’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in a speech delivered in the White House Rose Garden. “In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord,” Trump declared. “We will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine. ” Trump’s landmark decision had no shortage of detractors, as it was blasted by   celebrities, liberal lawmakers, and former president Barack Obama, who signed the agreement in April 2016. Schwarzenegger has spent several months leading an   campaign and denouncing the president’s agenda. He even recently offered to switch jobs with Trump “so people can finally sleep comfortably again. ” In April, the actor pushed the idea that Ohio Gov. John Kasich should run for president again in 2020 and challenge Trump in the Republican primary.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson",0
1044,Virginia Officials Request U.S. Inquiry After Inmate Deaths in Jail - The New York Times,"A   old inmate was in a southeast Virginia jail for about three months when he became ill in August, suffering from uncontrolled fainting spells, coughing and vomiting. “I don’t know what cause the blackouts,” the man, Henry C. Stewart, wrote on a form used by inmates to ask for medical help at Hampton Roads Regional Jail. “I can’t hold water down or food. ” That was Aug. 4. Two days later, Mr. Stewart was found dead in the jail in Portsmouth, Va. the second man to die in custody there within a year, the authorities said. The deaths of Mr. Stewart and the other inmate, Jamycheal Mitchell, 24, have renewed calls this month by legislators and state officials for better scrutiny and oversight of the state’s regional jails. Mark R. Herring, Virginia’s attorney general, has asked for a federal civil rights investigation, saying the “lack of clarity” over what happened to the men was troubling. “I write to you with urgency,” Mr. Herring said in letter to United States Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. The Sept. 6 letter, provided Wednesday by his office, contained details about Mr. Stewart’s death. The state “is once again confronted with significant questions about the provision of medical care at this regional jail,” Mr. Herring wrote. The Justice Department replied in an email that it had received Mr. Herring’s letter and was “in the process of reviewing the request. ” Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Democrat of Virginia, was asked about the men’s deaths in a video published on Sept. 1 by The  . “You bet I have concerns,” Mr. McAuliffe replied. “I have a lot of questions,” the governor added. “This is why we’re going to propose legislation in the upcoming General Assembly” which starts in January. “No one is taking responsibility,” he said. Virginia’s regional jails are operated by local, rather than state, authorities. The Hampton Roads jail is run by sheriffs, city managers and city council members from the five cities  —   Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Chesapeake  —   in its jurisdiction. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the governor, said on Thursday that any proposed legislation would aim to give state agencies the authority to investigate regional jails when events like the deaths of the two men occur. Currently, the state and the Portsmouth city police are investigating the jail deaths, Mr. Coy said. “The law can be more clear in terms of the process going forward,” Mr. Coy said. “Who, if anyone, has the authority to oversee and investigate local jails. “There is no clear authority about who investigates when there is a death in the local or regional jails,” he said. Last week, an investigation by The Richmond   showed that inmates died nearly nine times more often in custody at Hampton Roads Regional Jail than at other local or regional jails in Virginia during the past three years. The newspaper analyzed statistics from two state agencies showing that 12 of the 6, 716 inmates who have been locked up at the   jail have died since June 2013. Statewide, 129 inmates died across Virginia in the same time period. Lt. Col. Eugene Taylor III, the jail’s assistant superintendent, responded to the newspaper’s report, saying five cities that send inmates to the jail send their sickest, and the jail cannot refuse them. “If you have cancer, if you have H. I. V. you’re coming to Hampton Roads Regional Jail,” he was quoted as saying. The jail’s superintendent, David Simons, and the jail’s lawyer, Jeff Rosen, were not available for comment or did not return calls on Wednesday and early Thursday. The attorney general’s letter requesting the federal investigation after Mr. Stewart’s death was first reported by local media, including The   and WAVY. com, which have also published documents online detailing the jail’s response to Mr. Mitchell’s death. One of the jail’s documents shows a timeline of occasions when Mr. Mitchell sometimes refused food, treatment and medicine. The jail superintendent, Mr. Simons, has said the facility was cooperating with investigators in the Mitchell case, according to a letter he sent to Mr. Herring in June, a copy of which was provided in an email from Mr. Herring’s office. Mark Krudys, a lawyer for Mr. Stewart’s family, said Mr. Herring’s request for a federal investigation shows the jail “has a very significant problem on its hands in both dealing with the mentally ill and dealing with people who need medical help. ” He said in a telephone interview on Thursday that Mr. Stewart was being held and accused of violating probation. He said that he anticipated filing a lawsuit after receiving information, including the medical examiner’s determination of the cause of death There was no immediate information on Mr. Stewart’s original complaint. After Mr. Stewart died, the grievance form that he used to ask for medical help was included in the package of his belongings and returned to the family, and then it was published in media reports, Mr. Krudys said. It confirmed details about what former inmates had told the family after Mr. Stewart died, he said. The form shows that Mr. Stewart was told to wait for an appointment for medical help, a service that was the responsibility of an independent contractor for the jail, Mr. Krudys said. Mr. Mitchell was put in the Hamptons Road jail in May 2015 after being arrested and accused of stealing snacks from a  . While awaiting mental health treatment before a trial on the misdemeanor charges, he was not given enough medicine and food and was poorly treated by corrections officers, the lawsuit filed on behalf of Mr. Mitchell’s family said. It quoted interviews with former inmates for some of the details. Mr. Mitchell was found dead in his cell on August 19, 2015. The cause of his death was “probable cardiac arrhythmia accompanying wasting syndrome of unknown etiology,” said Donna Price, from the medical examiner’s office, in a report by The  .",0
1045,How to report voter fraud - Crash Course.,"By Shane Wright 11/05/2012 Voter fraud is a contentious issue of late; liberals swear it is a myth propagated by evil racist conservatives. We know better. Most on the right are aware of the voter fraud issue but many have little to no idea how to combat or report violations; consider this your crash course. First and foremost, step one in any instance where you see or suspect voter fraud is to alert the state officials who oversee the election process. For most states this is done by the Secretary of State, in other states, there is a State Board of Elections. Notifying these officials is paramount as they are the ones who ultimately certify and authenticate elections. Alert them before you call Fox News or blow up Twitter, though drawing as much media attention as possible is beneficial, you want to make sure you follow a process. I have included a contact list for each state at the bottom of this post. In many cases once you have alerted the state authorities they will direct you to the proper city or county officials where you will fill out paperwork. Bureaucracy at its finest. Go ahead and jump through their hoops, if you witnessed the fraud, chances are someone else did too. Make a good effort to get other witness' names and contact information as well. This will strengthen your case and increase the likelihood that state and county officials will step in and act on your complaint. If, as has happened before, state officials ignore you entirely your next step is to contact your state Attorney General and alert them of the situation. However, before you do this you need to arm yourself with knowledge of your specific states election laws. You will be more credible if you are able to cite the specific statutes which were violated. State laws are generally published online, however it may actually be quicker and easier for you to go to your local library or courthouse and utilize their search engines. In my experience relevant case law and updated statutes can be difficult to sort through on Google or other internet search sites. The Attorney General should conduct an investigation to determine whether or not there is enough evidence and/or information to take legal action. If state officials refuse to work with you, your next step is to alert both your State Representative and State Senator, they may intercede, and it is in the Secretary of State and Attorney General's best interest to respond professionally and quickly to these representatives. Should you continue to hit dead ends on the state level, it’s time to alert the Department of Justice. Before doing this, call your Congressman and Senator, in some cases they will be willing to write a letter on your behalf to the DOJ. This is what your goal is ultimately; for the DOJ is less likely to ignore these officials. If going through your elected officials is a poor option, as it may very well be depending on the circumstances, review federal election law and proceed anyways. Finally, you and I both know that the DOJ, nor liberal state officials are likely to do anything about a claim of election fraud, however, it is absolutely imperative that you go through these motions and document these steps to preserve any future legal options. Documenting instances of election fraud will continue to strengthen our case for voter ID. Furthermore it is important to press forward on these criminals, so that it's understood that we will not idly stand by and allow our elections to be manipulated. Last but not least, use your head. If you see or suspect voter manipulation, have the courage to record it, whip out your phone and start shooting video , and report it to the appropriate authorities first. Alabama 334-242-7210",0
1046,Associated Press reporter admits faking news stories for Hillary Clinton.,"*Sent:* Tuesday, August 11, 2015 6:00 PM *To:* Kendall, David *Subject:* Hi again from AP (inquiry about thumb drive) 
Hi David, 
We have been told, and we are preparing to report, that the FBI has taken possession of the thumb drive that was once in your possession. This is what we have been informed, and we wanted to see whether there was any sort of comment that could be provided. If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well . But we have solid reason to believe this. We’d welcome any comment you can offer. Thanks very much. 
Eric Associated Press reporter says he knows it’s true, but will gladly print that it’s false 
What’s truly astonishing in this email is how AP reporter Eric Tucker says he will gladly LIE to cover for the Clintons . In plain English, he explains that he has “solid reason” to believe the report about the thumb drive, but he will gladly publish a false narrative via the Associated Press , and he even suggests what that false narrative should be: “If you wanted to steer us away and say that we are misinformed, then I would gladly accept that as well.” 
In other words, he’s not just corrupt, dishonest and fraudulent as a journalist, he’s also SUGGESTING the false narrative the Clintons should use! 
This is the exact same way the AP talks to the CDC about vaccines and measles, by the way. Essentially, the Associated Press reporters say, “We are total media whores, we will bend over and grab our ankles while you shove your fake story down the throats of our readers who foolishly think we’re a credible news organization.” 
You gotta love Eric Tucker for this. The guy takes the prize for finally spelling out in black and white what we’ve known for years: the AP is a total joke when it comes to real journalism . Note carefully that the AP won’t even fire Tucker for this admission. He’ll probably get a prize of some sort. How many other Associated Presstitutes have deliberately LIED to cover up Clinton crimes? 
It all brings to mind the obvious question: How many other Associated Presstitutes deliberately lied to cover up Clinton crimes? 
Just what percentage of AP stories about the Clinton scandals are actually FAKE NEWS pretending to be credible journalism? (Answer: Probably about 99%.) 
It’s not just AP, either. It’s the same story at every other mainstream news organization across America: They’re all liars and crooks, and they’re all working for Hillary Clinton, the serial killer and rape excuser.",0
1047,Review: Garth Brooks Brings Rousing Anthems and Ballads to Yankee Stadium - The New York Times,"“The cameras are over,” Garth Brooks said late Friday night, speaking conspiratorially to the tens of thousands of people who had come to Yankee Stadium to see him. “Now it’s just you and me. ” He had just performed a rousing hour and a half full of   anthems, aching ballads, and lots and lots of running. This was his second encore. He asked for a capo, and someone hustled on stage to give him one. Then he played four acoustic killers  —   a Bob Dylan cover, a Billy Joel cover and two of his own  —   while, on either side of him, cameras were rolling, taking in the scene. Which is not to say that Mr. Brooks is a liar, per se  —   only that he is an outstanding salesman, one of the greatest in pop music history, a man who vacillates seamlessly between the performance of intimacy and the performance of exuberance, and often does not distinguish between the two. That skill made him the signature country star of the 1990s, and also the decade’s signature country disrupter. He infused the genre with classic rock gestures,   scale and pop ceremony long before doing so became the norm. And that made him staggeringly popular: The last time Mr. Brooks played New York City, it was to almost a million people in Central Park in 1997. This show in the Bronx was the first of two nights here, and the first country music concert at Yankee Stadium. And yet, Mr. Brooks was always a resolutely average singer. His greatest accomplishments were never technical or aesthetic, they were logistical  —   he turned country songs into   community soundtracks. (As if to prove the point, Friday’s show opened with a   video of the assembly of the stage, which was impressive, like a tiered cake with a huge circular loop that extended out into the center of the field.) He built the big tent under which country music now unthinkingly parades. He has done so with sleights of performance. Instead of singing with vibrato, he makes eye contact. Instead of vocal depth, he boasts a megawatt grin. Instead of flawless pitch, he has rugged athleticism. What he does have in common with more gifted vocalists, though, is his commitment to feeling. From that encore  —   especially on the tender “She’s Every Woman”  —   to “The Thunder Rolls” to “The Dance,” Mr. Brooks continually showed how to hush a room, even one with no roof. His wife, the country star Trisha Yearwood, joined him on the ballad “In Another’s Eyes,” then stuck around for three songs on her own  —   an energetic cover of “When Will I Be Loved? ,” the peak schmaltz of “How Do I Live” and the slightly tepid “She’s in Love With the Boy”  —   before giving Mr. Brooks a lingering kiss on the mouth, then leaving. So it was a family affair, too, this Yankee Stadium party. That jovial attitude extended to Mr. Brooks’s band and backup singers, perhaps the most excited and positive group of performers on any stage, anywhere. They smiled and laughed through “Ain’t Goin’ Down (‘Til the Sun Comes Up),” “Two Piña Coladas” and the rowdy “Papa Loved Mama. ” Even when Mr. Brooks turned serious, for just a fleeting second, he turned the moment into an inclusive jam. Before singing the gimmicky “People Loving People,” he said he had been asked to comment on the shooting in Dallas that killed five police officers and injured seven more. He said his answer had always been the same: “We’ve got to love one another  —   that’s what it’s all about. It’s our only hope. ” In that same breath he mentioned Orlando, Fla. where a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub last month, and Paris, where 89 were killed at a concert last November. Mr. Brooks did not, however, mention the fatal police shootings of black men in Falcon Heights, Minn. and in Baton Rouge, La. And that omission only became more awkward when, later in the show, Mr. Brooks played the   joyful “Callin’ Baton Rouge,” a song that felt out of step with the current political moment. Even though Mr. Brooks only recently made a public return to music after several years of semiretirement  —   he said he will be releasing a new album in the fall  —   he remains extremely popular. He recently announced a partnership with SiriusXM satellite radio, in which he will have a dedicated channel. And this show was being filmed, which was hard to overlook. Before Mr. Brooks took the stage, a functionary came out and   a blanket waiver. Another person said the number of cameras being used was 23. At one point during the show, Mr. Brooks ran around the circular stage twice, encouraging fans to do the wave. Afterward, breathing heavily, Mr. Brooks said that his producer was making “the old, fat guy” do it once more. And so he did. At the end of the night, fireworks shot into the sky from behind the stage, but they were upstaged by the rain, which began during “Friends in Low Places” and really took hold during “The Dance,” one of Mr. Brooks’s most scarred ballads. It was so apt as to seem   it was studied sincerity and spontaneity all rolled into one. As Mr. Brooks sang, with eyes closed, about the trauma of failed love, raindrops were exploding at his feet.",0
1048,Sicher trainieren: Beim Spinning gilt ab sofort Helmpflicht,"Montag, 21. November 2016 Sicher trainieren: Beim Spinning gilt ab sofort Helmpflicht Berlin (dpo) - Achtung, Freizeit-Sportler: Ab 1. Januar gilt in Deutschlands Fitnessstudios Helmpflicht. Wer sich durch Spinning in Form bringen will, darf das Indoorbike ohne professionellen Kopfschutz nicht mehr besteigen. Durch die Neuregelung soll die Unfall- und Verletzungsgefahr deutlich reduziert werden. Die Helmpflicht sei ein wichtiger Baustein, um die Sicherheit in den Studios weiter zu erhöhen, so der Verband Deutscher Fitness- und Gesundheitsunternehmen in einer Mitteilung. Zwar sei die Gefahr, von einem entgegenkommenden Pkw erfasst zu werden, vergleichsweise gering, doch seien schon mehrere Sportler vor Erschöpfung vom Ergometer gefallen oder von einem unaufmerksamen Bodybuilder angerempelt oder gar umgestoßen worden. Zudem erhöhe ein Helm das Sicherheitsgefühl, gerade bei rasanten Spinning-Einheiten oder Berg- und Talfahrt-Simulationen. Indoorbikes haben keinerlei Knautschzone, weshalb der Kopf besonders geschützt werden muss. Ebenfalls aus Sicherheitsgründen ist es künftig nicht mehr gestattet, während der Fahrt über Kopfhörer Musik zu hören oder auf einen Bildschirm zu starren. ""Wir bauen alle Monitore ab"", so Verena Hardenberg, Betreiberin eines privaten Fitnessstudios in Würzburg. ""Es hat sich herausgestellt, dass die Fahrer dadurch sehr stark abgelenkt werden. Das Risiko ist uns einfach zu groß!"" Und in der Branche sind bereits weitere Maßnahmen im Gespräch, sollte die Helm-Initiative zu kurz greifen. Möglicherweise müssen beim Spinning demnächst neonfarbene Warnwesten übergestreift oder leuchtende Katzenaugen mitgeführt werden. Diese könne man ohnehin ganz bequem am Shirt oder Stirnband befestigen. So sei auch in der Dämmerung und in den Abendstunden ein sicheres Training möglich. Aber nicht jeder ist begeistert. ""Ich fahr doch nicht extra mit meinem Rad 20 Kilometer ins Fitnessstudio, um mich dort dann zu blamieren"", so der kritische Kommentar von McFit-Stammkunde Mirko M. aus Ennepetal. Ein Helm sei umständlich, teuer und verringere, so glaubt er, vor allem seine Flirtchancen vor Ort, weil er albern aussehe. ""Wofür halten die uns? Für Spinner?"" swo; Foto [M]: Shutterstock",0
1049,Every Asset Class Will Collapse: ‘You Need To Be Looking At Your Wealth In Terms Of How Many Chickens And How Much Gas You Can Buy’,"
There’s no other way to put it.
The system as we know it will collapse. This, argues Karl Denninger of the Market Ticker , is a mathematical certainty.
In a recent interview with Future Money Trends Denninger touches on the various dire challenges facing America. From the Presidential election to the rampant corruption in our financial, political and healthcare systems, he pulls no punches and warns that the worst is yet to come unless real action is taken immediately. Failure to do so, says Denninger, will lead to a collapse of everything we consider to be a part of our current way of life.
If we do not start locking people up our government, our way of life and every asset class… the price of all of them… is going to collapse. This is not a maybe. This is arithmetic. It’s not politics. The problem here is that nobody in the political sphere from either party is talking about this. This is where the problem lies.
…At the same time, this is what is bankrupting all of the public sector pensions… If you’re a policeman, a firefighter, a teacher in any of the states you’re not going to get your money . At best you’ll get half. I’ve run the numbers… the best systems in the country right now will be able to pay half of those benefits… many of them are worse than that. You’re going to also see the collapse of all the state budgets for the same reason because they’ve got those embedded liabilities. Law or no law, I don’t care what your state Constitution says you have. If you can’t collect the money you’re not going to get the check. 

( Watch at Youtube )
What’s worse is the fact that not only can we not stop what’s coming, Denninger says that there is really no way to prepare for it from a wealth preservation aspect because anything that doesn’t get wiped out in a crash will probably be stolen by the government. Thus, when we think preparedness, we’d better be thinking in terms of survival essentials:
You can’t [protect your wealth]. You need to be looking at your wealth in terms of how many chickens are you going to be able to buy or how many gallons of gasoline… or how many kilowatt hours of electricity because the number of dollars you have or how many ounces of gold is utterly immaterial… The only thing that matters is what they buy. 
… The problem is and the aspect that people take on this …. and I get these questions all the time whenever I post an article showing the math… The first thing that comes up in the comments is ‘ what do I do as an investor to protect myself from this? ‘…. The answer is there isn’t a way to do it… remember, the government will steal everything that’s not nailed down and not protected with your life… so, unless you’re willing to die, at which point you don’t care how much money you have because you’re dead, there is no personal protection method that works.
If the picture Denninger paints of the future of America is accurate – and we can’t really argue with the mathematical evidence he has put forth at The Market Ticker over the last decade – then when this system does collapse it is going to lead to widespread chaos as every asset class out there is going to be worth significantly less than it is today.
In such a scenario we need to consider what will have value and what will take the form of money when dollars are no longer a feasible mechanism for exchange.
As Denninger points out, the only thing of importance will be how much the”assets” in your posession will be able to buy.
Dollars may be worthless in this instance. Gold and silver may have fallen or risen in price, but their purchasing power is what will matter, and as Denninger notes, they may be illegal to own so trade would have to take place on black markets. Food, medicine, toilet paper, soap, and other essentials will sky rocket in value, as has been evidenced by the hyperinflationary collapse currently taking place in Venezuela.
So when we look at protecting ourselves from the coming crash of our entire way of life, it’s the essential goods and services that people can’t live without that will become the assets of choice.
The math is clear. It is coming. Prepare for it now.

1050,Review: ‘Halt and Catch Fire’ Time-Travels to Silicon Valley’s Dawn - The New York Times,"In the tech business, you often invent the product first and find out what it’s for later. Facebook was a college social site before it became a global media hub Amazon was a bookseller before it was, well, everything. Likewise with AMC’s “Halt and Catch Fire,” set in the 1980s at the advent of the   revolution. When the series began two years ago, it was another   chasing a trend  —   in this case, the   antihero. Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace) a mysterious,   drifter of a businessman, was paired with Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy) a brilliant but failed engineer, in a sketchy scheme to bring an IBM clone to market. As a plot, it was less than inspiring, and as a character story, less than inspired: an   Don Draper and a Walter White who dealt in megabytes rather than meth. But at the end of its first season, “Halt” did something almost   in television, if not in tech: It upended its entire project. With the introduction of the Apple Macintosh, Joe and Gordon discovered that they had been chasing yesterday’s dream. They were thinking too small, too incrementally. The quest of the entire season had been a failure of imagination. And “Halt” would have been as well, had it not rebooted  itself. The outstanding second season latched on to a much more powerful idea. The 1980s, it said, were not the decade of a mechanical revolution but a cultural one. The headlines then were about computing power coming to your desktop. But the   change, barely glimmering in the days of telephone modems, lay in the connection of every desktop to every other. It was the birth of the social internet, where we now live. Season 2 followed Mutiny, a nascent online gaming company started by Gordon’s wife, Donna (Kerry Bishé) and Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis) an impassioned sparkplug of a programmer. For all practical purposes, the series changed not just its focus but its lead characters. Cameron was visionary but impractical Donna relished the new start but chafed at being forced into the role of the buzz kill adult in the room. (Ms. Bishé gave a nuanced, undersung performance.) This was something we hadn’t seen so often before: a tricky but fruitful alliance between two women in a   industry. Cameron had the digital native’s instinct to see the online world as a place of constant invention. Donna had the emotional intelligence to notice that Mutiny’s social component  —   its chat rooms  —   was the future of the future. Season 3, which begins on Tuesday, continues the show’s   process, picking up in 1986, as Mutiny has relocated from Texas to Silicon Valley and is beginning to reconceive itself one more time. (Cameron and Donna have noticed their gamers’ taking over Mutiny chat to negotiate   trades  —   shades of Craigslist or eBay.) The growing pains continue, throwing the women into the unfamiliar and   world of venture capitalists. “It only takes one of them to ask you to the dance,” says their consigliere, John Bosworth (Toby Huss). Cameron replies, “I love how even the metaphors in this business are sexist. ” They find a possible ally in Diane (Annabeth Gish) a sympathetic but bluntly honest investor. Gordon has come along in tow, feeling at loose ends in a managerial role at Mutiny. The chameleonic Joe, meanwhile, has landed in California as the head of a   firm, sporting a Steve Jobsian beard and speaking in pretentious koans. (“I’ve been accused of selling fear,” he tells a rapt audience. “But let me ask you: Is it fear or is it truth? ”) Joe’s   as a smug tech guru suits Mr. Pace, a striking but peculiar presence whom the show has struggled to use effectively. (He was well cast in the “Hobbit” movies as the frosty,   elven king Thranduil.) He seems fully at home now, strutting around his office listening to Gary Numan music, carrying himself like a human Patrick Nagel print. Joe 3. 0 is also a prelude to the fatuous moguls of HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” to which “Halt” is a temporal and tonal bookend. Where “Silicon Valley” is a gleeful satire about business people feigning idealism  —   all that   about changing the world  —   “Halt” is an empathetic drama about idealists trying to fake their way into business. The new season begins to give you some sense of how we got from there to here. We see the same scrambles to get   advantage, the pilgrimages up and down Sand Hill Road seeking venture capital. But where “Silicon Valley” trades in decacorns (  valued at over $10 billion) it’s jarring in “Halt” to see deals done for six figures  —   not even Dr. Evil money. The new season takes time to reset, and the movement in the early episodes is slow. The character dynamics are solid, though, and the ’80s details continue to be spot on. (At a fancy Valley restaurant, Donna stumbles over the pronunciation of a trendy new dish: risotto.) But any   period piece can recreate bygone days. “Halt” lets you see them as the cusp of bracing change. The real product in its tech business isn’t hardware or software  —   it’s tomorrow, and “Halt and Catch Fire” makes its past future feel dewy and new.",0
1051,Obama Used Religious Test to Favor Muslims Over Christians,"Obama Used Religious Test to Favor Muslims Over Christians   
We saw the statistical outcomes with the refugee numbers where the vast majority of Syrian refugees were Muslims with hardly any Christians at all. Now we have a snapshot of how that same bias worked with jobs. 
According to an email chain from 2008, John Podesta received lists of exclusively Muslims and Asians to be considered for jobs in the Obama administration. The email chain revealed that in this process, Middle Eastern Christians were purposefully excluded, or set aside in a separate list, with an aide writing, 
In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim (e.g., George Mitchell). Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list (of outside boards/commissions), most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful (where noted) may be Arab American but of uncertain religion (esp. Christian). 
Remember all that outrage over how un-American religious tests are? Religious tests that preference Muslims are how Obama Inc. does business. 
Note especially the ""uncertain religion"" part. This is how religious tests work.",0

1054,Life: Got The Flu? Here’s 6 Demands You Can Extract From Your Local Retirement Community With That Leverage,"Email You’re hacking up a lung and highly contagious, which gives you serious power over any retirement community. They’ll agree to almost anything you demand. 
1. Unlimited free toast from the breakfast buffet: They’ve got plenty of toast in the dining hall, so the retirement community will surrender as much toast as you want if you agree not to come near their barely functional immune systems until your flu clears. White, wheat, pumpernickel—it’s all yours for the taking. However, toast is just the beginning of what you can wring out of these defenseless seniors. 
2. Permission to tear all the nice pictures out of their magazines: You’re a walking plague ship of a human, and that puts the feeble and poorly constituted at your every whim. Feel free to peruse through the magazines in the senior lounge and keep any pictures you like. You can rip up Golf Digest to shreds for the glossy ads about wrist watches. They can’t stop you. 
3. Lipitor: You’re not sure what this drug does, maybe some kind of blood thing, but if you want to try Lipitor, this is your chance. Threaten to walk through their halls coughing on every doorknob you see unless you get a sack of Lipitor, pronto. You’ve got them over a barrel. 
4. Access to a senile patient who’s been told you’re FDR: This is your opportunity to have an 89-year-old man fawn over you and gratefully thank you for leading America through WWII. The retirement home might hesitate to lend a resident to you, but they’ll cave once you remind them that you’ve got plenty of virus-laden phlegm to spread around. At the end of the day, sacrificing one elder for the good of the others is a gamble a retirement community will take every time. 
5. Renaming the retirement community after you : Tell them there better be a bronze plaque with your name bolted next to the front door, or you’re going to lurch through their rec center hugging every retiree you encounter like the goddamn horseman of pestilence. Show them you mean business by taking their Purell dispenser from the front lobby and throwing it into the street. 
6. Have them cure your flu: All good things must come to an end, including your flu-empowered reign of terror. When you’re ready to recover from your debilitating illness, ask them to send over a nurse with some antiviral drugs and chicken soup. Just make sure the retirement community agrees to all these concessions in writing, because once you’re healthy, you’ve got nothing over them anymore.",0
1055,"Turkey Says Airport Bombers Were From Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Uzbekistan - The New York Times","ISTANBUL  —   The three suicide bombers who killed 44 people at Istanbul’s main international airport this week have been identified as citizens of Russia, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Turkish officials said Thursday. Turkey, which has blamed the Islamic State for the attack, carried out raids across the country on Thursday, detaining 13 people, including three foreigners, in connection with the attack  at Istanbul Ataturk Airport on Tuesday night. There were 238 people wounded in the attack, and 94 of them were still in the hospital, the governor of Istanbul, Vasip Sahin, said Thursday. No group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday’s attack. Although   units of the Islamic State have played an important role on the battlefield in Iraq and Syria, if the preliminary identifications of the Istanbul attackers are confirmed it will signify the first time that such fighters have taken part in a major external operation on a Western target. Turkish officials on Thursday did not offer any details about how they determined the identifications of the attackers. Russian and Uzbek officials said they had no information about the matter, nor any comment to make on it, The Associated Press reported. The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry denied that any of the attackers came from Kyrgyzstan, The A. P. said. Since 2014, the Islamic State has been trying to mount attacks in the West through a unit described in intelligence documents as the group’s external operations branch, headed by the militant group’s spokesman, Abu Muhammad  . In the past two years, this branch has sent at least 20 operatives, trained in Syria and mostly French speakers, to Europe and Lebanon, possibly because they could fit in more and assume a more Western appearance, analysts said. But an enduring question was why the militant group chose not to send its   fighters on such missions. If the group did indeed send those fighters to Istanbul, then that could mean more trouble for Western counterterrorism officials. Through the years, Russia and the former Soviet states have provided a fertile recruiting ground for the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL, and militants from those regions have earned a fearsome reputation on the battlefield. Rebel fighters in Syria have reported that the best snipers and the members of a crack military unit, known as the Islamic State’s special forces, are Russian speakers who are often deployed as shock troops when the Islamic State is at risk of losing a strategic position. Senior Russian security officials have estimated that up to 7, 000 fighters from Russia and Central Asia have gone to Syria to fight, many of them joining the Islamic State. According to the International Crisis Group, up to 4, 000 volunteers from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan had joined the militant group by the end of 2015. The presence of large numbers of   fighters in Syria has been widely reported. According to one account, a French citizen, Reda Hame, who was arrested in Paris last August soon after returning from Syria, told interrogators with France’s domestic intelligence wing that he had been recruited by the external operations arm of the group and assigned to create mayhem at a rock concert in France. In the transcript of his interrogation, Mr. Hame describes how, after reaching Syria last summer, he was first housed inside a dormitory that had “a hundred people  —   Russians, Chechens, some Chinese, one American, some Indians. ” Russian jihadists did not begin to leave for Syria in significant numbers until 2014 when, in the time before the start of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, the security services in the nearby North Caucasus region made it clear that they would kill any militants they could find. Russia also actively pushed people to leave, according to human right activists, who noted that a few   militants held under house arrest suddenly turned up in recruitment videos from Syria. In Central Asian states like Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the recruitment of fighters for the Islamic State has been spurred by government repression against Muslim organizations as well as widespread poverty. Kadyr Malikov, a government adviser on Islamic affairs in Kyrgyzstan, said on Radio Free Europe last year that there was a special faction of Islamic State fighters that drew together recruits from Central Asia. It was called Mawarannahr, which he said was the Arabic term for Transoxiana, a region of Central Asia incorporating parts of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, he said. In Istanbul, the Turkish authorities began to provide a more detailed picture of how the attack unfolded. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yildirim, told reporters late on Wednesday that the bombers first tried to pass through metal detectors at the airport’s outer band of security but were turned back. He said they returned armed with “  rifles” they had been carrying in their suitcases, “and passed the security control by opening fire randomly at people. ” Two of the militants took advantage of the ensuing panic to gain entry to the terminal, where they detonated their explosives, Mr. Yildirim said, while the other waited outside the building and then blew himself up. A series of videos showed chaos as terrified passengers ran through the halls of the airport, amid scenes of blood, bodies and shattered glass. The bombings were the latest in a string of attacks across Turkey this year. Some have been attributed to the Islamic State and some to Kurdish insurgents, who last year ended a   and revived a bloody conflict in the country’s restive southeast. Turkish news media reported that the attackers had rented an apartment in the Fatih district, one of the most conservative in Istanbul, and neighbors had complained about a suspicious chemical smell coming from the building. At least one man left his passport at the rental property, according to the privately owned Dogan News Agency. The airport reopened on Wednesday morning with additional security measures in place.",0
1056,Turmeric is More Powerful Than 14 Artificial Drugs,"posted by Eddie A lot of research has been done on turmeric. And the benefits of its compound curcumin have been confirmed by numerous studies. This herb has been proven to have medicinal and therapeutic properties more powerful than artificial drugs. Here are 14 drugs that can be replaced with turmeric/ curcumin. 1. Prozac and Imipramine (Antidepressants) This study found that turmeric was as effective as Prozac and Imipramine at reducing depression in animals. 2. Aspirin (blood thinner) One study found that curcumin has the same anti-platelet effects as aspirin. And it can also help fight arthritis. 3. Metformin (diabetes drug) Turmeric can be helpful to pre-diabetics and diabetics. In fact, this study found that curcumin was up to 100,000 times more potent than metformin in increasing glucose uptake and suppressing glucose production in the liver. 4. Corticosteroids (steroids) Studies show that curcumin is as potent as corticosteroids which are used to treat lupus and asthma. You’re better off using turmeric because corticosteroids have side effects like increasing risk of infections and high blood sugar. 5. Lipitor (for cholesterol) Turmeric showed great results when compared to Lipitor, according to research . It can lower cholesterol, fight inflammation and reduce oxidative stress. 6. Oxaliplatin (chemotherapy medication) A study published by Journal of Cancer found that curcumin compared well with oxaliplatin as an antiproliferative agenet in colorectal cell lines. 7. Anti-inflammatory drugs Research shows that curcumin is more potent than drugs that fight inflammation including: Sulindac",0
1057,Facebook Caught Selling Targeted Advertisement Which Excludes Different Races,"Facebook Caught Selling Targeted Advertisement Which Excludes Different Races 
Andrew Anglin Daily Stormer October 29, 2016 ""This is massively illegal,"" said one lawyer when shown Facebook's ad targeting system allows excluision by race. https://t.co/bCn8fLT529 pic.twitter.com/i62jKP5b8W 
This is so, so funny. 
The top SJW kike himself, Mark Zuckerberg, has been caught using logical means to sell advertisements. 
But logic, we goyim have been told, is pure hatred. 
No idea why they thought they could get away with this. 
RT : 
A scandal is brewing over the discovery that advertisers on Facebook can ânarrowâ their audience by race and ethnicity, allowing them to remove their ads from the feeds of selected demographics, including African American, Asian and Hispanic. 
Micro-targeting, which assigns an ethnicity to users based on their page activity, is designed by Facebook to be used to target niche audiences, but it also allows for exclusion. Facebook claims advertisers are prohibited from abusing the tool, such as using it to discriminate. 
An ad purchased by ProPublica gave them the option to remove certain ethnic groups from viewing a housing ad. 
âThis is horrifying. This is massively illegal. This is about as blatant a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act as one can find,â civil rights lawyer John Relman told the publication. 
Facebook responded to ProPublicaâs report saying they believed, âmulticultural advertising should be a tool for empowerment,â adding that they expect advertisers to use the service in compliance with the law. 
âWhen World Cup 2014 became a big focus throughout the US Hispanic community, a business developed a campaign to reach people who had shown interest in that community in order to create a positive association between its brand and the worldâs most popular sport. This meant more relevant ads to those audiences about the World Cup,” the social media giant said, pointing out an example of micro-targeting being used successfully. 
Facebook also said that ads in different languages were another example of the feature being useful for its clients. 
It was a clever troll. 
I am in awe. 
I of course don’t think this should be illegal – it is absolutely nonsensical to make it illegal to prefer certain races over another in any context. Even if you believe “race doesn’t exist,” the fact remains that the different races statistically act very differently from each other, so very much can be determined about a person by knowing their race. 
But it is so funny to see the SJW Jew Zuckerberg caught in his own Jew web of nonsensical gibberish.",0
1058,Gatlinburg Residents Return Home to Wildfire Destruction - The New York Times,"GATLINBURG, Tenn.  —   The annual Fantasy of Lights Christmas Parade had been canceled  —   the wildfire saw to that  —   and the procession that replaced it Friday was long and grim. The residents of Gatlinburg sat idling in their cars and trucks in the chill of a mountain morning, waiting to return to the little tourist city they had been forced to evacuate Monday night. For most of them, it would be the first time back since the fire in the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park roared through, whipped into a rage by an uncommonly strong wind. Now, four days later, government crews were still up on the winding streets looking for survivors and bodies. The authorities said that nearly 1, 000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed in Sevier County, which includes Gatlinburg, a city of about 4, 000. Thirteen people were confirmed dead. Nellie Gauvreau, 47, was behind the wheel of an old Dodge van, smoking. She had already heard that her home had burned down, but she wanted to see it for herself. Her friend Sherry Angel, 44, was in the passenger seat. Ms. Angel had heard that her aunt had died in the blaze, though other family members said Friday that the woman was only missing. The line of cars crept toward town. “What happens now,” Ms. Gauvreau said, “is that we just pick up our pieces and move on. ” There were moments this week in Gatlinburg when crying seemed like the only reasonable response. The police chief choked back tears at a news conference. Katrina Bogle, 41, a worker at a Subway restaurant near the perimeter of the evacuation zone, cried Friday while assembling a sandwich. “This is incredible, what Jesus is doing, isn’t it?” she said. It was particularly painful that the fire, a disaster of a magnitude modern Gatlinburg has never seen, would come at the onset of the Christmas season. This dramatically beautiful pocket of Appalachian East Tennessee is a place of tiny country churches and a big, homegrown  —   and homespun  —   entertainment business, and Christmas is a crucial time for both. Dolly Parton’s Dollywood theme park is a few miles away in Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg’s gaudier sister city. Southern families flock to the area just before Christmas to shop at outlet malls and fill up the holiday attractions. In Gatlinburg, it is the   charm of the Fantasy of Lights parade. In Pigeon Forge, it is the live Nativity show at the   Dixie Stampede dinner theater and the special seasonal “Christmas Disaster” version of the comic Hatfield  McCoy Dinner Show. By Friday, the dawning scope of the economic damage had begun to mingle with the more pressing grief and shock. Rumors of the victims’ identities trickled through the emergency shelters the authorities had only publicly named five of them as of Friday afternoon. Survivors traded their stories of narrow escape through the smoke and racing flames Monday night. But many had also begun to wonder what they would do next. “If the tourists don’t come back, there’s no work,” Silvestre Trinidad, 25, a restaurant employee, said in Spanish as he waited around with a large group of men who shared similar stories at the Rocky Top Sports World, a big athletic complex that turned into the main shelter. The return procession to Gatlinburg Friday was only temporary: Residents, and even tourists, who had been forced to leave town at a moment’s notice, were given little time to assess, grab essentials and leave. The mayor of Sevier County, Larry Waters, said that the city would not be open to the public until Wednesday at the latest. A number of the burned buildings were vacation rentals. But a bigger worry was the international news of the disaster, and the fact that it was difficult to discern, from a distance, what had not been ruined. Mark Adams, the chief executive and president of the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce, posted a video on Facebook showing off the relatively unmolested main commercial strip. “Everything is here,” he said. “All the shops that you’re accustomed to seeing here. ” But some were hesitant to visit what they thought might be a disaster zone. The problem was even afflicting Pigeon Forge, which was largely unscathed. Kelly Johnson and her family operate a number of restaurants in the area. One of them, a Gatlinburg steak house, burned down. But she said that big parties  —   family reunions and rehearsal dinners  —   had been canceling at her Pigeon Forge business. “It did not burn the city to the ground,” she said. “And if people think that happened, we are in big, big trouble. ” David Fee, president of the company that owns the   Hatfield  McCoy Dinner Show, said the fire had cost the company at least $300, 000 in the past three days. That included some 2, 000 donated meals and lost ticket revenues, he said. “We’re not going to lay anybody off as long as we’re able,” he said. But, “a quarter of a million dollars in three days is nothing you can sustain for long. ” Ms. Parton announced Thursday that she would donate $1, 000 a month for up to six months to county residents who had lost their homes. A native of Sevier County, Ms. Parton has become one of the area’s most prominent benefactors, and the gesture burnished a reputation that needs no burnishing. At the shelter, Nancy Garner, 54, said Ms. Parton used to regularly to give her cash decades ago, when Ms. Garner was working as a housekeeper for minimum wage and trying to raise her children. Ms. Parton, she said, is distant kin. “She’s got a big heart, I’ll tell you that,” she said. Those close family and community ties remain in Sevier County, even as Dollywood has given the place a corporate makeover, and people were relying on them heavily this week. Ms. Gauvreau, a rental property manager, drove into town past   buildings next to perfectly fine ones: the fire, it seemed, had hopscotched around erratically. She teared up at the sight of her house. She looked for a cat but had no luck. Then she screwed up some courage and drove on through the   ghost town to survey the properties she is charged with overseeing. “My heart is not hurting because of me,” she had said earlier. “I’m hurting for the tenants of mine that I saw every day. ”",0
1059,10-Year-Old Girl Used as Human Bomb in Nigeria Attack,"A    girl used as suicide bomber detonated an explosive and killed herself in a New Year’s Eve attack in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Although no group or individual has said they are responsible for the attack, using women and little girls is consistent with the tactics of the   group Boko Haram. [The little girl blew herself up around 9:30 p. m. after she went into a market where people were gathered buying noodles from a food vendor. Only one person was seriously hurt but it was reported that the little girl “died instantly,” according to Yahoo News.  “The girl was clearly not more than 10 and this could have made her too nervous, making her to detonate the explosives prematurely,” the aid worker told Yahoo News. The news outlet reported that there was a second female suicide bomber which was “caught and lynched” by an angry mob. Security officials safely detonated the bomb. As reported by Breitbart News on December 12th, a suicide bomb attack, believed to be from Boko Haram, involved two girls who were   or    . The explosion killed one person and injured 17 others at a market in Maiduguri, Nigeria. “They got out of a rickshaw and walked right in front of me without showing the slightest sign of emotion,” said militia member Abdulkarim Jabo about the Boko Haram bombing, according to Sky News. Another bombing at a crowded market in Madagali, Nigeria, reported December 9th killed 30 to 45 people. Social media posts said female suicide bombers were to blame, as reported by UPI and Breitbart News. In February, Breitbart News reported that two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in an Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp in northeastern Nigeria. The attack in the city of Dikwa killed approximately 65 people and wounded 150. Authorities said that Boko Haram was responsible for the murders. Breitbart News reported in March that a young girl in Nigeria was found with bombs strapped to her body. The little girl, estimated to be between nine and 12 years old said she was one of the 300 girls kidnapped from Chibok, Nigeria, two years ago. Law enforcement officials confirmed that the young girl was lying. In May, the Nigerian military thwarted suicide bombings that planned to use four Boko Haram female suicide bombers. Soldiers disarmed and arrested two women, one of which was holding a baby. Approximately   worshippers at a mosque in northeastern Nigeria were killed in October 2015 by three female suicide bombers. They were also believed to have been sent by the terrorist group Boko Haram. Lana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

1061,Shock Berkeley Poll: California Voters Want Democrats to Work with Trump - Breitbart,"A new poll by the Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS) at UC Berkeley shows that a majority of registered voters in California want the state’s elected Democrats to work with President Donald Trump rather than to resist his agenda. [The poll reveals that “by a 53% to 47% margin, slightly more voters prefer that when state leaders disagree with the president they should try to work with him even if it means making compromises, rather than opposing him if it risks negative consequences and losses in federal funding. ”   Voters prefer that Democrats work with Trump even though 61% disapprove of the job he is doing, according to the poll, which surveyed 1, 000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3. 6%. In fact, the poll found that Trump has lower approval ratings than any U. S. president at this point in his presidency since the poll began, with President John F. Kennedy in 1961. In addition, the poll finds that Californians reject “CalExit” and proposals to secede from the Union by more than a    margin, 68% to 32%. Republicans (85% no, 15% yes) are more opposed than Democrats (56% no, 44% yes) to seceding. The poll also found that California voters approve of Trump’s policies on infrastructure, the economy and jobs  —   and disapprove of his policies on every other issue. Trump rated lowest on his policies on the environment, and on minority groups. Illegal immigration was a closer call, with 38% of California’s registered voters approving of his policies and 49% disapproving, as the state’s Democrats prepare for a showdown with Trump over the contentious issue of sanctuary cities.

[Business Insider reports that a lawsuit filed on January 8th in New York states claims Twitter has played “a uniquely essential role in the development of ISIS’s image, its success in recruiting members from around the world, and its ability to carry out attacks and intimidate its enemies. ” Attorneys for the families stated that Twitter has potentially violated the   Act and seek “compensatory damages in amounts to be determined at trial. ”  The suit alleges that Twitter has “continued to provide these resources and services to ISIS and its affiliates, refusing to actively identify ISIS Twitter accounts, and only reviewing accounts reported by other Twitter users. ” It further says, “Simply put, ISIS uses Twitter as a tool and a weapon of terrorism,” This is not the first time that Twitter has been accused of allowing terrorist organisations to use their platform as a means of communication and recruitment. The family of a    former Florida sheriff killed while providing police training in the Middle East sued Twitter in January 2016, claiming that the company “knowingly permitted” ISIS accounts to spread extremist propaganda.

1063,Philippines Leader Vows to Pardon Police Accused in Mayor’s Death - The New York Times,"MANILA  —   President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines suggested on Friday that 19 police officers accused of killing a politician should spare themselves a lengthy trial and plead guilty because he planned to pardon them anyway. “I can’t leave these officers behind. If they are convicted? No problem,” Mr. Duterte said. “They can call me and say they have been convicted, and I’ll tell the judge to pardon them all. ” He said the officers would be not only reinstated, but also promoted. Mr. Duterte’s comments were criticized by opposition leaders and human rights groups, who have accused him of abusing his powers in a monthslong crackdown on drug dealers and users that has left thousands of people dead. Leila de Lima, a senator and former rights commissioner who was jailed in February on what she says are   charges, said Mr. Duterte’s pledge to free the police officers was “extremely disturbing. ” “It’s crass impunity,” Ms. de Lima said in a statement smuggled out of jail. Senator Paolo Benigno Aquino, an opposition leader, said Mr. Duterte’s comments meant there were some “individuals and groups who are above the law. ” He added: “It would be better to let justice takes its course before issuing promises. ” The 19 officers were arrested after the November shooting death of Rolando Espinosa Sr. the mayor of Albuera, a town in the central Visayas region. Mr. Espinosa was killed in his jail cell after being arrested on a drugs charge in October. Mr. Duterte had accused him of being one of 150 local officials involved in the drug trade. The officers, led by Marvin Marcos, a police superintendent, have claimed that a gunfight broke out in the provincial jail after the mayor pulled a gun, which he had concealed in his cell, on the men who were there to serve a search warrant. Mr. Espinosa was the second politician on Mr. Duterte’s list killed by officers in less than two weeks. In October, another mayor, Samsudin Dimaukom, was gunned down by police officers after reportedly firing at them at a checkpoint. A Senate investigation into Mr. Espinosa’s death said both mayors had been killed under “suspicious circumstances. ” The Senate report said 19 officers were guilty of a “grave abuse of authority,” adding that Mr. Espinosa’s death appeared to be premeditated and carried out by people who wanted him silenced. Despite these findings, Mr. Duterte has stood by the officers and insisted that scores of mayors and village chiefs, including Mr. Espinosa, have profited from the drug trade. “Why do you grieve for the son of a bitch?” Mr. Duterte asked on Friday at an event commemorating Women’s Day at the presidential palace. “He destroyed half of the Visayas. How many have been left crazy and unattended, their family already gone? Then you grieve for this idiot who was killed inside his cell,” he said, adding an expletive. Mr. Duterte said it was well within his presidential powers to grant conditional or absolute pardons with agreement from Congress, which is controlled by a majority of his allies. The case highlights Mr. Duterte’s attempts to silence and kill not only criminals actively involved in the drugs trade, but also leaders who may oppose his policies and tactics.",0
1064,FDA Found Manipulating The Media In Favor Of Big Pharma,"Videos FDA Found Manipulating The Media In Favor Of Big Pharma An investigation revealed that the FDA uses a variety of tactics to prevent the full truth from being revealed about a certain product. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A new investigation revealed that the FDA is using a variety of tactics to sway public opinion about certain products (AP Photo). 
Although the Federal Drug Administration is thought to serve American consumers by keeping them safe and well-informed, they are doing just the opposite by controlling the media and science press in order to create misleading and one-sided articles. 
An investigation into documents released through the Freedom of Information Act by Scientific American revealed that the FDA uses a variety of tactics to prevent the full truth from being revealed about a certain product. The biggest tactic is the “close-hold embargo,” where they invite a select few news sites to a briefing about the to-be released information with conditions. They stipulate that the journalists have to surrender their reportorial independence by agreeing to only speak with sources approved by their agency. 
When NPR reporter Rob Stein was extended one of these loaded invitations, he responded by saying, “My editors are uncomfortable with the condition that we cannot seek reaction,” and asked that they be given a bit more wiggle room to speak with others. When Stein was met with a resounding no, he decided to agree to the terms and attend the briefing. 
Stein wasn’t the only reporter to attend this particular briefing, as other sites such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times were all present. Despite agreeing to the terms, not everyone is actually comfortable with these conditions. The New York Times former Public Editor, Margaret Sullivan, said: “I think embargoes that attempt to control sourcing are dangerous because they limit the role of the reporter whose job is to do a full look at a subject. It’s really inappropriate for a source to be telling a journalist whom he or she can and can’t talk to.” 
Other tactics used by the FDA include denying major media outlets any access to the briefing prior to the public release of information, and the deliverance of half-truths when asked questions directly to hinder an investigation. Those who intend to speak with unapproved sources or announce these embargoes are met with threats. 
These embargoes are often used within the science community, but none as strict as the FDA’s rules on whom reporters can confer with. The usual restrictions only focus on the date and time that a news story can be published about a particular study, which is why the stories tend to break at the same time across media outlets. The Association of Health Care Journalists said that the close-hold embargo is “a serious obstacle to good journalism. Reporters who want to be competitive on a story will essentially have to agree to write only what the FDA wants to tell the world, without analysis or outside commentary.” 
If the FDA was truly concerned about the well-being of American citizens, it wouldn’t be so shrouded in secrecy and insistent on the way news stories are covered. Instead, they put up their list of demands in an effort to protect the medical industry and pharmaceutical companies whose interests and profits matter more than having a well-informed public.

1065,US Government and the Clinton female: Come to the Psychiatrist's Couch,"  America is going nuts. Suggestions stupidly abound about how Russian hackers are even going so far as to read people's emails. Of course there is absolutely zero evidence of this. Russians are being blamed for everything from flooded toilets, biting dogs, the tornadoes in Kansas, the kid's messy diapers, the car won't start and grandpa lost his dentures. Media encouraged hysteria This hysteria is being encouraged by the media, and especially pretentious, arrogant dishonest politicians and every deviant failure in life. Even in the hottest days of the Cold War such insanity didn't exist. The most blatant example of this recently was Vice President Biden boldly blaming Russia for hacking emails and trying to influence the election, promising that the United States was preparing to send a message to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over their plan to launch cyberwarfare against Russia and the Russian government. Days before, American intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security declared that the Russian leadership was responsible for attacks on the Democratic National Committee and the leaking of stolen emails. Of course there was no truth to it ""We're sending a message,"" Mr. Biden told Chuck Todd, a talk show host. ""We have the capacity to do it."" ""He'll know it,"" Mr. Biden added. ""And it will be at the time of our choosing. And under the circumstances that have the greatest impact."" Later, after Mr. Biden said he was not concerned that Russia could ""fundamentally alter the election,"" Mr. Todd asked whether the American public would know if the message to Mr. Putin had been sent. ""Hope not,"" Mr. Biden responded. It was categorically proven that all of these crooked and dishonest politicians were just engaging in disinformation and war propaganda. From none other than the New York Times: ""Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails"" Video Do you think this is going to stop them? Do you think paranoid schizophrenic psychotic Hillary is going to stop going before Americans and telling them the Russians are doing this, that and the other thing? Hell would freeze over first. Repulsive Hillary was blaming Russians for all the problems she had caused with her corruption, her lies, her greed, her personal perversions and deviancies Hillary Clinton is a sociopath, she certainly does not feel the necessity to ever admit any of her distortions, lies and crimes. She's inherently dishonest, a sneak, a selfish person who has massive anger problems, who has hate names for all of her countrymen. She is a racist, she uses a woman card when there is no one more the antithesis of woman than her. As Pravda readers know, this failed female is responsible for the total catastrophe in the Middle East, from Iraq, to Libya especially (he, he, he we came, we saw, he died) and now Syria. Innocent Syria. Syria is a secular democracy in Middle East, well known for the diversity and tolerance of the society. No matter whether one is Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Christian ...people all consider themselves just Syrians. Divisions among the people are clearly a US/western INVENTION. Some great work has been done by: Vanessa Beeley and Tim Anderson Syrians are extremely righteous people who have always accepted, get this, ACCEPTED REFUGEES into their own country, protecting them from genocides and wars going on and now they are being attacked from without, from foreign terrorists sent there by the likes of Clinton and Obama... First ""Lady""? I wondered why ever since Clinton was first ""lady"" and I use the term lightly... Why was she so intent on bombing Christian Serbs, innocent Serbs, just defending themselves from the aforementioned mujahadeen that were first sent to Afghanistan (see video) and then transported to the heart of Europe causing the Balkan wars and the bombing of Yugoslavia by her husband, which she agitated for, to protect these terrorists. I hope most of our readers know that Bin Laden was an employee of the CIA and during the Balkan Wars, he was in possession of a Bosnian (Muslim area) passport. Yet this corrupt female rides herself that they decided to kill off their asset, Bin Laden. They are famous for killing off their assets....a warning to all considering entering such a position. Now with the revelations about Huma Abedin I understand that all this time Hillary Clinton is involved with Saudi Arabia, ISIS head choppers all various and sundry terrorists. See the report outlining this connection, heretofore hidden, secret, washed away. This is thanks to certain Washington insiders who probably don't like the idea of being wiped off planet Earth by a nuclear explosion being planned by neocons like the Clintons and Obama. Video During the debates, Clinton made her imperial declaration that she would impose a no fly zone on Syria even though no one invited the US there, nor did the US get UN permission while Russia does have the invitation and a directive from the UN. Her imperial declaration would mean World War 3. She accuses her opponent, Mr. Trump, of having ties to Russia yet Saudi Arabia provides 20 percent of campaign contributions to KKKlinton, who does their bidding. They also have given KKKlinton Foundation like 20 million, plus she was given half a million worth of jewels. How is Saudi Arabia not influencing US elections and no one dares speak of it and the connections to ISIS by all of them? Today's opinion makers haven't learned the lessons they should have from the Joseph McCarthy period of US history. The demonization of Russia and Putin makes McCarthy days seem like child's play when lives and reputations were ruined. In Hillary Clinton's world and in the US government's world, there is only free speech for themselves. All others not agreeing with their insipid, globalist, war hawk, neoliberal agenda are attacked viciously both in print and physically. International law is only brought up when terrorists are getting a major thrashing, then it's ""Oh no, ceasefire, ceasefire (another word for rearm, regroup, reinforce) oh human rights, oh killing innocent civilians, bombing hospitals...boo hoo hoo"". Of course they have been constantly doing this themselves ever since World War II. The occupation of Germany and Japan has never ended and nearly a thousand bases are maintained worldwide to maintain the empire. US military are not being used to ""defend their country"" but to defend corporations, lobbies, the military industrial complex. KKKlinton crime syndicate Obama, the KKKlinton crime syndicate, and the NWO globalists are seeking to depopulate the Earth by placing a demented paranoid psycho in power, someone connected to every filth known to man: terrorists, ISIS, Nazis, Wall Street, witches, bankers, rapists, child abusers, pharmaceuticals, GMO/Monsanto poisoning of the food, bombers spreading depleted uranium all over the planet causing cancers and birth defects with radioactive contamination for the next 4 billion years, the most feudal totalitarian anti-human dictatorships that chop off heads and other body parts, that give women no rights other than slavery, in fact someone connected to human trafficking. The US sends that failure of a UN ""ambassador"" Samantha Power to do a major job of projection (a sign of a major personality disorder) to blame Russia for committing the crimes that they themselves have committed. And you can rest assured that Russia does not ""do the same thing"" and commit war crimes, deliberately target civilians to ""break their backs"" and ""send them to the stone age."" These famous pronouncements can easily be found on the Internet. Russia does all it can to protect life, that's why Russian forces are in Syria. The psychos in Washington would have you believe that Russia is just there to protect Dr. Assad and his government. Washington consists of pathological liars. They claim that Dr. Assad is a brutal dictator killing his own people. This man is a trained physician who had planned to live his life as s doctor, but then was called upon to help his country. The truth is available to anyone on the Internet about what caused this terrorist attack on Syria, this is no civil war of a leader against his people. Those Syrians caught in this war flee to government areas for protection. During all of these ceasefires, the foreign backed terrorists continued to bomb and use chemical weapons on civilians in government areas. Never has Assad used chemical weapons and you can find the truth about this also. It all boils down to a failing empire, an empire in its final death throes, an empire gone INSANE. An endless stream of attacks on countries unable to defend themselves, regime change often of democratically elected leaders quite in violation of international law and subject to a war crimes tribunal much like that at Nuremberg: crimes against peace attacking civilians collective punishment And now their demon Hillary Clinton is seeking to finish the project of either ""full spectrum domination"" or take the world down with them. We, the free world community, have come to a conclusion and diagnosis of your mental condition, neocon criminals. Specifically, you have been judged as a danger to yourselves and others. Recommendations: indefinite confinement in a mental institution for the criminally insane. Anyone considering supporting Hillary Clinton should ask themselves these questions now knowing her connections to Saudi Arabia and ISIS/terrorists: Do you want to place a mentally ill psychotic lunatic in the White House and continue the insane policies of the neocons i.e. Clinton? Do you want to see family members thrown in a pit and shot to death ISIS style? Do you want to see family members knelt on the ground and their heads chopped off ISIS style, or maybe their hearts or organs cut to pieces? Donald Trump is a breath of fresh air to all citizens of the world who long for peace; long for attacks against defenseless countries to stop; for people to be treated equally and have jobs and security, health care and a future free from terrorism. It's not dangerous or anti-American to want to have good relations with Russia. Russia is a peaceful, democratic Christian country...not some monster bent on an empire such as Clinton and the neocons have promoted for the globalist takeover of all the peoples of the Earth. Let's not let planet Earth become a barren lifeless planet or a horror worse than Nazi Germany where no one is safe from being attacked by terrorists. The choice is clear, war with Clinton or peace and prosperity, a return to traditional values with Donald Trump and terrorists burning in hell where they belong.",0
1066,Jay H. Lehr: The Beginning of the End of EPA,"At the Republican National Convention last summer, the GOP approved a platform that stated: “We propose to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science. ” It also says “We will likewise forbid the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide, something never envisioned when Congress passed the Clean Air Act. ”[The GOP followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who in a March debate said he would abolish EPA, and in a May speech in North Dakota condemned “the Environmental Protection Agency’s use of totalitarian tactics” that has “denied millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet. This is your treasure, and you  —   the American People  —   are entitled to share in the riches. ”  Trump and the GOP are saying, finally, what millions of people have been thinking for a long time: EPA has become the cause of, not the solution to, the nation’s major environmental problems. It’s time to end EPA. A Promising Beginning, In the late 1960s, the United States faced real problems regarding the quality of its air and water, waste disposal, and contamination from mining and agriculture. Pollution crossed borders  —   the borders between private property as well as between cities, states, and nations  —   and traditional remedies based on private property rights didn’t seem to be working. The public was overly complacent about the possible threat to their safety. Many scientists, myself included, lobbied the federal government to form a   agency to address these problems. [1] In 1971, EPA was born. During the agency’s first 10 years, Congress passed seven legislative acts to protect the environment, including the Water Pollution Control Act (later renamed the Clean Water Act) Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Clean Air Act. At first, these laws worked well, protecting the environment and the health of our citizens. Problems were identified, measured, exposed, and major investments were made to reduce dangerous emissions and protect the public from exposure to them. EPA and other government agencies regularly report the subsequent dramatic reduction in all the pollutants we originally targeted. By the 1980s, nothing more needed to be done beyond monitoring our continuing success in cleaning up the environment. It was time to declare victory and go home. EPA Is Now an Obstacle, Beginning around 1981, however, radical Leftists realized they could advance their political agenda by taking over the environmental movement and use it to advocate for   draconian regulations on businesses. Environmentalists allowed this   to occur because it brought massive funding from liberal foundations, political power, and prestige. [2] Politicians realized they could win votes by pandering to the environmental movement, repeating their   claims, and posing as protectors of nature and the public health. The wind, solar, and ethanol industries saw they could use regulations to handicap competitors or help themselves to public subsidies. Today, EPA is a captive of activist and   groups. Its regulations have nothing to do with protecting the environment. Its rules account for nearly half of the $2 trillion annual cost of complying with all national regulations in the United States. In 2008, The Heritage Foundation estimated the costs of EPA’s first proposal to regulate greenhouse gases in the name of fighting global warming were “close to $7 trillion and three million manufacturing jobs lost. ” According to Heritage, “the sweep of regulations   …     could severely affect nearly every major   product from cars to lawnmowers, and a million or more businesses and buildings of all types. And all of this sacrifice is in order to make, at best, a minuscule contribution to an overstated environmental threat. ” President Barack Obama has routinely used EPA to circumvent Congress to impose severe regulations on farmers, ranchers, other private landowners, fisheries, and the energy sector. Just last week, the agency rushed through approval of new fuel efficiency standards for automobiles more than a year ahead of schedule to thwart any attempts by the Trump administration to stop it. Courts and Congress have objected to and tried to limit EPA’s abuses, but without noticeable success. Once a genuine success story, EPA has become the biggest obstacle to further environmental progress. Replacing EPA, The solution is to return this authority to the states, replacing EPA with a Committee of the Whole of the 50 state environmental protection agencies. State EPAs already have primary responsibility for the implementation of the nation’s environmental laws and EPA regulations. With more than 30 years of experience, these state agencies are ready to take over management of the nation’s environment. Accountable to 50 governors and state legislatures, state EPAs are more attuned to   needs and  . Located in 50 state capitols, they are less vulnerable to the Left’s massive beltway lobbying machine. The Committee would be made up of representatives from each state. EPA could be phased out over five years, which could include a   preparation period followed by a   program in which 25 percent of the agency’s activities would be passed to the Committee each year.   percent of EPA’s budget could be eliminated and most of the remainder would pay for national research labs. A small administrative structure would allow the states to refine existing environmental laws in a manner more suitable to protecting our environment without thwarting the development of our natural resources and energy supplies. Benefits of Replacing EPA, The federal budget for environmental protection could be reduced from $8. 6 billion to $2 billion or less. Staffing could be reduced from more than 15, 000 to 300. The real savings, of course, would be in reduction of the $1 trillion in annual regulatory costs EPA imposes each year. This reform would produce a second huge benefit by ending the government’s war on affordable energy. EPA is the principal funder and advocate of global warming alarmism, the myth that   climate change is a crisis. That movement would end on the day EPA’s doors shut, allowing Congress to return to taxpayers and consumers a “peace dividend” amount to some of the $4 billion a day currently spent   on climate change. Dismantling EPA is one part of a comprehensive set of reforms, many of them discussed by Trump and referred to in the GOP platform, to lighten the massive weight of government regulations on the American people. The nation needs a     and   agenda that recognizes the tremendous value of the natural resources under our feet. While the rest of the world stumbles blindly in the grip of an   and   ideology, the U. S. can march ahead and regain its place as the world’s economic and technological leader. The nation’s environment is in terrific shape, thanks to early efforts by EPA and more recent efforts by state governments and businesses. The nation’s economy and environment will be even better if the federal government gets out of the way. EPA has long outlived its usefulness. Let’s return its powers to the states, where they belong.

1069,U.N. Envoy Says U.S. Still Backs Palestinian State - The New York Times,"UNITED NATIONS  —     hours after President Trump swatted away at a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, his United Nations envoy sought to assure the world on Thursday that his administration supports Palestinian statehood but wants a “thinking out of the box” approach. “We absolutely support a   solution,” the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the   conflict. “But we are thinking out of the box as well, which is  —   what does it take to bring these two sides to the table, what do we need to have them agree on?” she said. She said nothing about what that approach would be, nor did she go any further in revealing a coherent picture of United States policy on the conflict, one of the most intractable in the world. The day before, Mr. Trump hinted at a new regional effort aimed at bringing the two sides together, but he said he would not insist on the creation of a Palestinian state. “I’m looking at   and ” he said. “I like the one that both parties like. ” Both Ms. Haley’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks were in sharp contrast with warnings from other diplomats, including the United Nations envoy entrusted to help the two sides find a path out of their long, bitter conflict. “The   solution remains the only way to achieve the legitimate national aspirations of both peoples,” the envoy, Nickolay E. Mladenov, told the Security Council earlier in the day. “Israel can take the necessary step to stop settlement expansion and construction in order to preserve this prospect, while the Palestinian leadership can demonstrate their commitment to tackling the challenges of violence and incitement on their side,” Mr. Mladenov said. Speaking in Egypt the day before, Mr. Mladenov’s boss, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said, “There is no Plan B to the situation between Palestinians and Israelis but a   solution. ” The Swedish ambassador, Olof Skoog, told reporters on his way into the Security Council meeting on Thursday, “It’s very dangerous to move away from the   solution idea, especially before you have something viable as an alternative. ” France’s ambassador, François Delattre, said the risks were too high. “Should the prospect of a   solution disappear as a mirage in the desert, then that would be an open door to more extremism and more terrorism,” he said. Ms. Haley, who has been on the job for less than a month, used her remarks to the news media mostly to harshly criticize the United Nations as a whole for what she called its “  bias. ” Palestinians have accused the Trump administration of the opposite. The United States objected last Friday to the appointment of a former Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, as the secretary general’s envoy to Libya. The Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said on Thursday that Mr. Fayyad had been rejected “simply because he was a Palestinian. ” Ms. Haley also suggested that it was unnecessary and counterproductive for the United Nations Security Council to hold monthly meetings on the   conflict  —   or in her words, “obsess over Israel. ” In fact, the Council has three meetings on Syria every month, one on Yemen as well as regular briefings on every United Nations mission, from Afghanistan to South Sudan, plus briefings on the impact of Security Council sanctions on countries such as North Korea and Iran.",0
1070,How Trump Happened,"How the #NeverTrumpers sunk themselves. November 1, 2016 
Bruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center. 
The chorus of NeverTrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and Hillary’s supposed victory approach. After more than a year of complaining about Trump crashing their political soiree, the Republicans attacking Trump still don’t seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are out-of-touch elites disdainful of the Republican masses. 
A recent example comes from premier NeverTrumper Bret Stephens of the Wall Street Journal . In his column Stephens bids farewell to a Republican Party stupid enough to nominate Trump, contrasting it with his imagined Golden Age of Republican policy excellence that Trump and his followers have destroyed. One policy in particular, immigration, reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make Trump the nominee: 
At a 1980 Republican primary debate in Houston, candidates George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free. Mr. Bush said they should. “We’re creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law,” he lamented. 
Reagan agreed. Instead of “putting up a fence,” he asked, “why don’t we . . . make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit, and then, while they’re working and earning here, they pay taxes here.” For good measure, Reagan suggested we should “open the border both ways.” 
Where, in the populist fervor to build a wall with Mexico and deport millions of human beings, is that Republican Party today? 
Take Bush senior’s statement first. It repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan Gang of Eight recycled in 2013 during their push for Comprehensive Immigration Reform, another euphemism for amnesty. All those hard-working, family-values illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives, we were told, who just need legal status and social recognition so they can “come out of the shadows,” as John McCain said, and start voting Republican. The political apple doesn’t fall far from the tree: son Jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an “act of love.” 
This stance on illegal immigration by Republican politicos and pundits is obviously light-years from the experience and position of many ordinary people. Take McCain’s oft-repeated trope of “living in the shadows.” Seriously? Illegal alien young people openly protest on live television, knowing they are not going to be deported. Millions visit emergency rooms for free, and wrangle food stamps, welfare transfers, school lunches, and all sorts of largess, all the while they live protected by “sanctuary cities.” And “living in the shadows” doesn’t deter them from committing felonies, given that even if caught, convicted, and deported, they’ll soon be back. Remember Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, the illegal alien deported five times, who murdered Kate Steinle? Or Angel Gilberto Garcia-Avalos, another five-time deportee who just this month started a $61 million fire in Sequoia National Park? He had just been released from the Kern County Jail, but could not be deported because of California’s lunatic sanctuary city law, which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents. 
Simply repeating the “hard-working, family values, religious” mantra doesn’t address the problems of illegal immigration. There are such illegal immigrants, as I know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country. I grew up with Mexican-Americans, they’re members of my immediate family, they’re my friends, students, and colleagues. They’re also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border. 
Some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants, but many do not. A rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff. But Bush, McCain, and Stephens have not proposed a workable, rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go. That means with any form of amnesty, citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately, with only the most egregious felons sifted out, if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to “live in the shadows.” But all those guilty of DUIs, hit-and-runs, or defrauding the welfare system with fake IDs will stay––and then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act, which enshrined “family reunification,” with no limits on relatives of U.S. citizens. 
Equally tone-deaf is Stephens’s bringing up Ronald Reagan’s “open the border both ways.” That’s exactly what he did in 1986 when he signed the Simpson-Mazzoli Act, which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, with promises of “border enforcement” that never materialized. Stephens doesn’t mention that as a result, the number of illegal immigrants increased from about 3 million to 11 million, creating today’s crisis. The obvious lesson is secure the border first, then figure out what to do with the 11 million. It would be governmental malfeasance to repeat Reagan’s mistake. 
The problem with politicians and pundits like Stephens is they don’t live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores. People like Stephens don’t live daily with the disorder and crime that results. They’re not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life, the illegal immigration version of “broken windows,” such as dogs without rabies shots running free, health and safety codes ignored, building codes shrugged off, garbage and refuse dumped everywhere, copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights, and chronic petty theft––and that’s on top of stolen cars, hit-and-runs, driving without insurance, gang-banging, and dealing drugs. 
And if Mr. Stephens thinks I’m just a nativist or xenophobe or racist, I dare him to visit the San Joaquin Valley. Better yet, let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month. Come and tour a hospital emergency room, a Social Security disability office, a public school, a county jail, and then wax lyrical about these “honorable, decent, family-loving people.” It would take just a week for Mr. Stephens to develop a “fervor” for a five-foot high wall around his house, and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun. Then again, he wouldn’t last that long. Within a day he’d scurry back to his nice, white, secure tony neighborhood where he doesn’t have to pay the cost of his moral preening. 
And that hypocrisy is where Trump came from. In the perception of millions of voters––perceptions NeverTrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like reality––the conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their party’s voters. And so they would rather see a venal, perjurious, corrupt mediocrity become Obama 2.0 and continue the progressive destruction of the Constitutional order, than see elected the nominee of their own party. What sort of “principle” is that?",0
1071,Japan Vote Strengthens Shinzo Abe’s Goal to Change Constitution - The New York Times,"TOKYO  —   Voters helped Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan move closer on Sunday to securing the lawmaker support he needs to revise a pacifist Constitution that has been in place since American occupiers created it in 1947. An official count on Monday morning showed the governing coalition and its allies had captured   of the seats in the upper house of Parliament, the amount required to proceed with the constitutional revision. Despite a weak economy and divided public opinion on the expanded role for Japan’s military that Mr. Abe is seeking, his Liberal Democrats and their allies again won a commanding majority in the upper house. “This is the people’s voice letting us firmly move forward,” Mr. Abe said. When asked whether he would proceed with a revision of the Constitution, he said it had long been the Liberal Democrats’ goal. Whether Mr. Abe will be able to pursue that ambition  —   to overturn the constitutional clause that calls for the complete renunciation of war  —   remains to be seen. While the partners in the governing coalition have indicated some support for amendments, different groups have divided opinions on which clauses they want to change. Still, the election outcome is sure to give Mr. Abe more leverage. The results in Japan were achieved without the fiery populist emotions that have fueled the United States presidential race or the recent British vote to leave the European Union. Instead, the Japanese election seemed to reflect resignation with the status quo rather than a broad mandate. Voters see few alternatives, with many still feeling stung by what they saw as the opposition Democratic Party’s failure to deliver during its   term before Mr. Abe came to power in 2012. “I think people are unhappy, but they don’t really see that voting is going to make things different,” said Jeff Kingston, the director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo. For Mr. Abe, he said, “the ace up his sleeve is the opposition. ” Professor Kingston added: “There is not an alternative. This is as lukewarm a sense of support as you get. ” As in previous elections, voter turnout was low. The Ministry of Internal Affairs put it at just under 55 percent, only slightly higher than results three years ago in the last upper house election. During the campaign this summer, Mr. Abe and other Liberal Democrats kept mostly quiet about their revisionist ambitions, which led opposition party leaders and some news media critics to accuse them of a hidden agenda. Mr. Abe focused mainly on economic policy  —   known as Abenomics  —   and other less contentious issues, like his promise to expand child care and nursing home slots. Although polls have shown that few Japanese believe the economy is thriving, Mr. Abe spoke with pride of growth in employment, without mentioning that the rise had been mostly in   or contract jobs. “Abenomics is not failing,” Mr. Abe told a crowd of more than 1, 000 at his final campaign stop on Saturday evening in Tokyo. “The only choice is to go forward. ” Loyalty to the Liberal Democratic Party runs deep, a product of habit and history as much as support for its policies. Junko Kaneda, 84, who walked by herself through sweltering heat on Sunday to vote at a polling station in Nakano, a neighborhood in western Tokyo, recalled hiding in bomb shelters during World War II air raids. She said she was concerned about the Abe administration’s moves to revise the Constitution and expand Japan’s military powers. “But in the end,” she said, “I think all we can rely on is the L. D. P. ” The public remains split over constitutional revision. According to exit polls by NHK, about a third of voters said they supported some amendments, while another third said they saw no need to revise the governing document. Previous news media surveys showed even less support for constitutional revision. Although the governing coalition achieved the   threshold in Parliament, it is not clear how quickly it could move to change the Constitution. The Liberal Democrats have also proposed amendments that could limit free speech deemed dangerous to the public interest and expand emergency powers for the prime minister. The Liberal Democrats will have to work with their coalition partners to gain consensus on which parts of the governing document to change. Any amendments must also be approved by a majority in a nationwide referendum. “We are talking about a tremendously complicated and contentious political process,” said Tobias Harris, a Japan analyst at Teneo Intelligence, a New York political risk consultancy. “The idea that Abe is just going to be able to get whatever he wants is just not the reality. ” Analysts said the governing coalition was unlikely to start with its most controversial proposal, which would revise the constitutional clause renouncing all war. Last year, when Mr. Abe pushed through legislation giving the military limited powers to fight in foreign conflicts for the first time since World War II, the move set off enormous protests. Some analysts said they were concerned that if the governing coalition obtained the   threshold, it could find a way to sway public opinion in a referendum. “We have all seen what happened with ‘Brexit,’” said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, referring to the British vote to leave the European Union. “The results can be unpredictable. ” Professor Nakano noted that Mr. Abe’s administration had sought to quiet critical news media coverage and that, most recently, the party had invited students, parents and educators to file online reports of incidents in which they believed a teacher had violated “political neutrality. ” “I cannot be as naïve as to think that there will be free debate in a   to a national referendum,” Professor Nakano said. Other voters were ambivalent. “For revision of the Constitution, I don’t know what we should do,” said Ryuichi Okabayashi, 47, who voted for candidates from opposition parties at an elementary school polling station in Sagamihara, a suburban town southwest of Tokyo. “To be honest, I don’t want to send children to war. But I worry: What if Japan is attacked by China or North Korea? Japan needs military power in such cases. ” Several analysts said Mr. Abe might start with more technical amendments, like one that would change the votes needed to amend the Constitution. “By changing any part of the Constitution, he wants to leave his name in history,” said Ryosuke Nishida, an associate professor of public policy at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Japanese voters who selected opposition candidates on Sunday did so less out of passion than of protest. “I didn’t vote for positive reasons,” said Miu Okada, 30, an office worker in Nakano who said she simply chose a candidate who was not a member of the Liberal Democratic Party or its allies. Sunday’s election was also the first time that   and    had been allowed to vote. Yet many seemed apathetic about their new rights. Minori Hosaka, 18, a computer engineering major at Tokai University walking with a friend in the Akihabara district of Tokyo on the eve of the election, said he was not voting because he had not had time to move his residency from his hometown to Tokyo. Besides, he said, “I am not sure my own single vote can affect anything. ”",0
1072,JUST IN: Trump Camp Caught On Cam Bragging Of “Voter Suppression” Against Women & Blacks (VIDEO),"Comments 
Consultant Jesse Benton of the pro-Trump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting African-Americans and women. 
“In Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels … we can turn her to regular turnout levels she’s gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area – that’s dead heat. So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away.” 
Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. 
The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them – the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations – of “rigging” the election against them. But time and time again it’s been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter – especially non-white, male voters . 
Since the Republicans can’t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters – especially minorities – from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. 
They justify this in an underhanded appeal to “protecting the integrity” of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of “voter fraud” over the nation’s head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box.

1074,Chelsea Manning Asks Obama to Cut Sentence to Time Served - The New York Times,"Chelsea Manning, who confessed to disclosing archives of secret diplomatic and military documents to WikiLeaks in 2010 and has been incarcerated longer than any other convicted leaker in American history, has formally petitioned President Obama to reduce the remainder of her   sentence to the more than six years she has already served. In a statement accompanying her petition, a copy of which her lawyer provided to The New York Times, Ms. Manning again said she took “full and complete responsibility” for her actions, which she called “wrong. ” She also described her difficult life, including the turmoil she faced at the time of her leaks as she came to grips with gender dysphoria while deployed to Iraq, her treatment in prison, and her multiple suicide attempts. “I am not asking for a pardon of my conviction,” she wrote. “I understand that the various collateral consequences of the   conviction will stay on my record forever. The sole relief I am asking for is to be released from military prison after serving six years of confinement as a person who did not intend to harm the interests of the United States or harm any service members. ” Ms. Manning’s petition was accompanied by letters of support from Daniel Ellsberg, who is famous for leaking a classified history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers Morris Davis, a former military commissions chief prosecutor and Glenn Greenwald, a legal commentator and journalist who has been an outspoken supporter. While military prosecutors portrayed Ms. Manning  —   formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning  —   as a traitor, many   advocates consider her a   and a hero. In interviews, both Mr. Davis and Mr. Ellsberg said they hoped that Mr. Obama would give special consideration to her request in light of the election of Donald J. Trump, suggesting that the   would be less likely to give her favorable consideration. “I believe now, in the six and a half weeks we have remaining, we all have to ask President Obama to do with his powers good things before he leaves, before a new president comes in, and I really believe that he should commute Chelsea Manning’s sentence to time served,” Mr. Ellsberg said. A member of Ms. Manning’s volunteer support network said that a formal announcement and publicity campaign were scheduled for Monday. Several celebrities, including Michael Stipe of R. E. M. and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, are coordinating efforts aimed at building public support for Ms. Manning’s release. Both have previously made videos in support of her. While working as an intelligence analyst in a secure information facility at a forward operating base in Iraq, Ms. Manning copied and later sent to WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of incident logs from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a   diplomatic cables from American embassies around the world, dossiers about Guantánamo detainees, and a video showing an American helicopter strike on a group of people in Baghdad in which two Reuters journalists were killed. WikiLeaks later made the documents public, working with various traditional news media organizations, including The New York Times. After her arrest, Ms. Manning was tried by a   where she confessed to the leaks and pleaded guilty to a lesser version of the charges against her without any plea deal to cap her sentence. Military prosecutors pressed forward with the trial and convicted her of most of the more serious versions of the charges, including multiple counts under the Espionage Act, a World War   law that makes it a crime to disclose potentially harmful military secrets to someone not authorized to receive them. The law applies even if the defendant’s motivation was to inform the American public, rather than to help a foreign adversary. A military judge imposed a prison sentence of 35 years, dramatically longer than the sentences other accused leakers have received. While only a few leakers have been successfully prosecuted under the Espionage Act  —   the first such conviction came in 1985  —   most of those convicted have received sentences of between about one year and three and a half years. In some leak cases, Espionage Act charges were dropped as part of plea deals. John Kiriakou, a former C. I. A. official who was accused of discussing with journalists the identities of fellow intelligence officials involved in interrogating terrorism suspects, was initially charged under the Espionage Act, but those charges were dropped as part of a plea deal in which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. Mr. Kiriakou, who has finished serving his sentence, has applied for a pardon, the Justice Department said. Still, Ms. Manning is different from him and most other accused leakers because she disclosed a large volume of documents covering many topics, rather than one or two particular secrets. In that sense, her case more closely resembles that of Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who came forward in June 2013 as the source of a leaked archive of classified documents about surveillance. Mr. Snowden has also been charged under the Espionage Act, but he is living as a fugitive in Russia. In September, a group of Mr. Snowden’s supporters asked Mr. Obama to pardon him, although the White House has already ruled that out. Ms. Manning had petitioned for a full pardon three years ago, shortly after she was convicted and announced that she was transgender and was changing her name. She wrote in her statement that she now understood that her request had been premature and that “the relief requested was too much. ”",0
1075,Red Sox Broadcaster Jerry Remy Thinks Foreign Players Shouldn’t Use Translators,"Tuesday turned out to be quite the day for the English language. [First, Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Mike Schmidt said that Philadelphia’s Odubel Herrera’s “language barrier” prevented him from becoming a player that the Phillies could build around. Then, Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy got in on the act.  During the middle innings of Tuesday night’s game between the Yankees and the Red Sox, Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka had a meeting on the mound with Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild, and Tanaka’s translator. Tanaka, who hails from Japan, needs the translator because he doesn’t speak English. Shortly after Tanaka’s translator walked off the mound, Remy   on the subject of foreign players using translators. Remy said, “I don’t think that should be legal. I really don’t. ” “What is it you don’t like about that?” asked Red Sox    announcer Dave O’Brien. “Learn baseball language,” Remy said. “It’s pretty simple. You break it down pretty easy between pitching coach and pitcher after a long period of time. ” It’s unknown if Remy made these comments because of Schmidt’s earlier remarks. It’s impossible to imagine that Remy wasn’t aware of them. Either way, this seems like a perfectly stupid thing to say. Who cares whether or not the guy uses a translator? “Learn baseball language?” If signs, and a couple carefully selected words were all that was needed to communicate with a pitcher, then managers and pitching coaches would never go to the mound, and would just give signals from the dugout. By definition, if the team ventures out to the mound, unless they’re just stalling for time, it means something needed to be said which required actual conversation. If the player and the coach don’t speak the same language, that’s a problem. Masahiro Tanaka isn’t some refugee, or illegal alien attempting to make America become more like Japan. He’s a baseball player, being paid $155 million dollars to win baseball games. Something he hasn’t done a whole lot of this year. That’s a bigger problem. One obvious enough that it doesn’t require a translator. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
1076,Shi’ite Militias Join Iraq’s Mosul Attack,"Militia Fighters to Advance on Areas West of City by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
After a week and a half of assuring everyone that their role in the invasion of Mosul would be very limited, and removed from the Sunni population, Iraq’s Shi’ite militias have been announced to have launched an offensive west of Mosul, advancing on Tal Afar . 
According to officials, the main goal of this offensive is to cut the city of Mosul off from ISIS territory in Syria, preventing the ISIS fighters within the city from fleeing west if the battle begins to turn sour. The offensive is said to start “within a few days or hours.” 
The involvement of Shi’ite militias in the “liberation” of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. 
An effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the militias’ involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. 
Civilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the militias’ presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing “with” ISIS.

1077,"Escapism Reigns in Super Bowl Commercials, but Politics Proves Inescapable - The New York Times","While many Super Bowl advertisers chose to be silly or sentimental with their commercials on Sunday, it was the few that ventured  —   or appeared to venture  —   into political territory that attracted the most attention. Among the major brands that used their commercial time for social commentary was Airbnb, which had decided just last week to run an ad. In the ad, the company promoted its view of an open, multicultural world, reflecting its commitment to housing refugees.   revived an ad it ran during the 2014 Super Bowl featuring people singing a multilingual version of “America the Beautiful. ” It managed to strike a new chord with viewers, given the recent national conversation around immigration and diversity, and it prompted a flood of conversation on Twitter. “I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it,” said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York. It was a smart move from the brand to   an old message, she added, given that “you can’t say it’s a reactionary thing. ” In an interview before halftime during the game, Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA’’Chiat’’Day New York, said, “If there’s anything that’s screaming out here, it’s diversity. ” He added: “People are saying, ‘Is this trolling Trump?’ I don’t think it’s trolling. It’s a big smack in the face of ‘dude, this is America. ’” Still, for the most part, overtly political statements were few and far between  —   by design. A   advertiser, 84 Lumber, had its initial proposal for a commercial rejected by Fox last month for being “too controversial” because it showed a   mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico. The company edited its spot to remove the wall and directed users to see the end of its commercial online. Budweiser spent days telling the news media that its ad was not a response to President Trump’s recent immigration crackdown. The company’s commercial featured the journey of one of its founders to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and the discrimination he overcame on his way to success. The hashtag #BoycottBudweiser trended on Twitter early on Sunday evening, apparently started by people who disliked the ad. But it was then used by others to defend Budweiser and mock the people who were boycotting the ad. Carl Marci, chief neuroscientist at Nielsen, the TV ratings company, said, “If you make people think too much or get too serious during a game where people are really looking to be entertained, you’re taking a risk. ” That risk can pay off, though. Audi’s ad went viral before the game, having passed five million views on YouTube as of Friday. It was narrated by a father asking pointed questions about what to tell his young daughter one day as she competed in a cart race, such as, “Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?” As she won the race, he reflected that perhaps he would be able to “tell her something different. ” The commercial ended with text including a line saying that Audi of America is “committed to equal pay for equal work. ” But escapism and sentimentality were the strategy for many advertisers as brands tried to provide an antidote to the weighty issues facing the country this year. Mr. Clean was unexpectedly portrayed as something of a sex symbol. Michelob Ultra used the theme song from “Cheers” in its ad, which presented the label as a   beer. Justin Bieber showed off his dance moves for   while Avocados From Mexico jokingly used subliminal messaging to urge more avocado consumption. “Very often on the Super Bowl, we see emotional advertising, or we see   advertising,” said Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. He added, “All the controversy in the country is making advertisers nervous about addressing big, significant issues, and in a polarizing time, it is safest to stick to the product and stick to lighthearted humor. ” Advertisers were willing to pay, on average, about $5 million for   spots during the Super Bowl this year  —   or around $167, 000 per second  —   and even more in promotional costs to reach the game’s more than 100 million viewers. Many released the full ads or teasers online before Sunday while brands such as Snickers and Hyundai went the opposite route, producing their commercials during the game itself, which aired on Fox. Some were not impressed by the bulk of the ads that aired on Sunday, particularly given the rising cost of the commercials. “Comedy, celebrities and anthropomorphic creatures seem to be the   schtick,” said Andrew Essex, the chief executive of Tribeca Enterprises and a former C. E. O. of the creative agency Droga5. “After 50 years, half a century, it’s all feeling a little formulaic,” he added. “I find myself, as someone who’s not doing this anymore, wondering if this is the single greatest act of economic immolation on the planet. ” Others felt that the ads delivered. “People want to see lighthearted things in the Super Bowl, especially at a time when there are so many big issues in the country,” Mr. Calkins said.",0

Part 1 – The Russian navy modernisation program 
“I would like to emphasize that we have commissioned 42 warships in the past three years, from 2013 to 2016. From 2016 to 2018 we are planning to commission more than 50 warships, ” Russian naval CINC, Admiral Vladimir Korolyov said . Read more 
With only an estimated 48% of the Russian military has been modernised so far, it is certain that the Russian Navy is lagging behind. An interview with retired Deputy CINC Admiral Vasilyev provides more details on the scope of modernisation in all the regions of Russia, especially in the Arctic. RIA Novosti in Russian , in English 
It is good to see that the Navy is getting its lion share at last. Despite some highly visible setbacks, (notably with the French pulling out from the Mistral class contract in 2014), this modernisation program truly heralds in a new era for the navy, on a scale not seen since the time of the Soviet Union, more than 35 years ago. Here’s a prime example of the latest type of warship to enter into service: the – “ Admiral Grigorovich ” LINK 
The Russian Navy is focusing on new ships as part of the backbone of its green-water capabilities, while at the same time older Soviet era ships also get modernised & upgraded, the latest being the Marshal Ustinov , part of the Northern Fleet. Maintaining & deploying some of the older ships & as well as refitting such ships, underpins the blue-water naval component.

Part 2 – The Syrian operations 
“ Today the main thing — to increase the level of training of all categories of personnel in combat conditions at sea. And combat duty at sea is the best school and the best Academy for a sailor of any level and rank. ” Admiral (Rtd) Ivan Vasiliev. 
The Dutch submarine and the Kuznetsov fleet 
There is more to last week’s Dutch submarine incident than meets the eye, but I just can’t put my finger on what. Whatever happened officially, it was a very serious incident indeed. Routine tracking/surveillance missions by submarines don’t usually end up in the news. Unless the Russian MOD publicised this event to make a clear point to NATO, about its ability to detect & track NATO submarines. 
More here 
In spite of all of the disparaging memes about its smoke & breaking down, as officially reported on Russian TV on Saturday, the Kuznetsov’s air wing flies daily sorties off the Syrian coast, carrying out training & reconnaissance flights. ( Rossiya 1 – Vesti v subbotu ). Yet, MSM feathers are ruffled again, as the Kuznetsov is still causing moments of agitation in some circles. But even the US Pentagon states that the Russian naval jets aren’t carrying ordnance . Link 
The Russian MOD confirmed that a naval MIG-29K crashed into the Med while returning to the carrier, off the Syrian coast, fortunately the pilot ejected and rescued by a SAR helicopter. Link 
South Front produced this article on the deployment of the naval helicopters in Syria, which reportedly will make a vital contribution in a mass missile strike. 
The missile types & capabilities onboard the Russian Navy fleet currently in the eastern Med is outlined in the infographic below: LINK 
Naval movements 
In other naval news, the Russian Navy’s Yug Class Oceanographic Research Vessel, Donuzlav, went south bound in October into the Mediterranean, so maybe it is playing a part in the Tartus naval base expansion. It is also likely that the Russian Navy Black Sea Fleet’s Nanuchka class guided missile corvette (617) is also stationed off Syria, as part of the expanded Russian fleet. It is however not known whether it has joined the core Kuznetsov group. Rumours state that the 3 Russian submarines operating in the Med are: the “Lipetsk” -“Vyborg”& “St. Petersburg”. 
The latest addition to the Syrian Express is Tapir Class LST “Nikolay Filchenkov” (152) & the Alexander Shabalin (110) both southbound en route to Tartus. Heading back home is the Tsezar Kunikov (158). 
As of the 12th Nov, the Kuznetsov’s oiler Osipov, the tug Nikolai Chiker and the SB Prof. Muru are in Tartus. Also present is a general cargo ship, the STARSHINA DEROV N.G, with a Hazard A cargo, (explosives). There is another ship loaded with Dangerous Goods, the LADY EMAN, at anchorage. The logistics and supply aspect of the Syrian campaign is very busy, mostly preparation for the forthcoming campaign in the Aleppo region. 
In other news, Syrian rebel linked social media claimed that a Russian warship fired a ballistic missile on the outskirts of Dana in the night of the 10th Nov. There has been no confirmation from Russian sources whatsoever. 

Part 3- NATO’ s backyard 
NATO announced on the 9th Nov the start of a ‘newish’ Operation Sea Guardian in the central Med area. It has been in the making since July, but evidently the timing or circumstances of this latest deployment don’t have a connection to the fact that the Russian Navy has just muscled in on NATO’s perceived “hallowed turf” with a significant naval presence in the eastern Med. [Sarc off] 
Wasn’t this supposed to be the belated response to the migrant crisis that peaked last year in the Aegean Sea? NATO really took their time to assemble this. So far the Operation currently involves the Bulgarian, Italian, Greek and Spanish and Turkish navies. This is also the additional presence of a Greek & German submarine, as well as aircraft. According to the press statement : “ Operation Sea Guardian will help maintain an accurate picture of daily activity in the Mediterranean to help identify possible security concerns .” The mission can be broken down into 3 parts: LINK 
1. Security & counter-terrorism 
3. Capacity building 
(Memo to NATO: Can I have that in plain English please?) 
There is another aspect to this Operation Sea Guardian , since the core tasks can also be expanded to include freedom of navigation and interdiction tasks, amongst others. [ Ding ding.. alarm bells are ringing…. “freedom of navigation “ ? Ah, maybe stretching the mission a bit, to denying “freedom of navigation” to certain countries in the future?] As a stated by NATO, the aim of this Operation could change; to be tied in with Operation Sophia. So sometime in the future, it could conveniently include official monitoring of events in Syria & the Russian Navy in the Med. LINK 
So on paper it looks like a well-oiled machine swinging into action, but judging from the tone of the title this Greek newspaper, “ NATO operation starts amid Greek-Turkish tensions “, the reality isn’t so rosy in the Aegean. LINK 
Lastly, Obama will shortly visit Greece. Rumours state that the hidden agenda may include forcing Greece to block Russian warships from port calls. This thorny issue is seen as one of the stumbling blocks for the US & NATO. The Avaaz led campaign whirlwind stopped Spain and Malta from allowing the Russian warships to call in, but not Greece. The Russian foreign ministry replied to the pressures made on Spain & Malta to deny port calls to Russian naval ships. . @mfa_russia 's #Zakharova on the arrival of the #Russian Navy’s aircraft carrier group in the Mediterranean | #Malta https://t.co/G45qg8tErP pic.twitter.com/FIS4a6r5Gv

US & NATO Surveillance 
Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2) appears to be tasked with watching over the Russian navy in the eastern Med. Further to my initial briefing, this includes the Canadian warship- Charlottetown (now in Toulon), Danish warship – Absalon and the Spanish oiler – Cantabria (A15). All have taken turns to watch the Kuznetsov fleet deployment. 
Additionally, a USN P-8A Poseidon plane reportedly took off on the 10th Nov, from the Sigonella airbase in Sicily and monitored the activities of the Russian flotilla off Syria. This is not the first nor will it be the last either that the US Navy snoops on the Russians in the area. LINK 
Once more the German navy’s warship, Braunschweig, (designated as “UN warship” on AIS), patrolling includes taking a cursory peek at the Russian navy off Tartus. F260 is part of UNIFIL in Lebanon. Yet it is an interesting turn of events, since back in October, the Braunschweig seemed to be also keeping an eye on the Russian ship Yantar. To whose benefit was it being done? The UN’s? 

Part 4 – Further afield 
Bab Al Mandeb and Yemen 
The UK has ‘quietly’ deployed one of its latest class of warship , HMS Daring, to keep a watch on merchant shipping off Yemen. This comes after the October missile attacks against an UAE naval ship & 3 US warships on station there. Bab Al Mandeb is known as a maritime chokepoint and is a busy commercial route. LINK 
This ties in nicely to my next topic, the Yantar, since it recently transited this area and so did the UK warship. The Yantar was last reported on AIS as ‘stationary’ in the middle of the Gulf, off Kharg, Iran, quite likely near to the GBICS submarine cable. As previously mentioned last week, it is probably looking for others nations’ ‘taps’ or ASW arrays in the area. 
The Russian Pacific Fleet detachment 
A group of Pacific Fleet ships left Vladivostok for the Indian Ocean on 17 Oct, consisting of the Admiral Tributs (564 ), ASW warship, Bystriy, a destroyer, a tug “Alatau” & oiler “Boris Batuma”. They were in Indonesia at the beginning of November on a goodwill visit . 
It was rumoured that they would head for the Syria, but the latest unconfirmed rumour is that they are on exercise with the Chinese Navy again. 
Chinese visit by Russian Navy CINC 
Last week, the head of the Russian Navy ,Vladimir Korolyov, recently made a working visit to China. link 
This comes on the back of China’s first ever invitation to the Russian Navy to participate in a “joint-military-exercise ” in the South China Sea back in October. 
The visit by the Russian naval CINC , included China’s aircraft carrier the Liaoning during a working visit to China. Russian naval CINC Vladimir Korolyov visits #China 's aircraft carrier the Liaoning during a working visit to China, Nov 5 pic.twitter.com/kbvgz6i1no

Originally a sister ship of the Kuznetsov, the Varyag, (Riga), was never finished, & was left to Ukraine which then sold it to China. Lately, the Russian CINC met his counterpart ADM Wu Shengli. Link in Chinese 
What the Russian CINC made of the condition and life onboard compared to that of the Kuznetsov is not publicly known, although I suspect a few Russian ‘matros’ would be green with envy though (link to life onboard site).

1080,A Jarring New Level of Confrontation and Conflict Hits Washington - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump made clear in his fiery inaugural speech that he was going to challenge the Washington establishment. Now the establishment is quickly pushing back, creating a palpable air of uncertainty and chaos in the opening days of his administration. The new president fired an acting attorney general who refused to defend the administration’s executive order on immigration. Democrats on Tuesday boycotted Senate confirmation hearings to prevent votes on cabinet nominees. State Department employees opposed to the administration were urged to quit if they didn’t like Mr. Trump’s direction. Even after years of unbreakable gridlock and unyielding partisanship, it was a jarring new level of confrontation and conflict, and it was contributing to a building sense of crisis just as the new president was to disclose the identity of a new Supreme Court nominee  —   a selection certain to further inflame tensions. Republicans, adjusting to the new era, seemed blindsided by the rapid pace of events and the worrying failure of the new administration to engage in the   and consultation that would typically accompany the issuance of a potentially explosive proposal like the freeze on visas for refugees and immigrants from select countries. “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters Tuesday, noting that top Republicans learned of the contents of the order only as it was being issued. That secretive, closely held approach may be the preferred choice of the president and   disrupters like his senior adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, who is quickly emerging as the power in the West Wing, but not by more conventional politicians who definitely don’t like to be caught off guard. Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said similar failings had emerged in the early days of previous administrations but would not be tolerated for long. “You get a brief period you’re allowed for a learning curve, but after that, you have to get your act together,” Mr. King said. One veteran of past Republican administrations, acknowledging the Trump White House was still in its “shakedown” phase, encouraged the president’s staff to focus more on consultation to avert confusion. “Process matters,” said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who served as chief of staff to Ronald Reagan. “You are dealing with not just senior management, but with a variety of constituencies and a board of directors of 535 people. ” Still, the main Republican objection seemed to be with the handling of the executive order by the inexperienced and understaffed White House rather than the actual content of the order. Several Republicans noted that they were fully supportive of the border control effort and that the substance mirrored legislation the House had passed last year. Unlike the Democrats, there was almost universal support among Republicans for the firing of Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general. Republicans say they remain eager to work with the president to reverse what they see as Obama administration overreach and put their own conservative stamp on the government. In their view, the furor and continuing tumult in official Washington isn’t necessarily upsetting to the voters back home. “President Trump has made clear that he is a man of action and we are ready,” said Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, a member of the House Republican leadership. How ready remained an open question. Most in Congress, regardless of party, take their role seriously as members of a coequal branch of government and they don’t take well to being kept out of the loop on matters for which they will be held to account. In other corners of the establishment, the reaction to the first days of the Trump era was not nearly as enthusiastic as that of Ms. McMorris Rodgers. One usually   Republican consultant who didn’t want to be identified picking a fight with the new president said a continuation of the turmoil would quickly call into question the basic competency of the new administration. He noted that despite being in the middle of past Supreme Court confirmation fights, he surprisingly had not heard from the White House for ideas on how to handle the coming one. Democrats remained generally aghast, with Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, noting a “very tense environment between Democrats in Congress and the White House, and I think these executive orders have really pushed to the limit the relationship between us. ” At least part of the mounting consternation in the capital was because of the clear break with ingrained rituals and ways of doing business. When Democrats were clashing with President George W. Bush, there was a general expectation of how things would go and the realization that both sides understood their roles. Over eight years of the Obama administration, the two parties settled into a predictable pattern of Republicans opposing the president and Democrats trying to find a way around it. Despite frequent visits to the brink of crisis, the adversaries tended to find a resolution before the damage was beyond repair. With the Trump team, no one as yet is sure what to anticipate, leaving nerves jangled and people wondering what is next  —   a rollback of gay legal protections (denied by the White House) or a move against the young undocumented immigrants in the   Dreamers program? What about a clash with Iran or an embrace of Russia? Mr. Trump and his team seem in some ways to be enjoying the confusion they have come to create. “We’re going to be changing a lot of  —   a lot of the rules,” the president exclaimed Tuesday at a White House meeting with pharmaceutical executives. His comments were aimed at what to do about drug development and pricing. But they seemed to imply so much more, keeping Washington on edge.",0
1081,Clinton transmitted classified info to her lawyers,"Clinton transmitted classified info to her lawyers Andrew McCarthy: There's no attorney exception to criminal law that prohibits such action Published: 27 mins ago 
(National Review) — What was the legal rationale under which Hillary Clinton quite intentionally shared classified information with her lawyers, including David Kendall, Cheryl Mills, and Heather Samuelson? 
As I outlined in last weekend’s column, we know that Clinton’s e-mails were replete with classified information. According to the FBI, the classified e-mails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level: eight top-secret e-mails, and seven designated as “special access program” (SAP) information. (While FBI director James Comey’s presentation understandably left this vague, the likelihood is that seven of the eight top-secret e-mails are SAP.) Under President Bill Clinton’s 1995 executive order, top-secret intelligence is information the mishandling of which “could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.” The SAP designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligence-gathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources. 
That is why access to this information is so tightly restricted, and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted.",0

1083,General Election Campaigning Suspended In Wake of Manchester Suicide Bombing,"British political parties have announced they are suspending campaigning for the forthcoming general election after a suicide bombing in Manchester killed at least 22, and injured 60. [The move to suspend campaigning follows the form established after the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the independence referendum campaign in 2016 when all major parties announced they would cancel events out of respect.  A similar suspension took place during the recent French presidential election campaign after three French police officers were shot, one fatally, in central Paris in a suspected terror attack days before the vote. Fifteen full days remain until the polls open for Britain’s general election. Speaking after last night’s attack, British Prime Minister and Conservative Party leader Theresa May said: “We are working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. All our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those who have been affected. ” In a statement, the prime minister said: “I’d like to pay tribute to the emergency services who have worked throughout the night professionally and effectively  —   they have done an excellent job. “Later on this morning, I will be attending Cobra, chaired by the Prime Minister, to collect more information  —   to find out more  —   about this particular attack, and I can’t comment any more on that at the moment. “The public should remain alert but not alarmed. If they have anything to report, they should approach the police. But I have two further things to add. The great city of Manchester has been affected by terrorism before. Its spirit was not bowed its community continued. “This time it has been a particular attack on the most vulnerable in our society  —   its intention was to sow fear  —   its intention is to divide. But it will not succeed. ” Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said “the whole country will grieve” after the attack and had agreed to suspend nationwide campaigning “until further notice”. UKIP leader Paul Nuttall joined others in releasing a statement assuring “prayers and thoughts” for those affected and declaring a suspension of campaigning.  ",0
1084,'Grand slam!' Father-son film is smash hit for families,"Print Gappers team photo from “Every Boy Needs a Hero” 
Just in time for the start of the 2016 Major League Baseball World Series, WND Films has acquired the father-son baseball movie, “Every Boy Needs a Hero,” for immediate release on DVD. 
“We’re confident that “Hero” is a grand-slam movie that will build up families across America and restore luster to the game,” said Joseph Farah, WND founder and CEO. 
Starring Burgess Jenkins, of “Remember the Titans” and “Nashville,” and Gregory Alan Williams, of “Miracles from Heaven,” this award-winning movie brings the love of baseball to hearth and home. It also features a powerful music soundtrack by three-time Grammy winner Michael Omartian. 
Get “Every Boy Needs a Hero” now at the WND Superstore! From the producers of “Alone Yet Not Alone,” the movie is a powerful tale of restoring and strengthening relationships between fathers and their children. 
According to Dr. Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide, “ ‘Hero’ is an excellent movie about God turning a man’s heart to his son and a son learning to forgive his father.” 
Dr. Baehr added, “The opening is powerful. The ending is heartrending. The drama, the acting, the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie. This is one of the few movies that Movieguide can actually say go see it.” Keith Harris and Nick Edwards as Wynn and Sammy Heller 
“Hero” opens with Joe (played by Burgess Jenkins) coaching his son David’s baseball team, the Gappers, to the state championship. Seven years later, after pursuing his dream job, Joe returns to town. He had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family. His wife, Hannah, is stricken with cancer, while David is angry that Joe left them. After Hannah’s funeral, Joe moves back into the house, but David remains bitter. Meanwhile, David is coaching the now hapless Gappers; the team loses more than it wins. Joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners, hoping this gesture will help Joe reconcile with David. Unfortunately, the league rules have softened dramatically, making it nearly impossible to train the team properly: practice times are limited, coaches can’t make players take laps around the field, everyone gets a “participation” trophy. The beloved American pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games, let alone practices. So, Joe starts his own league to turns things around. 
From the director of “Isaiah 9:10 Judgment” and the producer of “Alone Not Yet Alone” comes “Hero,” a beautiful tale of the significance of the father-child relationship that’s and set around America’s pastime, baseball. 
One of the fathers Joe pursues for the new league is the warden of the local prison, Mr. Redding (played by Gregory Alan Williams). Redding’s career mirrors that of Joe. He’s been offered a big job in Washington, D.C. Like Joe, he’s lured by fame and fortune at the expense of his relationship with his son and family. In contrast, another Gapper teammate has a father who’s actually a prison inmate under Redding. Unlike many of the absent fathers outside the prison walls, the inmate father has a great desire to practice baseball with his son, but he cannot due to prison rules.

What makes “Hero” particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself. 
Watch the trailer: 
Washington Times reporter Bradford Richardson wrote in his article, “Study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players,” that the Austin Institute, a Texas-based think tank focused on family and societal issues, has commissioned a study titled, “Called Out at Home,” which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball.

Richardson writes: 
Kevin Stuart, executive director of the Austin Institute, said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because “it takes two to play catch.” 
There is a “long-standing connection between fatherhood and baseball,” Mr. Stuart said, pointing to famous father-son tandems who have played in the Major Leagues and the prominence of father-son relationships in popular baseball movies such as “Field of Dreams.” 
Baseball, he said, was made to be played by fathers and sons. 
“Baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle, where what’s really necessary, or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills, is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you,” Mr. Stuart said. 
Anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the study’s connection between fatherhood and baseball. 
Famous father-son tandems – including Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr., Prince Fielder and Cecil Fielder, and Tony Gwynn Sr. and Tony Gwynn Jr. – have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next. 
“Hero” received a powerful endorsement from renowned Christian author Stormie Omartian: 
“For such a time as this, ‘Hero’ is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son, who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball,” Farah said. 
Baehr concluded, “‘Hero’ is a wonderful, faith-filled sports drama. It will touch your heart, your mind and your soul.” Gapper team dads from the film, “Every Boy Needs a Hero”",0
1085,Venezuela’s Economic Crisis: Does It Mean That the Left Has Failed?,"[Photo: Demonstrators protesting legislative threats to privatize public housing instituted under Chavez. Credit: Venezuela Analysis .] =By= Mike Weisbrot Editor's Note Mike Weisbrot deserves a round of applause for not trying to make this a simple issue. I, and I imagine you, have read plenty of those. So set you brain to hold more than four strands and off you go! T he international media have provided a constant fusillade of stories and editorials (not always easily distinguished from each other) about the collapse of the Venezuelan economy for some time now. Shortages of food and medicine, hours-long lines for basic goods, incomes eroded by triple-digit inflation and even food riots have dominated press reports.
The conventional wisdom has a set of predictable narratives to explain the current economic mess. “Socialism” has failed — never mind that the vast majority of jobs created during the Hugo Chávez years were in the private sector, and that the size of the state has been much smaller than in France. The whole experiment, it is said, was a failure from the beginning. 
According to this narrative, nationalizations, anti-business policies, populist overspending during the years of high oil prices and the collapse of oil prices since 2014 sealed Venezuela’s fate. Adherents to this explanation say the downward spiral will continue until the chavistas are removed from power, either through elections or through a coup (most pundits don’t seem to care which). 
The reality is somewhat more complicated. First, the Bolivarian experiment did pretty well until 2014. From 2004 — after the Chávez government got control over the national oil industry — until 2014, real income per person grew by more than 2 percent annually. This is an enormous change from the horrendous long-term decline in the 20 years prior to Chávez, when GDP per capita actually shrank at an average annual rate of 1.2 percent. During the same years (2004–2014), poverty fell by 49 percent and extreme poverty by 63 percent — and this counts only cash income. The number of people over 60 years old receiving public pensions tripled, and millions of Venezuelans gained access to health care and education. It is the gains over this decade of chavismo that explain how the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) was able to win 41 percent of the vote in National Assembly elections in December 2015, despite serious shortages of consumer goods, 180 percent inflation and a deep recession. 
Now for the downward spiral of the economy over the past three years: Was this inevitable? And is it irreversible until the PSUV leaves power? To answer these questions, we must look at how Venezuela got into this situation, and how it might get out of it. The Story of Venezuela’s Economic Recession 
In the fall of 2012, and again in February 2013, the government sharply reduced the availability of foreign exchange. It was during this time that shortages of basic goods accelerated, along with inflation and the black market price of the dollar. The official exchange rate, at which the government sold the vast majority of dollars earned from oil sales, was at 6.3 Bolivares Fuertes (Bs.F) per dollar. But a parallel market already existed, and the shortage of dollars at the official rate drove the parallel market sharply upward. At the same time, the higher parallel market price of the dollar increased inflation, because it increases the price of imported goods. 
And when inflation goes up, more people want to buy dollars, because they see the dollar as something secure that won’t lose value to inflation. But this drives the price of the dollar up on the parallel market, which increases inflation even more. This cycle continues, causing an “inflation-depreciation” spiral. In October 2012, inflation was at 18 percent, and the parallel market rate was at 13 percent. By the end of 2015, annual inflation was at 180 percent and the parallel market rate was at 833 percent. The shortages of consumer and other goods also contribute to this spiral, and they have increased with it. 
By the first quarter of 2014, the Venezuelan economy was already in recession, even though international oil prices were more than $100 a barrel. By January 2015, prices had fallen to $48 a barrel, and are about the same today. This depleted the government’s revenue by a similar percentage, and the government resorted to printing money to cover expenses. The money creation would not necessarily accelerate inflation, but in the context of the inflation-depreciation spiral it certainly did. So inflation rose even faster. 
Since late March, the parallel market rate has fallen from a peak of more than 1,211 to about 1,025 Bs. per dollar today — about a 15 percent drop in the price of the dollar as measured in domestic currency — after shooting up rapidly for more than three years. At the same time, the government allowed the price of the dollar on a third market, called the SIMADI or DICOM rate, to go up. It is now at about 640 Bs. per dollar, or more than 60 percent of the parallel market rate. 
However, this does not mean that the economy is on the road to stabilization. 
First, the parallel rate is still 100 times the lower official rate of 10. Second, one of the main things that has slowed the inflation-depreciation spiral has been the deepening recession. There are far fewer people with money to buy dollars, and many are depleting their dollar savings in order to buy necessities. This has pushed down the price of the dollar on the parallel market. 
What this means is that the Venezuelan economy cannot recover under the current exchange rate system. It is stuck in recession. Furthermore, the multiple exchange rate system, with its vast differences between the different rates, creates an enormous incentive for corruption. Anyone with access to official dollars can multiply their income by 100 simply by selling them on the black market, which is completely accessible to almost anyone. 
But the official exchange rate system is only one way that the government’s dollar revenue is lost. Gasoline, even after the recent price increases, is about 6 Bs. per liter — or about one US cent per liter at the SIMADI exchange rate. Electricity and gas are also heavily subsidized. These subsidies cost the government more than 13 percent of GDP. For comparison, the total income tax revenue (individual plus corporate) of the US federal government in 2015 was about 10.6 percent of GDP. At the same time, there are price controls that are difficult or impossible to maintain in the current economic situation. In 2015, overall consumer prices increased by 180 percent; yet food prices, which are subject to price controls, increased by 300 percent. This is a pretty clear demonstration that price controls are not working. A Possible Path to Recovery 
Millions of Venezuelans now make their living from arbitrage of some sort — from waiting in line for hours for a small allocation of subsidized food and reselling it, to trading currency on the parallel market, to selling stolen goods. Even a dictatorship with considerable repressive power to crack down on all illegal transactions would have trouble maintaining a functioning economy with the magnitude of these price distortions. But Venezuela is not a dictatorship; in fact, the state is very weak in terms of law enforcement. 
Given this situation, it is clear that serious reforms are necessary in order to restart the economy. The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has assembled a team of economists, headed by former president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fernández, which has presented a set of proposals. (Full disclosure: I am one of the members of this team.) 
The most obvious change that is needed is to unify the multiple exchange rate system. This should be done quickly, and in one step. The government can auction a fixed amount of dollars each day, with the price determined by supply and demand. Although allowing the currency to float seems scary to many people, the price of the dollar would undoubtedly stabilize at something considerably less than the current parallel market rate of about 1,000. A floating rate is also the only way to avoid wasting scarce foreign exchange reserves in a futile attempt to maintain an overvalued fixed rate. 
Since devaluations generally lead to price increases, it would be necessary to protect people from any rising costs of essential goods, including food. This could be done with a vast expansion of the government’s current system of the Tarjeta Misiones Socialistas (a card system providing direct subsidies to lower-income families), which would give people a large discount that could compensate for any price increases. This system would be in place before the unification of the exchange rate. 
The energy subsidies could then be phased out more gradually over the next 18 months. To make this economically and politically acceptable, the additional government revenue as energy prices are allowed to rise would be added to the tarjetas (cards). This would be a net gain for the vast majority of Venezuelans. Some price controls — including those that do not allow producers to meet their costs — would be phased out. 
Other measures to protect people’s living standards would include indexing wages to inflation, and creating a temporary public works program to create employment. These could be financed by a wealth tax similar to one in Colombia, and by a tax on financial transactions. 
The government can help finance the transition by selling some of its foreign assets. At the same time, it will have to restructure its debt in order to reduce the $17 billion of debt payments (interest and principal) that would otherwise be due over the next year and a half. 
All of this is feasible even with current oil prices because Venezuela has already adjusted its level of imports to match the fall in oil prices, which provide more than 90 percent of the country’s dollar earnings. It has been an enormous adjustment; imports have fallen by more than half since 2012. For comparison, Greece, after more than six years of depression, has reduced its imports by 28 percent. 
This means that the hard part of the adjustment — the one that often requires people to reduce their living standards in order to sharply reduce imports — has already been done. It is relative prices now that have to be adjusted in order to recover. The result is that Venezuela can return to growth rather quickly, without the prolonged recession that neoliberal adjustment normally creates. Left Critiques of Proposed Economic Reforms 
Much of the left — including people inside the government and among the base of its party, the PSUV — rejects these economic reforms. They think it is a “ paquetazo ” (package) similar to International Monetary Fund (IMF) or neoliberal reforms that increased poverty in the past. They see the fixed exchange rate as socialistic and a floating exchange rate as a “free market” reform. But in reality, the informal economy for dollars constitutes one of the most destructive “free markets” that exists; it is the “ capitalismo salvaje ” (“savage capitalism”) that Hugo Chávez used to denounce. (Chávez himself successfully floated Venezuela’s currency in February 2002, and dollar reserves actually increased despite serious political instability.) And we can recall that the IMF supported fixed, overvalued exchange rates with disastrous results in Argentina, Brazil, Russia and a number of Asian countries in the last years of the 20th century. 
There is nothing neoliberal about a program in which the government creates employment, protects wages from inflation (which has not happened since inflation began to skyrocket nearly four years ago), subsidizes food and essential items on a large scale, and protects people generally from the burden of the adjustment of relative prices. 
Yet there are those on the left who seem to think that Venezuela can recover without fixing its most fundamental and destructive imbalances. Alfredo Serrano, an adviser to the government, posted eight “ economic theses ” on Venezuela on September 1. In 2,700 words, there is no mention of Venezuela’s dysfunctional exchange rate system. 
At the same time, the US government — which has sought “regime change” in Venezuela for the past 15 years — is trying to further destabilize the economy. In March 2016 President Obama once again declared that Venezuela posed an “unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security” of the United States, and imposed economic sanctions. The sanctions themselves are not economically important, but they send a message to investors who know what happens to countries that are labeled an “extraordinary threat” to the United States. The Obama administration has also pressured US financial institutions not to do business with Venezuela. 
The international media and their usual sources are also playing their traditional role, and some of the widely reported stories have been wrong. By 2015, there were widespread reports that the poverty rate had increased to 76 percent when this was practically impossible. The IMF, which has a long history of politically influenced forecasts, projected that GDP would shrink by 10 percent last year, when the actual figure was 5.7 percent. The media report IMF projections of 720 percent inflation for this year, although this is likely to be way off. It is further evidence of the media’s extreme hostility to the Venezuelan government that so many journalists feel the need to exaggerate, even when Venezuela is facing its worst economic crisis in decades. But even during most of the economic boom between 2003 and 2008, when employment was rising rapidly and poverty was plummeting, it was hard to find anything positive about Venezuela in the major media. 
Nonetheless, it should be clear that the Venezuelan economy will not recover, even if oil prices were to rise rapidly, without some major reforms that can resolve its worst economic imbalances.",0
1086,Herd of Stampeding Wild Boars Kills Three Islamic State Jihadists - Breitbart,"A herd of stampeding wild boars killed three Islamic State terrorists in a fiercely contested area of Northern Iraq, according to local sources. [The Times of London reports that a group of Islamic State jihadists was preparing an ambush in a field 50 miles from the Iraqi city of Kirkuk before being overwhelmed by a stampeding herd of wild boars, killing three terrorists and leaving five seriously injured.  Sheikh Anwar   chief of the local Ubaid tribe organizing   forces, told The Times that some militants had escaped death by managing to hide in large areas of reeds, but others had not been so lucky. “It is likely their movement disturbed a herd of wild pigs, which inhabit the area as well as the nearby cornfields,” he said. “The area is dense with reeds, which are good for hiding in. ” A group of refugees fleeing the region discovered the bodies. According to deputy head of the Kurdish intelligence service Brigadier Azad Jelal, jihadists in the area responded to the incident by going on a killing spree of the area’s wild boars. Anwar   also revealed that the incident happened shortly after the militants had slaughtered 25 people to death in Hawija, one of the few districts the Islamic State still controls, and a site where they regularly carry out mass killings. In August last year, the group massacred 85 civilians in Hawija as an apparent show of strength. Mosul, the country’s   city, remains the last major Islamic State stronghold in Iraq, as Kurdish forces fight to reclaim it.

1087,"Not From Venus, Not From Mars: What We Believe About Gender and Why It’s Often Wrong - The New York Times","TESTOSTERONE REXMyths of Sex, Science, and SocietyBy Cordelia Fine 266 pp. W. W. Norton  Company. $26. 95. If you hear a metallic rasp as you open the cover of Cordelia Fine’s new book, don’t be alarmed. It’s just the sound of the author sharpening her knives, the better to carve up the carcass of what she calls “Testosterone Rex”: the big, scaly body of assumptions, preconceptions, conjectures and distortions regarding “what men are like” and “what women are like. ” Fine takes on this king of all biases with admirable vigor, and it’s a pleasure  —   albeit a strenuous one  —   to follow the action as she dismembers the beast. She dissects as she goes, bringing a probing intelligence not only to what we believe about gender, and why it’s often wrong, but also to the history of how we came to think it was so. And lest we think gender stereotypes are themselves history, Fine produces an array of wincingly recent portrayals drawn from popular media. Like this rhetorical question from The Financial Times, meant to make clear why natural selection favored a taste for  : “Were the young women of the tribe more impressed when the cautious described their uneventful days,” the columnist John Kay asks, “or when the bold recalled their heroic escape from danger?” Kay exhibits little awareness of the possibility that those rapt “young women” might be independent agents who themselves chose to take risks, or not. Fine, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, is also willing to take a blade to the work of some of her fellow academics. She notes that Larry Cahill, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Irvine, has likened women and men to “very different kinds of car”: specifically, a Volvo and a Corvette. “Perhaps not coincidentally,” Fine dryly observes, “one is a nice, safe family vehicle with plenty of room in the trunk for groceries the other is designed to offer power and status. ” With keen precision and sharp humor, Fine shows how deeply our assumptions about gender are embedded in the questions that we  —   scientists, journalists and the rest of us  —   pose, the analogies we choose, even the options we’re offered on surveys. Built into the very structures of our thinking is the notion of women as less: less lustful, less competitive, less aggressive than men. Fine holds one such belief after another up to the light and wonders: How do we know this is true? Often, it turns out, it’s not true to the extent we imagine, or not true at all. Take, for instance, that presumption  —   apparently supported by science  —   that men are more enthusiastic   than women. The finding is based on male and female subjects’ responses to survey questions about their propensity to engage in risky behaviors. As Fine observes, however, “researchers have to make decisions about the kinds of risks they decide to investigate”  —   and the kinds of risk they have consistently decided upon have a culturally masculine cast, focused on activities like sports betting, financial investments, motorcycle riding and extreme sports like sky diving or bungee jumping. The author continues: “Although women routinely take risks, these often seem to slip under the research radar. For example, with divorce rates hovering close to 50 percent, being the one to quit or scale back your job when children arrive is a significant economic risk. Going on a date can end in sexual assault. Leaving a marriage is financially, socially and emotionally risky. In the United States, being pregnant is about 20 times more likely to result in death than is a sky dive. ” Our habit of defining risk in traditionally male terms has rigged the game against the perception of women as   in their own right. Well, then, what about the even more entrenched idea that evolution has primed men to desire many and varied sex partners? Here Fine quotes the Bradley University psychologist David Schmitt: “Consider that one man can produce as many as 100 offspring by indiscriminately mating with 100 women in a given year, whereas a man who is monogamous will tend to have only one child with his partner during that same time period. ” Fine expertly fillets this familiar premise, noting, among other inconvenient facts, that “the probability of a woman becoming pregnant from a single randomly timed act of intercourse is about 3 percent,” and that in historical and traditional societies, as many as 80 to 90 percent of women of reproductive age at any one time might already be pregnant, or infertile while they were  . “The theoretical possibility that a male could produce dozens of offspring if he mated with dozens of females is of little consequence if, in reality, there are few females available to fertilize,” Fine comments. Think about it: For every man on the prowl, there simply aren’t a hundred women available to bear his child. For all men not named Genghis Khan, monogamy must have started to look like a pretty smart bet. Again and again, Fine questions the way we think of biological sex “as a fundamental force in development that creates not just two kinds of reproductive system, but two kinds of people. ” (Or as she quotes yet another academic: “Psychologically, men and women are almost a different species. ”) Fine offers a satisfying counterpoint to this claim: People, she writes, are so different from one another as to seem members of multiple species  —   a variety not constrained or contained by dichotomous categories of male and female. Indeed, the fantastic diversity of Earth’s   is one of Fine’s recurring themes. To the many nonhuman species she writes about, the author brings her characteristically vivid descriptions and droll humor: We learn that male and female African forest weaver birds sing together, in unison that male macaque monkeys sometimes carry and groom their babies that female sandpipers are shamelessly promiscuous. (“While ‘promiscuous’ is a highly   term, no moral judgment whatsoever is implied by its application here,” Fine writes. “Not even for those slutty sandpipers. ”) Fine is also quite funny when observing how gender roles play out in her own life, and how stereotypes attach to her vocation as a feminist science writer. When she told her young son  —   who, she notes, “has a strange, unchildlike interest in taxidermy”  —   that it was time to get the family dog neutered, he excitedly suggested turning the testicles into a key ring. Fine remarks: “Contrary to a prevailing view of the feminist as the kind of person who could think of no more inspiring and motivating a start to the workday than to unlock her office with a set of keys from which dangles a   pair of testicles, I strongly vetoed my son’s suggestion. ” Colorful zoological anecdotes and amusing domestic interludes provide a welcome respite from the author’s   argument. If her book has a fault, it is that it is rather too thoroughly argued. The indomitable Fine amasses evidence, addresses objections and accumulates footnotes at such a brisk pace that the panting reader wishes at times for a water break. There’s no doubt, however, that such tireless energy is just what’s needed to slay a monster of this gargantuan size and this determined tenacity. Beliefs about men and women are as old as humanity itself, but Fine’s funny, spiky book gives reason to hope that we’ve heard Testosterone rex’s last roar.",0
1088,Marks and Spencer to turn High Street stores into Bingo Halls,"Tuesday 8 November 2016 by Fat Jim Marks and Spencer to turn High Street stores into Bingo Halls 
Marks and Spencer have announced it will convert all clothing and home shops to highly profitable bingo halls and high stake slot machine centres. 
The struggling retailer announced its turnaround plan as it seeks to address the changing needs of British customers. 
The move will also see an end to low-cost child labour exploitation as the company can now exploit an entirely new and untapped demographic, right here in this country. 
The retailer’s main customer base was found to be the over 60’s, many with a walking frame or one of those upright shopping bags with wheels. This core support still likes M&S, but only because they have lost most of their faculties and are not in a position to realise how awful it has become. 
M&S retail executive, Simon Williams, told us, “I looked at these customers of ours and thought ‘Bingo’, we already have a captive audience of people that want to throw their pensions away on unachievable lifestyle marketing – it’s the logical next step.” 
Chief Executive Steven Roe said, “We thought the British public wanted moderately affordable clothing in classic styles, but it turns out they actually want to throw their money into betting machines and to pay extortionate amounts for the thrill of ticking numbers off on a piece of paper.

1089,On Obama’s Pardon List: A Hotel Magnate Who Owned Studio 54 - The New York Times,"On Tuesday, President Obama pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 270 people, including  Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence analyst, and Oscar López Rivera, a Puerto Rican nationalist. Far down on the list, attracting almost no attention, was a boldface name from the disco days and nights of Manhattan in the 1970s. Ian Schrager, a hotelier and real estate developer whose club, Studio 54, was a notorious celebrity hangout, was among the 64 people granted a pardon in the waning moments of Mr. Obama’s presidency. The wild nightclub was central in Mr. Schrager’s conviction in 1980 on felony tax evasion charges he was accused of hiding money the club made from the government, concealing some of it in trash bags and ceiling panels. With a portfolio that has included some of the most expensive residential real estate in Manhattan  —   and boutique hotels, whose very concept he helped invent  —   Mr. Schrager seems to have little tangible need for a presidential intercession to set aside his conviction. He agrees, to a point. “I was able to overcome everything by being tenacious and, I suppose, relentless, and having successful products,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “It wasn’t something that I needed to continue business. ” Instead, he said, it was knowing that his son, who is 6, would grow up to learn what he had done that pushed Mr. Schrager to hire a Washington law firm, Hogan Lovells, four years ago to apply for a pardon. “I wanted it for closure. I wanted it for my family,” he said. “It’s hard to be a good example for your kids when you did something like what I did, and you try to teach your kids to live by the rules and be an upstanding person. ” Mr. Schrager applied in 2012 for the pardon, which restores civil liberties like voting but does not expunge a criminal record, and he waited each year for a decision, with no word back. The lawyer who helped with Mr. Schrager’s pardon application, H. P. Goldfield, said it was not his client’s financial success or connections that ultimately made his pardon application successful, but how Mr. Schrager had lived his life in the years since he left prison. “It’s not just saying, ‘I’m sorry.’ There has got to be a sense that the person is really remorseful and admits their wrongdoing and that they’ve lived an exemplary life ever since,” Mr. Goldfield said, pointing to the thousands of jobs that Mr. Schrager’s company had created and his history as a mentor to young people. “He has really lived an exemplary life. He asked for forgiveness, and the president saw it in his heart to forgive. ” The application also asks for written testimony from three character witnesses. Mr. Schrager, 70, declined to say who they were. “It happened when I was young enough, and thank God, having lost everything, I didn’t lose my enthusiasm for life,” he said. “Either I was just going to give up, or dust myself off and put my head down and just try and recoup everything that l lost. ” “Some of it you can’t recoup,” he added. “I’ll always have the scar. ” The felony conviction made it difficult to   himself after his release from prison. Mr. Schrager recalled having to drive to Virginia just to get a credit card, because banks in New York would not do business with him. Convicted felons cannot legally obtain a liquor license, so his first hotels in Manhattan, including Morgans and the Paramount, could not serve liquor, he said. In 1992, a lawyer for Mr. Schrager convinced the State Liquor Authority that he was sufficiently rehabilitated to merit another license. Mr. Schrager was convicted with his closest friend and business partner, Steve Rubell, who died in 1989. Some of his first thoughts upon learning of the pardon were of Mr. Rubell, Mr. Schrager said. “I’ll never have another friend like Steve,” he said. “And now I am here bringing closure to this event, and it’s bittersweet  —   I can’t share that with him. ” His conviction has brought other lingering effects. At airports, he is detained for questioning when he   the country, Mr. Schrager said. He said he was unsure if those stops would diminish after the pardon. But the lasting effect after more than three decades is mostly emotional, an abiding sense of shame. On Tuesday, when Mr. Goldfield called to tell him the news, Mr. Schrager was at his home in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. His son overheard the ensuing excited conversation between Mr. Schrager and his wife, Tania Wahlstedt. “He knew something good had happened, and he asked me, ‘Well, what’s so good that happened? ’” Mr. Schrager recalled. “I still didn’t feel like talking about it,’’ he said. “I said, ‘Well, the president said I was a good guy’  —   that was enough. ”",0
1090,Suspect captured in ‘ambush-style’ killings of two Iowa cops,"Suspect captured in ‘ambush-style’ killings of two Iowa cops 11/02/2016 
USA TODAY 
Authorities captured a 46-year-old male suspect without incident Wednesday, hours after an early-morning “ambush-style” killing of two police officers in the Des Moines metro area. 
The suspect in the back-to-back killings was identified as Scott Michael Greene, said Urbandale police spokesman Sgt. Chad Underwood. Before capturing him, police had described Greene, who was last seen driving a blue Ford F-150 with an Iowa license plate, as armed and dangerous. 
Greene was taken into custody by the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department while walking along a rural road in Redfield, about 35 miles west of where the shootings occurred. 
According to police, Greene flagged down a passing Department of Natural Resources officer, handed over his ID and told the officer to call police. No shots were fired and there was no struggle, according to police. 
The suspect was taken by ambulance to a Des Moines hospital with an unknown injury. 
In a late morning news conference, police identified the slain officers as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines police Sgt. Anthony “Tony” Beminio. 
The attacks began around 1:06 a.m. CT, when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale. 
The first officers arriving on the scene found Martin fatally wounded. About 20 minutes later, some two miles away, Beminio was was shot near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Ave. while responding to reports of the first officer’s shooting. Beminio was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died. Scott Michael Greene (Photo: Des Moines Police) 
Both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars. 
“It doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars,” a visibly emotional Parizek told reporters. 
“In all appearances it looks … that these officers were ambushed,” he added. Officer from Des Moines and another from Urbandale were shot and killed in their cars, @dmpolice said. #officersdown 
— Daniel P. Finney (@newsmanone) November 2, 2016 
Des Moines police, fearing officers were being singled out, paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone, Parizek said. 
“There’s literally a clear and present danger if you’re a police officer,” he said. 
Police did not offer many details on how investigators identified Greene as a suspect. Underwood said he was identified “through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips.” 
As of an early-morning news conference, police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers’ names, years of service and other details until later in the day, Parizek said. 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the killings, saying “violence has no place in the United States of America.’’ 
“Let me be clear, there is no message in murder,’’ the attorney general said, referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country. “Violence creates nothing; it only destroys.’’ A Des Moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Avenue in Des Moines on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. (Photo: Brian Powers, The Des Moines Register) 
It’s the first time Des Moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977. 
Two Des Moines officers, Susan Farrell and Carlos Puente-Morales, died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunk driver. 
The killing of the Urbandale officer appeared to be the city’s first for an officer shot in the line of duty, Underwood said at the news conference. 
Parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost Farrell and Puente-Morales, as well as with this tragedy. 
“I don’t even know where to begin on how bad this year is,” he said. But, “this is what we do. We come in day in and day out, we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what’s going on in our personal and professional lives.” Officers investigate the scene at Merle Hay and Sheridan ave. where an officer was found shot at about 1:26 A.M. on on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016, in Urbandale. 
In a statement, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad called the attack on the officers “an attack on the public safety of all Iowans.” 
“We call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice,” he said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm’s way.” 
Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed. 
“Although the investigation is still unfolding, what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us,” Ernst said. “This was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated.”

Weiner's revenge. Do Jews go to jail? He may be able to finagle this into some kind of legal cloak for himself. 
Can't stand Kelly's 'active listening' face. She has practiced keeping that big mandible shut - you can see her wanting to interrupt. Her neck strength must be immense. 
Studies show her jaw currently weighs 74.3 lbs. Holding it shut is a catch-22 as it grows through the act of holding itself shut (she cut her hair to decrease neck strain). Leading scientists/studies show, if she does not allow herself to become a mouth breather, that her mandible will triple in size by 3/10/2018. The growth tripling time will decrease by 6 mo's every month thereafter.",0
1092,A Family-Friendly Policy That’s Friendliest to Male Professors - The New York Times,"The underrepresentation of women among the senior ranks of scholars has led dozens of universities to adopt   employment policies. But a recent study of economists in the United States finds that some of these   policies have had an unintended consequence: They have advanced the careers of male economists, often at women’s expense. Similar patterns probably hold in other disciplines, too. The central problem is that employment policies that are   on paper may not be   in effect. After all, most women receive parental benefits only after bearing the burden of pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, and often, a larger share of parenting responsibilities. Yet fathers usually receive the same benefits without bearing anything close to the same burden. Given this asymmetry, it’s little wonder some recently instituted benefits have given men an advantage. To succeed at top universities, academics must finish graduate school, find a job as an assistant professor and then race to establish themselves as   researchers before being evaluated for tenure. Succeed within seven years and you have a job for life. Fall short, and you’re fired. It can be a particularly difficult path for women, for whom this career pressure typically coincides with prime childbearing years. Making matters worse, while many   male academics are supported by    wives, women more typically wed husbands with their own professional career pressures. To combat these disparities, many universities have adopted   policies that give new parents greater flexibility. Typically, this means extending the   period of tenure evaluation, usually by an extra year for each child. In practice, these policies are usually   giving dads an extra year to establish their reputations, just like moms. Universities typically adopted such policies in the 1990s and early 2000s, while about   chose not to do so. Three economists  —   Heather Antecol, a professor at Claremont McKenna College, Kelly Bedard, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Jenna Stearns, a doctoral student at Santa Barbara  —   evaluated these     policies in important new research. The policies led to a 19   rise in the probability that a male economist would earn tenure at his first job. In contrast, women’s chances of gaining tenure fell by 22 percentage points. Before the arrival of tenure extension, a little less than 30 percent of both women and men at these institutions gained tenure at their first jobs. The decline for women is therefore very large. It suggests that the new policies made it extraordinarily rare for female economists to clear the tenure hurdle. Shelly Lundberg, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study, told me that while she had long “suspected that these policies had an unintended negative impact on women,” the magnitude of the effect surprised her. The researchers compiled new data on the career trajectories of all untenured economists hired over the last 20 years at the 50 leading economics departments, and coupled it with details about policies instituted by those universities that extended the tenure clock for new parents. The authors compared promotion rates before and after these   parental policies were adopted, relative to trends in comparable institutions that did not alter their policies, while also accounting for an array of influences, like where each economist was trained. They found that men who took parental leave used the extra year to publish their research, amassing impressive publication records. But there was no parallel rise in the output of female economists. Perhaps this reflects the physical toll of pregnancy, the difficulties of a complicated birth, the extra task of nursing or simply an unwillingness to shirk parenting duties. Whatever the cause, the findings are exactly what you would have expected if becoming a parent exacted a greater career sacrifice for women than men. By giving men a relative advantage, these   policies appear to have effectively raised the tenure bar for women. Alison   dean of the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said these findings “clearly conform to what I see on the ground every day,” adding that “the extra year for men just disadvantages women. ” The problem, said Ms.   is that “giving birth is not a   event,” recalling that during her pregnancy, “I threw up every day. ” She argued, “Policies that are neutral in the eyes of a lawyer are not neutral in fact. ” This accords with what I’ve seen among my own colleagues. Male economists typically approach parenthood with few concerns about possible professional consequences. Women, however, are often counseled to delay motherhood until they have been evaluated for tenure. I expect this research to provoke some difficult discussions at universities. Better policies could help economics  —   not to mention the sciences and other fields  —   look like less of a boys’ club. The University of Michigan, where I work, recently adopted a tenure extension policy that explicitly recognizes the effects of pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions. Ms.   said that at the business school, “men don’t get extensions unless they have clear and compelling circumstances. ” At this point, so few universities have adopted policies that treat mothers differently from fathers that researchers can’t assess them precisely. Ms. Stearns, one of the study’s authors, noted that   policies aren’t, in themselves, bad. Standard parental leave policies outside the academic world offer a benefit that “is the same for men and women  —   both don’t go to work for six weeks. ” She argued that parental leave is a case where   policies may specifically help women by “decreasing stigma about use. ” The tenure extension policy that she analyzed, though, “is unique in that it is designed to change productivity evaluations of new parents. ” Gender neutrality in this case may be more problematic, she said. Economics remains a   field, and the research shows that policies fueled by the best intentions of universities have made an imbalance worse. Three female economists have shown that the tools of economics  —   which enable a careful assessment of incentives and constraints informed by   data  —   suggest that a more nuanced policy would lead to better outcomes. It leaves me wondering how many other policy mistakes we could avoid, if only we had more female economists.",0

1094,War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat,"2016 presidential campaign A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
Are most Americans warlike, or are they just easily misled into going along with the War Party that dominates both halves of the duopoly? In a certain sense, the distinction doesn’t matter. Most American don’t care enough about the lives of the millions of victims of U.S. empire to do much of anything to save them. And, if they voted for Hillary Clinton, they did not even have the presence of mind to save themselves from nuclear annihilation. War Less Imminent After Clinton Defeat A Black Agenda Radio commentary by executive editor Glen Ford 
“Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS.” 
With so many people who call themselves liberals and leftists tearing their hair out in dread of a President Donald Trump, it is necessary to point out that the prospects of avoiding nuclear war are much better than they were the day before the election. Hillary Clinton was committed to imposing a “no fly zone” over Syria that would have meant instant war with Russia, likely resulting in the annihilation of the human species. You’d think that would have made Clinton anathema to decent people. But Americans, including those who call themselves liberals, are not decent people – not really. Based on their political behavior, they just pretend to be decent, but support U.S. governments that have slaughtered millions since the end of World War Two. If you voted for Obama and Clinton, you gave your assent to continuing George Bush’s wars, allowing Obama to start two major wars of his own, in Libya and Syria, and to Hillary Clinton’s plans to roll the nuclear dice on the fate of humanity. The whole world knows that Americans are dangerous, to themselves and to others. But, decent? Since when, and to whom? 
Donald Trump looks and talks like the ugly, racist, bullying American -- and he is exactly that, but he hasn’t killed anybody yet, and his public statements have been of a far more peaceful nature than the woman he beat at the polls. Trump says he wants to cooperate with the Syrians and the Russians to defeat ISIS. Trump also does not make distinctions between the various Islamic jihadist groups in Syria, unlike the Obama administration, which has directly and indirectly armed and funded all of the jihadist groups, and has spent much of the last several months trying to protect the al Nusra Front, the al Qaida affiliate in eastern Aleppo, from Russian bombing. 
“The jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising.” 
No sooner had the votes been counted, than President Obama ordered U.S. Special Forces to go all-out to kill the leadership of al-Nusra. 
This war has been entirely based on lies, so Obama will probably limit his Kill List to al Qaida leaders, while sparing the rank and file jihadist fighters for future use by the United States. But it is safe to say that, had Hillary Clinton been elected, the most warlike factions in the U.S. military, the CIA, the State Department, and the foreign policy establishment at-large would be setting the stage for full-scale confrontation with Russia and all of Syria’s allies under President Clinton. Instead, the jihadists are in despair, and the prospects for driving them out of Aleppo look promising. Hopefully, the Syrian government and its friends will be on the road to victory before Donald Trump’s presidency is decisively captured by the bipartisan War Party that runs the empire. 
Syrian President Bashar Assad says it’s fine with him if Trump wants to fight the terrorists. But, Assad isn’t sure that Trump can deliver on his campaign pledge. “What about the countervailing forces within the administration, the mainstream media that were against him?” Assad asks . Assad thinks the notion of Trump bucking the War Party is “dubious.” He’s right. Half a million Syrians are dead because most Americans don’t much care who their government kills, as long as they’re not white. But, getting rid of Clinton has slowed the War Party down a bit, and maybe prevented a nuclear war. If you are a decent person, you should be pleased about that.

1095,MI5 Chief Presents Russia as Growing Threat to British Interests,"Insists Russia Defines Itself by Opposition to the West   
The first time a top British spy has ever given a newspaper interview, MI5 chief Andrew Parker has spoken with the Guardian , playing up the “growing threat” posed by Russia against British interests around the world. 
Parker claimed a “whole range of state organs and powers” in Russia are being brought to bear against Britain and the US, claiming that the advent of cyberwarfare has increased the number of ways in which Russia can move against them. 
Parker went on to claim that Russia defines itself by opposition to the West and, despite being a “covert threat for decades” has been increasingly hostile, citing their operations in Ukraine and Syria as proof that they are acting to just spite the West. 
This has been a common western talking point, but in practice Western (read: US) policy in both Ukraine and Syria appears to have itself been built with an eye toward being on the opposite side from Russia in the first place, and Russia is then condemned for acting in their own interests. 
This was particularly glaring in Syria, where Russia’s interest was obviously in the survival of a friendly Syrian government to host their naval base, and where “countering” Russia has brought the US “anti-ISIS coalition” into increasingly overt support for al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front, simply because they’re the ones most directly fighting against Russia.

1096,How Washington State Upended Trump’s Travel Ban - The New York Times,"While President Trump’s travel ban threw American airports into chaos last weekend, Bob Ferguson, the attorney general of Washington State, was biding his time on an airplane. On his way home from a conference of Democratic attorneys general in Florida, Mr. Ferguson landed a week ago in the center of a political and legal firestorm.   International Airport was in disarray, with protests massing. Gov. Jay Inslee, a fellow Democrat, had sent word to the attorney general’s staff that he wanted to mount a   attack on the president’s decree. Within two days, Mr. Ferguson had become a leading combatant in a battle with the president of the United States, filing a dramatic challenge to Mr. Trump’s travel ban that yielded a ruling from a federal judge on Friday freezing the order’s implementation. A genial    with an earnest demeanor, Mr. Ferguson cuts an unlikely figure as an antagonist for the most pugilistic president in modern times. He is seen in the state less as a   showman than as a former member of the King County Council with a wonky sensibility and an eager manner. But Mr. Ferguson, by his own account and the description of his associates, was incensed and offended by Mr. Trump’s sweeping immigration restrictions. And having landed in Seattle on the first full day the ban was in effect  —   while demonstrations grew across the country  —   he went home to greet his family and then went to work devising a plan to cripple Mr. Trump’s new policy. In an interview, Mr. Ferguson said he had concluded from the start that Mr. Trump’s order was “unlawful and unconstitutional,” and that any appropriate response would have to aim at neutering it entirely. Eschewing the approach of other   states, which have challenged Mr. Trump’s order by highlighting the claims of individual plaintiffs, Mr. Ferguson and his office opted to draft a complaint arguing that the ban would cause drastic damage to Washington State as a whole. Mr. Ferguson said that the state solicitor general, Noah Purcell, a former Supreme Court clerk for David H. Souter, had suggested last weekend that the state enlist major private companies as allies. And so the attorney general spoke by telephone with a host of executives, including the corporate counsels of Expedia and Amazon, who agreed to supply forceful declarations for the state’s suit, describing the damage that the White House order could inflict. Mr. Ferguson said he had recognized at the time that this was a potentially risky approach, seeking a more sweeping victory with a comparatively untested legal strategy. But Mr. Ferguson, a former state chess champion, explained in precise language that he had decided it was a gamble worth taking. “From my standpoint there is risk in everything, but I am someone who believes in calculated risk,” Mr. Ferguson said in the interview. “One just needs to be comfortable with that. And when it comes to the constitutional rights of my people, the people I represent, I’m prepared to take a calculated risk on their behalf. ” Mr. Inslee, also in an interview, said he strongly backed Mr. Ferguson’s approach, viewing Mr. Trump’s order as a unique threat to their state’s economy, which depends heavily on international trade, and to the state’s diverse population. In his view, the governor said, the state was right to make “any plausible claim” to take down the order. Few other states adopted such a daring strategy. Mr. Ferguson said he had invited other Democratic attorneys general to join in his lawsuit, finding only one taker so far: Lori Swanson of Minnesota. Mr. Ferguson said there were other states still weighing whether to join him. Mr. Inslee described the Friday ruling as a special kind of victory for Washington State, which draws relatively little attention in national politics but tends to race ahead of national trends on social issues. “It’s part of our nature and history,” Mr. Inslee said. “This is the first time this administration has been reined in. ”",0
1097,"To Protect and Swerve: Police Chief Caught Speeding, Gets a Laugh but No Ticket (Video)","
Video footage of a police chief being pulled over for traveling at speeds above 100 miles per hour was only released after one irritated citizen watched the top cop drive into the sunset without as much as a ticket.

Some criminals are let off with a slap on the wrist, but one Arkansas police chief got off with a slap on the wrist for speeding, with responding officers laughing during the traffic stop.
Brinkley Police Department Chief Edward Randle was pulled over by a state trooper who had been called for assistance by a Brinkley police officer. However, any concern the trooper may have had quickly disappeared when he recognized Randle while approaching the truck.
“ Where are you going so fast? ” the trooper asked Randle, chuckling. Randle told the trooper that he was heading to “ the game ,” a football game he was refereeing later that evening, KTHV reported .
When the Brinkley officer approached the vehicle, Randle proceeded to give him a hard time, saying: “I know you didn’t call the state police!” The officer explained that he did not announce the truck’s license plate into the reading, saying, “ I didn’t have your plate, so it didn’t go over. ”
The only time the reason for Randle’s speeding was mentioned in the recording was when the state trooper told him, “ I had you locked in at 107 [miles per hour]. ”
“ It won’t go over 95, ” Randle replied.
Randle continued to defend himself using this argument, telling KTHV that the truck has a governor device on the engine that prevents it from going above 95 miles (153 km) per hour. However, the officer told Randle that he was driving 90 miles (145 km) per hour and was still only trailing Randle.
Randle denied going close to 95 miles per hour, he even denied the trooper’s comment that he had been driving “ 71 (114 km) at the curve. ”
The confrontation ended quickly with all parties going their separate ways after a sum total of 45 seconds. The whole issue would have likely flown under the radar, had it not been for a citizen who witnessed it.
Benjamin Martin was leaving Clarendon, a nearby town, when he noticed the Brinkley police car in Clarendon city limits and pulled over to watch. What he saw troubled him, to say the least.
“ I find it, you know, very disheartening, that anyone, public official or not, would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit, and put the lives of innocent others at risk, ” Martin told KHTV, adding, “ I just feel that no one’s above the law, and you know, if it was me, I would’ve gotten a ticket. ”
Martin continued, “ As a chief of police, and as a law enforcement officer, you’re sworn to protect and serve, which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk. ”
However, Randle feels differently and claimed that after nearly three decades in law enforcement, he knows better than to put others at risk with dangerous driving. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

1098,"Fake News on Trump Hits Mexico, Explodes","McALLEN, Texas  —   A story wildly circulated by Mexican news outlets about a woman having her visa taken away because she had memes making fun of U. S. President Donald J. Trump has been deemed false by U. S. authorities. [The story began when Mexican media celebrity Denise Maerker reported on her show Atando Cabos that a woman in one of the Tijuana border crossings had her visa taken away by an immigration official because she had various memes making fun of Trump. Maerker took to Twitter to comment on the story and credited a journalist by the name Rocio Galvan.   Various news outlets like Radio Formula, El 5inco, El Mañana, and others went off Maerker’s tweet to further disseminate the story. The uncertainty caused by the alleged arbitrary measure spread on social media as various individuals began to ask about the case.  “There were no such events that occurred within any ports within the San Diego Field Office,” U. S. Customs and Border Protection responded to an inquiry by Breitbart Texas into the stories circulated by Mexican media. Breitbart Texas also requested similar information from ports of entry in Texas, and Arizona and received similar answers.  By Friday afternoon, Maerker sent a retraction of sorts in a second tweet and had Galvan back on her show, where they clarified that the woman who had her visa taken away was never told that it was over the Trump memes.  According to CBP, officers have the authority to cancel visas if the individual is found to be inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The act lists the grounds for denial of entry into the country including health related reasons, criminality, security, immigration violations and others the act does not list memes or jokes as a reason for canceling denial.

The CIJ team also published an address from MacFadyen’s wife and member of Julian Assange’s Defense Fund, Susan Benn, who described her husband as a “ larger-than-life person, ” with gratitude and respect. 
“ He was the model of what a journalist should be… He spearheaded the creation of a journalistic landscape which has irrevocably lifted the bar for ethical and hard-hitting reporting. Gavin worked tirelessly to hold power to account. 
“His life and how he lived it were completely in sync with the principles that he held dear and practiced as a journalist and educator – to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, ” Benn wrote .

1100,Former CIA Director Blames Millennials For WikiLeaks Documents - Breitbart,"Michael Hayden, the former director of the CIA, has claimed that millennials are more likely to leak information due to “cultural differences. ”[Speaking to the BBC following the publishing of WikiLeaks Vault 7 documents, former CIA director Michael Hayden stated that he believes millennials employed by the American security services are likely to leak classified information due to “cultural differences. ”  “I don’t mean to judge them at all, but this group of millennials and related groups simply have different understandings of the words loyalty, secrecy, and transparency than certainly my generation did,” said Hayden speaking to the BBC. “So we bring these folks into the agency  —   good Americans, all, I assume  —   but culturally they have different instincts than the people who made the decision to hire them. ” Hayden continued, “We may be running into this different cultural approach that we saw with Chelsea Manning, with Edward Snowden and now, perhaps, with a third actor. ” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

1101,Who Will Tell the Story of Slavery? - The New York Times,"RICHMOND, VA.  —   Here in the onetime capital of the Confederacy, at the end of the city’s Slave Trail, stands the latest repository for the   dream of L. Douglas Wilder. The     building, with Greek Doric columns flanking the entrance, was once the home of Richmond’s first   Baptist church. For the trailblazing Mr. Wilder, the nation’s first elected   governor, it represents the ideal setting for the United States National Slavery Museum, an institution he has struggled to create for nearly two and a half decades. The building is only an hour’s drive from the Fredericksburg site where Mr. Wilder’s first vision for the project, a $100 million museum designed by one of the world’s leading architecture firms, collapsed amid a welter of debt and recriminations. Two years ago, Mr. Wilder announced his latest plan at a news conference at the state Capitol, a more modest proposal, in an existing building in a town he’s long called home and where his government service and star power can still draw admirers. But this museum project appears no closer to reality than the last. The organization’s most recent tax filing, for 2014, reveals contributions of $0. His new   site, the former First African Baptist Church, is still owned by Virginia Commonwealth University and houses its department of clinical laboratory services. And just over a   away, where a notorious   compound known as “The Devil’s Half Acre” stood, a competing slavery museum proposal  —   championed by this city’s mayor and seeded with $18 million in state and city funding  —   is barreling toward groundbreaking in the fall of 2017. As the $540 million National Museum of African American History and Culture on the Mall in Washington prepares to open this fall, more attention than ever will be paid to the story of slavery and emancipation that Mr. Wilder has sought to recount and memorialize. But his institution will not be a part of that conversation, its artifacts in storage, its allies dwindling and its prospects approaching quixotic. Mr. Wilder, still prickly and proud at 85, remains undaunted. He declined to comment for this article, but in a memoir published last year, he said he’s optimistic his museum could be ready by 2019, the 400th anniversary of the first African slaves arriving in Jamestown. “My struggle has constantly been referred to as a ‘personal crusade,’ implying that it is something I would benefit from in some way,” Mr. Wilder wrote in “Son of Virginia: A Life in America’s Political Arena. ” “Combating that assumption is one reason I have persisted. This is not a personal crusade but a national necessity. ” And the grit of this grandson of slaves, who served in Korea but still had to leave Virginia to find a law school that would admit him, has long been acknowledged. “Governor Wilder has always struck me as a man of great determination and persistence,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, in Fredericksburg. “For him to accomplish what he did, starting in the days of Jim Crow, is an extraordinary accomplishment. And sometimes persistent, determined politicians need to remain persistent and determined to get their initiatives to come to fruition. ” The inspiration for a slavery museum came to Mr. Wilder during a trade mission to Africa he took as governor of Virginia in the early 1990s. In Senegal, he toured the slave houses and, as he recounts in his memoir, “saw how human beings were stuffed into bins, inspected and priced like products, branded like cattle, and packed into the holds of ships. ” “I returned from Africa,” he added, “with a single thought burning in my mind: We had to tell the story and keep our history alive as a charge of eternal vigilance. ” Last decade, he appeared close to realizing his vision. The museum project was given 38 acres by a developer to use as part of a “Celebrate Virginia” tourism and shopping complex in Fredericksburg. The architect C. C. Pei, a son of I. M. Pei, designed a modernist    building, its two halves connected by an atrium in which a replica of a slave ship was to be hung. Bill Cosby donated $1. 2 million. Companies like Philip Morris USA and the Wachovia Corporation pledged   sums. By 2011, though, the museum, strapped for funds to pay city real estate taxes, filed for bankruptcy. Some people who had donated their treasured artifacts demanded them back. The land where the museum was supposed to rise was sold last year. A mix of bafflement and bad feelings still resides in Fredericksburg. “The first inkling I had that something wasn’t right was when Wilder came and met with the Fredericksburg City Council in a closed session,” in 2001, said the city’s mayor at the time, Bill Beck. “He was obviously sincere about the issue and the subject matter. But it struck me that for a guy who’d been talking about a museum at that point for a number of years he really hadn’t given much thought to how a museum operates and what a museum is. ” Mr. Wilder first told the council his museum would cover a period of history that ended with the Civil War, Mr. Beck said. Then, a few minutes later, he suggested that the museum should take the story through the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. Mr. Beck said that he was frustrated by the lack of transparency and professionalism surrounding the project. He said the council, for example, learned the museum might be coming to Fredericksburg only when Mr. Wilder broke the news at a gathering of slave descendants at Montpelier, the estate of James Madison. “He never did any of the things you would do in terms of starting a museum,” he said. Mr. Beck, an antiques dealer, said he was not impressed by items from the collection displayed at a local university in 2004 and didn’t think the museum had hired enough professionals to staff such an ambitious venture. “He never did anything practical,” he said. “It was all show. ” In his memoir, Mr. Wilder writes that he’s at a loss “to fully explain why the project got so badly bogged down. ” Several possible culprits are cited: the city’s refusal to grant the museum   status   competition from other museums, including the Smithsonian’s   museum a deep recession. But foremost, Mr. Wilder said he felt the location was all wrong. Fredericksburg, he wrote in his memoir, was “off the beaten track for tourism. ” Mr. Beck, told of that explanation, tried, but failed, to suppress a chuckle. A significant Civil War battle was fought in Fredericksburg, and George Washington’s boyhood home is just across the river. “We’re not Rockefeller Center,” he said, “but that’s really kind of silly. ” Mr. Wilder has maintained that Richmond was always his first choice for the museum and that he’s learned from previous missteps. “The vision that we had in Fredericksburg was grandiose,” Mr. Wilder said in 2014. “That’s not going to be the case here. The building is built, and it would fit the needs of the museum. ” Except that some of the problems from Fredericksburg  —   communication breakdowns with local officials, for example  —   have resurfaced in Richmond. The building, the former First African Baptist Church, holds deep significance for Mr. Wilder. As a child, he attended Sunday school there, and both his father and grandfather were deacons and trustees. Yet its owner, V. C. U.  —   where the School of Government and Public Affairs is named after Mr. Wilder and where he teaches  —   was caught off guard by his formal announcement. Although Mr. Wilder had casually mentioned the idea to the university’s president over lunch a week before the news conference, the university said no commitment was given. More than two years later, little has changed. In a statement, V. C. U. acknowledged Mr. Wilder’s interest and noted that state funding had come through for a new building for the School of Allied Health Professions that would allow the school to vacate the former church. But, the statement continued, “a number of details about construction of the new building and relocation of the offices will need to be worked out before we can continue the conversation about the slavery museum proposal. ” Talks with the city  —   which controls the state funding for a heritage site  —   have been nonexistent. “I have not heard from anyone about any new ideas for another museum,” Mayor Dwight C. Jones said. Mr. Jones talks emotionally about the historical imperative of building a slavery museum in a city replete with Confederate monuments. But he and others favor not the church but a new museum and pavilion on the site of what was once Lumpkin’s Jail, where slaves were held in horrific conditions before being sold at auction. During the height of the interstate slave trade, when Richmond trailed only New Orleans in sales, Lumpkin’s was arguably the most infamous slave jail in the center of the city’s chattel business. After the Civil War, Robert Lumpkin’s widow, a former slave named Mary, leased the property to a Baptist minister seeking to build a seminary for freed slaves. It eventually became Virginia Union University. What had been known as “The Devil’s Half Acre” had become “God’s Half Acre. ” “You had enslavement you had emancipation then education and enlightenment,” said Delores L. McQuinn, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and chairwoman of the Richmond Slave Trail Commission. Ms. McQuinn, a champion of the jail site, recalled bumping into Mr. Wilder several years ago during a ceremony to unveil plaques honoring   who served Virginia during Reconstruction. “I said to him at the time: ‘You’re looking for a museum, and we’re working toward that. Is it something we could join forces to do? ’” Ms. McQuinn said. “He said he’d get back with me. I have not heard anything from him. ” And it’s difficult to imagine much good will between those behind the two projects since Mr. Wilder, who served as mayor before Mr. Jones, publicly lambasted his successor and his administration earlier this year. Mr. Jones did not answer directly when asked if Mr. Wilder’s criticism made cooperation more difficult, saying only, “We have the money, we have the site, and what we’re doing is going to happen. ” The city’s plans for the jail site are underway. Architectural and engineering contracts will be awarded soon, and the groundbreaking is projected for next year. Mr. Jones controls $10 million committed by the state and another $8 million from the city for the project. It’s unclear how much money Mr. Wilder’s museum organization has at this point. The museum was able to sell the land in Fredericksburg last year for $400, 000. The math and the politics do not look promising for Mr. Wilder. “The city’s project seems to be on a firmer financial footing, and that will be decisive in all likelihood,” said Mr. Farnsworth, the professor. “And I’m not sure that two separate visions for the same project can both be constructed. ” Still, Mr. Farnsworth doesn’t count out the tenacious Mr. Wilder from securing a role in whatever slavery museum does get built in Richmond. A rambunctious mayoral election is underway. The incumbent, Mr. Jones, is bumping up against term limits. Eight candidates are vying to succeed him. At least one is considered an ally of Mr. Wilder, who recently helped organize and moderate a mayoral forum. Yes, L. Douglas Wilder’s embrace may not carry as much weight as it did when he was governor or Richmond mayor. But he is still L. Douglas Wilder, still a Virginia institution, and he does not go down easy.",0
