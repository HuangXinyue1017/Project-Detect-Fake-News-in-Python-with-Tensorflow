18114,Matt Schlapp: CPAC 2017 Is About ’What Do We Do Now?’,"The president of the American Conservative Union, the sponsor of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, told Breitbart News Sunday host Matt Boyle that this year’s CPAC is about action after years of protest over taxes, regulations, and Obamacare. [“Now the question is: Are we really going to get it done?” said Matt Schlapp, who leads the ACU, one of the leading conservative group’s in the country and the keeper of the ACU Ratings scorecard.  Schlapp told Boyle that after the political victories of 2016, conservatives gather at CPAC, which opens Wednesday and runs through Saturday morning, to make sure the politicians fulfill the promises made to conservative activists. “How do we repeal and replace Obamacare? What is the right tax package to get passed into law?” he asked. “What can we do to stop these regulations? What can we do to keep Americans safe from Islamic terrorists? It is going to be a   of the actual ways that policies getting impacted. ” This is not the time for theories, he said. “It’s real. It’s: What do we have to do now?” Schlapp said. “As happens every time at CPAC, there’s going to be times when the movement and grassroots activists have to push those in government  —  even those we respect. ” The Conservative Political Action Conference began in 1973 as a partnership between the ACU and Young Americans for Freedom. It was part of the same movement by conservatives that supported Rep. John Ashbrook to oppose President Richard Nixon in the 1972 Republican primaries and led to the founding of the Heritage Foundation and the Republican Study Committee. Unlike any other annual political gathering, CPAC has always been full of college and high school students mixing with the activists and the dynamic is about the politicians coming to see the conservatives and make their case —  not the other way around. In addition to Republican office holders, administration officials and conservative thought leaders, Breitbart Technology Editor Milo Yiannopoulos is scheduled to deliver CPAC’s keynote address. Schlapp said with Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, the expectations are very high. Another highlight of the 2017 CPAC is the joint conversation with White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon facilitated by Schlapp. He said: “I think there are a lot of questions that people in the audience probably want me to ask —  like: Hey, how’s it all working up there?” Boyle told Schlapp that he remembered when President Donald Trump spoke at the 2013 CPAC. “He really lit the room on fire. ” Is Trump coming to CPAC this year? he asked Schlapp. “Well, I’m hopeful he’ll be there,” Schlapp said. Trump’s 2016 appearance was canceled at the last minute in favor of a campaign stop. “He has been to CPAC, I think, for five years or so,” he said. “You never know what he is going to do, which is why he is a political genius in a lot of ways. I’m hoping he doesn’t just read a script. I hope, if he comes, he speaks from the heart and thanks these activists. “Trump knows these are the activists who helped put him in the White House. ” In the   to Wednesday’s CPAC opening Schlapp and his wife Mercedes have their show on SiriusXM’s Patriot Channel 125 “The Road to CPAC 2017,” where they talk about the conference and what people can expect.

18115,"US Public Opinion Speaks to Anti-Militarism, the Electorate Votes for Warmongers    : Information"," US Public Opinion Speaks to Anti-Militarism, the Electorate Votes for Warmongers By James Petras November 14, Castigating the US electorate as accomplices and facilitators of wars, or, at best, dismissing the voters as ignorant sheep-people (sheeple) herded by political elites, describes a partial reality. Public opinion polls, even the polls overwhelmingly slanted toward the center-right, consistently describe a citizenry opposed to militarism and wars, past and present.
Both the Right and Left have failed to grasp the contradiction that defines US political life: Namely, the profound gap between the American public and the Washington elite on questions of war and peace within an electoral process that consistently leads to more militarism.
This is an analysis of the most recent US public opinion polls with regard to outcome of the recent elections. The essay concludes with a discussion of the deep-seated contradictions and proposes several ways in which these contradictions can be resolved.
Method
A major survey of public opinion, sponsored by the Charles Koch Institute and the Center for the National Interest, conducted by the Survey Sampling International, interviewed a sample of one thousand respondents.
The Results: War or Peace
More than half of the American public oppose any increase is the US military role overseas while only 25% back military expansion.
The public has expressed its disillusionment over Obamas foreign policy, especially his new military commitments in the Middle East, which have been heavily promoted by the state of Israel and its US domestic Zionist lobby.
The US public shows a deep historical memory with regard to the past military debacles launched by Presidents Bush and Obama. Over half of the public (51%) believe that the US has become less safe over the past 15 years (2001-2015), while one eighth (13%) feel they are more secure.
In the present period, over half of the public opposes the deployment of ground troops to Syria and Yemen and only 10% favor continued US support for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
With regard to specific US wars, over half believe that Bushs invasion of Iraq made the US homeland less secure, while only 25% believe it didnt increase or decrease domestic security. Similar responses were expressed with regard to Afghanistan: 42% believe the Afghan War increased insecurity and about a third (34%) felt it did not affect US security.
In terms of future perspectives, three quarters (75%) of the American public want the next President to focus less on the US military operations abroad or are uncertain about its role. Only 37% are in favor of increased spending for the military.
The mass media and the powerful financial backers of the Democratic Presidential candidate have focused on demonizing Russia and China as the greatest threats in our time. In contrast, almost two thirds (63.4%) of Americans believe the greatest threat comes from terrorism both foreign and domestic. Only 18% view Russia and China as major threats to their security.
In regard to the Pentagon, 56% want to reduce or freeze current military spending while only 37% want to increase it.
Wars and Peace: The Political Elites
Contrary to the views of a majority of the public, the last four US Presidents, since the 1990s, have increased the military budget, sending hundreds of thousands of US troops to launch wars in three Middle Eastern countries, while promoting bloody civil wars in three North African and two European countries. Despite public opinion majorities, who believe that the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq have increased threats to the US security, Obama kept ground troops, air and sea forces and drone operations in those countries. Despite only 10% public approval for his military policies, the Obama regime has sent arms, advisors and Special Forces to support the Saudi dictatorships invasion of tiny Yemen.
Obama and the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pushed a policy of encircling Russia and demonizing its President Putin as the greatest threat to the US in contrast to US opinion, which considers the threat of Islamist terrorism as five times more serious.
While the political elite and the leading Presidential candidates promise to expand the number of US troops abroad and increase military spending, over three quarters of the American public oppose or are uncertain about expanding US militarism.
While candidate Clinton campaigned for the deployment of the US Air Force jets and missiles to police a no fly zone in Syria, even shooting down Syrian and Russian government planes, the majority of US public opposed it by 51%.
In terms of constitutional law, fully four-fifths (80%) of the US public believes the President must secure Congressional approval for additional military action abroad. Nevertheless, Presidents from both parties, Bush and Obama launched wars without Congressional approval, creating a precedent which the next president is likely to exploit.
Analysis and Perspectives
On all major foreign policy issues related to waging war abroad, the political elite is far more bellicose than the US public; they are far more likely to ignite wars that ultimately threaten domestic security; they are more likely to violate the Constitutional provisions on the declaration of war; and they are committed to increasing military spending even at the risk of defunding vital domestic social programs.
The political elites are more likely to intervene in wars in the Middle East, without domestic support and even in spite of majoritarian popular opposition to war. No doubt the executives of the oligarchical military-industrial complex, the pro-Israel power configuration and the mass media moguls are far more influential than the pro-democracy public.
The future portends a continuation of militarism by the political elites, and increase in domestic security threats and even less public representation.
Some Hypothesis on the Contradiction between Popular Opinion and Electoral Outcomes
There is clearly a substantial gap between the majority of Americans and the political elite regarding the role of the military in overseas wars, the undermining of constitutional prerogatives, the demonization of Russia, the deployment of US troops to Syria and deeper US entanglement in Middle East wars for the benefit of Israel.
Yet it is also a fact that the US electorate continue to vote for the two major political parties which have consistently supported wars, formed military alliances with warring Middle East states, especially Saudi Arabia and Israel and aggressively sanctioned Russia as the main threat to US security.
Several hypotheses regarding this contradiction should be considered:
1. Close to 50% of the eligible voters abstain from voting in Presidential and Congressional elections. This most likely includes many among the majority of Americans who oppose the expansion of the US military role overseas. In fact, the war party winner typically claims victory with less than 25% of the electorate  and threats this as a mandate to launch more wars.
2. The fact that the mass media vehemently supports one or the other of the two war parties probably influences a minority of the electorate who decide to actually participate in the elections. However, critics have exaggerated the mass medias influence and fail to explain why the majority of the American public disagree with the mass media and oppose the militarist propaganda.
3. Many Americans, while opposed to militarism, vote for the lesser evil between the two war parties. They may believe that there are greater and lesser degrees of war mongering and choose the less strident.
4. Americans, who consistently oppose militarism, may decide to vote for militarist politicians for reasons besides those of overseas wars. For example, majoritarian Americans may support a militarist politician who has secured funding for local infrastructure programs, or protected farm and dairy subsidies, or who promises jobs programs, lowers public debt or opposes corrupt incumbents.
5. Americans, opposed to militarism, may be deceived by the pronouncements of a demagogic presidential candidate from one of the war parties, whose promise of peace will give way to escalating wars.
6. Likewise, the emphasis on identity politics can deceive anti-war voters into supporting a proven militarist because of issues related to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual preferences or loyalties to overseas states.
7. The war parties work together to block mass media access for anti-militarist parties, especially preventing their participation in national electoral debates viewed by tens of millions of voters. War parties collude to set impossible restrictions against anti-militarist party participation in national level elections, banning citizens with non-violent police records or former convicts who have served their sentences from voting. They reject poor citizens who lack photo identification, limit access to transport to voting sites, limit the number of polling places in poor or minority neighborhoods and deny time-off for workers to vote. Unlike other countries, US elections are held on a work day and many workers are unable to vote.
In other words the electoral process is rigged and imposes forced voting and abstention: Collusion between the two war parties limits voter choice to abstention or casting a ballot for the lesser evil among the militarists.
Only if elections were open and democratic, where anti-militarist parties were allowed equal rights to register, participate and debate in the mass media, and where campaign financing were made equal would the contradictions between the wishes of the anti-militarist majorities and votes cast for pro-war elites be resolved.

18116,Thousands Expected to Rally for Expanded School Choice in Texas,"An estimated 4, 000 Texans are expected to rally in Austin today to show their support for expanded school choice during National School Choice Week. They will bring their message to the south steps of the Capitol building. [Governor Greg Abbott and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, the state’s top school choice proponents, will speak at today’s rally. The event begins at 10 a. m. with a march on south lawn at the Capitol followed by the annual rally with more than 20 other Texas elected officials.  Abbott proclaimed January 22 through January 28, school choice week in Texas, reaffirming his commitment to “support families’ ability to choose the educational environment that best suits their children’s needs. ” In 2015, he underscored the relevance of a parent’s role in a child’s education. Last year, he signed a school choice week proclamation highlighting the importance “for parents in Texas to explore and identify the best education options available to their sons and daughters, as research demonstrates that providing children with multiple education options improves academic performance. ” Organizer Randan Steinhauser called this year’s rally a “reminder to our legislators that parents in Texas want more education freedom. ” She said: “The demand for more school choice is widespread and it’s time for Texas to join the growing number of states that allow parents the opportunity to choose their child’s education. ” While Texas already offers school choice options like magnet and public charter schools, plus private and home schools, lawmakers hope to expand access for the state’s   children through legislation that would create an education savings account (ESA) program. In 2016, the Lt. Governor made the case for ESA’s in a series of Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute (TCCRI) policy summits on education choice held around the state. It featured  panels of state legislators who support this kind of school choice plus Steinhauser and others who promoted ESA’s allow parents to have more choice in their children’s education, particularly for children stuck in a failing public school. Roughly 5. 3 million children attend   through grade 12 in one of the state’s   public schools. The   Public Education Grant (PEG) program listed 1, 379 struggling campuses, inching down from the even higher 1, 532 failing schools on the   PEG list. According to the Texas Charter Schools Association, 129, 589 students were on charter school wait lists in 2014. Proponents say school choice affords children access to educational settings that best fit them while empowering their parents to become more involved in the education process. U. S. Senator Ted Cruz called school choice “the civil rights issue of the 21st Century” in 2014. He supports universal ESA’s. In September, Daniel Garza, president of the nonprofit Libre Initiative, spoke at a   TCCRI summit in support of ESA’s and other similar tax credit scholarships and savings grant programs. He said they provided more educational opportunities to Texas’ Hispanic families. Garza cited the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP) a Washington, D. C.   private school student voucher program for   children, which he maintained had a 91 percent graduation rate, 30 percent higher than their public school peers. At press time, ESA legislation was not filed yet but the issue already stirred up strong opposition from the state’s teacher unions and associations. They assert school choice undermines traditional public schools by diverting public taxpayer dollars away from their coffers, are not held to the same accountability standards, and are not unionized. Lobbyist organizations like the Texas Association of School Boards (TASB) vow to stop vouchers. The Texas Association of School Administrators (TASA) stand against school choice programs.   also balked at the state’s new public school   accountability ratings system. Advocacy groups like Texas Kids Can’t Wait only support public schools Raise Your Hand Texas also opposes school choice. Some homeschool parents also have expressed wariness of ESA’s fearing that privately funded school choice will have “strings attached” and bring government intervention and regulation that will impact the state’s   for homeschooling liberties. As one parent told Breitbart Texas, “I love the idea of ESA’s, I just want to make sure we don’t lose freedoms we now enjoy (because of them). ” Event organizers include Texas for Education Opportunity, LIBRE Initiative, the Texas Private Schools Association, Texas Homeschool Coalition, Texas Charter Schools Association, Texas Public Policy Foundation, Texas Catholic Conference, ResponsiveEd, Families Empowered, Public School Options, Aspire Texas, EdChoice, Texans for Education Opportunity, Americans for Prosperity  —   Texas, The Justice Foundation, Agudath Israel, Texas Business Leadership Council, Texas Association of Business, Connections Academy, Institute for Justice, and the Texas Conservative Coalition. National School Choice Week is a nonpartisan, independent public awareness effort to raise public awareness about educational choices available to children such including traditional public schools, public charter schools, public magnet schools, online learning, private schools, and homeschooling. The first National School Choice Week, in 2011, consisted of only 150 events. Tuesday’s   rally is one of 21, 392 nationwide events, including 1, 593 in Texas, to promote school choice over a week that kicked off on Sunday, January 22, and runs through Saturday, January 28.

18117,Spain To Review Permission For Syria Bound Russian Ships To Refuel,"  Carol Adl in News , World // 1 Comment 
Spain is having to review its decision to allow Russian warships to refuel at one of its ports amid international outrage. 
“The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,” the Spanish foreign ministry said. 
A naval fleet headed by the Admiral Kuznetzov aircraft carrier, which passed through the English Channel last week, was expected to dock this morning in the autonomous enclave of Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain’s Foreign Ministry. 
NATO, the British government & EU officials have expressed anger even though Spain says Russia’s warships have been mooring there “for years.” 
The Independent reports: 
Asked about Spain’s role in supplying the fleet, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato Secretary-General, said he was “concerned”. 
“I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia’s ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,” he added. 
“I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all Nato allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.” 
Guy Verhofstadt, president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament, called Spain’s decision “scandalous”. 
He wrote on Twitter: “Spain signed EU statement on Russian war crimes in Aleppo last week – today [Tuesday] helps refuel fleet on way to commit more atrocities. Seriously?” 
The UK said that although access to Spanish ports was a matter for local authorities, concerns had been raised. 
“Her Majesty’s government has previously expressed concerns to the Spanish government about its hospitality to the Russian navy when we have concerns about Russia’s military activity,” a British Government spokesperson said. 
Spain, a Nato member, regularly allows Russian war ships to stop in its enclave of Ceuta, which borders Morocco at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea. 
A spokesperson for the foreign ministry told El Pais permission was granted on a case-by-case basis depending on the ship in question and possibly security risks. 
“We are looking at the latest [supply] stops requested based on information requested by Russian authorities,” he added. 
Intense international media coverage has followed the fleet’s progress from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean, with Royal Navy ships tracking it through the Channel.",0
18118,"New E-mails, More Classified Malfeasance: Clinton & Aides Jeopardized National Security","Email 
The WikiLeaks e-mail releases are not the only revelations Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Campaign team are cursing these days. Official State Department documents released pursuant to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and lawsuits are also delivering severe body blows to Team Clinton’s White House aspirations. 
On Wednesday, Judicial Watch, the government accountability watchdog group, released nearly 70 pages of Department of State (DOS) records confirming that, while secretary of state, Hillary Clinton and her top aides, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan, received and sent classified information on their non-state.gov e-mail accounts. Former Secretary Clinton has repeatedly denied — in interviews, debates, testimony, and speeches — that she divulged any classified material, even though the e-mail evidence and FBI Director James Comey’s testimony contradict that claim. At other times she has fudged, waffled, and evaded questions on this subject, bringing to mind the infamous weasel quote of her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, “It depends on what the meaning of ‘is’ is.” 
The new Judicial Watch e-mails are completely separate from the WikiLeaks e-mails, which the Clinton campaign and its allies have tried to discredit by claiming, without foundation, that they are the product of a Russian intelligence operation. The Judicial Watch documents were obtained recently in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015 lawsuit filed against the DOS after it refused to cooperate with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. That request was seeking: “All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non-‘state.gov’ email address.” 
The newly released documents, which are now also available on the State Department website, were obtained after the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the watchdog group in January ( Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State ). There are thus no grounds for questioning the provenance or authenticity of these recent Clinton e-mail revelations, since they come directly — albeit very reluctantly — from the State Department. Among the new documents are e-mails showing that Hillary Clinton used the clintonemail.com system to ask Huma Abedin (also on a non-state.gov e-mail account) to print two March 2011 e-mails that were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (using the moniker “aclb”) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan’s non-state.gov e-mail account. 
The Obama State Department has redacted the Blair e-mails under the FOIA Exemption (b)(1) rule which allows the withholding of classified material. The material is marked as being classified as “Foreign government information” and “foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources.” The irony is beyond rich, is it not? Secretary Clinton says she didn’t send any classified material by private, unsecured e-mail — while the State Department refuses to release certain of her private e-mails, claiming exemption because, says DOS, the e-mails contain classified information. Reasonable observers might be inclined to take that as an official confirmation that Hillary Rodham Clinton has lied and weaseled — repeatedly, and under oath — on this important national security matter. Is there any other reasonable way to view it? 
In another private e-mail, Clinton asks Huma Abedin how appointments in Washington, including a four-hour meeting concerning the Obama/Clinton war on Libya, would affect her vacation schedule in the Hamptons, the fabulous playground of the ultra-rich. As an aside, the Clintons have been longtime seasonal residents of the Hamptons, where many of their Wall Street and Hollywood billionaire cronies (and donors) own eye-popping mansions on sumptuous estates. Hillary, who regularly tries to make political hay by verbally attacking the rich “one percent,” apparently suffers no qualms of conscience about taking millions of dollars in speaking fees from the most notorious of the one percenters at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Blackstone, etc. Nor do she and Bill flinch at spending $50,000 per week for a beachfront mansion in the Hamptons near their movie mogul pal (and campaign contributor) Harvey Weinstein. Their populist rhetoric and faux working-class appeals notwithstanding, the Clintons are happiest and most comfortable consorting with the top one percent of the top one percent. But back to the e-mails. Responding to a message that details the sensitive Libya meetings in Washington, D.C., Clinton e-mails Abedin on August 26, 2011: “Ok. What time would I get back to Hamptons?” As with tens of thousands of Clinton DOS e-mails, this discussion relative to classified meetings, plans, and official policies, took place on private, unsecure e-mail accounts. 
The new Judicial Watch documents also include advice to Hillary on Libya from veteran Clinton operative Sidney Blumenthal, more infamously known to friend and foe alike as “Sid Vicious,” a reference to the raunchy and rancorous bass guitarist of the punk rock group the Sex Pistols. A reliable hatchet man for the Clintons for three decades, Blumenthal could always be counted on to come up with, and to carry out, dirty tricks to discredit and undermine the Clintons’ opponents. Trouble is, he also attacked and alienated many of the Clintons’ closest confidants, friends, and staff members. When Hillary Clinton wanted to bring Blumenthal on staff at State, President Obama nixed the idea. 
“President Obama would not allow it: key White House staffers had grown to detest the man,” writes James Warren, in an article on Blumenthal in Vanity Fair last July. “Two of them — Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Senior Adviser David Axelrod — threatened to quit if Blumenthal was hired. They believed that he had been involved in spreading unsubstantiated allegations against the Obamas during the 2008 Democratic primary, as detailed in the campaign chronicle Game Change , by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin.” 
Indeed, as has been firmly established, it was Hillary Clinton’s hit man Sid Vicious Blumenthal, not Donald Trump, who started the Obama “birther” controversy, during the 2008 campaign when Clinton and Obama were locked in a fight for the Democratic nomination. (See here and here .)But an operative with Blumenthal’s unique talents for intrigue is always in demand at Foggy Bottom and other shadowy dens of the DC Beltway netherworld. His official rejection at State didn’t mean he was totally out, nor did it prevent him from collecting a check from the Clinton Foundation, where he began pulling down a $10,000/month stipend as a key personal fixer/ambassador for Bill Clinton. He also began collecting a $200,000/year salary as a writer/staffer for Media Matters , the ultra-far-Left media group headed by an equally venomous viper, David Brock, and copiously funded by George Soros, and the Rockefeller, Ford, and Carnegie foundations — among others. But Blumenthal’s big payoffs would be in consultancy fees and partnerships with companies connected to the Clinton Foundation, who would get contracts through the good graces of Hillary Clinton’s State Department. And it is those DOS-Clinton Foundation ties that most interest Clinton’s critics concerned about the national security and conflict-of-interest implications of her relationship with the notorious political operator. Blumenthal had a personal financial stake in Libya, where he was using his connections to win U.S. government contracts for weapons providers, such as Osprey Global Solutions . The latest Clinton/Blumenthal e-mail release is sure to reignite the Blumenthal furor that erupted during last year’s incendiary hearings on Secretary Clinton’s role in the deadly 2012 Benghazi fiasco. House Benghazi Committee chairman Representative Trey Gowdy then grilled Secretary Clinton on her relationship with, and reliance upon, Blumenthal for important Libya decisions. “While Blumenthal, an old friend of the Clintons, admittedly knew little about Libya and had not ever been to Libya, Clinton seemingly read every one of his emails on the topic that began appearing out of nowhere in February 2011,” Gowdy wrote in a letter to Representative Trey Gowdy Elijah Cummings, a Democrat member of the Benghazi Committee who ran interference for Clinton. 
“Nearly half of all the emails sent to and from Secretary Clinton regarding Benghazi and Libya prior to the Benghazi terrorist attacks involved Sidney Blumenthal,” Chairman Gowdy wrote. “That number — nearly half — is simply astonishing.” The 13-minute segment of the House Benghazi hearing imbedded below is one of the key sections of the hearings in which Representative Gowdy roasts Secretary Clinton to a fare-thee-well on her e-mails from Blumenthall that she insisted were “unsolicited” and were merely part of her effort to avoid Washington group-think, and not get “caught in a bubble.” 
Obviously, for Clinton, Blumenthal, and partners, the dark money and blood money involved in these Libya deals would be best left in the shadows. Hence the need to resort to private e-mail. There are additional reasons, of course, for the clandestine activity. Since then-Secretary Clinton’s boss, President Obama, had forbidden Blumenthal’s employment at State, and since Sid Vicious had alienated top staff members in the administration, it is easy to see why Clinton would use a back channel to communicate with the hatchet man/bag man, so as not to tip off Blumenthal haters at DOS and the White House. For these reasons (and perhaps others) Clinton insisted Blumenthal’s March 9, 2011 Libya memo be printed “without any identifiers.” 
Among the newly released Abedin e-mails is a lengthy exchange giving precise details of Clinton’s schedule using unsecured government e-mails, Judicial Watch notes. The e-mail from Lona J. Valmoro, former special assistant to Secretary of State Clinton, to Abedin and Clinton reveals exact times (including driving times) and locations of all appointments throughout the day. Yet another itinerary e-mail provides details about a meeting at the United Nations in New York at 3:00 on Tuesday, January 31, 2012, with the precise disclosure, “that would mean wheels up from Andrews at approximately 12:00pm/12:15pm.” 
“These emails show that Hillary Clinton isn’t the only Obama official who should be worried about being prosecuted for mishandling classified information. Her former top State aides (and current campaign advisers) Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan should be in the dock, as well,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The Obama State Department has now confirmed that Clinton, Abedin, and Sullivan used unsecured, non-government email accounts to communicate information that should now be withheld from the American people ‘in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, and properly classified.’ When can we expect the indictments?” 
Indeed, when? Team Hillary’s “Run-out-the-clock strategy” has almost worked — and it may yet succeed. However, there are, undoubtedly, among the operatives in her inner circle many with white knuckles and faint hearts, wondering if they will make it to the November 8 finish line before the Clintonworld corruption and criminality spill out in eruptions too huge even for her Big Media allies to cover up.",0

26 Oct, 2016 26  
(REUTERS) U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s plan for Syria would “lead to World War Three,” because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
 
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
…
“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
“You’re not fighting Syria any more, you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” he said.

18121,Soros-Backed Blogger Under Fire For Anti-Semitic Tweets,"An influential French blogger has come in for heavy criticism after thousands of antisemitic, threatening and homophobic tweets he published under a pseudonym resurfaced over the weekend, sparking fierce debate. [The tweets included threats against Front National leader Marine Le Pen, who he threatened to kill, but their author Medhi Meklat, 24, and his supporters have shrugged them off as a joke.  “I am going to slit your throat Muslim style” read the tweet threatening Le Pen. Another called for “Hitler to kill all the Jews” while a third said he wanted to “rape” former Charlie Hebdo    Charb, one of the victims of the January 2015 terror attacks, with a “Laguiole knife”. The tweets were published under the pseudonym ‘Marcelin Deschamps’ described by Meklat as a “shameful” “fictional character” whose thoughts were “quite the opposite” of his own. ” But they remained on the account after Meklat switched it to his name in 2015. This weekend they were outed by a fellow Twitter user who was outraged after seeing Meklat on TV promoting his new book, Le Monde has reported. On Saturday Meklat cleaned the account, deleting around 50, 000 tweets spanning back over a number of years to leave just 503 remaining. He also used the platform to issue an apology, writing “I’m sorry if these tweets shocked some of you. they are obsolete” adding “through Marcelin Deschamps, I was questioning the notion of excess and provocation. ” But his claims have not convinced everyone. The   secularist organisation Printemps Republicain [Republican Spring] have slammed the tweets as “serious” and “within the scope of the law”. They have accused the media of bearing some responsibility for the tweets, having “promoted” and “praised” Meklat. Had he been a member of France’s National Front, they said, Meklat “would have been instantly and quite rightly pilloried by the same media, and would certainly have found himself in court” they added in a statement. And they dismissed claims that Meklat, under the pseudonym Deschamps, was acting satirically in the same vein as the provocative magazine Charlie Hebdo arguing that Meklat had “only attacked certain categories of people [  …    ] Charlie Hebdo attacks everyone. ” Born in the notorious Paris suburb of    where riots have recently been raging, Meklat gained prominence through his writing for the Bondy Blog, a   blog set up following the 2005 Paris riots and financed by George Soros’ Open Society Foundation. Lauded as the authentic voice of France’s migrant communities, Meklat has capitalised on his media exposure to escape the banlieues, spending summers aboard yatchs in Los Angeles, and networking with esteemed institutions such as the Cartier Foundation to work on joint projects.

Just when you thought that, surely, big banker greed had bottomed out with 2008’s Wall Street crash and bailout, along comes Wells Fargo, burrowing even deeper into the ethical slime to reach a previously unimaginable level of corporate depravity. 
It’s one thing for these finance giants to cook the books or defraud investors, but top executives of Wells Fargo have been profiteering for years by literally forcing their employees to rob the bank’s customers. 
Rather than a culture of service, executives have pushed a high-pressure sales culture since 2009, demanding frontline employees meet extreme quotas of selling a myriad of unnecessary bank products to common depositors who just wanted a simple checking account. (Photo: Shutterstock) 
Employees were expected to load each customer with at least eight accounts, and employees were monitored constantly on meeting their quota — fail and you’d be fired. 
That’s why the bosses’ sales culture turned employees into a syndicate of bank robbers. The thievery was systemic, and it wasn’t subtle. 
Half a million customers were secretly issued credit and debit cards they didn’t request, fake email accounts for online services were set up without customers’ knowledge, depositors’ money was moved from one account to another, signatures were forged, and — of course — Wells Fargo collected fees for all of these bogus transactions, boosting its profits. 
CEO John Stumpf was recently forced out because of the scandal, but what about the other top executives and the board of directors — all of whom were highly paid partners in this crime? 
Stumpf wasn’t the only rotten apple at Wells Fargo. This isn’t a case of a few bankers gone rogue, but of a whole bank gone rogue, rotting from the head down.",0
18123,"ALERT – New Bill Clinton Mistress Confirmed, Hillary Camp Panics…","ALERT – New Bill Clinton Mistress Confirmed, Hillary Camp Panics… Oct 28, 2016 Previous post The identity of one of Bill Clinton’s long-time mistresses was just revealed. The former president’s Secret Service detail nicknamed the mistress “Energizer” because of the way Bill always “perked up” and seemed revitalized after her visits. Julie McMahon has been outed by the press as Bill Clinton’s “Energizer,” a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Energizer Bunny. This mother of three and socialite has publicly denied being one of Clinton’s lovers, but a plethora of purported evidence is now unfolding online in an effort to refute McMahon’s claims of innocence, as per Bizpac Review . McMahon reportedly lives just a few minutes away from Bill and Hillary Clinton’s home in New York, which is called Whitehaven. If the Clintons were Republicans, the liberal mainstream media would be calling them racists over the chosen name of their luxurious estate. Always, Julia McMahon would arrive at Whitehaven via SUV. She would only stay a few hours sometimes, but other times she would spend an entire week at the Clinton residence. Julia McMahon reportedly met both Bill and Hillary in 1998 when he was president. Although the Clinton campaign has tried to label McMahon a friend to both of the Clintons, she only visited or spent the night at the house when Hillary wasn’t home, the Daily Mail reports. Sometimes, McMahon allegedly arrived just mere minutes after the departure of the former first lady. The Secret Service agents on the Clinton Whitehaven detail were reportedly not ever privy to the woman’s name, but they were allegedly under strict orders not to approach or stop her when she arrived. Every member of a president’s family is protected by a Secret Service detail. The Secret Service reportedly uses the same letter to assign a codename to protectees. Bill Clinton’s Secret Service name is reportedly “Eagle” and Hillary’s is “Evergreen.” The Secret Service may have run out of “E” codenames over the years thanks to all of Bill’s lady friends. Author Ron Kessler revealed the name of the Energizer mistress in his new book, The First Family Detail: Secret",0
18124,"Gambia’s President, in Power 22 Years, Loses Election - The New York Times","BANJUL, Gambia  —   Yahya Jammeh, the president of Gambia, has been defeated in his bid for   according to results made public on Friday. It is a stunning turn for a nation that has lived for more than two decades under what human rights groups have described as a repressive regime. Adama Barrow, a real estate company owner, was declared the winner a day after voters cast ballots, in an upset victory that astonished observers. In a concession speech broadcast on state television on Friday night, Mr. Jammeh, one of Africa’s most eccentric leaders, calmly accepted his loss. “I told you, Gambians, that I will not question the outcome of the results and will accept it,” he said. “I did not wish to contest or find out why they did not vote for me. I leave that with God. ” Mr. Jammeh’s whereabouts on Friday was unknown, and speculation was rampant that he had fled the country. People celebrated in the streets, calling it a new era for the West African nation. “We have our country back,” shouted Modu Ceesay, a taxi driver who took his shirt off and waved it furiously over his head. “This is our country, and now we have it. ” Mr. Jammeh’s defeat is a rare turn for the crop of longtime African leaders who have amassed so much power  —   and often, wealth  —   through decades of incumbency that they sometimes manage to stay in office until death. Other   leaders for life have interfered with elections to cling to power. Mr. Jammeh had himself been accused of keeping power by rigging elections in the past. And so it came as a surprise that in this tiny sliver of a country, the smallest on continental Africa, voters managed to oust a strongman who has reigned for 22 years in a government that prosecuted and jailed critics, some of whom wound up dead, and sent thousands of fearful citizens into exile. After more than 24 hours of an internet and phone blackout, networks lit up Friday morning in the nation, which has a population just under two million, as the news that Mr. Jammeh was trailing in the vote count began to trickle out. On the streets in Gambia, men took off their shirts in celebration, pounding on passing cars. One yelled repeatedly, “Today we are free!” Mr. Jammeh seized power in a coup in 1994, and he has become known for eccentric behavior that included claiming to be able to cure AIDS with herbs, prayer and a banana. He has been denounced by human rights groups for threatening to behead gay people, ordering   sorcerers to be hunted and killed, and arresting and prosecuting journalists and supporters of the opposition. “It is the birth of a new Gambia where we can together as people raise our fists to the sky and say ‘never again shall we experience dictatorship,’” said Sheriff Bojang Jr. a Gambian journalist who has lived in exile in Dakar, Senegal, for 15 years. Mr. Barrow, a real estate agent and former security guard at a London department store, is an accidental presidential candidate. He was thrust into the position after members of his party were either arrested or died in prison this year. Supporters describe him as an unassuming businessman. Yet he managed to do what no other opposition candidate has done in recent elections: bring various groups together to support him. His coalition of opposition groups jelled in the final days of the campaign as enthusiasm swept the streets of Banjul, the capital. People gathered by the hundreds for peaceful protests, crying out for the end to what they said was an oppressive government. “What happened is unity,” said Jeffrey Smith, founder of Vanguard Africa, a political consultancy and nonprofit group that supported Mr. Barrow in the campaign. “That is precisely what is needed to take down highly entrenched regimes. ” But analysts said the victory might be more a vote against Mr. Jammeh than one for Mr. Barrow. In past months, Mr. Jammeh’s administration had come under increasing scrutiny by Western leaders over the suppression of human rights. The European Union threatened to impose sanctions on the government, and the United States issued statements highly critical of Mr. Jammeh’s crackdowns on opponents. Organizations like Amnesty International released stinging reports on his methods. In recent years, democracy has had mixed results on the continent. Late last year, Ivory Coast had its first peaceful election in two decades. In Nigeria, the dominant party lost elections last year and conceded to Muhammadu Buhari, who is now president, in a peaceful transfer of power that reverberated across Africa. And in some nations, presidents who have tried to hold on to power have been ousted by popular uprisings. The government of Blaise Compaoré in Burkina Faso was toppled in 2014 after mass protests against his attempts to change the Constitution and to extend his tenure after he had been in office for 27 years. But elsewhere, other leaders are hanging on to power, like in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where President Joseph Kabila’s term is almost up and it is unclear when an election will take place. This year, Gabon was widely accused of verifying fraudulent election results that kept President Ali Bongo Ondimba in power. And some nations on the continent still maintain   presidents for life. In Cameroon, Paul Biya has been in power since 1982. Mr. Biya has been criticized for spending weeks at a time in Europe, with some critics calling him the president of the Hotel Intercontinental in Geneva. This summer, a Cameroonian citizen stood outside the hotel with a loudspeaker shouting insults at the president. The message from elections across not just Africa but the globe is muddled. Winners are those who can unite various forces that in the past have pursued their own, separate interests and split the vote, said Kamissa Camara, a political expert and founder of the Sahel Strategy Forum, a research group that analyzes events in West and Central Africa. “In general, politics has become so unpredictable,” she said. “Outcomes such as the one we’re seeing today in Gambia will definitely send the signal that elections are not for nothing. ” In his concession call to Mr. Barrow, Mr. Jammeh admonished him to “work towards peace and stability. ” “Because without peace and stability, let me make it clear, you cannot achieve anything in Africa,” he said.",0
18125,Sessions to Strip Billions from Sanctuary Cities,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced he is cracking down on sanctuary cities cutting billions of dollars in law enforcement grants. [The Department of Justice will hand out $4 billion in federal law enforcement grants over the balance of this fiscal year which ends in September. Sessions told reporters at the White House he will be working to prevent any of it from going to sanctuary jurisdictions, The Washington Times reported.  “Countless Americans would be alive today   …     if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended,” General Sessions told reporters. The AG stated he is using a tactic that began under AG Loretta Lynch. Not only can the Attorney General withhold grants from this year’s funding requests, the DOJ can actually claw back grants made in prior years to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with immigration officials, U. S. Representative John Culberson ( ) told Breitbart Texas. Culberson began working on defunding sanctuary jurisdictions with   General Lynch, Breitbart Texas reported in December. Using the “power of the purse” entrusted to Congress, Culberson told a group of supporters in December that he has been able to “step on the air hose” of Obama’s DOJ and force the certification of ten sanctuary jurisdictions as not being in compliance with 8 U. S. C. § 1373, an existing law that requires 100 percent cooperation from local and state jurisdictions in order to receive DOJ grant funding. That law was signed by President Bill Clinton in the 1980s to force local jurisdictions to cooperate with immigration officers. “99 percent is not good enough,” Culberson stated. “These jurisdictions must cooperate 100 percent in order to qualify for these DOJ grants. They must choose between protecting illegal aliens and receiving federal funds. ” The DOJ Office of Inspector General previously certified 10 jurisdictions as not being in compliance with that law and eligible for cuts in funding: These 10 jurisdictions received 65 percent of the law enforcement grants allocated in FY2015 as of March 2016. “It is not just future funds that are at risk for these sanctuary jurisdictions,” Culberson told Breitbart Texas. “The DOJ can force them to reimburse funds received from these grant programs in the past. This means, the State of California could be forced to repay the more than $3 billion in grants received over the past 10 years. ” The AG announced three funding programs that will be cut from sanctuary jurisdictions this year. Those include the COPS, Byrne, and State Criminal Alien Assistance Program grants. Last week, U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials began releasing a report showing criminal aliens released by sanctuary jurisdictions after immigration officers placed holds on inmates. Texas led the nation with well over 70 percent of those released. In the initial report covering January 25 through February 3, 206 criminal aliens were released. Many of these are violent felons. The jurisdictions listed in this report could find themselves ineligible to receive grants this year. Following President Donald Trump’s January announcement calling for a crackdown on sanctuary jurisdictions,   County immediately reversed course and rescinded its sanctuary policy, Breitbart News’ Katie McHugh reported.  “I want to make sure we don’t put in jeopardy the millions of funds we get from the federal government for a $52, 000 issue,” Mayor Carlos Giménez stated. “It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be arresting more people. It doesn’t mean that we’re going to be enforcing any immigration laws,” he added. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

18128,From Monster to Mr. President-Elect: Democrats Grovel Before Trump     : Information," From Monster to Mr. President-Elect: Democrats Grovel Before Trump By Andre Damon
November 11, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" WSWS "" - Within a day of the election of Donald Trump, leading Democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the president-elect.
President Barack Obama invited Trump to the White House for a friendly 90-minute meeting on Thursday. He declared afterwards that his number-one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful. He added, speaking to Trump, I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-Elect, that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeedbecause if you succeed, then the country succeeds.
Obamas declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago. Then he asserted that Trump appears to only care about himself and doesnt know basic facts that youd need to know to be president. He added that Trump spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working people.
That was before the Democratic debacle on Election Day. Now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that Trump is successful.
Obamas comments followed the statement by Hillary Clinton on Wednesday that she hoped [Trump] will be a successful president for all Americans. Senator Bernie Sanders, the supposed socialist, issued his own groveling statement, declaring, To the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him.
With such declarations, the Democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a President Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress.
The proclamations of support from top Democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in American politics. What is coming to power is a government of the extreme right, with fascistic characteristics. There are reports that Trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, an ultra-right and fascistic media outlet. His top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former New York Mayor Rudolf Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
In their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of normalcy, the Democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the election.
No one is noting that a principal factor in the election of Trump was a significant decline in voter turnout. For all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind Trump, the Republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney received in losing the 2012 election to Obama. Clinton won 6 million fewer votes than Obama won in his reelection, when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in 2008. Also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that Trump failed even to win the popular vote. Clinton had a higher percentage of the national vote, but she lost in the Electoral College, which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states. Trump will take office having failed to secure a plurality, let alone a majority, of the overall vote.
In the entire 240-year history of the United States, there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote. When this happened in 1876, the Republican, Rutherford B. Hayes, became president, though he had fewer votes than the Democrat, Samuel J. Tilden. The political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the Republicans were able to hold the White House only after agreeing to the effective end of post-Civil War Reconstruction, through the withdrawal of federal troops from the South.
After a split vote in 1888, when Grover Cleveland lost to Benjamin Harrison, the winner of the Electoral Vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next 112 years. In the 21st century, this anomaly has now happened twicein 2000 and again in 2016. In the former case, the selection of George W. Bush as president required the intervention of the Supreme Court to halt the recount of ballots in Florida.
Had Trump found himself in the position of Clinton, he would have taken his time before conceding. His concession speech, when and if it came, would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that Crooked Hillary could not claim a mandate.
The media message would have stressed the need for Clinton to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen Trump. One can easily imagine CNN announcing the breaking news that Clinton had withdrawn the nomination of Obamas choice for the Supreme Court and invited the Republicans to name the replacement for the deceased Antonin Scalia.
But the Democrats have done just the opposite.
What is behind this universal about-face? President Obama said perhaps more than he intended when he declared Wednesday that we have to remember that were actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmagethat is, a test competition involving players from the same school.
The United States does not really have an oppositional political system. The divisions between the Democrats and Republicans, and between Clinton and Trump, are of an entirely tactical character. They all defend the same basic intereststhose of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political system.
Within this framework, the Democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory party, since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working peopleincluding by the likes of Bernie Sandersare thoroughly vacuous and insincere. In relation to Trump and the dangers he poses, there is an element of complete complacency, which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the Democrats or the privileged social forces for which they speak, but to the working class.
The chief concern of the Democrats is to contain popular anger. Their moves to circle the wagons around Trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming government, but the capitalist system itself.
Even as Obama, Clinton, Sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to Trump, thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the president-elect. These protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to come.
What is critical is that the lessons of the 2016 election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the Democratic Party be rejected. The task is not to take back the Democratic Party or push it to the leftthe inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the Sanders campaignbut to break with both parties of big business and all forms of capitalist politics and build an independent socialist and internationalist movement of the working class.

18129,Seattle Approves ’Safe Injection’ Sites for Illegal Drug Users to Inject Illegal Drugs - Breitbart,"Officials in Seattle approved the nation’s first “ ” sites for illegal drug users Friday. [The sites offer illegal drug users clean needles, medical supervision, and quick access to drugs that reverse the effects of an overdose, the Washington Post reported.  Sites like those approved for Seattle have been popular in Europe for a long time, and the idea is spreading to other cities in the United States such as Boston, New York City, and Ithaca, New York. Opponents of the new sites say that they only promote illegal drug use while supporters say the sites help keep people alive and can put those who are addicted on the path to treatment. “These sites save lives and that is our goal in   County,” Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. Kelly Dineen, a professor of health law at Saint Louis University School of Law, says the sites are illegal under federal law because the Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal to operate facilities where drugs are used. The King County Board of Health voted unanimously earlier this month to approve two sites, one in Seattle and the other in the surrounding county. Murray and King County Executive Dow Constantine gave the final approval Friday. In 2015, 132 people died of heroin overdoses in King County, according to the University of Washington’s Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute. Nationwide, 33, 000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2015, according to the CDC. Officials hope to open up the Seattle site within a year, and both sites will be aimed at homeless drug users and will focus on giving these people health services and ultimately drug treatment. “The real goal is not to open a day spa where people can come in and have a good time and use drugs, but to engage them in treatment,” Jeff Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County, said. “They inject in a place where there’s a   worker who can save their lives if they overdose. ”",0
18130,"Limbaugh: Sessions-Russia Story Is About Obama, Democrats ’Attempting to Sabotage the Trump Presidency’ - Breitbart","Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh dismissed the saga first reported by The Washington Post late Wednesday evening suggesting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had failed to disclose meeting with Russian officials during his confirmation hearings earlier this year.  Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): It appears, ladies and gentlemen, that the people on our side still haven’t learned a single lesson about how to deal with the Democrat Party and the media, the American left  —   of course, that’s all the same group of people. It’s patently obvious. It’s really frustrating to me. All of this should have been anticipated. All of this was easily predictable. I think somebody I know pretty well did. And the way this is all being handled today  —   and people have the best intentions. The heartfelt desire to defend Jeff Sessions by pointing out the Democrat hypocrisy, when are we gonna learn that Democrat hypocrisy doesn’t exist? There is no such thing as Democrat hypocrisy in the media. You’re never gonna beat these people back by pointing out how they’ve done the same thing that they’re accusing us of doing. It’s never gonna work! This story is not about Jeff Sessions. By the way, greetings and welcome. Great to have you. Rush Limbaugh,   . This story is not about Jeff Sessions. This story is not about illegal talks between Trump and his campaign people and the Russians. This story is about Barack Obama and the Democrat Party attempting to sabotage the Trump presidency and do everything they can to either render it meaningless and ineffective or to get him impeached or force him to resign. That’s what the story is. And that is what has to be attacked, not defended. We have no reason to be on defense all the time. We won the election. These people are barely hanging on. This is all they’ve got. And there’s no evidence, despite a year and a half of allegations of illegal contact between Trump, his campaign, and the Russians. There is no evidence. Limbaugh urged his listeners not to concede anything wrong was done by suggesting there was hypocrisy and cited Republican disfavor with the media as the reason. You know what Sessions ought to do? “Yeah, yeah, I talked to the Russian ambassador about our grandchildren. You know, he’s got some grandchildren, I got some grandchildren, that’s what we were talking about. ” Well, that’s what Loretta Lynch and Clinton said they were talking about on the airplane one week before a decision was coming down from Comey on whatever was gonna happen with the Clinton investigation into her emails and stuff. I can point that out and you go, “Yeah, yeah, right. ” And you know what it’s gonna get us? Nothing! Even in the court of opinion it’s gonna get us nothing because it accepts the premise that Sessions did something wrong and therefore we can mitigate that by pointing out, “Well, look what the Clintons did. ” It doesn’t work that way. We should learn after 30 years, it doesn’t work that way. The Democrats are never held accountable for hypocrisy. There is no such thing where they are concerned in the eyes of the media and others who hold them accountable or don’t. I know the desire to defend Sessions. He’s a great man. He’s a decent man. He’s a good man. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
18131,Zika Deal in Congress Likely to Be Delayed Until After Recess - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Emergency financing to fight the   Zika virus appeared likely to be delayed until after Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess, as Democrats on Wednesday sharply criticized a new Republican proposal to provide $1. 1 billion, but with $750 million redirected from other federal programs. Republican House and Senate negotiators have been working to resolve differences between a Senate plan to provide $1. 1 billion in emergency financing for Zika and a House plan that would provide $622 million but would take the money from other programs. Both proposals offered far less money to fight Zika than the $1. 9 billion requested by the Obama administration. Still, Senate Democrats and the White House had indicated some willingness to go along with the Senate plan. But as the Republican negotiators announced Wednesday evening that they had reached a tentative agreement  —   which the House approved early Thursday in a   vote  —   Democrats lashed out. They said the proposal was layered with numerous unrelated provisions that they would never accept, including an effort to restrict government financing of Planned Parenthood, the women’s health organization. While Democrats did not have any sway over the   negotiations, Republicans do not have sufficient votes in the Senate to overcome procedural obstacles and approve the agreement on their own. The White House also said the legislation appeared unacceptable and would further delay the effort to combat the Zika virus, which can cause serious neurological disorders and other deformities in infants born to infected mothers. “While we are still awaiting more details on the legislation, it is clear that once again, Republicans have put political games ahead of the health and safety of the American people, particularly pregnant women and their babies,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “This plan from congressional Republicans is four months late and nearly a billion dollars short of what our public health experts have said is necessary to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus and steals funding from other health priorities,” Mr. Earnest added. “The fact that the Republican plan limits needed birth control services for women in the United States and Puerto Rico as we seek to stop the spread of a sexually transmitted disease is a clear indication they don’t take seriously the threat from the Zika virus or their responsibility to protect Americans. ” In an announcement late Wednesday, Republicans said their proposal included important restrictions on how the emergency money would be used. “Unlike the administration’s request that allowed overly broad authority for federal agencies to use Zika dollars with little accountability, this legislation places tight controls and oversight on spending to ensure that every dollar is being used appropriately,” the statement from the House Appropriations Committee said. In a statement, Representative Hal Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, praised the legislation. “This is a solid agreement that will adequately and effectively fund resources for our troops and their families, our veterans, and to fight and prevent the spread of the Zika virus,” Mr. Rogers said. “It is the product of careful and thorough deliberations between the House and the Senate, and reflects a responsible compromise that can and should be signed into law. ” Mr. Rogers urged Democrats to approve the legislation given the expected arrival of   mosquitoes in the United States. “Mosquito season is upon us these dollars must get out the door now to help control the spread of the Zika virus and continue   efforts to stop this disease, such as vaccine and treatment development and deployment,” he said. But Democrats, including the party’s Senate leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, had nothing but sharp criticism. “A narrowly partisan proposal that cuts off women’s access to birth control, shortchanges veterans and rescinds Obamacare funds to cover the cost is not a serious response to the threat from the Zika virus,” Mr. Reid said in a statement. “In short, Republicans are trying to turn an attempt to protect women’s health into an attack on women’s health. We waited four months for Republicans to do anything to combat Zika. Their proposal would be comical except this a public health emergency and it deserves urgency. ” The money to fight the Zika virus was included in an $82. 5 billion annual appropriations measure covering military construction and veterans’ affairs programs for 2017. Republicans stressed that the legislation would provide $2. 6 billion more for those programs than in 2016, but Democrats said it still did not provide sufficient funding for veterans. It was not immediately clear how congressional leaders might resolve the impasse, or when the federal money for Zika would ultimately be approved.",0

18133,Didn’t Vaccines Eradicate Diseases? An Untold Truth About Vaccines,"If you’ve been paying attention, you probably know that vaccines have been a huge topic of discussion for a long time now, and a very emotional one as well. But regardless of which side of the debate we are on, our worries are well justified. We have seen many diseases emerge over the course of human history that we want to protect ourselves and our children from, and so we came up with ways to do that. The challenge is, our methods may have also increased our risk for developing other diseases and health problems, and we need to look at that side of the story.
Right off the top, we need to stop looking at it from a pro or anti vaccine stance, relying on blind faith and emotion to support our views. Both sides of the coin use propaganda to bash the other and this actually reduces a very serious conversation to hate fuelled and fact deficient bickering. The media has also done a great job of ensuring that questioning this topic is seen as sheer heresy to begin with. But there are real concerns and very real information backing those concerns to consider.
As a human race, we need to come together, drop all the arguments, and simply figure things out for the betterment of all — not for pharmaceutical gain, not because we’re afraid to change (or because we’ve ‘always’ done things this way), and not because we want to prove the government or ‘the man’ was wrong. We need to approach all things openly like this, in the spirit of community and collaboration.
One thing I’ve always wanted to do is create a space for scientists to conduct unbiased research on this issue — to take 10 scientists whose research shows that vaccines are safe and 10 scientists whose research shows the opposite and get them in on an independently funded study, working together. This would ensure there is no fudging of science, results, data or anything by either side to produce desired results.
Education People have been very misled about a lot of public health issues in our world. This was made clear most recently when the Heart and Stroke Foundation released a new statement about heart health. They claim (finally) that saturated fats are actually not the problem, nor unhealthy, and it’s more about a well thought out diet than anything else.[1] The idea that saturated fats have been vilified and are actually very important to brain health has been going around for decades through people the mainstream considers quacks, yet as is so often the case, these people were proven correct a couple decades later when the mainstream finally caught up.
I believe we need to keep these types of track records in mind when we are presented with ideas that are new or alternative to what is currently accepted. We could start to slow the dissemination of poor health information in the mainstream, the belief in which is misleading people and causing them to lead less healthy lives.
Vaccine education is also very important. There’s plenty of misinformation out there on both sides of the coin and it’s causing confusion among the masses. Part of this is a result of lack of public knowledge, since it’s often difficult to find good information, and part of it is a result of the mainstream handing out inaccurate information to shape and manipulate public opinion.
A great example of that is with common diseases, which people believe vaccines eradicated completely. Yet in truth, they were either wiped out naturally or eliminated by some other societal upgrade. Why is this important to know? Because the more we know about what is ACTUALLY going on, the better we can stop responding to these issues emotionally and the clearer the picture becomes for how to move forward.
Here is a graph from the Journal of Pediatrics that illustrates how clean water and effective sewer systems caused the greatest decreases in most infectious diseases, not vaccinations.

Here is another key link for future reading that looks at vaccinations from an honest point of view.

Here is a transcript of the video for those who cannot watch it.
Ty Bollinger: But didn’t vaccines wipe out all the communicable diseases: the diphtheria, the pertussis, the polio, weren’t vaccines responsible for that? 
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny (vaccine expert): You know, it’s interesting, because every time someone is new to this topic it always starts from, “Well, what about smallpox, what about polio?” Well, I do an hour and a half talk on that so I can maybe give you two sentences that say the answer is no. That less than 10 percent of the global population was actually vaccinated for the smallpox vaccine, and it was a virus that was dying out and becoming weaker over time, and when we introduced hygiene and refrigeration, that’s when the smallpox started to go away. And then, of course, it morphed into this other type of virus called monkeypox, and so smallpox is still around, it’s just given a different name.
The same thing with polio. The epidemic of polio in this country was well on its way out before 1954 when FDR released the polio vaccine. And we’ve seen nothing but travesty about that ever since. And the only places in the world that still report any polio are places that are using the oral polio vaccine, which is a live virus.
The other thing is that polio is not a synonym for paralysis, and that the vast majority of people don’t understand that 98 percent of people who actually were exposed to the polio virus, and maybe even contracted the infection [that] caused polio, it was nothing more than looking like a stomach flu. It was some diarrhea. It was maybe a little bit of fever, and it just passed through that you maybe thought you had food poisoning and then you had lifetime immunity to this gastrointestinal virus.
But we have done such an amazingly good job impregnating multi-generationally into people’s brains about iron lungs and little children with braces and people with deformed limbs. That happened so infrequently in the big picture, but yet we have this horrifying terror of polio when we really shouldn’t.
I mean we’ve spent billions of dollars around the world to eliminate that virus. What if we would have spent those billions of dollars on potable water and refrigeration and better hygiene? What could we have done with that?

18134,Why China Is Intervening in Hong Kong’s Legislature - The New York Times,"HONG KONG  —   The Chinese government plans to intervene in a legal dispute in Hong Kong over two politicians who have been prevented from taking seats in the local legislature, officials said on Friday, raising fears that the territory’s independent judiciary is under threat. A decision may come on Monday. What is this case about? Two politicians who advocate independence for Hong Kong  —   Yau   25, and Sixtus Leung, 30  —   were elected to the city’s Legislative Council in September. On Oct. 12, as they were being sworn in, they deviated from the oath of office by saying “ ” instead of China. Many consider the term a derogatory slur against Chinese people because it was used by the Japanese in World War II. Ms. Yau also added a crude epithet. The clerk ruled their oaths invalid, preventing them from taking office, and the president of the Legislative Council scheduled another session for the pair to be sworn in. But the Hong Kong government went to court, arguing that Ms. Yau and Mr. Leung should not be allowed to take their seats on the council.  What does the law say? Hong Kong, a former British colony, is governed by a charter known as the Basic Law, which was negotiated before the area returned to Chinese rule in 1997. One provision says legislators must “swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. ” There is also a local statute that says any person “who declines or neglects to take an oath duly requested” is disqualified from entering office, or must vacate the post if he or she has already done so. The Hong Kong government, which is led by a chief executive who is essentially appointed by Beijing, argued in court on Thursday that the two politicians have declined to take the oath and should be disqualified. But a lawyer representing the president of the Legislative Council argued that the question should be decided by the legislature, not the courts or the executive branch.  How can the Chinese government intervene? The Basic Law gives Beijing the authority to issue interpretations of the charter. Specifically, it grants the power to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is rare, however, for the Chinese government to issue an interpretation of the Basic Law without being asked to do so by Hong Kong’s highest court or by the Hong Kong government. That has happened only once since 1997, and the committee has never issued an unsolicited opinion on a matter under active consideration by the courts in Hong Kong. On Friday, officials said the Chinese government planned to do just that, potentially issuing a ruling before the courts have finished hearing the case.  What is at stake? Some say the independence of the courts in Hong Kong is at risk. The territory’s reputation for rule of law has been crucial to its success as an international financial hub, so any move that undermines its judicial system could have repercussions beyond this particular case. China promised “a high degree of autonomy” for Hong Kong in a treaty with Britain, but people have worried that it has been interfering in the territory’s affairs and undermining civil liberties. In the past year, five local booksellers who sold publications critical of Beijing disappeared and later showed up in Chinese custody. Two years ago, hundreds of thousands of protesters occupied major roads in Hong Kong demanding free elections to select the city’s top official. The Hong Kong Bar Association says intervention by the Chinese government would be “a severe blow” to the judiciary and to the principle of   in the territory. Even the Hong Kong government says the case should be decided in Hong Kong’s courts.  What might happen next? The Chinese government is worried that   sentiment in Hong Kong is growing and wants it to stop. It has pilloried Ms. Yau and Mr. Leung in particular, and may issue a narrow ruling that bars them from taking office. But it might go further and try to block all   candidates from running for office. Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said a ruling by Beijing would probably be messy and incomplete because the country’s leaders do not appreciate and do not understand Hong Kong’s highly developed legal system, which draws on precedents set over hundreds of years. Many questions could be left unanswered. For example, what if a person who once supported independence for Hong Kong has a change of heart? Would he or she be eligible to serve in the legislature? Hong Kong’s courts will have to fill in the gaps, inviting further interpretations of the Basic Law by Beijing, “and that, of course, will create even more chaos,” Mr. Young said.",0
18135,Arizona Sheriffs Want To Help Trump With Border Security,"Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly visited Arizona border counties and their sheriffs to get a broader look at the nation’s border security problem. [Kelly toured the U. S.  southern border with Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey ( ). afterwards meeting withAfter the tour, he conducted a roundtable of Arizona’s border county sheriffs where they collectively agreed that more security at the nation’s border was necessary.  Kelly’s meeting included Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot, Santa Cruz County Sheriff Tony Estrada, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier. Napier praised Kelly, telling AZ Central, “I think the bottom line is we finally have a receptive ear of someone who is taking notes, very engaged, very willing to listen to us. ” “We talked about the value of technology in some areas and physical structures in others, but there’s a lot to be vetted out in that,” Napier said. “There’s a whole lot of distance between an executive action and some political rhetoric and actual policy implementation at the local level. ” Dannels echoed Napier’s call for not only a border wall, but more local security and cooperation. “The fencing along is not the   to this border problem,” Dannels said. “We need to help get [local law enforcement] at the table, and number two is fund the programs that we’re taking on as a result of the federal government not doing it. ” Dannels said one of the issues Kelly and the Arizona sheriffs all agreed on was the reinstatement of what’s known as the “Stonegarden” program, where federal grant money is given to local authorities to help them be equipped with handling border security issues. Stonegarden, according to Dannels, is a “force multiplier when it comes to community and highway interdiction to those that smuggle drugs and smuggle humans. ” Wilmot, on the other hand, asked Kelly to have President Donald Trump’s administration bring back Operation Streamline, which allowed for immigration judges to criminally charge illegal immigrants in large groups, rather than by an individual basis. Estrada, the lone Democrat in the meeting, was the only law enforcement official during the meeting to question the validity of a border wall, versus other solutions. “I think that’s still an open question, being that we’re unique all along the border from San Diego to Brownsville,” Estrada told AZ Central. “It requires different approaches. In some places, you may not even need a wall. ” Trump has long made immigration one of his top priorities, and has often called for programs which were previously cancelled by the Obama administration to be reinstated to modernize the nation’s border crisis.

Here’s what you need to know: • The second presidential debate. Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump spent nearly 90 minutes exchanging personal attacks Sunday night, suggesting that the final weeks before Election Day on Nov. 8 will be an ugly political brawl. Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for not showing remorse after several provocative comments during the campaign, and Mr. Trump accused her of having “tremendous hate in her heart. ” He also repeatedly described recorded remarks from 2005, in which he boasted that he could grope women because he was a celebrity, as “  talk. ” Here are more highlights from the debate. •   analysis. The takeaways: Mrs. Clinton stuck to a safe script and leveled no surprise attacks Mr. Trump widened his political vulnerabilities with   comments. Who won? According to some pundits, Mr. Trump exceeded expectations and showed supporters that his campaign wasn’t over. Finally, we   several of the nominees’ statements. • Fallout from lewd comments from 2005. Mr. Trump has threatened to retaliate against Republican lawmakers who withdrew their support for him. The list has grown to more than 160 prominent party members. And Billy Bush, the “Today” show host who was bantering with Mr. Trump on the recording, has been suspended by NBC. We look at why the network was slow to report its own story about the video despite knowing about it last Monday. • Hurricane Matthew’s toll. Nearly 900 people died  in Haiti as a result of the storm that blasted the island last week, and more than 500, 000 remain stranded in the country’s south. “God gives and God takes,” a resident in one   town said. “Mankind, for all the evil he does, could never do something like this. ” In the U. S. at least 17 people were killed by the hurricane, which caused record flooding in North Carolina. • More problems for Samsung. The world’s biggest smartphone maker temporarily suspended production of its Galaxy Note 7 devices after reports of fires in its replacement models. The company had previously said it would recall 2. 5 million Note 7 phones over reports that the battery could catch fire. • Nobel in economics science. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded this morning to Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom for their insights into how best to write contracts. • Choosing a voice for conversational computing, an emerging field in technology, reflects society’s preconceptions around race and gender. Companies are having to decide whether it is better to succeed by complying with a stereotype, or risk failure by going against type. • A   automotive company is turning to an unlikely ally for advertising help: the satirical news outlet The Onion. • Resolving workplace  conflicts with empathy and forgiveness can improve conditions at work, a business professor’s recent studies have found. • U. S. stocks finished down on Friday.

F. L. suspension and threw for over 400 yards to lead New England to victory. Toronto moved on to the American League Championship Series, and Cleveland and Chicago are a win away from advancing in the M. L. B. playoffs. • “The Girl on the Train” was the top movie at the North American box office. “The Birth of a Nation” had a disappointing opening. • Obama’s valedictory tour. President Obama made a rare stop in his adopted hometown, Chicago, spending Friday and Saturday there for a   and some golf. He also spent time with supporters discussing plans for his presidential library and charitable foundation in the city. • New market for medical marijuana. Some owners of dogs and cats are giving their   pets   remedies to treat seizures, inflammation, anxiety and pain. The Food and Drug Administration, though, has not approved marijuana for domesticated animals, citing a lack of research showing its effectiveness. • Start the week with style. Here are 50 of our best photographs from fashion month. • Recipe of the day. Take it easy with this classic tuna salad sandwich. Columbus Day is being observed in the U. S. today. In Canada, it’s Thanksgiving. And new holidays seem to be invented every year. Today is also Handbag Day and Angel Food Cake Day. One event on this date, though, highlights a more serious subject: World Homeless Day. Started in 2010, the day seeks to bring attention to homelessness, a problem that affects tens of millions of people worldwide, according to the United Nations. In the U. S. more than a   people live on the streets or in shelters for temporary stays. But national statistics show that homelessness is declining. And Salt Lake City has been held up as a model. The city’s approach is simple: Before tackling the problems that led someone to become homeless, those in need first receive a place to live. The program is credited with reducing the number of chronically homeless people across the state by 91 percent since 2005. Lloyd Pendleton, who leads Utah’s homeless task force, initially doubted the plan. “I get probably two to five calls a week now,” he said in an interview last year, “wanting to know how we did it. ” For information on how you can help, the National Alliance to End  Homelessness and the National Coalition for the Homeless offer resources.

18137,"Hillary Clinton’s Email Was Probably Hacked, Experts Say - The New York Times","When the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said on Tuesday that his investigators had no “direct evidence” that Hillary Clinton’s email account had been “successfully hacked,” both private experts and federal investigators immediately understood his meaning: It very likely had been breached, but the intruders were far too skilled to leave evidence of their work. Mr. Comey described, in fairly blistering terms, a set of email practices that left Mrs. Clinton’s systems wide open to Russian and Chinese hackers, and an array of others. She had no   cybersecurity professional monitoring her system. She took her BlackBerry everywhere she went, “sending and receiving   emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. ” Her use of “a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. ” In the end, the risks created by Mrs. Clinton’s insistence on keeping her communications on a private server may prove to be a larger issue than the relatively small amount of classified data investigators said they found on her system. But the central mystery  —   who got into the system, if anyone  —   may never be resolved. “Reading between the lines and following Comey’s logic, it does sound as if the F. B. I. believes a compromise of Clinton’s email is more likely than not,” said Adam Segal, the author of “Hacked World Order,” who studies cyberissues at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Sophisticated attackers would have known of the existence of the account, would have targeted it and would not have been seen. ” Mr. Comey couched his concern on Tuesday by repeating the intelligence community’s favorite phrase  —   “we assess”  —   four times, but ultimately reached no    conclusion. “We assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal email account,” he said. But that was notable: Until Mr. Comey spoke, Mrs. Clinton and her campaign have said that her server  —   there were actually several, in succession  —   was never hacked. A State Department inspector general’s report issued this year reported what looked like several attempts at “spear phishing”  —   fake emails intended to get a user to click on a link that would install malware on a computer  —   but there is no evidence that those links were activated. Mrs. Clinton, and her campaign, have always maintained that the server was secure. President Obama backed her up in an interview last October on CBS’s “60 Minutes. ” “I don’t think it posed a national security problem,” he said. But Mr. Comey painted a different picture. “Hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact,” he said. And that would have meant that tracking the trail of electronic breadcrumbs back to her server would have been a pretty simple task. After that, their ability to break in would have been a mix of skill and luck, but they had plenty of time to get it right. Mrs. Clinton’s best defense, and one she cannot utter in public, is that whatever the risks of keeping her own email server, that server was certainly no more vulnerable than the State Department’s. Had she held an unclassified account in the State Department’s official system, as the rules required, she certainly would have been hacked. Russian intruders were thoroughly inside that system for years  —   since at least 2007  —   before the State Department shut its system down several times to perform a digital exorcism in late 2014, nearly two years after Mrs. Clinton left office. Either out of embarrassment or to protect its sources of intelligence, the Obama administration has never publicly blamed Russia for stealing data from the unclassified systems at the State Department and the White House, just as it has never publicly identified China as the culprit in the theft of   information on nearly 22 million Americans stored by the Office of Personnel Management. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has insisted that the server did have some cyber protection software, but they have not said what kind. But security software is useless unless it is updated constantly to reflect threats that change every day. Even then, there are ways for a determined,   hacker to get in. The best hackers use a gap in the software that has never been discovered before called a “zero day,” suggesting there are zero days of warning about its dangers, or they wait for a user error, including clicking on a   link. Perhaps Mr. Comey’s most surprising suggestion was that Mrs. Clinton had used her private email while in the territory of what he called “sophisticated adversaries. ” That usually means China and Russia, but could include visits elsewhere, including Eastern Europe. James A. Lewis, a former government cyber security expert who now studies the cyber activities of nations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said, “If she used it in Russia or China, they almost certainly picked it up. ” Once the hardware is in a foreign country, and on its phone networks, it is particularly vulnerable. Malware can be placed on it that could turn the phone into a listening device. One lurking question is whether Mrs. Clinton’s own practice of taking the phone around the world made it susceptible to tinkering by a foreign government. The State Department worries so much about corrupted cellphones that visitors to the secretary’s suite on the seventh floor must place their devices in lockers near the guard’s desk. Mrs. Clinton, her campaign said on Wednesday, took her smartphone to the State Department but kept it in a room outside the secure area around her office suite. Moreover, for truly sensitive data, the State Department does not use its own networks at all. It quietly uses a network run by one of the major intelligence agencies, according to officials familiar with the system. That suggests a lack of confidence that State’s classified systems can be fully trusted. Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used private email, officials in the government and many outside it have been monitoring the internet, looking to see if any of her messages, or those directed to her, made their way into the public domain. Documents from the Democratic National Committee began circulating after it announced a breach that also appears to have been conducted by Russian intelligence. Nothing from Mrs. Clinton has surfaced. But that does not mean they were not stolen, only that they have not been made public.",0
18138,One Veteran’s War on Islamophobia,"One Veteran’s War on Islamophobia Nate Terani and Nick Turse, October 31, 2016 Share This 
Originally posted at TomDispatch . 
Recently, I was asked a question about Kill Anything That Moves , my history of civilian suffering during the Vietnam War. An interviewer wanted to know how I responded to veterans who took offense at the (supposed) implication that every American who served in Vietnam committed atrocities. 
I think I softly snorted and slowly shook my head. 
Already two books behind me, Kill Anything That Moves might as well have been written by someone else in another lifetime. In some sense, it was. 
It takes effort for me to dredge up the faded memories of that work, a Kodachrome-hued swirl of hundreds of interviews on two continents over the course of a decade. But this particular question was easy enough to answer. Almost all the Americans I interviewed had seen combat, but most American veterans of the war hadn’t. Many had little or no real opportunity to commit war crimes. Case closed. 
But that question caused me to recall a host of related queries that churned around the book. Questions by skeptics, atrocity-deniers, fair-minded interviewers attempting to play devil’s advocate. A favorite was whether the book was ""anti-veteran."" That, too, was a head-shaker for me. 
""How could that be?"" I would respond. After all, the book owed its genesis to veterans. Veterans were key sources for it. Veterans provided the evidence. Veterans provided the quotes. Veterans even supplied the title. The book was, to a great extent, the history of the war as described to me by veterans. The story I told was their story. How could that in any way be anti-veteran? 
Many of the vets I spoke with viewed their truth-telling as a form of patriotism, of continuing service to country. Nate Terani’s inaugural TomDispatch essay follows in the same American tradition. His eyes were opened to the abuse of military power while living in Iran as a boy. Later he would join the U.S. Navy and wear the stars and stripes with particular pride. September 11th and all that came after – notably the demonization of his Muslim faith in his homeland – imbued him with a new mission, one he now views as no less sacred than his military service. 
From Smedley Butler to Andrew Bacevich , Daniel Ellsberg to Chelsea Manning , Vietnam Veterans Against the War to Iraq Veterans Against the War , the U.S. armed forces have produced a steady stream of truth-tellers and whistleblowers, men and women willing to serve their country in profound ways during trying times. There’s no bronze star for activism, no Navy Cross for unpopular or contrarian opinions, no Purple Heart for the hard knocks involved in speaking out against war crimes or Islamophobia or laying bare information vital to the American public. Veterans who dare to do so have sometimes walked a cold, lonely road far from the warm glow enjoyed by summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. Those who do so exhibit a special form of courage that may even exceed the bravery of the battlefield, the courage to stand tall and make oneself a target, a courage deserving ( with a nod to Thomas Paine ) of the love and thanks of man and woman. ~ Nick Turse 
Tehran, USA Fighting Fundamentalism in America By Nate Terani 
I’m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. 
What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. 
In Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders – of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry – Islamophobia – threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
""Death to America!"" 
As a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of ""Death to America!"" That day would define the rest of my life. 
It was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting ""Death to America!"" I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. 
In a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us – if we ever wanted to see our families again – to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, ""Death to America!"" as they stomped on our sacred symbols. 
I was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. 
Across the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for – or against. 
""Camel Jockey,""""Ayatollah,"" and ""Gandhi"" 
My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including ""camel jockey,""""sand-nigger,""""raghead,""""ayatollah,"" and ironically, ""Gandhi"" (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to ""other-ize"" me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. 
Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform – all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. 
When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. 
Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. 
Through patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the ""otherness"" of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. 
In 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve atthe Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. 
In the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist ""us vs. them"" attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. 
By the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam – or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. 
For the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America’s quest to escape the verydemons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. 
The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up 
On February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as ""a monster."" Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. 
The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. 
At that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help – and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon – and I, of course, joined it. 
From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. 
Our group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. 
Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a ""clash of civilizations."" Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an ""us vs. them"" and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. 
As of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the ""other,"" the enemy. 
My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. 
In many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country.

18139,"Ann Coulter: Every Time I Try to Be Mad at Trump, the Media Pull Me Back","Every time I try to be mad at Trump, the media reel me back in by launching some ridiculous, unprovoked attack. This time, it’s the fake news story about Trump “leaking” classified information to the Russkies. [The president can’t “leak” classified information: It’s his to declassify.  The big secret Trump allegedly revealed is that Muslims might try to blow up a plane with laptops. I already knew that. I read it in The New York Times. The New York Times, March 22, 2017: Devices Banned on Some Planes Over ISIS Fears, Intelligence showing that the Islamic State is developing a bomb hidden in portable electronics spurred the United States and Britain on Tuesday to bar passengers from airports in a total of 10   countries from carrying laptop computers   …     two senior American counterterrorism officials said.   …     This totally secret, Deep   information has been widely published in thousands of news outlets throughout the civilized world. There was yet another round of stories last week with the update that the U. S. is considering a laptop ban on flights from Europe as well. Hey, you know what might make more sense than banning laptops? How about banning Muslims? Bear with me here, I’m still working out the details, but I’m almost certain a federal judge in Hawaii can’t block a president’s temporary ban on Muslim immigration just because he’s testy with Trump over some campaign statements. As Northwestern law professor Eugene Kontorovich explained in The Washington Post, courts have never examined a politician’s campaign statements for improper motive, because 1) campaigns are not part of the deliberative process and 2) to start doing so would open the door to “examinations of the entire lives of political officials whose motives may be relevant to legal questions. ” Nonetheless, Kontorovich says, that is the legal argument being advanced against Trump’s travel ban: “Trump is a bigot, and thus his winning presidential campaign in fact impeaches him from exercising key constitutional and statutory powers, such as administering the immigration laws. ” To preserve their judicial coup, this Monday, the 9th Circuit sent out the geriatric ward to hear an appeal of the Hawaii judge’s absurd ruling. At their ages, there’s a good chance the judges will be dead by the time the Supreme Court overturns them. Arguing against Trump’s exercise of his constitutional and statutory powers was   American, Neal Katyal. (There are plenty of    . You couldn’t get one of them to argue that we should end our country through mass immigration?) At oral argument before the three wheezing gargoyles, Katyal announced that, before enforcing federal immigration laws passed by generations of Democrats and Republicans working together in Congress, the president of the United States is required to profess: “Islam is peace. ” There’s a new legal principle! Asked by one of the   if Trump is the only president who would be prohibited from issuing this precise travel ban because of his statements about Muslims, the smarmy, preening, pretentious Katyal answered: “I think the most important point is, if you don’t say all these things, you never wind up with an executive order like this. ” As lawyers say: Nonresponsive! But as long as we’re operating under these new rules for determining a U. S. president’s rights and responsibilities, how about looking at everything Trump has said about Muslims? For example, may the courts consider this quote from September 2015? Trump: “I love the Muslims. I think they are great people.   …     Would I consider putting a   in my Cabinet? Oh, absolutely. No problem with that. ” Lawyers like Katyal aren’t telling the courts what Trump said they’re telling courts their own crazy interpretations of what Trump said. No liberal is capable of accurately reporting Trump’s position because the left never understood his position in the first place. As Peter Thiel said, the media take Trump literally, but not seriously, while the people take him seriously, but not literally. After the San Bernardino terrorist attacks in December 2015, Trump made the perfectly reasonable suggestion that we curtail our breakneck importation of Muslims, some of whom periodically erupt in murderous violence. The media concluded: TRUMP HATES MUSLIMS! Nothing Trump or anyone else said could persuade them otherwise. Here’s what Trump actually said: What’s happened is, we’re out of control. We have no idea who’s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us.   …     I have friends that are Muslims. They are great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. ‘Cause something is going on. And we can’t put up with it, folks.   …     “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.   …     Where the hatred comes from and why  —   we’ll have to determine, we’re going to have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can’t live like this. It’s going to get worse and worse. You’re going to have more World Trade Centers.   …    ” Throughout the campaign, Trump supporters tried in vain to explain the   “Muslim ban” to a hostile media dead set on interpreting everything out of Trump’s mouth in the ugliest possible way. For example, our general policy on Muslim immigration would be “No, thanks!” but there would be exceptions. So Charles Krauthammer can stop worrying about King Abdullah of Jordan. In March, Trump supporter Andy Dean told a dense CNN anchor: He’s talking about the culture of Islam in the Middle East.   …     We love Muslims in America and they love us. Why? We have a great culture that respects women’s rights.   …     The thing about Muslims in the Middle East is they don’t respect women’s rights. If a woman wants to get a divorce in the Middle East, that woman could be killed. If you want to leave the religion of Islam in the Middle East, you can be killed. It’s very real. To the same blockhead anchor, Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany had to fill in an edited quote the network had just shown of Trump: It’s important to know what happened 15 seconds later. Anderson Cooper said to him, “Are you speaking of radical Islam or are you speaking of Islam?” He said radical sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference, though. So he did say radical Islam. He said it repeatedly during his campaign. He said, “I have Muslim friends. I love the Muslim people. ”   …     One of Trump’s vast number of   supporters told HLN’s Drew Pinksy: I love what (Trump) is doing with the Muslims getting out of the country, because if they really knew what that was about  —   if they knew that that was about freedom. It was about freedom versus enslavement. He’s right. It’s not about religion. It’s not about nationality. It’s about hitting the pause button on bringing in radical Islam’s dysfunctional, misogynist, violent,   culture. The voters understood Trump. (At least some of us did  —   barely enough of us to elect him president!) Liberals didn’t. But now the courts are blocking Trump’s exercise of presidential powers based on the left’s own idiotic misinterpretations of what he said.",0
18140,Race for Britain’s Prime Minister Down to Theresa May and Andrea Leadsom - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   One way or another, Britain will have its second female prime minister. The governing Conservative Party took another step on Thursday in its process to replace Prime Minister David Cameron, winnowing the contest to two candidates: Theresa May, the home secretary, and Andrea Leadsom, the junior energy minister. When the contest is concluded in September, one of them will become the first woman to lead Britain since Margaret Thatcher, also a Conservative, stepped down in 1990. The winner will take over as Britain grapples with how to carry through with its stunning decision last month to withdraw from the European Union, a choice that Mr. Cameron opposed and that led him to announce he would step aside once the party chose a successor. Ms. May quietly supported remaining in the European Union but has since said that she respects the outcome of the June 23 referendum and that she will seek the best possible deal for Britain as it negotiates its withdrawal from the bloc. She dominated the first stage of the selection process, in which the field is narrowed to two candidates through voting by the 330 Conservative members of the House of Commons. Ms. May, 59, remains the favorite, but in the next round will be judged by a different constituency: registered party members, many of whom were vociferous supporters of leaving the European Union. Conservative Party headquarters has for days been unable or unwilling to disclose how many registered voters there are, but the House of Commons Library said that the latest published figure of 149, 800 stems from December 2013. Voters will mail in their ballots, with the winner, to be announced on Sept. 9, becoming party leader and prime minister without having to call a general election. Ms. Leadsom, 53, the   in Thursday’s round of voting by members of Parliament, was a vocal advocate of leaving the European Union. In finishing second and qualifying for the final round, she eliminated Michael Gove, the justice secretary, who helped lead the Leave campaign. Mr. Gove had announced his candidacy just before the deadline last week, and in doing so torpedoed the hopes of his partner in the Leave campaign, Boris Johnson, the former London mayor, to succeed Mr. Cameron. Ms. May holds one of the   posts in the British government and is considered the more experienced candidate  —   serious and competent but lacking charisma. Ms. Leadsom, who had a low profile and entered government as a junior minister only in 2014, has been accused of inflating her résumé. As recently as three years ago, she supported continued British membership in the European Union. Ms. Leadsom put her 25 years of working in financial services before becoming a legislator in 2010 at the center of her leadership campaign, but those who worked with her have told reporters that she exaggerated her role at Barclays Bank and Invesco Perpetual, a fund manager. She told Sky News, “My CV is correct. ” In Thursday’s voting, Ms. May received 199 votes, Ms. Leadsom 84 and Mr. Gove 46. Ms. May and Ms. Leadsom are both ideological conservatives whose backgrounds are far different from those of the   male circle that has dominated Conservative politics since Mr. Cameron became party leader in 2005. Both women went to state schools, where Ms. May won a place at Oxford. Ms. Leadsom went to the University of Warwick. Ms. May said on Twitter that she was gratified by support from across the Conservative Party, including both people who favored membership in the European Union and those against it. “I’ve always said there should be a proper contest. Now is the time for me and my team to take our case out to members in the country,” she wrote. “We need proven leadership to negotiate the best deal as we leave the E. U. unite our party, and build a country that works for everyone. ” In a speech on Thursday, Ms. Leadsom said she would focus on “the continued success of the U. K. economy,” which has been hit hard by Brexit, raising fears of an increased budget deficit from lower growth and lower tax receipts. “Prosperity should be our goal, not austerity,” she said. She also said that “trade must be our top priority: continued free trade with the E. U. ” She added that she favored “fair but controlled immigration,” without explaining how   trade with the European Union could be maintained while scrapping European rules on freedom of movement and labor, which she also has said she intends to do. European Union leaders have repeatedly said that access to the single market of the European Union is not possible without accepting freedom of movement and labor. Ms. Leadsom had initially agreed to back Mr. Johnson in return for the promise of a high government post. He was supposed to call or text her confirming their arrangement by a certain time, but failed to do so, prompting Ms. Leadsom to announce her own surprise candidacy. Simon Jenkins, writing in The Guardian, defended Brexit as the instrument of a great clearing out of a stagnant British politics. “It has got rid of a prime minister and is about to get rid of a leader of the opposition,” he wrote. “It will soon be rid of a chancellor of the Exchequer and a lord chancellor. It is also rid of two, if not four, Tory heirs apparent. ” Even more, Mr. Jenkins said, the Labour Party is in chaos and the Greens and the U. K. Independence Party have both lost their leaders. “An entire political class is on the way out. As Oscar Wilde said of the death of Little Nell, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh. ”",0
18141,Survivors of Syria Gas Attack Recount ‘a Cruel Scene’ - The New York Times,"REYHANLI, Turkey  —   After an airstrike on his village, a Syrian farmer hurried to rescue the initial victims of the attack, the residents of a   home. But as Mohammad Nejdat Youssef neared the site, he ran headlong into what he described as “a winter fog  —   not quite yellow and not quite white. ” He started to lose his balance, he said. His eyes began to sting. His nose started to stream. Finally, Mr. Youssef said, he started to foam at the mouth. Mr. Youssef had been poisoned, one of the victims of Tuesday’s chemical attack in northern Syria, one of the deadliest chemical weapons attacks in years in the country, which killed dozens of people. A tall and burly man, Mr. Youssef, 23, was able to recover after being treated locally. But when the toxic cloud that had sickened him was blown downwind toward his farm outside the village, his pregnant wife, 20, and a nephew, 9, had a far more serious reaction and were evacuated by ambulance to a hospital in Turkey, said Mr. Youssef, who accompanied them. At the hospital in Reyhanli, a small Turkish border town that took in many of the victims, the mourners gathered outside mostly came from just two extended families, Mr. Youssef’s and the Abu Amash family. The families are connected by marriage and both come from Khan Sheikhoun, the village in   Idlib Province that residents said had been hit with chemical weapons earlier that morning. “Just look at this!” Orwa Abu Amash, 33, said as he held up his phone. On the screen was a long WhatsApp message listing what he claimed were the names of 46 relatives who had died that day in Khan Sheikhoun. As Mr. Youssef paced around the parking lot outside the hospital, he said he was scared not just for his wife on the other side of the hospital wall, who had arrived lying motionless on a stretcher, but for his relatives on the other side of the border. Many of them had also been poisoned by the gas but had not been deemed sick enough to be treated in Turkey, whose border is closed to most Syrians. Earlier Tuesday, witnesses reached by phone in Syria described similarly traumatic scenes at the site of the attack. Warplanes had roared overhead just before 7 a. m. when many people in the town were sleeping after a night of intense sounds of bombing, said Othman   an activist in Khan Sheikhoun who was reached via phone at a first aid station. He spoke after fleeing Rahmeh Hospital in Khan Sheikhoun, where many victims were being treated, after an airstrike hit part of the hospital. While he was speaking, another loud boom sounded, and the line went dead he called back to say it had been another nearby strike. The   area’s minister of health, Mohamad Firas   said in an online video that hospitals and clinics were overwhelmed. He said he had been in a field hospital at 7:30 a. m. when over 100 people arrived injured or sickened many others, he said, were sent to other clinics, with some left lying in the corridors. Symptoms, he said, included suffocation, fluid in the lungs with foam coming from the mouth, unconsciousness, spasms and paralysis. “It’s a shocking act,” he said. “The world knows and is aware of what’s happening in Syria, and we are ready to submit evidences to criminal laboratories to prove the use of these gases. ” Yasser Sarmani, a rebel fighter reached by phone in Idlib, said he collapsed while driving to the scene on his motorcycle to help the victims. “It became a routine for us that when we hear an airstrike to rush to the scene and try to rescue people,” he said. “I woke up to the sound of an explosion, but it was not as loud as usual. ” “Driving against the wind, my eyes started burning and I felt I was being suffocated,” he added. “People were running away from the site and falling on the ground. It was a cruel scene. At that point I fainted. ” He said he woke up an hour later at a clinic, after receiving injections and oxygen. “Kids were all over the floor, some dead and others struggling to breathe,” he said. “The noise of them trying to breath was loud, with foam all over their faces. ” As they watched the ambulances come and go outside the hospital in Reyhanli, Mr. Youssef and several of his relatives wondered what President Trump might make of all this. On Monday, Mr. Trump’s administration signaled that it no longer saw the departure of President Bashar   of Syria as a priority. On Tuesday, Mr. Assad appeared to unleash one of the worst chemical attacks of the war. “If Donald Trump is happy for this to happen to his own people and his own children,” said Mr. Youssef, “then we’re happy to keep Bashar  . ” Shuffling around in the hospital parking lot, several of Mr. Youssef’s relatives buried themselves in their phones, watching the videos of the morning’s atrocities over and over. The clips have been widely circulated on the internet. They show the pale corpses of dead toddlers, or the retching bodies of men who appear to be close to death. One   woman lay on her back, her purple leggings exposed. A young boy, perhaps 12, lay motionless except for his mouth, gasping for air. None had visible marks of injury. Some of the sickened and dying were nearly naked, as rescuers, many with their bare hands, stripped them and hosed them down. A man narrating a video of motionless children, lined up as if sleeping, was able to come up only with sentence fragments. “A whole family,” he repeated. Unlike the people around the globe who found these videos on social media, several of those watching them outside the hospital in Reyhanli had witnessed the scenes in real life. You wouldn’t have known it, however, by looking at their blank faces. “We’ve seen so much of this,” Mr. Abu Amash said. “It’s normal. We see this every day. We had six years of it. ”",0
18142,"Dakota Access Caught Infiltrating Protests to Incite Violence, Funding Trolls Online","posted by Eddie You know the Dakota Access Pipeline protests are working when oil interests start resorting to underhanded tricks to paint water protectors in a negative light. As the fight against the pipeline grows in North Dakota and around the country, dirty tricks are being deployed in an apparent attempt to delegitimize the opposition. Dakota Access Employee Tries to Incite Violence, Sheriff’s Department Makes False Report That He Was Shot by Protesters Mother Jones journalist Wes Enzinna, who was at the protests, says he witnessed a Dakota Access LLC employee try to infiltrate the Dakota Access Pipeline protests: “An armed security agent employed by the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline was arrested Thursday after he was caught entering the camp of activists protesting near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in southern North Dakota. After a car chase and a standoff during which he allegedly pointed his assault rifle at a local Sioux teenager, the man, whose ID indicated he was an employee of Dakota Access LLC, was arrested and handed over to the FBI.” According to an official statement from the tribe, the man fired several shots from his gun before being peacefully apprehended by tribal police. Witnesses at the scene say he pointed his gun at several protesters. The man was clearly trying to provoke violence that could later be used to demonize protesters who have so far remained peaceful. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department circulated a false report claiming the man was shot, presumably by protesters. As you can see in the images above, the man was not harmed. The Sheriff’s Department has since retracted that report. Anti-Media ’s attempts to obtain clarifying comments from Morton County Sheriff’s were ignored. 
Fake Internet Trolls Slam Dakota Access Pipeline Protests, Promote Pipeline on Twitter 
With very little organic support for the Dakota Access Pipeline remaining, groups allied with the pipeline builders now seem to be creating paid Internet trolls or bots to slam protesters while praising the pipeline. DESMOG , an environmental blog, conducted an investigation and found what it says are “sock puppet” accounts tied to an oil industry lobby operating on Twitter: “A DeSmog investigation has revealed the possibility that a front group supporting the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) — the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now (MAIN) — may have created fake Twitter profiles, known by some as ‘sock puppets,’ to convey a pro-pipeline message over social media. And MAIN may be employing the PR services of the firm DCI Group, which has connections to the Republican Party, in order to do so. “DeSmog tracked down at least 16 different questionable Twitter accounts which used the #NoDAPL hashtag employed by protesters, in order to claim that opposition to the pipeline kills jobs, that those protesting the pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s encampment use violence, and that the pipeline does not pose a risk to water sources or cross over tribal land. “On September 13, people began to suspect these accounts were fake, calling them out on Twitter , and by September 14, most of the accounts no longer existed.” 
With the Dakota Access Pipeline builders resorting to backhanded trickery, it’s clear the tide is turning against the pipeline following law enforcement’s overwhelming militarized crackdown of the protests. source:",0

On Sunday, exactly a week after he found out he had made the United States team, he was 2 down with three holes to play in his singles match against Lee Westwood when two of his teammates, Patrick Reed and J. B. Holmes, showed up on the 16th hole in a show of support. As Reed and Holmes looked on, Moore produced an    finish to hand Westwood a   defeat and deliver the United States its 15th point, clinching the Americans’ first victory in the biennial event against a European team after      losses. It did not matter, Moore said, that he was making his Ryder Cup debut while Westwood was making his 10th appearance. “I saw both of those guys,” Moore said, “and I said: ‘All right, I’m going to do it for my team. I’m going to try to flip this match somehow. ’” The Americans, who had lost eight of the previous 10 Ryder Cups, flipped their fortunes in the competition one man and one match at a time.

Patrick Reed, whose fiery demeanor and   play earned him the nickname Captain America, gained the first point for the United States in Sunday’s singles matches with a   victory against Rory McIlroy in a showdown of showmen that featured exquisite shotmaking,   exchanges and a warm embrace when it was over. By sundown, every United States player had earned at least a point during the   event. The last time that happened was in 1975, when an American team captained by Arnold Palmer dominated a squad from Britain and Ireland. It was the perfect tribute to Palmer, who died five days before this year’s competition got underway at Hazeltine National Golf Club. The United States captain, Davis Love III, whose 2012 squad squandered a   lead and lost on the final day at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago, said he was proud of how his players competed in the face of immense pressure. “But mostly, proud of the way they came together as family and supported each other,” Love said. Brandt Snedeker, a player on that losing squad in 2012, said this team was closer. “I think this week the underlying theme was everybody had your back,” he said. Snedeker was the only American to go unbeaten. He said he could not have finished    if not for the support of Bubba Watson, who helped him get past his singles opponent, Andy Sullivan, by 3 and 1. Watson walked with Snedeker during the match on Sunday and kept him loose and in a positive frame of mind after Snedeker fell two holes behind after three holes. Watson, the   golfer in the world, was not playing because he had been bypassed for the 12th and final team berth in favor of Moore. Desiring to be included in the event, Watson volunteered to serve as part cheerleader, part errand boy for Love’s team. “I don’t know if I could have done it without him out there,” Snedeker said of Watson, one of the American team’s five vice captains. In truth, Love had six assistants, because everyone included Phil Mickelson  —   who, at 46, qualified for his 11th Ryder Cup  —   as part of the captain’s coterie. Perhaps no one, including Love, came into this competition with more pressure on his shoulders than Mickelson, who had spoken out against the status quo in the news conference after the Americans’   loss in Scotland in 2014. Mickelson criticized the leadership style of that year’s captain, Tom Watson, who was seated a few feet away. His   insurrection led to an overhaul of the system for selecting the players and the captain. The players, past and present, got more input, and a more collaborative process was put in place. One of the changes instituted paved the way for the   selection of Moore. Mickelson’s contributions to the victory ended with his    record but started with that news conference in 2014. At Sunday’s      session, the first question was for Mickelson. He was asked what he thought of Love’s leadership. Mickelson laughed along with everyone else on the dais. “We had a great week this week,” he said. “We had a lot of fun together as a team, and we played some great golf, and we are really excited to have won. ” When he was finished, Mickelson’s teammates and their support crew applauded him. “We can’t thank Phil enough,” Snedeker said, adding: “He realized how this week turned out was going to reflect on him 100 percent, and to have shoulders that big and go out there and realize you’re going to have to shoulder it one way or the other  —   we all felt invested in that. We were not going to let Phil go down as a scapegoat. ” Mickelson said he felt their support all week but especially Sunday, in his singles match against Sergio García. It was an epic contest, with the players combining for 19 birdies, 10 by Mickelson. He had one bogey for a 63 but made a clutch putt at the 18th hole to secure a halve with García and extend his career singles record to   . His teammates, Mickelson said, “told me all the time they had my back, and it was an awesome feeling. ” “It elevated me to a different level of play having that type of support system,” he added. “I felt the support, the energy, and I played my best golf. ” After his last putt dropped, Mickelson’s feet left the ground. His jump was not as high as his putt was long, but it didn’t matter. He got his message across. The margin of victory was deceptive. Trailing by 3 points on Sunday morning, Europe’s captain, Darren Clarke, had in desperation   his singles lineup. His strategy sent shivers through the partisan crowds when no American player in the first five matches held a lead after the first nine. The Europeans pulled to within a point of the United States with victories in three of the first four completed singles matches. But the Americans finished strong. Led by Moore and Snedeker, they won five of the last six matches while Mickelson sat with his wife, Amy, behind the 18th green soaking up the scene. The European team featured six Ryder Cup rookies, including Thomas Pieters, who compiled a record of  . Pieters and McIlroy are not going anywhere, so the United States cannot afford to rest on this win. “We need to build on this,” Mickelson said. “Otherwise, it’s all for naught. ”",0
18148,Breitbart News Daily: Pat Buchanan on Trump’s First 100 Days - Breitbart,"On the Tuesday edition of Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 6AM to 9AM Eastern, Breitbart    Alex Marlow will continue our discussion of the first 100 days of the Trump administration. [He’ll be joined by the renowned conservative writer and historian Patrick J. Buchanan. Buchanan, who was the subject of a recent Politico profile, will weigh in on Trump’s first 100 days. As the opening paragraph of Politico’s article details, Buchanan is nothing short of a living legend whose keen insights into the populist nationalist movement predate Trump’s political ascendancy by decades:  His first date with his future wife was spent in a New Hampshire motel room drinking Wild Turkey into the wee hours with Hunter S. Thompson. He stood several feet away from Martin Luther King Jr. during the “I Have a Dream” speech. He went to China with Richard M. Nixon and walked away from Watergate unscathed. He survived   too, and sat alongside Ronald Reagan at the Reykjavík Summit. He invaded America’s living rooms and pioneered the rhetorical combat that would power the cable news age. He defied the establishment by challenging a sitting president of his own party. He captured the fear and frustration of the right by proclaiming a great “culture war” was at hand. And his   candidacy in 2000 almost certainly handed George W. Bush the presidency, thanks to thousands of Palm Beach, Florida, residents mistakenly voting for him on the “butterfly ballot” when they meant to back Al Gore. We’ll also hear from Rep. Louis Gohmert ( ) and White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Live from London, Rome, and Jerusalem, Breitbart correspondents will provide updates on the latest international news.

18149,Report: House Intel Committee to See ’Smoking Gun’ Evidence Obama Admin Spied on Trump Team - Breitbart,"James Rosen of Fox News reports that Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee will be presented with “smoking gun” evidence that “the Obama administration, in its closing days, was using the cover of legitimate surveillance on foreign targets to spy on   Trump. ”[According to the source for Rosen’s report, this evidence will come from the National Security Agency, which is supposed to produce documents for the House Intelligence Committee by Friday. It is expected to take a week or so for congressional investigators to assess these materials.  The NSA material is said to be even more compelling than the evidence that prompted committee chairman Devin Nunes ( ) to announce on Wednesday that “incidental” surveillance of the Trump transition team was conducted by the intelligence community. Rosen’s report has a few more interesting developments in the aftermath of Nunes’ announcement: Because Nunes’s intelligence came from multiple sources during a span of several weeks, and he has not shared the actual materials with his committee colleagues, he will be the only member of the panel in a position to know whether the NSA has turned over some or all of the intelligence he is citing. However, Fox News was told Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Rep. Adam Schiff,  . had been briefed on the basic contents of the intelligence described by Nunes. CIA Director Mike Pompeo is also sympathetic to the effort to determine, with documentary evidence, the extent of any alleged Obama administration spying on the Trump team, sources said. Because so much criticism has been leveled at the media for basing reports hostile to the Trump administration on anonymous sources of uncertain motivation, it should be duly noted that the Fox News report relies heavily upon a single source, without a single clue to this person’s identity or position. It’s not clear if this individual is connected to the intelligence community, or to the House Intelligence Committee. The nature of the NSA’s “smoking gun” information is also left to the reader’s imagination. In fact, it’s described as “potential smoking gun” information. It should also be noted that on Thursday, a spokesperson for Nunes said the chairman is waiting to see “all the documents he requested” from intelligence agencies before he “knows for sure” what surveillance of the transition team or   Trump was conducted. Perhaps the material coming from the NSA will positively establish which, if any, Trump transition team members were caught up in the “incidental surveillance” Nunes described on Wednesday. An unnamed intelligence official speculated to ABC News that surveillance on foreign officials might have caught them “talking about Trump transition team members, as opposed to transition team members participating directly in the communications. ” The NSA would seem to be the agency most likely to possess documentation resolving that question.",0
18150,"Tens of thousands march for, against Venezuela government","Tens of thousands march for, against Venezuela government   
Tens of thousands of pro and anti-government protesters have gathered on the streets of Venezuela's capital Caracas. 
During Wednesday’s mass rallies, in which over 20 people were injured and 39 were detained, the opponents accused President Nicolas Maduro of violating the constitutional order and blocking a recall referendum aimed at removing him from power. 
They also called for his immediate resignation. 
“This is a way of pressuring Maduro so he understands that he has to go,"" said one protester. ""Being passive is no use anymore. We have to apply more pressure,"" another one added. 
Meanwhile, large numbers of pro-government protesters gathered near the Miraflores presidential palace in a show of support for Maduro. 
As the protests were being held, the president engaged in crisis security talks in reaction to the demonstrators’ demands. In a televised speech after the talks, he called for ""political dialogue and peace in Venezuela."" 
Maduro is adamant about Washington's role in his country’s political and economic woes, and has accused the opposition of conspiring with the US against the South American country. 
""They are desperate, they have received the order from the north to destroy the Venezuelan revolution,"" he added. 
On Tuesday, Maduro accused the opposition of attempting a “parliamentary coup” by voting to launch an impeachment process against him. 
“There has never been a parliamentary coup in Venezuela, and we shall not allow anything like this to happen, the right-wing here and there should know this,” Maduro said during a massive rally by his supporters outside the presidential palace. 
The opposition-controlled National Assembly agreed to initiate the impeachment process against Maduro earlier on Tuesday in reaction to blocking a bid to recall him last week. 
The political standoff in Venezuela has worsened since the October 20 suspension of the opposition push to hold a referendum to try to recall Maduro. Back then, four state courts said the signature-gathering process for the referendum had been “fraudulent,” effectively blocking it. Share This Article...",0

18152,Kerry and Albright Ask Courts to Keep Blocking Trump’s Travel Ban - The New York Times,"A group of prominent Democrats who served in recent administrations, including John Kerry and Madeleine K. Albright, have called on the courts to extend a ruling blocking crucial parts of President Trump’s travel ban, saying the White House executive order would “endanger U. S. troops” and disrupt antiterrorism efforts. The former officials expressed their concerns on Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, which is considering the matter after a judge in Seattle effectively ruled that travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations as well as vetted refugees from all nations could, for now, continue to enter the United States. With Mr. Trump’s executive order, “we risk placing our military efforts at risk by sending an insulting message” to Iraqis working with American forces battling the Islamic State there, the legal filing to the court said. “The order will likely feed the recruitment narrative of ISIL and other extremists that portray the United States as at war with Islam,” it said, using another name for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. In addition to Mr. Kerry, a secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and Ms. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton, officials behind the filing included Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, and Leon E. Panetta, who served as secretary of defense and head of the C. I. A. The filing comes a week after Mr. Obama took issue with Mr. Trump’s order, saying in a statement that he “fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion. ” The former officials hope that adding their voice to the debate from a national security perspective undercuts a critical argument of the Trump administration: that the travel ban is meant to deter terrorist attacks by keeping the country safe from “very bad and dangerous people,” as Mr. Trump has put it. Noting that the 10 signatories to the filing “have all held the highest security clearances,” the letter asserts that Mr. Trump’s order “ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer. ” The travel ban was dealt a stinging setback on Friday, when a federal judge in Seattle issued the broadest ruling to date blocking major parts of the executive order. The Trump administration appealed Saturday, leaving the issue in the hands of the court in San Francisco. After the appeals panel rules, the Supreme Court is likely to take up the issue.",0

18154,"Kerry: Trump’s Reasons for Paris Accord Withdrawal ’Fake News,’ Puts ’America Last’ - Breitbart","Thursday, former secretary of state John Kerry said President Donald Trump’s reasons to withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change were “fake news” that will end up putting “America last” in the renewable energy industry.  Kerry said, “My immediate reaction is this is an abdication of American leadership, a shameful moment for the United States to have unilaterally walked away from an agreement which did not have one other country requiring us to do something. It was a voluntary program. We designed the program. The president was not truthful with the American people today and the president who talked about putting America first has now put America last. Together with Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and Nicaragua, which though the agreement didn’t go far enough. This is an extraordinary moment of fake news because the economy he described is not the economy of America. ” “America has been gaining jobs in solar,” he continued. “Solar has gained 17 times the rate of our economy. There are 2. 6 million jobs in our country in clean energy. Half of them are in the states that Donald Trump won. So he is not helping the forgotten American. He’s hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma in the summer. They will have a harder time having economic growth. He’s made us an environmental pariah in the world.

Según activistas medioambientales de la región, la muerte de miles de anfibios de esta especie autóctona del lago Titicaca fue provocada por la contaminación incontrolada del río Coata. Imagen Ilustrativa Pixabay / Couleur Síguenos en Facebook 
Las autoridades peruanas están investigando la repentina muerte de al menos 10.000 ranas gigantes en el río Coata, que desemboca en el lago Titicaca. Se considera que la muerte de los anfibios fue provocada por la contaminación incontrolada del cauce de este río, informa el diario peruano ' Correo '. 
El Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (Serfor) de Perú ""actuó de forma inmediata tras recibir una alerta sobre la muerte de las ranas"", según un comunicado publicado en el sitio web del organismo. Sin embargo, los miembros del comité de lucha contra la contaminación del río Coata aseguran que las autoridades no han hecho todo lo posible para prevenir la tragedia . 
Los activistas medioambientales llevaron unas 100 ranas muertas a la plaza central de la localidad más cercana, Puno, para atraer la atención sobre el problema. ""Me tocó traer las ranas muertas para que nos creyeran. El gobierno no sabe cómo estamos viviendo acá"", explicó la líder del comité, Maruja Inquilla. ""No saben el nivel de contaminación que tiene el río. La situación se está saliendo de control "", añadió. 
""El problema es que no cuidan el río"", afirmó Roberto Elías, un experto en anfibios que lleva trabajando en un programa para la conservación de esta especie desde 2010. ""Estos anfibios son muy sensibles y los llamamos centinelas ambientales, porque en cuanto se modifica algo en el ecosistema son las primeras especies en morir "", agregó. 
Conocida científicamente como 'Telmatobius culeus', la rana gigante del Titicaca recibió su apodo por los enormes pliegues de piel que incrementan el volumen de su cuerpo. Esta especie autóctona del lago Titicaca , que comparten Perú y Bolivia, está declarada en peligro crítico de extinción desde el año 2004.",0
18156,Hillary Clinton’s Edge in a Donald Trump-Centric Race Has Liberals Wary - The New York Times,"Liberal Democrats and progressive activists have grown wary of the state of the 2016 presidential race, chafing at Hillary Clinton’s   courtship of Republican leaders they have long opposed and fearing the consequences of shaping the contest as a referendum on Donald J. Trump. While few have questioned the electoral strategy of bringing Republicans into the fold by casting Mr. Trump as a singular threat to democracy, both skeptics and some admirers of Mrs. Clinton have come to view her decisive advantage in the polls with mixed emotions. She may win by a   margin, they say. But what, exactly, would the mandate be for? In a matter of weeks, beginning with the party conventions, the   debates that animated the Democratic primary race have largely disappeared from the political foreground, giving way to discussions of Mr. Trump’s temperament, his inflammatory remarks and even his sanity. “If she’s going to get anything done as president, she is going to have to have a mandate,” said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor in Bill Clinton’s administration who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary. The subject of Mr. Trump’s temperament was unavoidable, Mr. Reich said, “but temperament doesn’t give you a mandate to do anything. ” Mrs. Clinton’s dogged pursuit of Republican votes has especially rankled progressives, and highlights the divisions within the Democratic Party, even as they see a victory more likely. They have grumbled at her eager promotion of endorsements from veterans of the George W. Bush and Reagan administrations, including that of John D. Negroponte, a top diplomat and intelligence official under Mr. Bush. They worry aloud that Henry Kissinger, of whom Mrs. Clinton has often spoken fondly, could be next. “Secretary Clinton’s decision to aggressively court Mitt Romney’s base has her looking more and more like Mitt Romney every day,” said Benjamin T. Jealous, a former N. A. A. C. P. president who initially supported Mr. Sanders. “That’s not a good thing. ” By most measures, the Democratic Party’s left flank has had a banner year. Mr. Sanders’s primary challenge pushed Mrs. Clinton conspicuously left, coaxing her into policy shifts on trade and college tuition. The party platform was, by virtually all accounts, the most progressive in history, and Mrs. Clinton has not made any perceptible changes in substance recently. Notably, a major economic speech from Mrs. Clinton on Thursday in Michigan would not have seemed out of place in the primary race, with discussions of expanded Social Security,   college and a higher minimum wage. And on Friday morning, her campaign, sensitive to any suggestion that Mrs. Clinton might waver on promises to the left, emailed reporters a collection of 22 sympathetic quotes and Twitter posts from   leaders and organizations. “She is not just running as the alternative to the other guy. She is running on a progressive policy agenda that she seriously believes will make a difference in people’s lives,” Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said in an email. “If she wins, it will not just mean a rejection of Donald Trump. It will be a call to action on the issues she has championed. ” But the campaign’s chief gambit since the start of the Democratic convention  —   depicting Mr. Trump as a menacing anomaly, disconnected from mainstream Republican thought  —   has already supplied   conservatives with an opening: Even if Mrs. Clinton wins big, Republicans opposed to Mr. Trump’s rise may argue that Americans were not voting for her policy proposals. Some are not waiting. “Clinton is not likely to emerge with a legislative mandate,” said Rick Tyler, a former top aide to Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential run. “She will have to start from zero in terms of selling all her policy proposals. They will not have been sold through this process. ” Mr. Tyler, who believes the 2016 election has effectively been decided, predicted a common refrain from Republican legislators next year: “We didn’t see that the people voted for that we see that the people voted against Donald Trump. ” In interviews, elected progressive leaders, activists and local lawmakers made clear that their top priority remains defeating Mr. Trump. Most cautioned that the race was a long way from over, despite a wave of encouraging polls for Mrs. Clinton. Still, some liberals fear their leverage has been diminished, though the vast majority of Sanders supporters have rallied to Mrs. Clinton’s side, if sometimes tepidly. If she can win without generating excitement among that already distrustful wing of the party, they reason, she may be less inclined to accommodate it once in office. “We need the broadest popular front against Donald Trump,” said Bill Lipton, a founder of the Working Families Party. “The challenge for the left is, if that’s all we do, we’re saying anyone one degree to the left of David Duke is O. K. with us. ” Many of Mr. Sanders’s backers believe that two of the principal issues he raised during his primary contest against Mrs. Clinton  —   her foreign policy hawkishness and her Wall Street ties  —   remain central to her political core. “I fully expected that we would be at war with the Clinton administration, if there is one,” said Jonathan Tasini, a former union leader who challenged Mrs. Clinton in her Senate primary in 2006. “Once she is elected, I suspect she will go back to being what she is, which is a relatively moderate, centrist, corporate Democrat. ” Helen Gym, a Philadelphia City Council member who supported Mrs. Clinton in the primary, said the dynamics between Mrs. Clinton’s team and the party’s activist base reflected “a fragile negotiation. ” “The coalition has to hold together,” she said. “Is a Clinton victory synonymous with a progressive victory? It depends. I don’t think I can give a full yes or no. ” Megan Ellyia Green, a St. Louis alderwoman and Sanders delegate, said she feared Democrats were squandering “our New Deal moment” by not focusing voters’ attention more intensely on the issues that powered enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton and her team have long ago grown weary of any implication that she is not entirely committed to liberal causes, repeatedly presenting her as a fusion of pragmatism and idealism. She has called herself “a progressive who likes to get things done. ” In both of her presidential primary runs, Mrs. Clinton accused her opponents  —   first Barack Obama in 2008, then Mr. Sanders  —   of promising more than they could credibly deliver. But when approached at her rallies, even zealous Clinton supporters are often   to name a signature policy proposal of hers. Her speech in Michigan touched on, among other things, a planned $275 billion infrastructure investment and green energy spending. Mr. Fallon noted that Mrs. Clinton has pledged to act on issues ranging from immigration reform to gun safety. On some such measures, she has promised to pursue executive action in the face of possible congressional resistance. Recent unease from the left has often centered more on presentation and messaging than on the merits of her proposals. “Her policy proposals are admirably detailed, but they cover so much ground that their whole is less than the sum of their parts,” Mr. Reich said. “She really needs to focus on a few big ideas. ” Some Clinton allies have argued that the most pressing goal should be to run up the largest possible margin of victory, which could enable the party to seize   seats that might be unwinnable in an ordinary year. And a number of candidates in such elections, including some elevated by Mr. Sanders, have said it is incumbent on them to frame their races as something more than a Trump litmus test. “It’s up to us,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state senator who recently won her primary in a run for Congress. Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Mrs. Clinton’s efforts to cast a wide net and train voters’ attention on Mr. Trump amounted to a “  sword. ” “Republicans in Congress won’t grant as easily after the election that we won a huge mandate on progressive issues, but thanks to Donald Trump, we might have more progressives and majorities in Congress,” Mr. Green said. “I’d rather have a Republican minority in denial about what just happened than a Republican majority standing in the way. ”",0

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Earlier in the day, Amnesty International revealed in a report that the US-led coalition had killed hundreds of noncombatants in Syria during two years of airstrikes that were purported to target the Daesh. © Sputnik/ US Military on Ground in Syria Training Opposition for Raqqa Operation ""We take all such reports seriously and we support the Defense Department as they do the proper investigations,"" Kirby told reporters. ""We welcome that input."" 
When asked about the rights group suggesting that the US-led coalition underestimated harm done to civilians in Syria, Kirby claimed that the United States had no reason not to welcome that feedback because its military tries harder than any other to avoid civilian casualties. 
Amnesty International said US authorities have failed to respond to a memorandum that raised questions about the conduct of coalition forces in Syria. 
According to the group, the most recent deadly airstrikes, conducted in June and July, killed more than 100 civilians in the Syrian villages of Tukhar, Hadhadh and Ghandoura. ...",0

Britain is lagging behind countries including Rwanda, the Philippines and Nicaragua in a global ranking of gender parity, slipping to 20th place on the World Economic Forum (WEF) index. 
Read more 
The WEF, a not-for-profit based in Switzerland, analyzed data from 144 countries. It found the global gender gap has widened to its largest extent since 2008. It estimates economic gender parity won’t be achieved for at least another 170 years. 
The US and Australia are even further behind than Britain, however, at 45th and 46th place respectively. 
The UK’s 2016 rankings – which take into account key areas such as the economy, politics, education and health – mark a slide from ninth position in 2006. 
Britain sits at number 53 for economic participation. This reflects a drop in the number of women in senior and technical positions, as well as a reduction in the estimated income women earn compared to men. 
The UK is ranked 24th for political empowerment, because of a fall in the number of women parliamentarians, the WEF said. The figures do not take into account Prime Minister Theresa May’s rise to Downing Street.

Rwanda, by contrast, has the highest share of women in parliament globally at 64 percent. 
Jemima Olchawski, head of policy and insight at the Fawcett Society, told the Express: “It’s unacceptable that Britain is languishing at 53rd in the world for economic participation, is only 24th for political empowerment and performs below average compared to our region. 
“The moral case for gender equality should be enough alone to motivate us to speed up the pace of change, but with evidence suggesting that improving gender equality could add £150 billion [US$183 billion] to our GDP it’s also clear that we simply can’t afford to wait.”

Voter fraud has been labeled as a right-wing myth by the left, but Schulkin, a Democrat, confirmed everyoneâ€™s worst fears, going against the grain of his own party.
â€œYou know, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s too much to ask somebody to show some kind of an IDâ€ŚLike I say, people donâ€™t realize, certain neighborhoods in particular they bus people around to vote,â€ said Schulkin.
When asked about which type of neighborhoods the busing of voters takes place in, Schulkin confirmed that it was minority neighborhoods, adding, â€œthey get busses and they move people around.â€
Schulkin expressed concern over voter fraud and suggested that Mayor Bill de Blasio was to blame for a lot of the voter fraud taking place in New York City.
â€œHe gave out ID cards. De Blasio. Thatâ€™s in lieu of a driverâ€™s license, but you can use it for anything. But, they didnâ€™t vet people to see who they really are. Anybody can go in there and say I am Joe Smith, I want an ID card. Itâ€™s absurd. Thereâ€™s a lot of fraud. Not just voter fraud, all kinds of fraud.â€
Despite having disapproval with de Blasioâ€™s faulty ID program and widespread voter fraud, Schulkin also expressed concerns over safety in the polling locations as well as the potential for voter fraud, specifically with regards to Muslims wearing burkas.
â€œThey detonate bombs in the public schools, which we are using. That could disrupt the whole electionâ€ŚYour vote doesnâ€™t even count, because they can go in there with a burka and you donâ€™t know if they are a voter.â€
It is clear after listening to a New York City Democratic Election Commissioner that the Democrats are in denial of the fraud that surrounds them. Schulkin confirms that voter ID laws are something that New York City desperately needs as a way to curb voter fraud.

18164,"All Governments Lie, The Movie","Posted on October 30, 2016 by DavidSwanson 
Picture, if you will, video footage of vintage (early 2016) Donald Trump buffoonery with the CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves commenting on major media’s choice to give Trump vastly more air time than other candidates: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” 
That’s the introduction to a powerful critique of the U.S. media. A new film screens in New York and Los Angeles this week called All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone . 
The website AllGovernmentsLie.com has screening dates , a list of lies , and a list of good journalists who expose lies . The lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film, but there’s a good deal of overlap — enough to give you a sense of what this project is about. 
I’d have made various changes and additions to the film. In particular, I’m tired of all the focus on Iraq 2003. This film touches on war lies since then, but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence. 
Still, this is a film that should be shown in cities, homes, and classrooms across the United States. It includes and is driven by Noam Chomsky’s analysis of how the media system is “rigged” without those doing the rigging believing they’ve done anything at all. It’s a survey of skullduggery by corporate media. It’s an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm. And it’s an introduction to I.F. Stone. It includes footage of a presentation of the annual Izzy Award which goes to journalists acting in Stone’s tradition. 
One of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the Gulf of Tonkin (non-)Incident. Anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie. And it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense. That is: had the North Vietnamese really shot back at a U.S. ship off their coast, that would not have been any sort of legal, much less moral, justification for escalating a war. I’d love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the Black Sea, the Red Sea, and every other part of the earth today. 
But the Gulf of Tonkin lies about Vietnamese aggression against the U.S. ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of Vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the U.S. role of Global Policeman. Someone had to make the lies transparent. Someone had to document that in fact the Secretary of So-Called Defense and the President were lying. Sadly, nobody did that in the first 24 hours after the Congressional committee hearings, and that was all it took for Congress to hand the president a war. 
And it was decades before White House transcripts came out and before the National Security Agency confessed, and additional years before former Secretary Robert McNamara did. Yet, those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew. And they knew it because of I.F. Stone who just weeks after the (non-)incident published a four-page edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about Tonkin. 
Stone’s analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the Red Sea off Yemen. And in fact it is to Yemen that Stone immediately turned on page 1 in 1964. The United Nations, including its U.S. ambassador, had recently condemned British attacks on Yemen that Britain defended as retaliatory. President Dwight Eisenhower had also warned the French against retaliatory attacks on Tunisia. And President Lyndon Johnson, even at the time of Tonkin, Stone notes, was warning Greece and Turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other. 
Stone, who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to, pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks: the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the U.N. Charter. The latter two are still theoretically in place for the U.S. government. 
The United States in Vietnam, Stone goes on to show, could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of Vietnamese boats. And indeed the U.S. ships, Stone reports, were in North Vietnamese waters and were there to assist South Vietnamese ships that were shelling two North Vietnamese islands. And in fact those ships had been supplied to South Vietnam by the U.S. military and the good old American tax payers. 
Stone did not have access to closed committee hearings, but he hardly needed it. He considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war. And then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees. He found their denials to be non-denials and nonsensical. It made no sense that the U.S. ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the South Vietnamese ships. Stone didn’t believe it. 
Stone also filled in the background information. The United States had been supporting guerrilla attacks on North Vietnam for years prior to the non-incident. And Stone raised numerous suspicions, including the question of why the U.S. ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the (non-)incident to (not) occur, and the question of why in the world Vietnam would take on the United States military (something nobody could explain, though Eugene McCarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored). 
Missing from the film and website of All Governments Lie is I.F. Stone’s work on lies about the outbreak of the Korean War. We’ve learned more since he wrote it, but seen little more insightful, relevant, or timely for our understanding of Korea and the world today. This entry was posted in General .

18165,"Trump: NYT ‘Intent Is So Evil and So Bad,’ ‘They Write Lies’","WASHINGTON, D. C.  —   President Donald J. Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive Oval Office interview that the “intent” of the New York Times in its negative coverage of him is “so evil and so bad” and that “they write lies. ”[“If you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it’s —  the intent is so evil and so bad,” President Trump said in the interview on Monday afternoon. “The stories are wrong in many cases, but it’s the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong. ”  He went on to say about the newspaper that “they write lies. ” Trump’s comments came in a discussion about the media generally, in a part of the exclusive Oval Office interview focused on “fake news” and “fake media” versus journalists who are trying to get it right. The president specifically praised this reporter, and Steve Holland of Reuters, as two examples of journalists who do try to accurately report the news —  and made a distinction between “fake” media and the media as a whole. Trump said that the “fake” media has made a concerted effort to conflate his distinction between “fake media” and the media generally, and that “there’s a difference” between the two. He said that his comments about the “opposition party” and the “enemy of the American people” were specifically about the “fake media,” not the media as a whole. This is a point that the president made in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) last Friday in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, D. C. Hope Hicks, the director of Strategic Communications at the White House, joined in part of the conversation with the president. The president also specifically singled out the New York Times for one embarrassing and egregious error the newspaper made during the course of the campaign, when it posted an article —  and printed it on the front page —  containing allegations from several women against him. The piece, by Michael Barbaro and Megan Twohey, was actually challenged by women quoted therein, prompting even the vehemently   CNN to question the authenticity of the Times’ reporting, with CNN’s Kate Bolduan saying the piece was “concerning” to her “as a journalist. ” President Trump also declined to comment specifically on the looming   Warner potential merger, a deal that would boost CNN’s parent company significantly, but did say generally speaking he believes there should be “competition in the marketplace” —   especially in the media industry. Read a full transcript of this section of President Trump’s interview with Breitbart News, including the section with Hicks: BREITBART NEWS NETWORK (BNN): “The big thing I kind of wanted to zone in on right off the bat is ‘the opposition party,’ the media —  “ PRESIDENT TRUMP (POTUS): “Well, it’s not the media. It’s the fake media. ” BNN: “That’s what I was going to —  “ POTUS: “There’s a difference. The fake media is the opposition party. The fake media is the enemy of the American people. There’s tremendous fake media out there. Tremendous fake stories. The problem is the people that aren’t involved in the story don’t know that. ” HOPE HICKS: “Just the fact that they didn’t report that accurately proves your point. ” POTUS: “Which accurately?” HICKS: “They said ‘Oh Donald Trump said the press is the enemy of the American people. ’” POTUS: “Right. They take ‘fake’ media off. They say ‘the media is the enemy of —  well, they didn’t say the ‘fake media.’ I didn’t say the media is the enemy —  I said the ‘fake media.’ They take the word fake out and all of a sudden it’s like I’m against —  there are some great reporters like you. I know some great honorable reporters who do a great job like Steve [Holland] from Reuters, others, many others. I wasn’t talking about that. I was talking about the fake media, where they make up everything there is to make up. ” BNN: “Right and that’s what I wanted to zone in on with you because I know you made that very clear in your CPAC speech. Can you kind of more clearly define what standards and quality we should expect from those who are doing reporting?” POTUS: “It’s intent. It’s also intent. If you read the New York Times, if you read the New York Times, it’s —  the intent is so evil and so bad. The stories are wrong in many cases, but it’s the overall intent. Look at that paper over the last two years. In fact, they had to write a letter of essentially apology to their subscribers because they got the election so wrong. They did a front page article on women talking about me, and the women went absolutely wild because they said that was not what they said. It was a big   article, and the Times wouldn’t even apologize and yet they were wrong. You probably saw the women. They went on television shows and everything. ” BNN: “Yes, it was pretty embarrassing for the Times. ” POTUS: “[They said] ‘we really like Donald Trump and he [the Times reporter] totally misrepresented us. He said he was going to say good and it was absolutely bad.’ This was a front page article, almost the entire top half of the New York Times, and it was false. It was false. Did they apologize? No. I call them the failing New York Times and they write lies. They write lies. Nobody would know that. For instance, when people read the story on the women —  first of all, the reporter who wrote the story has a website full of hatred of Donald Trump. So, he shouldn’t be allowed to be a reporter because he’s not objective. It’s not all, but it has many negative things about Donald Trump. But he shouldn’t be allowed to write on Donald Trump. And, he writes that story. But that’s one of many. So, when you read the Sunday New York Times, it’s just hit after hit after hit. And honestly, I think people are wise to it because if you look at the approval rating, you see it’s down. You know, it’s gone. There’s very little approval. ” BNN: “Now, during the campaign, one of the things you and a lot of your campaign guys like Peter Navarro talked about was breaking up some of these oligopolies in the media. If you look at the media, part of the problem seems to be that a vast majority of the media companies are owned by just a handful of different companies. Obviously, there’s a looming merger between ATT and Time Warner. I wanted to see what your thoughts are on that and if CNN’s pretty bad behavior over the course of —  they really don’t seem to be making an effort to get it right —  does that give you hesitation in terms of approval of the deal?” POTUS: “I don’t want to comment on any specific deal, but I do believe there has to be competition in the marketplace and maybe even more so with the media because it would be awfully bad after years if we ended up having one voice out there. You have to have competition in the marketplace and you have to have competition among the media. And I’m not commenting on any one deal, but you need competition generally and you certainly need it with media. ” Specifically, this part of the interview came in the wake of the president’s CPAC speech, in which he delineated the difference between fake news and real news. At CPAC on this topic, Trump said:  I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s fake, phony, fake. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make ’em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, “Nine people have confirmed. ” There’re no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said, “Give me a break. ” Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people. But they say, “Nine people. ” And somebody reads it and they think, “Oh, nine people. They have nine sources. ” They make up sources. They’re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word “fake. ” And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy.  They take the word “fake” out. And now I’m saying, “Oh, no, this is no good. ” But that’s the way they are. So I’m not against the media, I’m not against the press. I don’t mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don’t get —  I don’t get too many of them. But I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. “A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being. ” Let ’em say it to my face. Let there be no more sources. And remember this  —   and in not  —   in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around. They’re talented, they’re honest as the day is long. They’re great. But there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people.  And they shouldn’t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you’ve never seen before. So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story  —   and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you’re not part of the story. And if you’re not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know  —   if you are part of the story, you know what they’re saying is true or not. This is the second part of President Trump’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News in the Oval Office on Monday. The first focused on the epic fail at the Academy Awards in Hollywood on Sunday night.

18166,"O’Keefe Releases 4th Undercover Video: Robert Creamer’s Criminal $20,000 Foreign Wire Transfer Videoed","Email 
The fourth video in a series has been released by James O'Keefe of Project Veritas from his undercover sting of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the election rigging and voter fraud tactics implemented by the Democratic National Committee. In this video, election rigging guru Robert Creamer is caught arranging an illegal $20,000 foreign contribution to Americans United for Change (AUFC). 
Keep in mind that AUFC is the same organization that was behind all the hullabaloo at the Trump rallies. Take a look at the video. 
According to the video's description: 
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money. 
Project Veritas reports: 
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. 
""First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I'd like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I'm going to make here is to my money guy and he's going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,"" said the PVA journalist. 
Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the ""donors"" ""niece"" - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. 
In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor's money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. 
Creamer, who has been to the White House at least 340 times and at least 45 of those times met with Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah, is heard saying, ""Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising."" 
Creamer went on to speak about Obama, whom he claims to have known since the 1980s. During that time Obama was a community organizer in Chicago. 
""Oh Barack Obama's was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too,"" said Creamer of Obama. ""I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. He's a pro, I've known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago."" 
""I was just at an event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last. He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in,"" he added. ""I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues."" 
According to Project Veritas, ""AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money."" 
If that was not enough, following the release of the previous videos, ""Americans United for Change fired Scott Foval and Robert Creamer announced to the DNC that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities."" 
O'Keefe has filed suit with the Federal Elections Commission regarding the DNC, Hillary Clinton and Robert Creamer.

18167,Where Did the Government Jobs Go? - The New York Times,"On a muggy afternoon in April, Angelina Iles, 65, folded herself into my passenger seat and took me on a tour of her beloved Pineville, La. a sleepy town smack in the middle of the low, wet state. We drove past     houses and   businesses  —   shuttered restaurants, a decrepit gas station  —   as Iles, an   retired lunchroom worker and community activist, guided me toward the muddy banks of the Red River. Near there stands the   Art Deco shell of the Huey P. Long hospital, which once served the poorest of the poor in Rapides Parish  —   and employed more than 300 workers. When employers leave towns like Pineville, they often do it with a deaf ear to the pleading of state and local governments. But in the case of Huey P. Long, the employer was the government itself. Its demise began, arguably, in 2008, when Bobby Jindal was swept into the Louisiana governor’s mansion on a     platform, promising to modernize the state and unleash the power of American private industry along the Gulf Coast. At the time, Louisiana was flush with federal funds for Hurricane Katrina reconstruction and running a budget surplus. Jindal and the State Legislature slashed income taxes and started privatizing and cutting. This was a source of great pride for Jindal. During his failed bid for the presidency last year, he boasted that bureaucrats are now an endangered species in Louisiana. “I’ve laid off more of them than Trump has fired people,” he said, “and I’ve cut my state’s budget by more than he’s worth. ” He laid off more than just bureaucrats. Jindal cut appropriations for higher education, shifting the cost burden onto students themselves. (State spending per student was down more than 40 percent between 2008 and 2014 just one state, Arizona, cut more.) And he shuttered or privatized nine charity hospitals that served the state’s uninsured and indigent. They were outdated and costly, Jindal argued, and private management would improve access, care and the bottom line. Huey P. Long was one of those hospitals. Iles, along with dozens of other workers and activists, helped organize a protest against the cuts, she told me. They held a vigil on the hospital’s front lawn. Iles even helped produce an   documentary called “Bad Medicine” that was broadcast on local television. But it was all for naught. “The good governor did not want to listen to us,” Iles said, checking her constantly buzzing phone in the car. The hospital closed its doors in 2014, and its patients were redirected to other local medical centers and clinics. All of the hospital’s workers lost their jobs. Driving around Pineville, Iles and I dropped in on a friend of hers from church, Theresa Jardoin, 68, who worked in the hospital for 41 years, most recently as an EKG supervisor. Out of work, she spends most of her days at home, taking care of her family. Earlier, Iles had introduced me to another friend, Linette Richard, whose story was similar. She had been working as an ultrasound technician when the hospital closed. She lost much of what she had been expecting for her retirement, because she had not been there long enough. “Nobody’s jumping to hire a    especially in my field,” Richard said. “You can get a   job, like McDonald’s or Burger King. But higher up? We don’t have positions available. That’s the way it is. ” That’s the way it is across much of Louisiana. The state has added 80, 000 new jobs since the Great Recession officially ended in 2009. But at the same time, jobs have been shrinking at every level of government, with local offices losing 10, 600 workers, the state government 31, 900 and the federal government 1, 600. Louisiana is an exaggerated case, but the pattern persists when you look at the country as a whole. Since the recession hit, private employers have added five million jobs and the government has lost 323, 000. The country has recovered from the recession. But public employment has not. The public sector has long been home to the sorts of jobs that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. These are jobs that have predictable hours, stable pay and protection from arbitrary layoffs, particularly for those without college or graduate degrees. They’re also more likely to be unionized less than 7 percent of   workers are represented by a union, while more than a third of those in the public sector are. In other words, they look like the   jobs our middle class was built on during the postwar years. The public sector’s slow decimation is one of the unheralded reasons that the middle class has shrunk as the ranks of the poor and the rich have swollen in the   years. This is certainly true in Louisiana, where five of the 10 biggest employers are public institutions, or health centers that in no small part rely on public funds. In Rapides Parish, which includes Pineville, the biggest employer is the school district. Across the country, when   workers lose their jobs, the burden disproportionately falls on black workers, and particularly women  —   people like Theresa Jardoin and Linette Richard. “We felt middle class,” Richard told me. “Now we feel kind of lower. ” In the middle of the last century, a series of legal and legislative decisions  —   fueled by and fueling the civil rights movement  —   increased the number of black workers in government employment. F. D. R. ended official discrimination in the federal government and in companies engaged in the war effort Truman desegregated the armed forces Kennedy established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and Johnson signed an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors. As a result, black workers gained more than a quarter of new federal jobs created between 1961 and 1965. And the share of government jobs held by women climbed 70 percent between 1964 and 1974, and nearly another 30 percent by the early 1980s. Through the middle of the century, the wage gap between white and black workers narrowed as social forces and political pressure compelled private businesses to open up better jobs to black workers. “  work has been a backbone of the black middle class for many reasons,” says Mary Pattillo, a sociologist at Northwestern who studies race and class. Affirmative action helped bring marginalized groups into the public work force there, they benefited from more public scrutiny of employment practices. “The inability to fire people in a   fashion has likely protected   who are perhaps likely to be fired in a   fashion,” she says. As of 2007, black workers were 30 percent more likely than workers of other races to be employed in the public sector. For any number of reasons, the Great Recession unraveled much of the progress made by the black middle class. Leading up to the mortgage crisis, black families tended to have a higher proportion of their wealth tied up in their homes. And regardless of their income, black families were much more likely to be rejected for conventional mortgages and pushed into   subprime loans. All of this meant that when housing prices turned down, the   wealth gap yawned. As of 2013, white households were, on average, 13 times wealthier than black households, the biggest gap since 1989, according to Pew Research Center data. Declining tax revenue led to tightened state budgets, which led to tens of thousands of layoffs for   employees. And during the recovery, public workers became easy political targets precisely because of their labor protections.   rights, pension funds and mandatory raises look like unnecessary drains on state coffers to a work force increasingly unfamiliar with such benefits. And when the layoffs came, black Americans experienced a disproportionate share of the ill effects. A graduate student of sociology at the University of Washington, Jennifer Laird, wrote a widely cited dissertation, examining the effects of   layoffs on different races. She found that the   unemployment rate climbed more for black men than for white men  —   and much more for black women than for white women, with the gap between the two groups soaring from less than a percentage point in 2008 to 5. 5 percentage points in 2011. “It may be that black workers are more likely to be laid off when the layoffs are triggered by a sudden and significant reduction in funding,” she wrote. “When the number of layoff decisions increases, managers have more opportunities to discriminate. ” Worse, once unemployed, black women were “the least likely to find   employment and the most likely to make a full exit from the labor force. ” As a result of all these economic punishments, a recession that set America back half a decade may have set black families back a whole generation, if not longer. And because the public sector provides so many essential services, cuts to it have a cascading effect. Hospitals close, and people have to drive farther away for medical care. Teachers’ aides lose their positions, and local kids no longer have the same degree of   attention. Angelina Iles, the retiree I met in Pineville, cited the loss of dental,   and emergency medical services as being a particularly profound problem for her community. Other states and towns are electing to have smaller public work forces. Wisconsin, for instance, has thinned its ranks of government workers by some 5, 000 since its Republican governor, Scott Walker, led a push to abrogate public workers’ organizing rights  —   a political choice with profound economic and racial ramifications. “They try to say that collective bargaining is a drain on the economy, when it provides the ability and opportunity for folks to have a seat at the table,” Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, told me. And the economic evidence does show that a higher concentration of unionized workers increases intergenerational mobility and raises wages for all workers, public and private. With time, government jobs should come back that pathway to the middle class should grow again. “Government jobs are always slower to come back after a recession,” says Roderick Harrison, a former Howard University demographer. It takes time for private businesses to rehire workers. It takes time for tax revenue to rise to a level at which cities and states feel comfortable adding public workers back onto their payrolls. “That means that the portion of the black middle class that was dependent on government jobs  —   police, schools, emergency workers and so on  —   is going to take longer to recoup and regain whatever positions they had,” he says. For Pineville, that recovery might come too late for many of its workers, especially those who were looking toward retirement. Because Linette Richard can’t find suitable work, she and her husband get by on what he makes as a car salesman. She has given up trying to find work again around Pineville. So has Theresa Jardoin, who has resigned herself to a tougher retirement than she thought she would enjoy. “All of a sudden, there’s nothing,” she said, sitting in an easy chair in her living room, just blocks from Huey P. Long, playing with her granddaughter’s hair. “You can’t enjoy retirement in this situation. ” “You didn’t even get a pocket watch, did you?” Iles asked. “No,” Jardoin said, with a resigned laugh. “Just aches and pains. ”",0
18169,You Could Be Unknowingly Killing the Hummingbirds! (Here’s How to Save Them),"You Could Be Unknowingly Killing the Hummingbirds! (Here’s How to Save Them) Oct 27, 2016 0 0 
( Real Farmacy ) Hummingbirds are beautiful, delightful little creatures to have around your garden. Not only are they great pollinators, but they also bring fun life into your yard. Many home gardeners will put feeders up to keep these summer personalities around. 
If you don’t take the necessary steps to provide healthy nectar and clean feeders, your favorite pollinators could catch deadly infections. 
Hummingbird feeders must be kept clean and free from mold and fungus, or your tiny friend could develop a serious and deadly fungus infection. This infection causes the tongue to swell, making it impossible for the bird to feed. Losing the ability to consume nectar, the cute little bird faces starvation. 
A mother hummingbird can pass a fungal infection to her babies who, in turn, could also face the possibility of dying from starvation due to swelling tongues. 
Not changing out the nectar enough could create fermentation within the nectar. Fermented nectar can cause liver damage, which usually will lead to death. The Basics of Hummingbird Care 
When looking to purchase a feeder, find one that is easy to clean. 
To clean your feeder, flush it with hot tap water and use a bottle brush to scrub the sides of the glass jar. DO NOT use soap because it will leave residue behind. If you do use soap, use a bleach or vinegar and water solution to rinse and remove soap residue. 
Inspect the feeder carefully for black mold. If you see any mold growth, soak the feeder in a solution of 1/4 cup bleach to one gallon water for one hour. 
To make the nectar , mix one part ordinary white cane sugar to four parts water. Do not use store bought mixtures, or honey, or any other kind of sugar — just ordinary white cane sugar will work. Bring solution to a boil, stir to dissolve the sugar, then allow the mixture to come to room temperature before filling the feeder. 
Boiling the water will help slow the fermentation process of the nectar, but as soon as a hummingbird beak dips and drinks, healthy microorganisms carried on the beak will be transferred into the nectar. 
If the nectar becomes cloudy, it has gone bad and needs to be replaced. A sugar solution can spoil in as little as two days. If your feeder is hanging in the sun or outside where the temperatures are high, the nectar may start to ferment in only one day. 
To avoid wasting nectar, only put out enough for the birds will consume in two or three days. If you mix up a large batch, you can keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

18170,Sanders’ Democrats Call for Change,"Sanders’ Democrats Call for Change November 14, 2016 
The fallout from the imploded Hillary Clinton campaign is prompting demands from Democratic progressives for an immediate change at the top, in this case the resignation of interim DNC chairperson Donna Brazile, says Norman Solomon. 
By Norman Solomon 
It’s time for Donna Brazile to go. Like Debbie Wasserman Schultz before her, Brazile has lost credibility as an honest broker at the Democratic National Committee. The DNC chair should be evenhanded — but, thanks to leaked emails , Brazile’s cover is blown. 
At the same time that Brazile was publicly claiming to be neutral in the fierce Clinton-Sanders primary battle, she was using her job as a CNN political analyst to give the Clinton campaign advance notice of questions that would be asked during a CNN debate between the two candidates. Donna Brazile, interim Democratic Party chairperson. 
Yet Brazile seems tone deaf about her integrity breach — just as the Democratic Party establishment has been tone deaf about the corrosive effects of servicing Wall Street and wealthy contributors. 
As the Washington Post reported a week ago , “Donna Brazile is not apologizing for leaking CNN debate questions and topics to the Hillary Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. Her only regret, it seems, is that she got caught.” 
Consider Brazile’s response after the email hack exposed the chasm between her public claims of being evenhanded and her furtive effort to help Clinton gain an improper debate advantage over Sanders. “My conscience, as an activist, as a strategist — my conscience is very clear,” Brazile said in a radio interview , adding that “if I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.” 
But the current DNC chair’s lack of encryption knowledge is hardly the problem. Brazile has functioned as a shameless cog in the Clinton political machine. That machine hasn’t just broken down; it is now kaput. 
In the wake of Donald Trump ’s victory, the DNC must undergo a far-reaching shakeup. And — with no time to waste — we can’t wait several months until Brazile’s planned departure from the DNC chair job in March. 
That’s why several hundred activists who were Bernie Sanders delegates to the Democratic National Convention just voted to “call for the immediate resignation of Donna Brazile as chair of the Democratic National Committee.” 
A lopsided tally came in over the weekend, with 96 percent — 337 to 13 — in favor of pushing for Brazile to resign. The straw poll was conducted by the Bernie Delegates Network (which I coordinate), an independent group sponsored by the online activist organization RootsAction.org in partnership with Progressive Democrats of America. 
“The DNC must either change or it will die,” says PDA executive director Donna Smith. “And that change starts with Ms. Brazile’s prompt resignation.” 
RootsAction has launched a nationwide petition campaign calling for Brazile to resign immediately. 
A Symbol and Symptom 
Brazile’s duplicitous behavior is a symbol and symptom of the Democratic Party leadership — which remains unwilling to admit that its chronic alignment with Wall Street, big banks and harmful trade deals has been key to sagging electoral fortunes. Bernie Sanders supporters rally in Washington D.C. on June 9, 2016. (Photo credit: Chelsea Gilmour) 
The national Democratic Party has long been in the grip of those who assume that following along Wall Street — with minor quibbles and facile populist rhetoric — is the pathway to the White House. That claim has now been thoroughly discredited, as election returns from the Rust Belt attest. 
The old guard at the DNC should not be allowed to hang on. Despite all the pseudo-populist gestures, Donna Brazile and her Clinton Inc. allies can be expected to do little more than tinker with corporate-fueled DNC machinery that is long overdue for the junk heap. 
The Democratic National Committee is now a relic of mechanisms spinning toward oligarchy. Every day that goes by with the old leadership in place is a day wasted for the essential work to come.

Solomon is executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

18171,A Wheelchair on Broadway Isn’t Exploitation. It’s Progress. - The New York Times,"There’s a wheelchair onstage at the Belasco Theater, and it’s drawing an abundance of attention. There’s also a wheelchair onstage at a small theater not far away, and it’s drawing practically no attention at all. The gulf between the two says quite a lot. At the Belasco, the Broadway house on West 44th Street, the wheelchair is one of the conspicuous elaborations the director Sam Gold has brought to his production of “The Glass Menagerie,” the beloved Tennessee Williams drama. The chair isn’t just a prop it’s a necessity for the actress playing Laura, Madison Ferris, who has muscular dystrophy. That bit of casting is, of course, a significant change from the shy girl with a limp that Williams called for in his play. And Mr. Gold’s staging leaves no doubt that Ms. Ferris is not some   actress pretending to have a disability. He has her enter by painstakingly climbing stairs, one of several times that he takes her out of the wheelchair and confronts the audience with the difficulties of having severely limited mobility. Some leading critics have objected to the transformation of Williams’s subtle play about a family enveloped in denial into something more strident. The kindest objections say that Mr. Gold’s interpretation simply doesn’t mesh well with the text harsher ones on theater chat boards have called his use of Ms. Ferris exploitative. Perhaps these detractors are focusing on moments like the one in which Amanda, Laura’s mother, tells her: “You’re not crippled. You just have a little defect  —   hardly noticeable, even!” How can such a line make sense when there’s a wheelchair onstage? For one thing, this is a   “memory play,” told through the recollections of Laura’s brother, Tom (played by Joe Mantello). And memory is an interpretation of the past, not a literal playback of it. But, more than that, to live with a child with a disability is to be both isolated  —   as this family is  —   and susceptible to what seems to others like an unreality. My own daughter, who has a serious disability called Rett syndrome, is just three years younger than the    Laura. Is it easy for me to imagine a parent who sees a vastly different child than the outside world sees? You bet. As for the charge of exploitation, I read that as, “It was unpleasant to see Ms. Ferris pull herself along the floor by her arms I prefer that people with disabilities remain invisible, as they so often are. ” Broadway audiences are accustomed to seeing perfect bodies doing entertaining dance steps. Guess what, Broadway? One in five Americans has a disability, according to the census bureau. Nine blocks north and four blocks west of the Belasco, at the A. R. T.  York Theaters, Theater Breaking Through Barriers has a program of shorts running through Sunday. The company, which has been around since 1979, stages productions using actors with disabilities as well as   actors. The five plays on its current program include works by Neil LaBute and Bekah Brunstetter, a producer of the TV series “This Is Us. ” Nicholas Viselli, the company’s artistic director, has put quirky interstitials between the plays  —   a song, some monologues. Ryan Haddad, who is gay and has cerebral palsy, steals the show with a funny, deeply personal piece called “Hi, Are You Single?” This is the type of production that’s most likely to showcase actors with disabilities: intimate theater, small audience, $25 ticket. The program (which is called “The Other Plays: Short Plays About Diversity and Otherness”) is   but it feels 1, 000 miles from the mainstream represented by the Belasco, where the best seat for “The Glass Menagerie” can set you back more than $200. Mr. Gold’s brashest stroke in a production full of them may be the bridging of that divide  —   taking a theatrical universe that has existed for some time on the outskirts and putting it on a Broadway marquee featuring the   names of Mr. Mantello and Sally Field, who plays Amanda. He’s not the first to do so  —   think back, for instance, to the breathtaking Deaf West reimagining of “Big River” in 2003, featuring a lot of deaf and    actors and sign language, or to the same company’s 2015 “Spring Awakening” (which also had an actor who uses a wheelchair). But it remains a rare occurrence, and as a result Broadway remains unrepresentative of the full range of humanity. So do television, film and most other forms, though inroads are being made there, too. Does the casting of an actor with cerebral palsy to play a character with cerebral palsy on the ABC sitcom “Speechless” seem manipulative? How about the coming introduction of a character with autism on “Sesame Street?” Sometimes, what seems a cheesy gimmick or instance of exploitation is really just the front edge of needed change. Some theatergoers were probably outraged the first time a black Juliet was cast against a white Romeo. Did that change how some of Shakespeare’s lines registered and imbue the play with new meanings? Sure. Is   casting now widely accepted and the theatergoing experience richer for it? Yes. Mr. Gold’s production is hardly perfect. If you figure out that thing with keeping the house lights up for a third of the show, let me know. But at least with the Laura character, he has done what he intended. “I’m not very interested in pretend,” he has said. “I’m interested in putting people onstage. I want people. And I want a world that reflects the real world. ” It’s worth contemplating what that means from the audience’s perspective. On those chat boards, some writers have complained that Ms. Ferris isn’t very good. Here’s the thing: We have been conditioned to define good acting in terms of facial expressions, comic timing, physical bits. An actor with a disability, especially one involving muscle control or cognitive impairment, isn’t necessarily going to be able to give the kind of performance we’re used to. Will Ms. Ferris impress someone looking for that kind of performance? Probably not. But she gives the most realistic portrayal of a person with muscular dystrophy that I’ve ever seen. In any case, the overall package worked for me and showed me a different play, just as Deaf West did with “Big River,” one of my favorite musicals. The Amanda of this “Menagerie” is more in denial than other Amandas the gentleman caller, played by Finn Wittrock, who sees past Laura’s disability, is all the nobler. And  —   especially given the time frame of the play, an era before curb cuts and the Americans With Disabilities Act, Tom’s decision to leave his family is not so much a personal liberation as a cruel abandonment. I don’t really care whether this is what Williams intended. What I admire is the attempt, and the fact that this production has people talking about something other than whether Ms. Field’s Amanda is better or worse than Cherry Jones’s in 2013 or Jessica Lange’s in 2005. Debates like that are the product of a theater of complacency. Debates like the one Mr. Gold has unleashed are what keep theater vigorous and challenging.",0
18172,Chasing Hiroshige’s Vision of Japan - The New York Times,"The rain misted down and I had two choices: the road up the hill, or the one alongside the river. I stood next to some kind of cement plant, most of it hidden behind a corrugated metal fence dripping with moisture. My pack pulled down on my shoulders. The river, engorged by two days of rain, roared and echoed against the mountains. A man in blue overalls emerged from behind a small Fuso truck. Like many people I’d encountered in Japan, he wanted to help me. I was grateful. I put roughly 25 percent of my Japanese language skills to work. “Sumimasen?” I said (Excuse me).  “Hai?” “Tsumago?” He gestured down the road, I thought along the river. He said quite a few things that I didn’t understand. I thanked him and strode off, pack on back, hands on straps, rain on head. A   later, after continuing along the river and then beneath a highway overpass, pressing against the wall because there was no shoulder, and then doubling back in confusion  —   this can’t be right  —   I found myself outside the same plant, beside the same fence, talking to the same man. He seemed mildly frustrated with me. He gestured again, and this time I went up the hill. Of course  —   when you have a pack on your back, the destination is always up the hill. I soon came into Tsumago, a beautifully preserved   town on the Nakasendo road in the Kiso Valley. I had wanted to visit for years  —   35, actually  —   and had chosen to walk from the train so I could first experience the town as travelers had in the 19th century: on foot, the neat rows of wooden houses revealing themselves in diminishing perspective as I turned the corner. But it was 2011, so instead I entered via the parking lot, and had to negotiate my pack between an idling bus and a pair of vending machines featuring the image of Tommy Lee Jones. My obsession with Japan began in 1979 when my parents took me from our house in Brooklyn to see a show of woodblock prints at the Cooper Hewitt museum in Manhattan featuring works by the great landscape artist Hiroshige. The show featured prints from Hiroshige’s first famous series, the 53 Stations of the Tokaido, which chronicled life along the ancient coast highway that connected Edo,   Tokyo, and Kyoto. Traveling the road was an envied,     experience, and those who got the chance availed themselves of spectacular views, local culinary delicacies, hot spring baths and other more carnal pursuits along the way. Those who couldn’t go, or wanted souvenirs to remember their journeys, bought prints like Hiroshige’s for roughly the price of a double serving of noodles. The strikingly modern designs, the warm hues of the skies and trees, the towns nestled in the mountains or by the sea, the raucous joy of the travelers, and the almost palpable sense of the seasons lit up something inside me  —   I stood there transfixed. I was soon spending hours trying to draw like Hiroshige. I became obsessed by all things Japanese  —   books, movies I even took up Japanese fencing. The country had recovered from the war, but was not yet the economic powerhouse it would become in the 1980s  —   it was something of a blank slate for my imagination. This interest never quite faded away like others of adolescence. But over the decades, various events (college, jobs, children) seemed timed to prevent me from actually visiting Japan. Or maybe I just told myself that. I suppose, deep in my heart, I didn’t want modern reality to get in the way of my childhood fantasy land. So in 2011 when my wife and two children had finally had enough  —   Why don’t you just go?  —   I screwed up my courage and went, with one goal of recreating the Hiroshige experience. The Tokaido is mostly built over, but portions of the Nakasendo, which connects Tokyo and Kyoto via the interior, and which Hiroshige had also chronicled, are still preserved. The evening after my rainy wrong turn I clumped eagerly up the road from Tsumago to the town of Magome. I was in some kind of heaven that day, in either bright sunshine or cool, crisp shade, but was rarely out of earshot of a highway. At one point, deep in the woods, I encountered a vending machine (Tommy Lee Jones again). I had an iced coffee. Four years later, as I planned my return to Japan, I knew I had to travel beyond the populated heart of the country if I wanted to really replicate the world I had seen in those prints, going farther afield than Hiroshige himself. And so I chose the Kumano Kodo, a series of trails through deep forest and small towns on the Kii Peninsula several hours south of Osaka. It’s a religious pilgrimage that I came across in my obsessive reading. Pilgrims go to visit the numerous shrines along the way, worshiping the mountains themselves. They’ve done so since the sixth century. It’s said one can achieve spiritual powers by enduring the route’s physical challenge. Spirituality aside, this seemed to have everything I wanted: long walks deep in the woods, beautiful towns with little hotels promising hot baths, sake and great meals. The idea of going alone was intimidating (I could only imagine how little English was spoken) but I hated the idea of being part of a group with a guide. My Japanese obsession is a very private thing. And that’s when I discovered Oku Japan, and the   tour. I found it online. The reviews were good. For $955, Oku would book my hotels and provide me with a    guide to the trail. The company, based in Cheshire, England, had an office in Japan with an emergency phone number this made my wife feel better. I opted for a     hike, paying a little more for a single supplement, but less because I’d take care of my own train tickets with a Japan Rail Pass. Oku provided me with timetables. And so with my trusty pack on my back, I set off for my second trip to Japan. First I spent two days in Tokyo. I visited print galleries during the day and wandered Shinjuku at night  —   to a New Yorker, it felt like 20 Times Squares  —   where I was carried along in a swirl of crowds, neon, blaring pop music, screeching overhead trains, weird bird tweets at walk signs and the approaches of   touts who promised “100 percent naked women,” all the beer I could drink in 60 minutes or both. I deflected offers of the first by pointing to my wedding ring, and the second by feigning indignation and announcing that I did not drink. Then I went off in search of a quiet cocktail bar. I found several, including a tiny one in the decrepit but atmospheric Golden Gai section, where the bartender said I looked like Jack Bauer from “24. ” I don’t, but the name stuck, and the other drinkers exclaimed “Goodnight, Jack Bauer!” in tipsy unison as I returned to the   alley an hour or so later. At my inn in Kyoto, a package awaited from Oku Japan: my   itinerary, a booklet detailing the Kumano Kodo with directions (I would be taking the Nakahechi route) and several beautiful laminated color maps with height elevations. I was all set. The next morning, having condensed my essentials and a few of my favorite books about Japan into a shoulder bag, I grabbed a boxed lunch at Kyoto Station and got on the Super Kuroshia No. 7 limited express, nonreserved car, as per my instructions. I studied my itinerary and maps as the outskirts of Kyoto and then Osaka gave way to small towns and finally, the blue expanse of the Inland Sea, dotted with tiny islands as jagged and numerous as those portrayed by Hiroshige. The train hugged the west coast of the peninsula before arriving at the town of   where I got off and found the bus that would take me into the interior. As I got on, I noticed a group of Westerners who seemed to be following the same instructions. This was something I had not considered: Others would be taking the same   tour at the same time and I would be, by default, part of a group. The bus climbed away from the cluttered coastline into rich green mountains, and eventually along a wide, pebbly river. Soon enough, and right on time, we were in Takijiri, a tiny town in a deep ravine at the intersection of the Tonda and Ishifune rivers where the Kumano Kodo begins. I paid the 960 yen (about $8. 80) Oku had prepared me for, and went into a shop to get water and a bamboo walking stick. I also wanted to let the others get ahead of me. I followed my instructions. The first shrine, Takijiri oji, was just behind the shop. I walked toward it, and then to the left around it, and saw the beginning of the trail, a sharply ascending ladder of logs and tangled tree roots, slick with damp leaves, beside a steep  . Up I went. Have I mentioned that I’m not much of a hiker? Beyond my   phase, athletics have never been a priority. I’m not outdoorsy I’m indoorsy. But my Hiroshige fantasy propelled me onward, even as my chest started to ache awfully soon. I’m also a little anxious about heights. This was an issue that first day, and on the subsequent two days, as the trail was often atop a towering cliff on the right side, the left side, or at a few spots, both sides, the path crowning a precipitous land bridge. At one point, I kicked a small rock to determine how long it would take to the reach the bottom. It was still bouncing down, on and on, more and more distant, when I resumed my trek. I got into a rhythm, marking my progress on my map and at every wooden trail marker. Oku explained the history and legends associated with this or that shrine or landmark, kept me from taking several wrong turns, and warned me away from a detour that, while promising a great view, would have been exhausting. And anyway, there were already views at every break in the trees  —   layers and layers of mountains, some smooth, others rough with treetops, their ridges meeting in diagonal lines, each a different shade of  . The first day was only 2. 8 miles. Soon I descended into the tiny town of Takahara. Here two roads met on a gliding slope, and there were a few shops and one hotel, the Organic Hotel Takahara   . Every room in the place, from the     room with its bare support beams to the men’s and women’s baths to the bedrooms, had spectacular views of the yawning valley below, now tinted gold. I tossed my bag in my room and went to have a beer and take some notes on the terrace. The afternoon cooled: The instant the sun dipped behind the mountains, it felt as if the valley became  . I found the group from the bus, beers   one of the women with a laptop, and discovered that after my solitary    day, I didn’t mind a little company. After a bit I went for a bath, joined in the wooden tub by two chatty and elderly Japanese men, and enjoyed the view of the darkening mountains some more before getting dressed for dinner, set for precisely 6:30 p. m. One member of the group, Janet, invited me to sit with them, and I liked the idea, but my hosts said this would be impossible: We were different parties, after all. Sometimes in Japan, I’ve found, rules can be intractable. So I ate alone  —   pickles, beef I dipped in boiling water, and several other items including a very western avocado dish  —   at the next table over, my back to the others. It was equal parts awkward and comic. “How are you doing over there, Wendell,” Janet asked at one point over her shoulder. The rules were relaxed as the meal ended, and I shifted my chair around and joined the other table as I finished my sake (not included in Oku’s fee). There were five of them: Janet her husband, Stan her aunt Elvina her colleague Pat and Pat’s friend, also named Pat. We traded the basic details of our lives. They were from Canada, Edmonton and Vancouver, with jobs that included judges and lawyers in family court. It made for fascinating   conversation. They were also fierce hikers, having tackled many ambitious walks, such as the Camino de Santiago in Spain. They were indeed following Oku’s instructions, and had found the first day’s walk a snap. “Have you seen the elevations for tomorrow, and the day after?” one asked me. I had and said that I was worried. The second day’s hike was 6. 5 miles, including 1, 575 feet of ascent. I went down to the village to take in the view from there, and to allow the Canadians to get a head start I still envisioned my hike as a solitary adventure. Soon enough I was deep in the woods, marveling at the towering and   Japanese cedars and passing an abandoned house that looked like something out of a Japanese horror movie. Some trees were flecked with   orange. I sat on a stump to eat two sandwiches the Organic Hotel had packed for me for lunch. At one point I paused beside an especially deep ravine. The cedars stood like an infinite army of stoic and towering sentries all around and above and below me, endless legions of them, falling away on my hill and then rising higher on the next one, their tops shimmering gently way, way up there in the occasional breeze. A few beams of sunlight slanted down, but otherwise all was in shade. There wasn’t a sound, not a bird, not a cricket even the branches swaying in the breeze could not be heard, as if they were in a silent movie. My hiking senses sharpened. I came to learn that a glimpse of blue sky near the bottom of the trunks ahead meant I was reaching the crest of a mountain, just as the increasingly loud gurgle of a stream meant I was reaching the bottom. There always seemed to be more up than down. I encountered the occasional solitary hiker flying by with scissoring poles, pilgrims with twinkling bells, and small groups. One was a gaggle of young women from Osaka who asked me to take their picture, asked me to appear in a picture with them, and gave me as a reward a selection of Japanese candies. After they thanked me and I   responded “Sure,” they engaged in a contest to see who could best imitate my voice, each attempt getting deeper and of longer duration. “Sure. ” “Sure. ” “Suuuuure. ” At another point I was joined by a retired Japanese man who spoke nostalgically of the months he’d spent in Indiana studying engineering. He practiced his English on me while I practiced my Japanese on him. (Sumimasen?) Oku had warned that the Kii Peninsula could be rainy, but I never had anything but sun. My stamina followed an arc: I tired quickly, then got into a rhythm, magically energized. I felt my mind open up and go free  —   it wandered through time, over that print show at the Cooper Hewitt, my family, my first trip to Japan, even my job: Solutions to several vexing problems at work suddenly became clear. I tired again as I approached my destination, the town of Chikatsuyu, where Oku had booked me at a minshuku, a guesthouse, more modest than a traditional Japanese inn. It sat on the far bank of the Tonda. I had another long, hot bath, this one fed by a hot spring, again with two chatty and elderly Japanese men, though not the same ones as the evening before. I threw in once and for all with the Canadians at dinner. Maybe I’d already tired a little of my own thoughts. We agreed to stick together the next day. Another group at the guesthouse was from Spain, including a stocky bald man said to be a karate expert. We started early the following morning  —   Elvina was soon way ahead  —   and marked our progress on our maps. We had lunch in a small field next to a stream: I had two rice balls I’d bought at a shop in Chikatsuyu and an egg that Elvina made me take from the hotel, saying she was worried I wouldn’t have enough for lunch. We saw some wildlife. A snake zipped between the feet of one of the Pats. Three monkeys ruffled branches down a hill, warning us off with ghastly shrieks. And a deer with two short,   antlers and a   white tail froze on the trail ahead of us. I reached for my camera but not quickly enough: the karate master bounded up from behind  —   “Qué pasa?”  —   and the deer bolted into the cedars as if it had been launched from a catapult. The Canadians paid more attention to hiking times and progress than I did. I learned a lot from them, like how each of the many shrines we passed had a small box containing a stamp and an ink pad. Or how I shouldn’t swing my hands when I hiked, because they could become swollen. In return I shared some of the many small facts I’d picked up about Japan in my decades of reading, like that the   egg with a velvety texture that we’d had at breakfast was an “onsen egg” cooked in a hot spring. “Where did you learn that?” Janet asked me. “I don’t know. It’s just one of the obscure facts I picked up in the last 35 years. ” That day’s hike was the longest at nine miles with roughly 2, 000 feet of ascent. I was glad for that extra egg. This was the moderate option suggested by Oku it included a quick bus ride. There was an easier option with a longer bus ride but that felt like cheating. Eventually, we came out of the forest and walked along paved roads in little farming towns. The hike ended in the magnificent Grand Shrine at Hongu, a key stop for many of those   pilgrims. The shrine’s   wooden buildings sat atop a towering stone staircase limned by hundreds of white flags blazing with Japanese characters, a fittingly dramatic finale. That night’s accommodation was a modern hot springs hotel. I had a bottle of Kirin from the refrigerator in my room before sampling all the various   baths. I bathed inside, I bathed outside, and after a farewell dinner with the Canadians, found one of two private baths unoccupied, so I bathed there, too, finally alone. These baths were in a little house, the damp wood wall that separated them open near the ceiling. Two Japanese women  —   a mother and a daughter, I suspect  —   had gone into the other one as I went into mine, and I listened groggily in the near darkness to their mellifluous words and laughter, and occasional tiny splashes, as I sat in the steaming water up to my neck. If Hiroshige could see me now. The emotions I experienced after my first trip to Japan in 2011  —   and here my parents and children might want to skip ahead  —   were distinctly similar to those I’d experienced after losing my virginity: something I’d imagined a million times had now taken place, and while it wasn’t exactly as I’d expected, it was still pretty great, and I was now a different person. And I wanted to do it again. My second trip made it all feel more real. The fantasy Japan of color woodblock prints and    movies was being replaced by the actual country. Those little encounters, with the gang at the Golden Gai bar, the hiker from Indiana, the men in the baths, a friend I met for lunch at Tokyo Station on my   race back to Narita Airport and home, brought Japan ever so slightly into focus. Hiroshige probably never visited the Kii Peninsula. In fact, recent scholarship suggests he never even traveled the length of the Tokaido, creating some of his most famous designs from guidebooks. I don’t know and I don’t care: I’m certain that in those solitary moments deep in the woods, my mind free, the cedars like endless rows of sentries, as I walked a path worn smooth by pilgrims 1, 400 years ago, the silence complete, enveloping, I saw him.

18174,"At the Hajj, Facing Islam’s Inconsistent Embrace of Women - The New York Times","MECCA, Saudi Arabia  —   “Sister, where are your socks?” one of the women I was sitting with demanded. “Don’t you know you have to cover your feet?” We were in the sprawling Grand Mosque that surrounds the Kaaba, Islam’s holiest site, during the hajj, the   pilgrimage of rites and rituals that ended on Wednesday. I could not decipher which of the four Saudi women in identical billowing black robes and black gloves was speaking to me because their faces were covered with not one but two veils, something I had never seen before. They made space for me. I discreetly covered my offending feet with my own long, black robe, which I bought specially for the hajj, my first. These women who looked like black ravens poured me golden Arabian coffee from their thermos and fed me crunchy yellow dates while we waited for Friday Prayer to begin. There it was again. I was at once frustrated by Islam’s nitpicky strictures on women’s dress and embraced by its warm sisterhood. Over and over again during this physical and personal journey, I was confronted by my conflicting feelings on how the faith I was raised in deals with gender, the very thing that had made me take off my hijab in college. At its founding, 1, 400 years ago, Islam was revolutionary for its time in seeing women as spiritual equals. But in its contemporary conception, the    gender roles trouble me. My testimony in some Islamic court matters would count for half that of a male witness. Men can take four wives, women one husband each. Yet Muslim women have a right to an education, to be scholars and in some cases jurists. We have as an eternal role model the Prophet Muhammad’s first, beloved wife, Khadija, a successful trader who popped the question to a man 15 years her junior. “Treat your women well and be kind to them,” Muhammad himself urged in his last sermon, during his final pilgrimage to Mecca. “It is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. ” So, kindness and rights, but also women as something less than men. It can feel patronizing, and diminishing of our full humanity. It is why I started to lose faith after a childhood in an observant family and what I still struggle with, at 38, living a life that is secular but guided by Islamic values. Each day in Mecca provided powerful reminders of a religion that seems to simultaneously embrace women and push them away. Another day at the Grand Mosque, I met Saraya, a   woman who is from South Africa but lives in Australia, where I grew up. She had longed to make the hajj for years but was unable because she lacked a mahram, or male guardian  —   usually a husband, brother or father  —   to accompany her male pilgrims can come alone. “I never thought I’d get here,” said Saraya, beaming. She got here only because the Saudi government allows some women over 45 to come with an older female companion. (I got around the mahram requirement because I came on a journalist visa, which included a different kind of guardian, a Saudi minder named   who accompanied me during all my reporting.) Saraya, whose last name and age I never had a chance to ask, said there had been “a few incidents” that detracted from the positive experience of her pilgrimage, like when someone in her delegation was “propositioned in a taxi,” and the fact that men frequently pushed in front of her. “But I’m a bit bohemian, so I trust the energies around me,” she added. “I just let it flow whatever is supposed to come is a learning. ” Once women overcome the obstacles to getting here, they are required to perform all the same rituals as men. The only real gender difference on the hajj is that men are supposed to wear two white sheets with nothing underneath (women have no specific dress requirement beyond modesty) and at the end, men shave their heads and women simply cut a lock of hair. Unlike in the segregated prayer spaces of mosques and the separate wedding celebrations of conservative Muslims, men and women mix freely during hajj rites: walking together seven times around the Kaaba climbing together to the top of Mount Arafat, where supplications to God are believed to be answered throwing stones together at the Jamarat, the three pillars that symbolize the devil. There was something lovely about watching that, doing that. But segregation —   and unequal treatment  —   come back five times daily with the call to prayer. One night at the compound where my   V. I. P. delegation was staying in Arafat, I was working when the men suddenly started kneeling in a large,   carpeted room. I asked where the women should pray, and various officials kept directing me back through a parking lot crammed with buses until I realized there was no space set aside we were meant to bow alone in our rooms. Another night, as I tried to find room between worshipers, a security guard shouted that I was taking space where men needed to walk. Among other special rules around the hajj, there is a relaxation of some of Islam’s modesty strictures: Women are not supposed to cover their faces. But I met several female pilgrims who still shrouded themselves, either with thin gauze or with a cloth draped from a visor. One step forward, two back. Beneath the veils, though, were hardly oppressed chattel. One woman I met, Mervat, works as a cardiologist in   Yemen, risking her life to save lives. Then there was Raghdah Hakeem, 27, a Saudi assigned by the Ministry of Culture and Information to care for the women in our delegation, which included 100 journalists (about 10 of them women, which the veterans said was the most they had ever seen covering the hajj). When Ms. Hakeem was ordered to sit at the back of the bus one night, she refused and stayed in her seat, a Muslim Rosa Parks. “I can sit wherever I want,” she recalled telling the elderly, bearded official. She grinned as she shared the rest: “All the men around me said, ‘I’m so glad you didn’t go.’ I stood for my opinion, and they supported me. ” Despite dire warnings from my mother and sister, who had done the hajj before me, I did not experience sexual harassment in any form  —   no groping, no gestures, no untoward or unwelcome comments. I felt safe. But also, too often,  . When our delegation reached the rocky plain of Muzdalifa, we were ushered into a   compound akin to mobile homes. It was starkly different from the accommodations of the rest of the pilgrims, who traditionally sleep under the stars on pieces of cardboard and sheets, men and women in separate but close quarters. In Muzdalifa, pilgrims are meant to gather stones to throw at the three Jamarat pillars. Instead, somebody left rocks near the entrance of our compound so we wouldn’t have to go out onto the plain. It was a thoughtful gesture for some of the women in our group, who rushed to cover themselves whenever a man approached our quarters, usually to deliver food or drinks. Once, one of my roommates, wearing a   robe with strawberries, only had time to hold a veil up in front of her face. She looked as if she were deleting herself from a picture. But for me and a few other female Muslim journalists, the gesture felt like a slight. We wanted to gather our own stones, to experience the whole hajj. We strolled onto the plain, and I bent to pick up rocks and put them into an empty water bottle. As I rose, one of those veiled women handed me a yogurt drink to rehydrate.",0
18175,Will Trump Be Different than Hillary Or Obama? SoT #125,"  U.S. Economy Clinton Foundation , new world order , Trump admin Tyranny is defined as that which is legal for the Government but illegal for the citizenry – Thomas Jefferson 
The mainstream media tried it’s hardest to persuade the public that Hillary was a lock to win the election. Even the nefarious George Soros asserted confidently that Trump might win the popular election but Hillary would win the Electoral College. 
But apparently the voters just weren’t ready for a tyrannical President yet. The perception of the two candidates shaped by the mainstream media led the unsuspecting – if not comatose – public to believe that Hillary Clinton was some liberal angel who would save the country from reality and that Trump is some kind of fascist monster who is going to force everyone with slightly tinted skin to leave the country. 
Of course, nothing could be farther from the truth. Lost in the shuffle is the fact that the Dragon Lady, reincarnated, hid behind the veil of the tax-free status of the Clinton Foundation to steal $100’s of millions from the taxpayers and the Saudi royal family (the Huma Abedin connection, which is why she is Hillary’s “Igor”) and move it into the bank accounts of the Clinton family and friends of the Clinton family. The taxpayers got nothing in return – the Saudi family got use of the U.S. military to attack Syria. 
Phony polls are just another form of insidious propaganda – it’s a tool designed to persuade the masses to go the direction of the poll and discourage the other side from voting. It worked for Hitlery and the DNC against Bernie in California. But the people woke up enough to see through the ruse in the big election. 
The election results on Tuesday were not about giving Trump or the Republican Party a political and economic policy mandate. The only mandate issued on Tuesday – quite loud and clear – was this: “Someone please stop Washington DC and Wall Street from date-raping us in the bodily area where waste exits.” That was it. Obama had the same mandate in 2008 and completely betrayed his supporters. 
Judging from the early indications from the Trump camp regarding Trump’s likely cabinet and advisor appointments, it’s going to be out with the old and in with the old. Currently it appears as if the new Attorney General will be Rudy Guiliani, who is a blatant Establishment hack; Larry Kudlow as an advisor, who is the worst economist in modern era; and Jamie Dimon, CEO, JP Morgan/Chase – who should be in jail – and Goldman Sachs alumnus Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary. More of the same. Neocon elitists, Establishment apologists and Wall Street thieves. 
The Shadow of Truth hosted special guest, Eric Dubin of The News Doctors to review and dissect what happened on Tuesday evening. Unfortunately, it’s not difficult to conclude that not much will change when Obama hands the Oval Office wand to Trump: Share this:",0
18176,"Rigged Primary, Media, and Candidate; the American Rigged System","Email 

The excitement over the US election is culminating as the due date is getting closer. Each candidate is trying to use any device at hand to denigrate the other and morality is the last thing to strike the minds of the candidates. The fact of the matter is that morality is a dead circle in the American politics. Hillary Clinton, the democratic candidate, uses f-word in a debate ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/did-hillary-clinton-mutter-donald-trump-debate.html ) watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world and finds no shame in it. Even American religious leaders believe that Clinton is not competent to be the president of a religious country like United States ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/christian-right-leader-hillary-clinton-hostile-biblical-christianity.html ). On the other hand, the GOP candidate, Donald trump , has no better condition. His sexual harassments and violent ideas towards women were shocking not only for female victims, but also for the dominant male group in America. The violent use of words to address different groups of people, mainly in social media ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/as-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-to-save-you-from-her-husband.html ) , made it hard for the parents to allow their kids to follow him. Besides, the number of women that accused Trump of groping and rape ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/list-women-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault.html ) is increasing day by day and the list is running on. The so-called locker-room video of Trump talking dirty about women and his attitude towards them leaked to the public to be the final shot on the republican candidate, but it did not have that much affect. It seems that even grabbing “the women by the p…y” could not change their idea about Trump. 
All these information, some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly WikiLeaks, seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate. This has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the United States. 
The fact that Trump does not talk about a rigged-election for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth. His words that “I will accept the result of the election if I were chosen” is more like a joke than the words of a would-be president. What Assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system. The whole administration and political system is rigged in America and the people will not choose a candidate; they are chosen to choose. This is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media. The fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the American election.",0

Handy Park has been dyed with a sea of red, white and blue as more than 1,700 flags have been placed to create the Field of Valor, honoring those who have fought and are still fighting for the country’s freedoms. 
This is the second annual Field of Valor event, held by the Community Foundation of Orange. Susie Cunningham, executive director of the foundation, said it wasn’t certain if last year’s event would take off at all, but a powerful community response enabled this year’s event to be much more ambitious. 
The main draw is the same as last year: 1,776 American flags lining the park. Each flag represents either a veteran or an active service member with a tag telling a bit about the person. These provided tags can be as detailed as listing out medals and commendations won in Vietnam, or as simple as remembering that a grandparent served in the Navy during World War II.

18179,"Putin: “If Americans Vote For Trump It’s Peace, Clinton It’s War”","We Are Change 
Russia has been increasing it’s weapons capabilities recently, adding a newly improved “ Super Satan Nuke ” to it’s arsenal and running test run drills with it. Now Russian President Vladimir Putin has proclaimed to American voters if they choose “Trump it’s peace, if they choose Clinton it’s war.”

This comes as no surprise and it’s something that many of us feared deep down, but knew that it was likely true. Now Putin has said it out his own mouth. It seems that things are heating up in Ukraine and Syria. With Russian battle ships moving towards Syria and tensions building up along Ukraine’s boarder with NATO, it seems like world war could break out any day. As We Are Change’s Luke Rudkowski recently pointed out, Russia isn’t playing games anymore.
With failure after failure of peace talks and cease fires things are getting dangerous and Russia is running out of options. To have Putin come out and say something so straight forward should scare all Americans — this is serious.
Especially since NATO wants to continue trying to push for war with Russia and the U.S. is a member of NATO. Putin has also vowed retaliation over the U.S. missile system that was setup in Syria.

“If Americans vote for Trump, they’re voting for peace! ”If they vote for Clinton, its war.” – Vladimir Putin. 
It’s no wonder that Putin would make such a strong statement when Hillary Clinton has been for years bashing him. It’s additionally been revealed thanks to Wikileaks that Hillary Clinton would enforce a “no fly zone” in Syria . An instant declaration of war in Russia’s eyes. Washington has had troubled relations with Moscow starting from 2012 with Syria and in 2014, when the Ukraine coup was orchestrated by the U.S. — as a leaked Victoria Nuland phone call shows. Victoria Nuland answered to Hillary Clinton who was Secretary of State at the time of these discussions, and her leaked call is below.
A pre-Maidan video of former Ukraine Deputy Oleg Tsarov warning of a civil war coup before it broke out in Ukraine also makes this point. Maiden was the event where snipers shot at both sides of the opposition rebels and police. Polish MP Janusz Korwin-Mikke alleges that what occurred in Ukraine was a special op to provoke a riot.
Then we had the MH17 incident that has been blamed on Russia and Russian separatist despite the Ukrainian government being allowed to fabricate evidence. 
Additionally a leaked phone conversation from the EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister alleges that the snipers were paid for by Maidan leaders .
Soros is also linked to the Ukraine uprising and he is someone that Vladimir Putin despises, so it’s again no surprise that Vladmir Putin would say “If Americans vote for Hillary it’s war,” since Hillary is George Soros’s puppet after all.
“Many of the participants in Kiev’s ‘EuroMaidan’ demonstrations were members of Soros-funded NGOs and/or were trained by the same NGOs in the many workshops and conferences sponsored by Soros’ International Renaissance Foundation (IRF), and his various Open Society institutes and foundations. The IRF, founded and funded by Soros, boasts that it has given ‘more than any other donor organization’ to ‘democratic transformation’ of Ukraine,” – William F. Jasper reports.
Does the U.S. really want war with Russia? No the U.S. as a whole doesn’t want war, no one likes war but oligarchs and the military industrial complex that profits off of it’s citizens blood.
That’s where Donald Trump sets himself apart, at least according to his campaign promises that he would work with Russia .
Putin recently expressed support for Trump, saying that “Russia’s not playing favorites but Trump does speak for the people.” Putin added, that “Elections have stopped being an instrument of change, and have been reduced to scandals, to mudslinging, to questions of who pinched whom and who is sleeping with whom,” during a WSJ interview. 
If Hillary gets in the Oval Office she will continue her war mongering ways – after Libya and Ukraine, Syria is next as General Wesley Clark warned in his 2007 speech . Hillary is taking marching orders from the CFR which she admits herself . If the fix is in for Hillary like we detailed previously will Hillary Clinton be the president that starts World War III with Russia?

18180,Galaxy Note 7 Is Not Samsung’s Only Problematic Product - The New York Times,"Samsung killed the Galaxy Note 7 smartphones this week after the devices continued to burst into flames. But the tech behemoth has not extinguished scrutiny over its safety record. The South Korean manufacturer, which makes an array of consumer electronics, including kitchen appliances and television sets, is in the middle of juggling other safety problems. Those include a recall in Australia for more than 144, 000 Samsung washing machines that were prone to causing fires, and a potential recall of defective laundry units in the United States. Over the years, Samsung has faced other safety situations that have resulted in regulators taking action. The larger incidents include a 2003 recall of 184, 000 microwave ovens in the United States, and 210, 000 refrigerators in South Korea in 2009. There have been other smaller recalls, including one in 2009 of about 43, 000 microwave ovens in the United States because of a shock hazard and 20, 000 washing machines in 2007 because of a fire risk. Those episodes have been compounded by consumer frustration. People who have faced safety hazards with Samsung kitchen and home appliances said they frequently had to jump through hoops to get replacement products or refunds. To them, Samsung’s bungled handling of the Galaxy Note recall this week was not surprising. Ed O’Rourke, a resident of Boston, said that over the span of four years, Samsung replaced his malfunctioning induction range three times before the fourth one’s glass cooktop exploded in 2013. After that, Samsung declined to issue a refund until 2015, after his wife fought the company in   court and won. The couple now uses an Electrolux range. The panoply of other Samsung product recalls shows that the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco was not an isolated case, though it was the company’s largest by far, with more than 2. 5 million devices. Combined with Samsung’s often bureaucratic process for rectifying these consumer issues, it raises questions about whether the company prioritized profit over customer safety. “I thought, why doesn’t this happen to Apple or G. E.? And is Samsung playing it a little too cute in pushing things to limits that other companies aren’t pushing in terms of   ratio?” Mr. O’Rourke said. Product recalls are common among consumer electronics companies, so given the large portfolio of Samsung products and the size of the company, some problems to its lineup are to be expected. Apple, Samsung’s chief rival, has had a number of smaller recalls for products, including one for thousands of Beats speakers last year after receiving complaints of overheating, and a recall for some iPod Nanos in 2011 because of issues related to overheating. A Samsung spokeswoman pointed to an earlier statement about its washing machines in Australia, in which the company said thousands of refunds and replacements had been made and that customer safety was its top priority. Yet the scale and prominence of the Galaxy Note 7 problem renews the spotlight on Samsung’s safety record in other product areas, even as the company grapples with the smartphone recall. On Wednesday, Samsung revised its   profit estimates to absorb $2 billion in losses. The company said it earned 5. 2 trillion won in the third quarter, 33. 3 percent less than the 7. 8 trillion won profit it had estimated last week. It said it had also cut its sales estimate for the quarter by 2 trillion won, to 47 trillion won. The revised profit for the third quarter showed a 29. 6 percent drop from the same quarter last year. Shares of Samsung fell 0. 65 percent on Wednesday after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday. “Samsung has not been communicative with consumers, regulators or the media as clearly as it should have during this recall, especially for a hazard as dangerous as this one where your phone can catch on fire, damage your property and harm your family,” said William Wallace, a policy analyst for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports. The smartphone recall is most likely unrelated to other Samsung product recalls that are now unfolding, like the one for the washing machines. That is because consumer electronics like TVs and kitchen appliances are made by a different Samsung division than the mobility group that is responsible for the smartphones. In Australia, Samsung is in the process of a recall it started three years ago for   washing machines that were prone to catching fire as a result of an internal electrical defect. Samsung said that as of last month, it had resolved the problem in 81 percent of the affected washers. Yet many owners of the troubled Samsung washing machines contend their problems are far from resolved. For the recall in Australia, Samsung repaired the machines by fitting plastic bags over some connectors. A Facebook group with more than 4, 000 owners of the recalled machines crowdfunded money to hire forensic experts to analyze the fix. The forensic reports concluded that the plastic bag was ineffective because it did not prevent moisture penetration of the connectors. “It’s quite extraordinary that consumers who are scared for their lives had to get these scientific reports done,” said Tarn Allen, an owner of a recalled Samsung washing machine who is an administrator for the Facebook group. Ms. Allen, who lives in Sydney, Australia, said the South Korean manufacturer had refused to issue refunds to many members of the Facebook group until an Australian government agency issued a statement saying it was looking into the matter. Samsung may also be preparing to recall   washing machines in the United States. Some models of the   washers made between 2011 and this year are at risk of causing property damage or personal injury when the machines wash   clothing and bulky items including bedding, according to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. “C. P. S. C. is advising consumers to only use the delicate cycle” with those items, the agency said late last month. “The lower spin speed in the delicate cycle lessens the risk of impact injuries or property damage due to the washing machine becoming dislodged. ” The affected units may experience abnormal vibrations, Samsung said in a statement. The commission and Samsung said they were working toward a fix.",0
18181,ISIS fails to produce any gains in east Homs after Russian chopper crash - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
almasdarnews.com 
DAMASCUS, SYRIA (2:05 P.M.) – The Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) launched a large-scale offensive in the eastern countryside of the Homs Governorate on Thursday, targeting the Al-Mahr Gas Fields and key town of Jubb Al-Jarrah. 
Initially, the offensive got off to a good start for the terrorist forces, as they managed to shoot down a Russian attack chopper near the Al-Sha’er Mountains. 
Not long after shooting down the attack chopper, ISIS stormed both Jubb Al-Jarrah and the Al-Mahr Gas Fields, resulting in a heated battle with the Syrian Armed Forces that lasted for several hours on Thursday. 
The Syrian Army’s stiff defenses proved impregnable on Thursday after the Islamic State suffered heavy losses to both military personnel and equipment in eastern Homs. 
According to an Al-Masdar field correspondent in Damascus, the Syrian Armed Forces killed a total of 28 Islamic State terrorists at Al-Mahr and Jubb Al-Jarrah, forcing the aforementioned terrorist group to withdraw their assault before sundown on Thursday.

18182,Park Geun-hye’s Life in Jail: Cheap Meals and a Mattress on the Floor - The New York Times,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   As president of South Korea, Park   never appeared in public until stylists had arranged her hair in the trademark updo of her mother, a popular first lady who was killed by an assassin in 1974. On Friday, Ms. Park was required to remove the hairpins she uses to maintain that style before entering the jail where she now resides. Inmates at the Seoul Detention Center cannot have metal hairpins, because they could use them to hurt themselves, officials said. “When she wakes up in the morning and realizes that she can’t do her hair anymore, she will be faced with the stark new reality,” Lee   a former prosecutor who is now an opposition lawmaker, said in a radio interview on Thursday. Ms. Park, who was jailed before dawn Friday on charges stemming from the corruption scandal that ended her presidency three weeks ago, now lives alone in a cell, eating $1. 30 meals, washing her own tray and sleeping on a foldable mattress on the floor. It is a stark comedown for someone who spent more years living at the Blue House, South Korea’s sprawling presidential palace, than anyone else  —   first as daughter of the   dictator Park   and later for four years as president herself. If convicted of the charges on which she was arrested Friday, including bribery, Ms. Park would face between 10 years and life in prison. Because of her father, many South Koreans long derided Ms. Park as a princess. She was known to be fastidious when she once visited the port city of Incheon as president, officials had to install a new toilet specifically for her, according to a former mayor of the city. Many South Koreans stayed up late to watch the live coverage of prosecutors escorting Ms. Park to the detention center in Uiwang, south of Seoul. She was the most prominent inmate to arrive at the center since at least 1995, when Roh   a former military dictator, was detained there. Hundreds of her supporters chanted “Park   our president!” as her motorcade pulled in. But others celebrated her arrival. “It’s time to pay dearly for what you have done!” one woman shouted as Ms. Park’s car passed through the steel gate. At the gate, Ms. Park’s   bodyguards, the only official privilege she still enjoyed, turned around. Since her formal removal from office on March 10 by the Constitutional Court, she had lost most of the other perks provided to an   like an office, a personal staff and a pension. The court unanimously upheld the National Assembly’s vote in December to impeach her, on charges that included abusing her power to help a longtime confidante, Choi   extort tens of millions of dollars from businesses. Once inside the detention center, ringed by a high wall interspersed with watchtowers, Ms. Park changed into a   jumpsuit required for all inmates and was assigned an inmate number, according to jail officials who briefed reporters on procedures at the center. Her photograph was taken, she underwent a quick medical checkup, and she was taken to a solitary cell, of a kind used to hold prominent politicians and business tycoons, to ensure their safety. Most inmates are held in    cells, with six inmates to each. Detention center officials would not reveal the size of Ms. Park’s cell but said the usual solitary cell was 71 square feet. They added that Mr. Roh, the former president, had been allowed a larger cell, of 118 square feet, and his own shower. Most inmates are allowed to use communal bathing facilities twice a week. Each cell has a TV set, a sink, a small cupboard and a reading desk that doubles as a dinner table, officials said. The TVs show only programs authorized by the Justice Ministry. There are roll calls at 6 a. m. and 8 p. m.   minutes of outdoor exercise are allowed per day. Because no time limit is imposed on lawyers’ visits, inmates wealthy enough to be unconcerned with their fees will often take advantage of the rule to spend several hours a day in a visiting area with their attorneys, rather than alone in their cells. Ms. Park is expected to meet frequently with hers to prepare for her trial. On Friday, Ms. Park would have been served bread, ketchup, cheese, soup, salad and soybean milk for breakfast, according to the jail menu for the day. Lunch was to be a   and vegetable stew with rice, bean sprouts, kimchi and seaweed. Each meal costs $1. 30, though a limited supply of private snacks can be bought from a jail cafeteria. The government pays for inmates’ regular meals. Ms. Park will have access to none of the stylists, personal chefs, plastic surgeons,   specialists or physical therapists who used to visit her regularly at the Blue House, prosecutors said. Ms. Park knows a number of inmates at the center, including her former chief of staff and several other senior aides who have been indicted in connection with the scandal that brought her down. Also there are Ms. Choi, the friend of Ms. Park who is at the center of the scandal, and Lee   the de facto head of Samsung, South Korea’s largest and most powerful conglomerate, who is charged with giving $38 million in bribes to Ms. Choi and Ms. Park. But officials said it was unlikely Ms. Park would interact with any of her former associates in jail. Male and female inmates are segregated, and inmates involved in related legal cases are kept separate. Jeong   a spokesman for Ms. Park’s conservative Liberty Korea Party, expressed hope Friday that she would be the country’s last former president to be jailed, even if she was not the first. “It’s really sad,” Mr. Jeong said. “We hope that the painful history of former presidents being arrested will not be repeated again in this country. ”",0
18183,"No, the Internet Has Not Killed the Printed Book. Most People Still Prefer Them. - The New York Times","Even with Facebook, Netflix and other digital distractions increasingly vying for time, Americans’ appetite for reading books  —   the ones you actually hold in your hands  —   has not slowed in recent years, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.   percent of adults in the United States said they had read a printed book in the past year, the same percentage that said so in 2012. When you add in ebooks and audiobooks, the number that said they had read a book in printed or electronic format in the past 12 months rose to 73 percent, compared with 74 percent in 2012.   percent said they had opted for an ebook in the past year, while 14 percent said they had listened to an audiobook. Lee Rainie, the director of internet, science and technology research for Pew Research, said the study demonstrated the staying power of physical books. “I think if you looked back a decade ago, certainly five or six years ago when ebooks were taking off, there were folks who thought the days of the printed book were numbered, and it’s just not so in our data,” he said. The 28 percent who said they had read an ebook in the past year has remained relatively steady in the past two years, but the way they are consuming ebooks is changing. The Pew study, based on a telephone survey of 1, 520 adults in the country from March 7 to April 4, reports that people are indeed using tablets and smartphones to read books. Thirteen percent of adults in the United States said that they used their cellphones for reading in the past year, up from 5 percent in 2011. Tablets are a similar story: 15 percent said that they had used one for books this year, up from 4 percent in 2011. While 6 percent said they read books only in digital format, 38 percent said they read books exclusively in print. But 28 percent are reading a combination of digital and printed books, suggesting that voracious readers are happy to take their text however they can get it. “They want books to be available wherever they are,” Mr. Rainie said. “They’ll read an ebook on a crowded bus, curl up with a printed book when they feel like that, and go to bed with a tablet. ”",0
18184,Call It What It Is: Rape - The New York Times,"The state of Montana doesn’t often make the national news. But it did recently when a judge there sentenced a man to just 60 days in jail after he repeatedly raped his    daughter. In the three weeks since the sentence was issued, over 80, 000 people have signed an initiative seeking to have the judge impeached. The New York Times’s Express desk caught up to the news on Friday, but it put a headline on its story that drew its own protests: “Montana Judge Criticized for   Sentence for Man Who Has Sex With His Preteen Daughter. ” In the view of many Times readers, that was a poor attempt to sum up the story. Among them was Elizabeth DeHoff, who homed in on the problem with the headline: DeHoff, of Littleton, Colo. articulates well the concerns of many of the readers who emailed me on Friday. Editors were clearly struggling with the headline, changing it five times over the course of the day. About three hours after the initial headline went up, a new one was put on the story, getting a little closer to the mark, but clunky: “Montana Judge Criticized for   Sentence for Man for Incest With Daughter, 12. ” Finally, after three more tries, the headline read: “Montana Judge Is Criticized for   Incest Sentence. ” (Still later, the headline was changed again, to “Outrage Follows   Sentence in Incest Case Against Father of Girl, 12. ”) Those were improvements but, in my view, they still fell short of the mark. To understand the thinking behind the headline changes, I spoke with Patrick LaForge, the editor who oversees the Express desk, which aims to get news from around the country up on the Times site quickly. “After the story was published early this morning, a number of editors and readers rightly objected to that language,” LaForge said. “After some discussion, the headline and lead paragraphs were revised to more clearly specify the charge. Please offer apologies and thanks to the readers who pointed this out. We’ve had a thorough conversation with the editors who were involved. ” I appreciate, and suspect readers appreciate, LaForge’s acknowledgment of a mistake in judgment and the effort to rectify it. But while the headline improved when it backed off the idea that this was simply “sex,” in my view the final headline still didn’t go far enough by merely referring to “incest. ” After all, the word incest to many readers might imply sex with a blood relative that is quite possibly consensual. Several other news sites didn’t hesitate to label this “rape” in their headline, among them CBS News, Time, The Washington Post and New York magazine. The challenge for headline writers in this case was that the man sentenced pleaded guilty to a charge of incest. So the safe thing to do is just stick to that word. But there should come a point in the   process when common sense kicks in. People are enraged because by any reasonable reading of the news story, a man raped a preteen girl, repeatedly, and he’ll spend two months in jail for it. The prosecutor used the word “rape” in court. The Times should have, too.",0
18185,Trump Inauguration Security Planners Brace for Wave of Protesters - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Security surrounding the inauguration of Donald J. Trump is proving to be the most challenging in recent history, according to senior officials involved in its planning, largely because of the same forces of political rancor that shaped the race for the presidency. On top of the daunting threats to any inaugural ceremony, the three dozen agencies responsible for security at the Jan. 20 festivities are preparing for the possibility of large numbers of protesters flooding the capital, along with what may be nearly a million supporters of Mr. Trump. The agencies are worried about the possibility of confrontations between groups of Americans still deeply divided over the election  —   and at a moment when millions of people around the world will be turning their attention to Washington. At the very least, officials said, protests would put additional pressure on the region’s   security apparatus. “To paraphrase Tolstoy: Each inauguration is risky, but each is risky in its own way,” said Michael Chertoff, who was secretary of homeland security under President George W. Bush and oversaw the department for President Obama’s first inauguration, in 2009. “I can’t think of an inauguration that presented more security challenges than this one,” Mr. Chertoff said. There were, of course, heightened concerns for the second inauguration of Mr. Bush, in 2005, the first presidential   to follow the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. And in 2009, Mr. Obama’s inauguration was the first transfer of power in the    era  —   and the first in which an   was taking the oath of office. Mr. Obama faced a rash of racist threats, as well as concerns about a terrorist plot that ultimately proved unfounded but sent the   and top aides scrambling on the eve of his  . Even so, Mr. Obama did not face the kind of large protests expected to greet Mr. Trump when he officially arrives in Washington. The 2009 crowd of nearly two million people, a record, included few, if any, protesters and did not lead to a single arrest, according to Christopher T. Geldart, the director of homeland security for the District of Columbia. The National Park Service, which controls much of the public land in Washington, from sidewalks to the National Mall, has already seen permit requests from groups hoping to host events both for and against Mr. Trump skyrocket to 23. In typical inauguration years, the agency receives just a handful of requests. Safeguarding the nation’s peaceful transfer of power is no easy task even under the most predictable of circumstances. There are few   rituals in American public life than the   of a new president. From the Metropolitan Police of Washington to the National Park Service to the F. B. I. a vast overlapping patchwork of intelligence analysts, military personnel and law enforcement officers numbering in the tens of thousands will be working to protect the inauguration and related activities. In total, more than three dozen agencies spread out across the capital will be working to prevent the occasion from becoming a platform for individuals or groups looking to do harm. Their work, begun months ago, has taken on a new urgency since Election Day and will soon include the imposition of a security perimeter around the Capitol, the Mall and large parts of the city. The costs of security alone are expected to exceed $100 million. Protecting the new president, the thousands of dignitaries who will be on hand and the crowds is the top priority of federal intelligence, law enforcement and military agencies, as it has been at inaugurations since the Sept. 11 attacks. Threats, from abroad and from homegrown extremists alike, remain a chief concern, current and former officials said. “What the intelligence community says publicly is what they say privately, and that is more threats from more directions than ever before,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who is chairman of the congressional committee planning the inaugural ceremony. “And that just means the Capitol Police and the security elements need to be more thoughtful and alert than ever to what could happen. ” But this time, security forces  —   particularly law enforcement officers who will be on the ground here  —   are also preparing to confront crowds of Americans who are unusually divided and anxious over the election results. The priority, officials said, is to avoid the kind of violent clashes that periodically flared up on the campaign trail between Mr. Trump’s supporters and those who opposed him, while allowing groups on both sides to carry on with events. “Everybody knows how contentious the campaign was,” said Mr. Geldart, the District of Columbia homeland security director. “Honestly, what really keeps me up at night around this is the ability for us to just allow folks to come in, express their views and leave safely. ” Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the agency was “actively reviewing” permit requests, with a goal of trying to accommodate as many events as possible. Groups that are granted permits will be spaced out to try to prevent mixing, Mr. Geldart said. The largest of those events, the   Women’s March on Washington, was granted a permit for about 200, 000 people to rally and then march in protest against Mr. Trump on Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration. Boris Epshteyn, the communications director for Mr. Trump’s inaugural planning committee, said the group welcomed the “free exercise” of First Amendment rights “as long as it is done peacefully and within all applicable laws, rules and regulations. ” Just how many of Mr. Trump’s supporters will attend remains unclear. The planning committee said it was expecting two million to three million people. Such a crowd would be a record, though Mr. Geldart said his team had yet to see evidence that would cause it to revise its own estimates of 800, 000 to 900, 000 people. The security effort will require virtually the full strength of the region’s law enforcement agencies, as well as significant reinforcements. More than 3, 200 police officers from departments across the country and about 8, 000 members of the National Guard will be on hand to help with basic crowd and traffic control around the city. An additional 5, 000 active duty service members will be on hand to serve in ceremonial capacities. Mr. Geldart said those forces would allow local agencies better versed in crowd management tactics to monitor the protesters and   groups, in person and with the help of social media. The security planning covers not just Inauguration Day itself but also a week of public and private events planned to celebrate Mr. Trump’s victory, beginning with a welcome concert on the National Mall on Jan. 19. Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s who is leading the inaugural planning committee, said each of those events had been carefully negotiated with the Secret Service and its partners. Mr. Trump’s personal security was made somewhat simpler when he decided he would stay at Blair House, as his modern predecessors have, rather than at his new hotel in Washington, as was once under consideration. “It’s their party and we’re there to develop the operation security plan to make their party safe,” said James Murray, the deputy assistant director of the Secret Service’s office of protective operations, which has overall responsibility for inaugural security. “But by all means it’s certainly a    kind of thing. ”",0
18186,Drunk coed attempting to take topless selfie while driving plows into police cruiser,"Print 
A tipsy Texas collegian was taking a topless Snapchat photo for her boyfriend last night moments before she crashed her car into a cruiser, according to cops. 
Miranda Kay Rader, 19, drove her SUV into the rear of a squad car whose driver had exited the vehicle to investigate a disturbance call. Rader, seen at right, was not injured in the 8:30 PM crash in Bryan, a city bordering College Station, home to Texas A&M (where Rader is a freshman). 
When a patrolman approached Rader’s Acura, he noticed that the student had on an “unclasped brassiere” and was “attempting to put a black blouse on.” When the officer asked why she “was not dressed while driving,” Rader replied that she had been “taking a Snapchat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at the red light.” 
Rader said she was en route to her Texas A&M dormitory at the time of the crash, according to a probable cause affidavit .",0
18187,Washington Accuses Russians of Bombing Five Hospitals in Syria – State Department Refuses To Provide Evidence,"Source: Global Research 
US State Dept. Dismisses Question from RT, Says Won’t Treat it Like Other Media 
RT has asked the US State Department for specific information concerning allegations that Russia is targeting hospitals in Syria. The response was a reiteration of those allegations and a refusal to treat RT in the same way as other media outlets. 
During Wednesday’s State Department briefing, spokesman John Kirby accused Russia and the Syrian regime of the bombing of ”five hospitals and at least one mobile clinic in Syria.” RT’s reporter Gayane Chichakyan asked Kirby to specify the details of the alleged incidents, including their location . 
Kirby said that he doesn’t know the exact locations. 
“I’m not making those accusations, I’m telling you that we’ve seen reports from credible aid organizations,” Kirby said, refusing to clarify any details on the alleged attacks or even give the list of the ”many Syrian relief agencies” on which the State Department relied. 
He went on with his criticism of the reporter. 
“Here’s a good question: Why don’t you ask your Defense Ministry what they are doing? You work for Russia Today [RT], and so why shouldn’t you ask your government the same kind of questions that you are asking me?” Kirby told RT on Wednesday. While Chichakyan pointed out she needed specific details so that RT could inquire about the allegations, Kirby refused to elaborate. 
The US official’s response prompted Matt Lee, a correspondent from the AP news agency, to intervene. 
“Please be careful about saying ‘your Defense Ministry’ and things like that – she’s a journalist, she’s just like the rest of us are,” he pointed out. 
“From a state-owned outlet!” Kirby interrupted, adding, ”I’m not going to put Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets.” 
A State Department official later apologized to Chichakyan and emailed the reporter a detailed statement with the locations of the allegedly bombed hospitals originally sent by “HEALTH CLUSTER TURKEY HUB / Health Cluster partners & NPM.” 
The statement said three hospitals were hit by airstrikes in Atarib, outside Aleppo, while two hospitals and a mobile clinic were hit in the Idlib province, resulting in several reported deaths and injuries and rendering the medical facilities out of service. 
It did not, however, lay blame on any party for the alleged strikes. 
Earlier on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau accused Russia of striking “five hospitals and one mobile clinic in Syria,” without specifying the source of information. Russia’s Defense Ministry has strongly denied these allegations. 
“We do not know where Elizabeth Trudeau gets information about what is happening in Syria. Her repeating rumors about some ‘five hospitals’ and ‘one mobile clinic’ which were ‘bombed’ only confirms the fact that all the State Department’s public rhetoric on the situation in Syria is based on blatant lies,” Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said at a Tuesday briefing. 
As of Wednesday, Russia has not launched any airstrikes in Aleppo for 29 days, according to the Defense Ministry. Russian jets are currently flying sorties in Idlib and Homs provinces, striking only verified terrorist infrastructure , namely factories and arms depots. ‘Unprofessional, borders on incompetence’ 
Larry Johnson, a retired CIA and State Department official, criticized Kirby’s behavior during the briefing, saying that his treatment of RT’s correspondent was “so unprofessional” that it “borders on incompetence.” 
Johnson says that the proper way for Kirby, who “relays the assentation of an unnamed group” to handle the situation, would be to calmly explain that he was not able to name the locations at the moment. 
While the accusations thrown at Russia stem from “highly suspect” sources of information, they fit the narrative of Russia’s demonization in the US media, Johnson said. 
“I have never seen this kind of hysteria against Russia in the United States, ever… the extreme statements, the insults directed at President Putin and at Russia in general, the notion that the United States can conduct military operation at the Russian border at will,” Johnson said, adding that it should not come as a surprise that such rhetoric causes serious concerns in Russia. 
“It’s emotional, it’s not rational, it’s nothing that can be explained by reason,” he added, voicing hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will review this approach and opt for cooperation with Russia instead. 
In contrast, constant rebel shelling in Syria causing mass civilians casualties continues to go largely unnoticed in Washington, Johnson argues, saying that it appears that for the US government “the other side doesn’t matter.” 
Speaking about Kirby’s attempt to justify his conduct toward RT’s correspondent by pointing out that RT is funded by the Russian state, Johnson regarded it as an odd argument, as the same is true for many major media outlets, for instance, BBC. At the same time, Johnson believes that US mainstream media is failing to do its job properly and seems to be “in the pocket of this [Obama] administration.” 
“They are not even asking basic critical fundamental questions, they accepting assertions by the administration at face value, not challenging, not questioning,” he said.

18188,Pope Francis Condemns ‘Genocide’ of Armenians Before Visit to Memorial - The New York Times,"ROME  —   Pope Francis waded into turbulent geopolitical waters once again on Friday during his first visit to Armenia when he made an unscripted remark referring to the World War   massacre of an estimated 1. 5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks as a genocide. The prepared text of his speech did not include the politically contentious word, which generally draws furious reactions from Turkey. Instead, the text opted for the more veiled Armenian expression “metz yeghern,” which translates as the “great evil. ” But in keeping with his penchant for blunt talk, the pontiff said Friday that “that tragedy” had been “a genocide” and was “the first of the deplorable series of catastrophes of the past century, made possible by twisted racial, ideological or religious aims that darkened the minds of the tormentors even to the point of planning the annihilation of entire peoples. ” Francis’ words were met with a standing ovation by President Serzh Sargsyan of Armenia and other officials and diplomats who gathered at the presidential palace in Yerevan, the nation’s capital, to hear the pope. There was no immediate reaction from Turkish leaders. Turkey has disputed the genocide designation, arguing that it was wartime and that many Turks were killed as well. And it has insisted that there was never a systematic plan to execute Armenians. The last time Francis used the term in reference to the mass deaths of Armenians, in Rome in April 2015, Turkey reacted angrily, recalling its ambassador to the Vatican and not returning the envoy for 10 months. The suffering and resilience of the Armenian people was the main theme of the first day of the pope’s   trip to the Caucasus region. His speeches also underscored the importance of dialogue and cooperation to overcome conflict  —   a tacit acknowledgment of Armenia’s continuing frictions with its neighbors Turkey and Azerbaijan. “May all join in striving to ensure that whenever conflicts emerge between nations, dialogue, the enduring and authentic quest of peace, cooperation between states and the constant commitment of international organizations will always prevail,” the pope said. Armenia has no diplomatic relations with Turkey. It has also locked horns with Azerbaijan over the disputed province of   since they both broke free from the Soviet Union. The choice to begin the journey with Armenia is in line with the pope’s “different geopolitical map of the world,” said Alberto Melloni, a historian of the Vatican. Mr. Melloni noted that the pope has tended to “start with small countries, before approaching larger powers,” and that his visits to the Caucasus could be seen as a preliminary approach to Russia, “which is the Vatican’s real issue  —   what to do with Russia and China, the great superpowers of the century. ” Originally, the pope had planned to include Georgia and Azerbaijan in his trip, but visits to those countries have been postponed until autumn. As the leader of one billion Roman Catholics, Francis also spoke Friday about the plight of Christians in the Middle East, where he said they suffer persecution and discrimination “perhaps even more than at the time of the first martyrs. ” “It is vitally important that all those who declare their faith in God join forces to isolate those who use religion to promote war, oppression and violent persecution, exploiting and manipulating the holy name of God,” he said. Before leaving Rome, Francis said he would go to Armenia as a pilgrim “to the first Christian country. ” Armenia adopted the faith in 301, and the Armenian Apostolic Church, which broke with other Christian churches in the fifth century over a theological dispute, counts about 93 percent of Armenia’s population of three million as adherents. By contrast, the country has only about 280, 000 Roman Catholics. Msgr. Gabriel Quicke, a Vatican official who works to promote unity with other Christian churches, said relations with the Armenian Apostolic Church have been strong since the Second Vatican Council 50 years ago. While in Armenia, the pope plans to visit the Tsitsernakaberd Memorial Complex, the country’s main monument to the Armenian genocide in Yerevan. He is expected to lay a wreath there and meet with descendants of Armenian orphans who were given refuge at the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, during the years of the killings, from 1915 to 1923. He also plans to visit a monastery near Mount Ararat, where the Bible says Noah’s ark landed after the Great Flood. The pontiff’s recognition of the Armenian genocide has drawn praise from Armenians and Armenian Americans. Karekin II, the patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church, told the pope on Friday that people remembered, “with gratitude,” Francis’ “historic sermon condemning the genocide” at St. Peter’s Basilica last year. And Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, issued a statement saying “the pope is both strengthening Christian solidarity with Armenia and taking a courageous stand for truth and justice. ”",0

18190,"European Leaders Snub Davos, Despite Focus on Populism","The leaders of some of the European Union’s largest countries and institutions will be giving the elite gathering at Davos a miss next week, despite the timely issue of populism being high on the agenda. [The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, and Spain have all snubbed this year’s forum, as has the Commission leadership, preferring instead to send finance ministers, in the case of the four nations, and five commissioners.  Their decision not to attend means they will not play a role in what is set to be a   between China and the incoming Trump administration on how to address the popular opposition to globalisation. Their absence will also deny Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, an opportunity to sound out her counterparts on issues surrounding Brexit, just weeks before she is due to enact Article 50 and begin the process of withdrawing Britain from the EU. Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to dominate this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) held annually at the Swiss ski resort of Davos. The first Chinese president to attend the Forum, Xi is expected to take on   Donald Trump’s   rhetoric during his keynote speech, by putting forward his views on steering “economic globalization towards greater inclusiveness”. As the Forum runs between   January, with the closing ceremony due to take place just hours before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president, he will be represented by Anthony Scaramucci, a member of his transition team. The Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong has told reporters that “channels of communication” will be open between the Chinese delegation and Trump’s transition team at the forum, although no formal meeting has yet been scheduled. The U. S. will also be represented by a strong delegation led by outgoing   Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry. So far, Britain’s Theresa May, Ireland’s Enda Kenny, Mark Rutte of The Netherlands, and Sweden’s Stefan Löfven, among other European leaders, are expected to attend. WEF founder Klaus Shwab has said that this year’s meeting must make progress on the problems facing the world, and has argued that populism isn’t the answer. At a   press conference, Shwab said: “Every simplified approach to deal with the global complex agenda is condemned to fail. “We cannot just have populist solutions. “The problems we face technologically, economically, socially and politically are so tremendous, such that sustainable solutions requite a systemic, holistic approach [  …    ] and particularly the collaboration of all global stakeholders, united in one mission  —   improving the state of the world. ” In total, aproximately 3, 000 participants will attend the event, including 1, 800 business leaders and around 50 heads of state, including the leaders of Paraguay, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Pakistan, Ukraine, and South Africa, among others. Hollywood stars Matt Damon and Forest Whittaker and the singer Shakira are also set to make an appearance.",0
18191,Essential Reading: 5 Books About Dramatic Supreme Court Nomination Hearings - The New York Times,"There’s courtroom drama, and then there’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing drama. As the Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil M. Gorsuch goes through his Senate confirmation hearings  —   which are taking place in an overheated political climate, and after Senate Republicans last year refused to consider Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland  —   here are five books that capture dramatic nomination hearings from the past. Ethan Bronner’s “Battle for Justice” (1989) dissects the hearings for Robert H. Bork, who was nominated by Ronald Reagan in 1987. According to The Times’s critic Christopher   the “mesmerizing” book lays out the intellectual and ideological reasons that Bork failed. (In short: Liberals got away with oversimplifying Bork’s ideas, and Bork himself did an ineffective job of articulating his philosophy and vision.)   said the book, a “vital portrait of a political process,” was not overtly political, but was instead “more history than argument, and extremely dramatic history at that. ” Bork’s hearings were highly contentious at the time. Then came the   1991 hearings for Clarence Thomas, defined by Anita Hill’s accusations of sexual harassment, a spectacle fully recounted in “Strange Justice,” by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson. (Mayer, now a staff writer at The New Yorker, and Abramson, who eventually went on to become executive editor of The Times, were then reporters for The Wall Street Journal.) Margo Jefferson, reviewing the book in The Times in 1994, said it recreated the hearings “in all their sleaze and silliness: the high stakes and the low blows, the   moralizing punctuated by moments of   street talk. . . . But Ms. Mayer and Ms. Abramson also take us behind the scenes, where fierce political maneuvering determined the outcome: The White House lobbied fiercely for Senate votes, and new alliances were forged between white and black evangelical ministers. ” Thomas succeeded Thurgood Marshall, the first   to serve on the country’s highest court, and the   story of Marshall’s own hearings is told in Wil Haygood’s “Showdown” (2015). Segregationist Southern senators, including Strom Thurmond, opposed Marshall’s nomination. (Thurmond would end up being the only Republican to vote against the confirmation.) “I didn’t want to write a traditional biography,” Haygood told Baltimore magazine in 2016. “When I looked at his 1967 Supreme Court confirmation hearings and looked at the other nominees who came before him, it struck me as stunning that all the other hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee lasted four hours or less. . . . I just thought everything that took place in room 2228, where the hearings were held, told this great story about this nation  —   how we got from there to here  —   and about the life of Thurgood Marshall. ” Marshall was not the first trailblazing justice to be subjected to the rigors of the confirmation process. Melvin I. Urofsky’s “Louis D. Brandeis: A Life” (2009) is a full,   biography, but it does include a look at the controversy that ensued after Woodrow Wilson nominated Brandeis to the Supreme Court in 1916. As Alan Dershowitz wrote, reviewing the biography in the Book Review: “Urofsky believes that his religion played less of a role than his radical approach to the law, but it is impossible to separate the two, because the bigotry of the day associated his alleged radicalism with his Jewish heritage. ” For a broader take on the history of the nomination process, one can turn to “Advice and Consent,” published in 1992 by   Paul Simon, of Illinois. In the Book Review, the legal scholar Ronald Dworkin wrote that Simon offered a “thoughtful, modest and shrewd appraisal” of his and the Senate’s performance during the nomination hearings for Thomas and Bork. The book also provided a history of other important confirmation struggles and made suggestions for reforming the process.",0
18192,A Gut Makeover for the New Year - The New York Times,"If you’re making resolutions for a healthier new year, consider a gut makeover. Refashioning the community of bacteria and other microbes living in your intestinal tract, collectively known as the gut microbiome, could be a good   investment in your health. Trillions of microbial cells inhabit the human body, outnumbering human cells by 10 to one according to some estimates, and growing evidence suggests that the rich array of intestinal microbiota helps us process nutrients in the foods we eat, bolsters the immune system and does all sorts of odd jobs that promote sound health. A diminished microbial ecosystem, on the other hand, is believed to have consequences that extend far beyond the intestinal tract, affecting everything from allergies and inflammation, metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, even mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. Much of the composition of the microbiome is established early in life, shaped by forces like your genetics and whether you were   or  . Microbial diversity may be further undermined by the typical   American diet, rich in sugar, meats and processed foods. But a new study in mice and people adds to evidence that suggests you can take steps to enrich your gut microbiota. Changing your diet to one containing a variety of   foods, the new research suggests, may be crucial to achieving a healthier microbiome. Altering your microbiome, however, may not be easy, and nobody knows how long it might take. That’s because the ecosystem already established in your gut determines how it absorbs and processes nutrients. So if the microbial community in your gut has been shaped by a daily diet of cheeseburgers and pepperoni pizza, for example, it won’t respond as quickly to a healthy diet as a gut shaped by vegetables and fruits that has more varied microbiota to begin with. “The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by the microbial community that encounters that food,” said Dr. Jeffrey Gordon, the senior author of the new paper and director of the Center for Genome Science and Systems Biology at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Nutritional components of a healthy diet have to be viewed from “the inside out,” he said, “not just the outside in. ” One of the questions the study set out to answer was how individuals with different diets respond when they try to improve their eating habits. The scientists harvested gut bacteria from humans, transplanted them into mice bred under sterile conditions, and then fed the mice either   or   diets. The scientists then analyzed changes in the mice’s microbial communities. Of interest, the scientists harvested the gut bacteria from people who followed sharply different diets. One group ate a fairly typical American diet, consuming about 3, 000 calories a day, high in animal proteins with few fruits and vegetables. Some of their favorite foods were processed cheese, pepperoni and lunch meats. The other group consisted of people who were devotees of calorie restriction. They ate less than 1, 800 calories a day and had meticulously tracked what they ate for at least two years, sticking to a mostly   diet and consuming far less animal protein than the other group, a third fewer carbohydrates and only half the fat. This   group, the researchers found, had a far richer and more diverse microbial community in the gut than those eating a typical American diet. They also carried several strains of “good” bacteria, known to promote health, that are unique to their   diet. “Their choices as adults dramatically influenced their gut community,” said Nicholas W. Griffin of Washington University, the paper’s lead author. The study, published in Cell Host  Microbe, is not the first to report findings suggesting dietary shifts can induce persistent changes in a gut microbial community, said Dr. David A. Relman, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, who was not involved in the current research. He noted that other studies had found even more profound effects. After the human microbiota was transplanted into the mice, the mice got to eat either like typical Americans or like the calorie restrictors. Mice that had a microbiota conditioned by the typical American diet had a weaker response to the   diet. Their microbial communities didn’t increase and diversify as much. “They all responded in a predictable direction, but with not as great a magnitude,” said Dr. Griffin. Another aspect of the study suggests the company you keep may also enrich your gut microbiota  —   at least in mice. At first the animals were kept in separate cages. Then, when they were housed together, the microbes from the communities conditioned by plant diets made their way into the   microbiome. It’s not clear how that translates to humans: Mice eat one another’s droppings when they live together, so they easily share the bacterial wealth. Still, it’s possible humans have other ways of sharing bacteria, Dr. Griffin said. “We know from previous work and other studies that spouses who live together will develop microbial communities that are similar to each other,” he said. Perhaps the best way to cultivate a healthier microbiome is to eat more fiber by consuming more fruit, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts or seeds, said Meghan Jardine, a registered dietitian who was not involved in the current study but has published articles on promoting a healthy microbiota. (She is also affiliated with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which recommends a   diet.) She urges people to aim for 40 to 50 grams of fiber daily, well above levels recommended by most dietary guidelines. “When you look at populations that eat real food that’s high in fiber, and more   foods, you’re going to see they have a more robust microbiota, with more genetic diversity, healthier species and fewer pathogenic bacteria living in the gut,” she said.",0
18193,Why We Can’t Look Away From Our Screens - The New York Times,"In a new book, “Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,” the social psychologist Adam Alter warns that many of us  —   youngsters, teenagers, adults  —   are addicted to modern digital products. Not figuratively, but literally addicted. Dr. Alter, 36, is an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University who researches psychology and marketing. We spoke for two hours last week at the offices of The New York Times. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity. Q. What makes you think that people have become addicted to digital devices and social media? A. In the past, we thought of addiction as mostly related to chemical substances: heroin, cocaine, nicotine. Today, we have this phenomenon of behavioral addictions where, one tech industry leader told me, people are spending nearly three hours a day tethered to their cellphones. Where teenage boys sometimes spend weeks alone in their rooms playing video games. Where Snapchat will boast that its youthful users open their app more than 18 times a day. Behavioral addictions are really widespread now. A 2011 study suggested that 41 percent of us have at least one. That number is sure to have risen with the adoption of newer more addictive social networking platforms, tablets and smartphones.  How do you define “addiction”? The definition I go with is that it has to be something you enjoy doing in the short term, that undermines your   in the long term  —   but that you do compulsively anyway. We’re biologically prone to getting hooked on these sorts of experiences. If you put someone in front of a slot machine, their brain will look qualitatively the same as when they take heroin. If you’re someone who compulsively plays video games  —   not everyone, but people who are addicted to a particular game  —   the minute you load up your computer, your brain will look like that of a substance abuser. We are engineered in such a way that as long as an experience hits the right buttons, our brains will release the neurotransmitter dopamine. We’ll get a flood of dopamine that makes us feel wonderful in the short term, though in the long term you build a tolerance and want more. Do the designers of the new technologies understand what they’re doing? The people who create video games wouldn’t say they are looking to create addicts. They just want you to spend as much time as possible with their products. Some of the games on smartphones require you to give money as you play, so they want to keep you playing. The designers will build into a game a certain amount of feedback, in the same way that slot machines offer an occasional win to hold your interest. Not surprisingly, game producers will often pretest different versions of a release to see which one is hardest to resist and which will keep your attention longest. It works. For the book, I spoke with a young man who sat in front of his computer playing a video game for 45 consecutive days! The compulsive playing had destroyed the rest of his life. He ended up at a rehabilitation clinic in Washington State, reSTART, where they specialize in treating young people with gaming dependencies. Do we need legislation to protect ourselves? It’s not a bad idea to consider it, at least for online games. In South Korea and China, there are proposals for something they call Cinderella laws. The idea is to protect children from playing certain games after midnight. Gaming and internet addiction is a really serious problem throughout East Asia. In China, there are millions of youngsters with it, and they actually have camps where parents commit their children for months and where therapists treat them with a detox regime. Why do you claim that many of the new electronic gadgets have fueled behavioral addictions? Well, look at what people are doing. In one survey, 60 percent of the adults said they keep their cellphones next to them when they sleep. In another survey, half the respondents claimed they check their emails during the night. Moreover, these new gadgets turn out to be the perfect delivery devices for addictive media. If games and social media were once confined to our home computers, portable devices permit us to engage with them everywhere. Today, we’re checking our social media constantly, which disrupts work and everyday life. We’ve become obsessed with how many “likes” our Instagram photos are getting instead of where we are walking and whom we are talking to. Where’s the harm in this? If you’re on the phone for three hours daily, that’s time you’re not spending on    interactions with people. Smartphones give everything you need to enjoy the moment you’re in, but they don’t require much initiative. You never have to remember anything because everything is right in front of you. You don’t have to develop the ability to memorize or to come up with new ideas. I find it interesting that the late Steve Jobs said in a 2010 interview that his own children didn’t use iPads. In fact, there are a surprising number of Silicon Valley titans who refuse to let their kids near certain devices. There’s a private school in the Bay Area and it doesn’t allow any tech  —   no iPhones or iPads. The really interesting thing about this school is that 75 percent of the parents are tech executives. Learning about the school pushed me to write, “Irresistible. ” What was it about these products that made them, in the eyes of experts, so potentially dangerous? You have an    son. How do you interact with your technologies when you’re with him? I try not to use my phone around him. It’s actually one of the best mechanisms to force me not to use my phone so much. Are you addicted to this stuff? Yeah, I think so. I’ve developed addictions from time to time to various games on my phone. Like many of the people in the survey I mentioned earlier, I’m addicted to email. I can’t stop checking it. I can’t go to bed at night if I haven’t cleared my inbox. I’ll keep my phone next to my bed, much as I try not to. The technology is designed to hook us that way. Email is bottomless. Social media platforms are endless. Twitter? The feed never really ends. You could sit there 24 hours a day and you’ll never get to the end. And so you come back for more and more. If you were advising a friend on quitting their behavioral addictions, what would you suggest? I’d suggest that they be more mindful about how they are allowing tech to invade their life. Next, they should cordon it off. I like the idea, for instance, of not answering email after six at night. In general, I’d say find more time to be in natural environments, to sit face to face with someone in a long conversation without any technology in the room. There should be times of the day where it looks like the 1950s or where you are sitting in a room and you can’t tell what era you are in. You shouldn’t always be looking at screens.",0
18194,"Concealed Carry Up 215%, Murder Rate Down 14% - Breitbart","Concealed carry permits rose 215 percent between 2007 and 2015, and the murder rate dropped 14 percent during that same time period. [In other words, more guns being carried for   correlated with fewer murders.  On May 22, Breitbart News reported that the demand for concealed carry permits witnessed its greatest surge ever between May 2016 and May 2017. Fox News referenced Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) data showing there were 14. 5 million permit holders in May 2016 and approximately 15. 7 million in May 2017. Now the NRA is tweeting data which shows that the bigger picture is not just the   surge but a 215 percent jump in concealed carry permits between 2007 and 2015. Know the #facts about concealed carry, and urge your lawmakers to support national reciprocity! https:  .  #2A #DefendTheSecond pic. twitter.   —   NRA (@NRA) May 24, 2017,  It is interesting to note that the murder rate dropped by 14 percent while concealed carry permits surged. And “the overall violent crime rate” dropped by 21 percent. This is not what the left tells us will happen if concealed carry expands. In fact, national reciprocity for concealed carry has been introduced in Congress, and Gabby Giffords, Senator Mark Warner ( ) Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, and many other gun control proponents have come out against national recognition of concealed carry for   citizens. They all suggest national reciprocity would undermine gun control and make Americans less safe. Here is the problem with their claims  —   concealed carry surged by 215 percent between 2007 and 2015 and the murder rate fell and the violent crime rate fell with it. On December 4, 2013, Breitbart News reported a Congressional Research Study (CRS) which showed a similar correlation between gun ownership and plummeting murder numbers. Gun ownership climbed from 192 million firearms in 1994 to 310 million firearms in 2009, CRS found that murder rates fell sharply during the same time period. According to the report, the “  murder and   homicide” rate was 6. 6 per 100, 000 Americans in 1993 but fell to 3. 6 per 100, 000 in 2000. By 2011, the murder rate was 3. 2 per 100, 000.

18195,"With Donald Trump Tanking, a Trump Supporter Waves Her Hillary in a Noose Doll at Rally","At a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina, a proud Ginger Glover waved a “Lyin’ Hillary Doll” with a special edition noose on it. 
Watch a clip with Glover at the Wednesday rally here via NBC News : 
Glover said the noose was her way of making a point that Hillary Clinton should be “incarcerated at the very least,” but when asked said she doesn’t think Clinton should be killed. 
Yet her employees put the noose on the doll for her and she brought it out in public and waved it around. For “effect.” 
Where is all of the Trump rallies’ violent rhetoric and imagery going? 
Donald Trump seems to attract people who are angry and want someone to blame. 
The Washington Post did an incredible story on Melanie Austin, a Trump supporter who said Trump sees the world like she does. She realized this days after she had been injected with something intended to “calm” her, after she was involuntarily committed for homicidal ideation against President Obama. 
The first time she had seen him, at a rally in June, she was just beginning to realize how many people saw the world the way she did, that she was one among millions. At the time, her hips were still sore from a series of injections intended to calm her. She had gotten them in February, during a difficult time in her life, when she had been involuntarily hospitalized for several weeks after what she called a “rant,” a series of online postings that included one saying that Obama should be hanged and the White House fumigated and burned to the ground. On her discharge papers, in a box labeled “medical problem,” a doctor had typed “homicidal ideation.” 
Donald Trump and the alt-right, and indeed way too many elected Republicans, have already pointed these folks at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as Evil People Who Must Be Harmed. When you attract unstable people who are easily manipulated out of anger and fear and then direct them to harm someone, as Trump and his advisers have done suggesting Hillary Clinton might be shot and saying she should be executed with a firing squad, you are responsible for inciting violence. 
Things are not going well for Trump supporters, and even buoyed as they are with unscientific online polls and delusions fed by the alt-right media and Fox News, they smell defeat. 
Perhaps that’s not connected to this specific woman who brought a Hillary Clinton doll in a noose to wave at a Trump rally last night, but it is a trend we’re seeing in general – angry Trump fans using more and more violent rhetoric. 
There will be more of this, not less, as Trump’s likely defeat becomes reality outside of tinfoil circles. 
This is political intimidation that mimics Donald Trump’s despotic promises to jail Clinton even though she’s been cleared of wrong-doing in all of the relentless Republican investigations into her activities as Secretary of State. 
Of which there will be plenty more, Republicans promise us, should she win — because just like the Trump camp doesn’t want you to vote, Republicans only want government to work when they’re not in power. 
The potent mixture of tinfoil and rage is creating a toxic brew of violent fantasies and rhetoric among Trump supporters.

18196,Neil Gorsuch: Conservatives Praise Trump’s Supreme Court Pick,"Conservatives were effusive in their praise on Tuesday evening for President Donald Trump’s choice for the U. S. Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. [Faith  Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed said:  President Trump won 81 percent of the evangelical vote in no small measure because he made an ironclad pledge that if elected he would fill the vacancy on the US Supreme Court with a strict constructionist who would respect the Constitution and the rule of law, not legislate from the bench. We never doubted   Trump’s sincerity or commitment, and by nominating Judge Gorsuch, he has now kept that promise. Judge Gorsuch is a widely respected jurist whose   intellect is complemented by his temperament and the knowledge of the law. He is exactly who the nation needs as a Supreme Court Justice in the model of the late Antonin Scalia. Faith  Freedom Coalition is thrilled by this nomination and will work tirelessly for the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. Michael A. Needham, CEO of Heritage Action for America, said: Judge Neil Gorsuch is a nominee ‘very much in the mold’ of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Trump deserves credit for fulfilling his campaign pledge by nominating an individual who will, based on his record, interpret the text of the Constitution rather than create unwritten rights supposedly hidden between the lines. The usurpations of the rule of law, substituting for the will of the people as embodied in democratically enacted legislation rights nowhere to be found in our Constitution itself, only serves to divide our nation. Judge Gorsuch is an outstanding choice, and now the Senate must prepare to carry out its “Advise and Consent” role as it has for the past 227 years. Tea Party Patriots President and   Jenny Beth Martin said: Tea Party Patriots and our network of supporters and grassroots activists across the country thank President Donald Trump for nominating Neil Gorsuch to be our next Supreme Court Justice. President Trump promised to nominate someone who is both exceptionally qualified and has a demonstrated record of interpreting the Constitution and our laws and by nominating Judge Gorsuch, he has kept his promises. Judge Gorsuch has a distinguished record that demonstrates he will be fair to all Americans, no matter their background or beliefs. Like Justice Scalia, he believes that judges should base their decisions on the actual text of the Constitution and our laws, not on personal policy preferences. During the campaign, President Trump took the unprecedented step of sharing a list of names from which he promised to choose a Supreme Court nominee. Exit polls showed that one in five voters named the Supreme Court as their top issue. President Trump has a clear mandate to choose our next Justice, and our network of grassroots activists will work very hard to ensure the Senate quickly moves to confirm Judge Gorsuch. Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning said: The election of 2016 was a referendum on who would get to select the next Supreme Court justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. President Trump’s wise and thoughtful selection of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court should be respected by the Senate, which has the constitutional responsibility to provide for a fair and expedited hearing process, and an up or down vote decided by a simple majority of the Senate. If Senate Majority Leader McConnell faces the sort of obstruction that has been promised by some in the minority, including the use of the filibuster, to block consideration of Gorsuch, it will be incumbent on him to use all means necessary to ensure that this qualified and outstanding jurist is confirmed. It is time for the Senate minority to reconcile itself to the fact their party lost the election, and stop behaving like spoiled children who didn’t get a candy bar in the grocery store. Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said: Neil Gorsuch is a mainstream conservative choice who fulfills President Trump’s promise to the American people to appoint a justice who represents their views. In this past presidential election, the American people gave their support to President Trump in large part because he vowed to appoint a justice in the mold of the great Justice Scalia. Neil Gorsuch’s sterling track record of faithfully interpreting the Constitution, protecting individual rights, and ensuring limited government is complemented by his discerning approach to every case and a high personal integrity. Democrats who plan on obstructing President Trump’s choice are only scheming to deprive the American people of their rightful voice on the nation’s highest court. Americans are clearly in support of this thoughtful and qualified choice, and it’s time for Democrats to honor the will of the people so the Supreme Court can once again have nine justices. Public Interest Legal Foundation President and General Counsel J. Christian Adams said: Former colleagues speak of Judge Gorsuch’s tested adherence to the honorable tradition of strict constructionism just like the late Justice Antonin Scalia before him. The Rule of Law is on firmer ground tonight, and we will have Judge Gorsuch to thank for that. Former Senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum said: Judge Gorsuch has proven himself to be one of the great legal scholars of his generation. His rulings on the Circuit Court have shown that he understands our Founders’ intent and will rule with the strict constructionist legal mindset our nation needs. Justice Antonin Scalia was known for his robust legal rulings, and Judge Neil Gorsuch will surely follow in his footsteps. Carl Anderson of the Knights of Columbus said: We applaud the president’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. From his writings and his record it is clear that he will interpret the Constitution as it was written, including our first Amendment right to religious freedom, and the right to life of every person. Judge Gorsuch was confirmed without opposition to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006, and has received a “unanimously well qualified” rating from the American Bar Association. It is hard to imagine a better, and more qualified, candidate. The Senate should swiftly confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Balckwell said: President Trump hit a home run in his choice of Judge Gorsuch, an extremely well qualified and widely respected jurist with a deep commitment to upholding the Constitution and the vision of founders. President Trump took an unprecedented step during the campaign by sharing his list of potential nominees with the American public and the people responding by electing him president. With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, the President has clearly delivered on his campaign commitment to appoint a Justice in the mold of Antonin Scalia who would be guided by the Constitution and not by their ideological or personal views. Gorsuch has been nominated to fill the seat vacated last year by Justice Antonin Scalia, who passed away suddenly on vacation. Some Senate Democrats say they want to force Republicans to overcome the   filibuster threshold to confirm Judge Gorsuch. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

18197,The Loneliness of Being Black in San Francisco - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Gerald Harris was walking along Ocean Beach, the blustery coastline at the western edge of the city, when he passed Danny Glover, a star of Hollywood action movies and a San Francisco native. The men exchanged glances. “We were the only two black people in the area,” Mr. Harris said. San Francisco was once a national beacon of   culture, home to a thriving jazz scene that had so many clubs it was known as the Harlem of the West. But these days, blacks say they take notice when they see another   in affluent and   neighborhoods. The jazz clubs of the Fillmore neighborhood have been replaced with upscale shops. Marcus Books, a cultural anchor of the black community and one of the first bookshops in the nation to focus on   topics, closed in 2014. Other black landmarks that have long since disappeared are commemorated with remembrances embedded in the sidewalk like tombstones to a forgotten culture. The decline has been steady and noticeable. One of seven residents was black in 1970. Today, it is nearly one of 20, with most of the city’s 46, 000 blacks living in public housing. “My prediction is 10 years from now, we won’t have 20, 000 blacks in this city,” said the Rev. Amos C. Brown, the pastor of Third Baptist Church, a historically black church founded in 1852. While San Francisco residents agree that the loss of black culture is palpable, there is disagreement over what to do about it. City officials say they are trying to retain the remaining black population, largely through expanding and improving public housing, and want to lure more affluent blacks to the city. They are also confronting accusations of racial profiling by the police force, which has spurred protests throughout the city. Yet one of the city’s most prominent   Willie Brown, a former mayor and former speaker of the California State Assembly, said he did not believe the shift could be reversed. There is no point in trying to engineer the city’s ethnic population, he said. “I don’t think I would put a whole lot of time and energy into doing anything,” Mr. Brown said, “except making sure there’s equal access and equal opportunity and equal resources. ” He called the current mix  —   with whites, Asians and Latinos making up the largest segments of the population  —   a “new reality. ” The reasons for the migration are in large measure economic: Skyrocketing real estate prices fueled by   tech jobs have priced out   residents of all ethnicities. But the exodus was also accelerated by a domino effect of black businesses and families moving away, many of them to Oakland and other cities along the East Bay. When black communities, which were splintered into three areas in San Francisco, lost their barber shops, restaurants and clubs, they lost their centers of gravity, according to Mr. Brown. Black residents moved to places where they felt more “comfortable socially,” he said. The tech industry, the motor of San Francisco’s economy in recent years, has accelerated the decline. The tech industry skews white and Asian. John William Templeton, a local historian and an advocate for greater black participation in the industry, said it was disappointing that blacks were not more involved in one of America’s most successful industries. Around 1 percent of employees at tech companies in the Bay Area are black, down from 4 percent in 1998, according to Mr. Templeton. The shift was also partly encouraged by what is now recognized as an extensive and misguided city policy of eradicating what was called “urban blight. ” Thousands of homes in black neighborhoods were razed in the name of redevelopment from the 1950s to the 1970s. Theodore Miller, an aide to Mayor Edwin M. Lee, called it a “terrible undertaking that had catastrophic consequences. ” The final draft of a   report, published in January, said redevelopment benefited prominent members of the business community whose “real motivation was the replacement of   ‘slums’ with   commercial and residential development. ” The city is by no means empty of   especially in the business district many blacks commute to work from other cities in the Bay Area. Still, Mr. Harris said he often found that he was the only   in restaurants or at the Commonwealth Club, where he helps organize seminars on science and technology. Frederick E. Jordan, a business leader who talks about the need for a “Marshall Plan” to woo more blacks to the city, says “there are no jobs and no contracts” for blacks. “Our backs are against the sea we’re almost out,” said Mr. Jordan, who owns an engineering firm and is the chairman of the San Francisco African American Chamber of Commerce. “We have to rebuild our   middle class,” said Mr. Miller, the mayor’s aide. The majority of blacks who remain are disproportionally poor, with median incomes for blacks at $27, 000 compared with $89, 000 for whites, a disparity twice as large as the national average. Blacks who remain have been subject to racial profiling by the police, according to the public defender’s office, and a recent report commissioned by the city cited a host of actions by the police against blacks that appear to be discriminatory. The report found that while   make up about 6 percent of the city’s residents, they constituted about 40 percent, 20 of 51, of the victims of   shootings from January 2010 through July 2015. In addition, the study found evidence of racial disparities in the rate of police stops and searches of  . Those racially charged shootings, including of a black man and woman, forced the police chief, Gregory P. Suhr, to resign in May. From the days of the gold rush, San Francisco was a place of opportunity for pioneering blacks, as it was for Jews, Italians, Irish and other ethnic groups. The city’s black population was small until around World War II, when tens of thousands of blacks migrated from the South to work in shipyards and other wartime jobs. The   population increased by nearly 800 percent in the 1940s and reached its peak around 1970, when 13 percent of the city was black. San Francisco also played a role in the civil rights movement. In 1968, black students at what was then San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) held a prolonged strike that led to the creation of the nation’s first black studies program, a campaign chronicled in the recent documentary “Agents of Change. ” Mr. Glover, who took part in the protests as a student, said the black exodus from the city made him “sad and angry. ” The larger question, he said, is whether San Francisco is becoming an enclave for the rich. “It’s a question about who we are and our responsibility to build our communities,” he said, “and not just based upon who has the ability to pay. ” The frustration is keenly felt among those whose neighborhoods have lost their core. Many say they feel like strangers in their own city. “You get the feeling that people are thinking, ‘You’re still here? ’” said Barbara Gainer, a probation officer and a jazz singer. She lives in the western reaches of the city, a neighborhood that was once predominantly black but now is mostly   a segment that now makes up 34 percent of the city’s population, up from 13 percent in 1970. Ms. Gainer says she is regularly asked if she wants to sell her house her mailbox fills up with solicitations. The inquiries were flattering at first because they reminded her of the value of her property, but now she feels singled out. She remembers one couple in particular who approached her four or five times about selling. She tried to dissuade them. “I said: ‘Even if I sold you my house and you gave me this big price, why would I do that? Where would I live? ’” The reply stunned her: “You should go to Antioch. That’s where your people go. ” Antioch, a city about 50 miles northeast, has a sizable   population. At Mr. Brown’s Third Baptist Church, attendance has been steadily declining on a recent Sunday, around 150 parishioners worshiped in a sanctuary that seats 1, 100. “We pray that we would never be cut flowers, that we would always have roots,” Mr. Brown told the congregation. Mr. Brown then told the story of hearing a radio program lamenting the looming extinction of a type of butterfly. “And yet,” he said, “we don’t have the basic compassion and common sense to realize that blacks are an endangered species in the city of San Francisco. ”",0
18198,What Will Replace ISIS?,"Search What Will Replace ISIS? This is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the West or to Islam. October 28, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
Before long the same administration that declared the fighting in Iraq over several times will claim victory over ISIS. The timetable for its push against the Islamic State appears to have less do with the victimized Christians and Yazidis who have been prevented from coming here as refugees in favor of Syrian Muslims than with the Clinton presidential campaign. Like Obama’s declarations that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were over, the announcement that ISIS has been defeated will be premature. 
It is based on a profound misunderstanding and misreading of Islamic terrorism. 
Long before its current string of defeats, ISIS had begun evolving into another Al Qaeda; a multinational alliance of Jihadists scattered around the world. Bombing Mosul isn’t hard, but try bombing Marseille, Brussels or London. There is no doubt that the ability of ISIS to temporarily establish a caliphate allowed it to build a network that could carry out terror attacks from New York to Miami to Nice to Munich. But it would be dangerous to assume that losing Iraq and Syria will stop ISIS. 
ISIS doesn’t matter. The idea of ISIS does. And the idea of ISIS is Islamic supremacism. 
The organization we think of ISIS has transformed and rebranded countless times. Even now our leaders vacillate between calling it ISIS, ISIL or, more childishly, Daesh, while it dubs itself the Islamic State. We have been fighting it in one form or another for over a decade. It would be unrealistically optimistic to assume that the war will end just as this old enemy has shown its ability to strike deep in our own cities. 
The bigger error though is to think that we are fighting an organization. We are fighting an idea. That is not to contend, as Obama does, that we can debate it to death. It is not the sort of idea that argues with words, but with bullets, bombs and swords. But neither does it just go away if you seize a city. 
Al Qaeda in Iraq not only survived the death of Zarqawi, but it became even more dangerous under Baghdadi. It would be risky to assume that ISIS will die with him. Instead it may very well grow into a new phase of Al Qaeda, one that ties together some of the world’s deadliest Islamic terror groups into a network that is decentralized enough that it will not suffer from Al Qaeda’s leadership fatigue. 
The rise of Islamic terrorism has been an incremental process in which new groups learn from the mistakes of the old and supersede them. If ISIS does recede into a localized oblivion, reemerging only on occasion to suicide bomb something or someone in Baghdad, then a deadlier and even more effective group is likely to take its place. Each group will move one step closer to realizing the caliphate. 
To break the cycle, we must confront the idea of the caliphate at the heart of Islamic terrorism. 
ISIS is not un-Islamic. It is ruthlessly and uncompromisingly Islamic in that, unlike its predecessors in the Muslim Brotherhood and Al Qaeda, it makes the fewest compromises to civilizational sensibilities. Its goals are the same as those of every Islamic political organization, including those dubbed moderate. It seeks to restore and enforce an Islamic system in every part of the Muslim world before moving on to conquer and subjugate the non-Muslim world. If this were merely some fringe belief held by a tiny minority of extremists, then it could be bombed to pieces in some Syrian or Iraqi backwater. 
But it’s the driving force of Islam. That’s why it won’t go away. No amount of appeasement will banish it. 
Taking in more Muslim settlers, pressuring Israel and letting the Muslim Brotherhood colonize our foreign policy won’t do it. We’ve tried it and it actually makes Islamic terrorism much worse. 
When the announcement is made, the usual suspects will pat themselves on the back for having defeated ISIS by mobilizing a Muslim coalition. But it wasn’t Obama who mobilized a Muslim coalition. The coalition, such as it was, mobilized them. Obama provided useful support to Islamic state sponsors of terror, such as Iran and Turkey, assorted Islamic Jihadists on the ground, some blatantly associated with Sunni and Shiite terror groups in their internal Jihadist conflict with ISIS over who will fight us. 
The “allies” we are aiding today will be the ones bombing us tomorrow. 
And that is why claiming credit for beating ISIS accomplishes nothing. ISIS is an expression of an Islamic impulse encoded in the Koran. Islamic groups differ in the tactical expression of that impulse. ISIS was nastier and uglier than most of the Islamic terror groups we had dealt with before this. Though even it found its Boko Haram affiliate in Nigeria occasionally a little too much to stomach. 
If ISIS vanishes from the world stage, Islamic terrorism will be easier to dismiss. Or so the thinking goes. The Islamic State was better at viral videos than the media that tried to whitewash Islamic terror. It was hard to ignore. But a scattering of Islamic terror groups around the world will be forgotten by the public. 
History suggests that’s wishful thinking. 
Islamic terrorism has shown no signs of receding. Growing Muslim populations, both at home and in Muslim settlements in the West, and the increase in travel and communications, the infrastructure of globalism, spread it from the most backward to the most advanced parts of the world. Wealthy and unstable Muslim countries, rich in oil but poor in power, finance its spread through mosques and guns. 
These are the ingredients that give us ISIS or any other combination or letters that stands for Islamic terror. To do anything meaningful about it, we would have to reverse the decline of the West. 
Islam originally spread into a vacuum created by civilizational decline. Civilizational decline is why it is rising once again. An obscure local terror group eventually turned into ISIS by filling a power vacuum. Even as Obama performs another touchdown dance, some other group will be making that same journey. Its mission will be the familiar one of replacing our civilization with its own. 
Until we come to terms with this civilizational struggle, we will go on fighting endless wars in the sand and coping with endless terror attacks in our own cities because we have failed to recognize the nature of the enemy. We are not fighting an acronym, whether it’s ISIS or ISIL; we are fighting an Islamic State. 
This is a war to determine whether the future will belong to the West or to Islam.",0

18200,U.N. Rights Expert Urges Nations Not to Sign ‘Flawed’ CETA Treaty,"For more information and media requests , please contact Mr. Thibaut Guillet (+41 22 917 9674 / ) or write to For media inquiries related to other UN independent experts: Xabier Celaya, UN Human Rights – Media Unit (+ 41 22 917 9383 / ) — U.N. Rights Expert Urges Nations Not to Sign ‘Flawed’ CETA Treaty GENEVA (28 October 2016) – The trade deal set to be signed by the European Union and Canada is a corporate-driven, fundamentally flawed treaty which should not be signed or ratified without a referendum in each country concerned, a United Nations human rights expert says. Alfred de Zayas, the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, deplored the pressures brought on the Belgian regional parliament of Wallonia, which initially said it would not approve the treaty but later said its concerns had been met. “A culture of bullying and intimidation becomes apparent when it comes to trade agreements that currently get priority over human rights,” the expert said. In his reports to the Human Rights Council and General Assembly Mr. de Zayas has previously warned that CETA is incompatible with the rule of law, democracy and human rights, and substantiated how and why before the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He believes that both CETA and TTIP – the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership currently being negotiated by the EU and the US – give undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human rights, and deplores that the mere existence of investor-state dispute settlement generates a regulatory chill. “The danger of CETA and TTIP being signed and one day entering into force is so serious that every stakeholder, especially parliamentarians from EU Member States, should now be given the opportunity to articulate the pros and cons. The corporate-driven agenda gravely endangers labour, health and other social legislation, and there is no justification to fast-track it” Mr. de Zayas said. “Civil society should demand referendums on the approval of CETA or any other such mega-treaty that has been negotiated behind closed doors,” he noted. The expert said the EU should have heeded expert warnings and strong civil society opposition to CETA. His specific concerns include provisions which he says could hamper States’ regulatory powers and could allow investment companies to sue over legislation affecting profits, even in cases where the laws were designed to protect workers’ rights, public health or the environment. States should not sign the agreement unless their powers to regulate and legislate in the public interest are fully safeguarded and the so-called “investment protection” chapter is removed. “This chapter creates privileges for investors at the expense of the public,” said Mr. de Zayas, noting that the new text may slightly amend this chapter but adding that the Investment Court System (ICS) is similarly incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which requires legal cases to be heard by transparent, accountable, independent public tribunals. “The associations of German and Spanish judges have already decried this kind of investor-State dispute settlement, which is a one-way street, and also discriminates against domestic enterprises, Moreover, ICS is not necessary when all participating States are parties to the ICCPR and already have public courts that are independent, transparent and accountable,” he said. “CETA – along with most trade and investment agreements – is fundamentally flawed unless specific provision stipulates that the regulatory power of States is paramount and must not be impacted by a regulatory chill. It must also be clear that in case of conflict between commercial treaties and human rights treaties, it is the latter that must prevail.” The expert said there was now a strengthened case for a legally binding instrument on corporate social responsibility, obliging transnational corporations not to interfere in the internal affairs of States, and imposing sanctions when they pollute the environment or shift their profits into tax havens. The Human Rights Council has established an inter-governmental working group on transnational corporations, which is holding its second session this week. Mr. de Zayas, who has participated in this working group, urges the prompt adoption of a treaty that makes the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights legally binding and enforceable. He also said it was time to discuss the secrecy surrounding the drawing up of the CETA treaty, and the anomaly that much of the information about it became available only through whistleblowers, in violation of State obligations to ensure open access to information. “The constitutionality of the CETA and TTIP agreements should be tested before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and the human rights aspects before the European Court of Human Rights, which could be called upon to issue interim measures of protection,” said Mr. de Zayas. “National courts should also test the compatibility of the agreements with national constitutions,” the Independent Expert stated. “There is a legitimate fear that CETA will dilute environmental standards, food security, and health and labour protection,” he said. “A treaty that strengthens the position of investors, transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of States to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats.” Mr. de Zayas said the EU should have paid greater attention to a warning from a committee of Members of Parliament from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The Committee on Social Affairs, Health and Sustainable Development said earlier this month that CETA imposed unacceptable restrictions on the legislative powers of national parliaments, and called for the signing to be postponed. NOTE TO EDITORS: The UN Independent Expert devoted his 2015 report to the UN Human Rights Council to the adverse human rights, health and environmental impacts of so-called free trade agreements such as CETA, TPP, TTIP and TISA.

18201,University of Chicago Strikes Back Against Campus Political Correctness - The New York Times,"The anodyne welcome letter to incoming freshmen is a college staple, but this week the University of Chicago took a different approach: It sent new students a blunt statement opposing some hallmarks of campus political correctness, drawing thousands of impassioned responses, for and against, as it caromed around cyberspace. “Our commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support   trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own,” John Ellison, dean of students, wrote to members of the class of 2020, who will arrive next month. It was a    rebuke to the protests calling for limits on what kinds of speech should be condoned on campus, and who should be allowed to speak, that have rocked Yale, Wesleyan, Oberlin and many other colleges and universities in recent years. Some alumni, dismayed by the trend, have withheld donations from their alma maters. The Chicago letter echoed policies that were already in place there and at a number of other universities calling for “the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. ” But its stark wording, coming from one of the nation’s leading universities, and in a routine correspondence that usually contains nothing more contentious than a dining hall schedule, felt to people on all sides like a statement. Kevin Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University in Des Moines, dismissed the letter on his website as “a manifesto looking for an audience,” one that “relies on caricature and bogeymen rather than reason and nuance. ” The Heritage Foundation wrote on Facebook that the letter “will make you stand up and cheer. ” Other universities have made similar statements, but the message from Chicago is “clearer and more direct than I’ve seen,” said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a leading critic of what it says are destructive speech restrictions at many campuses. “Sending a letter to freshmen is different than I’ve seen, at least in a long time, and certainly from a major university. ” Michael S. Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said the Chicago letter was, at least in part, a publicity stunt  —   “Gosh, is there any doubt?” he asked  —   and a way of “not coddling students, but coddling donors. ” Jeremy Manier, a University of Chicago spokesman, insisted there were no hidden motives behind the letter. And he said professors remained free, at their discretion, to use trigger warnings, the messages sometimes posted atop campus publications, assignments and other material, noting that they might be upsetting for people who have had traumatic experiences. Conservatives have been the loudest critics of campus political correctness, and hailed the Chicago statement as a victory. Mary Katharine Ham, a senior writer for The Federalist, a conservative website, wrote that it was “a sad commentary on higher education that this is considered a brave and bold move, but it is, and the University of Chicago should be applauded mightily for stating what used to be obvious. ” But while conservatives often frame campus free speech as a    issue, the dispute is often within the left. “Historically, the left has been much more protective of academic freedom than the right, particularly in the university context,” said Geoffrey R. Stone, a University of Chicago law professor who specializes in free speech issues. Conservatives “suddenly became the champions of free speech, which I find is a bit ironic, but the left is divided. ” Mr. Lukianoff said he and his group are often mistakenly called conservative, adding, “I’m a former A. C. L. U. person who worked in refugee camps. ” The dispute over free speech has ricocheted off campuses and around the country. In a commencement speech this year at Howard University, President Obama said: “Don’t try to shut folks out, don’t try to shut them down, no matter how much you might disagree with them. There’s been a trend around the country of trying to get colleges to disinvite speakers with a different point of view, or disrupt a politician’s rally. Don’t do that  —   no matter how ridiculous or offensive you might find the things that come out of their mouths. ” The University of Chicago has long been associated with the conservative school of economics that is named for it. It also takes pride in a history of free expression, like allowing the Communist Party candidate for president, William Z. Foster, to speak on the ornate   campus on the city’s South Side in 1932, despite fierce criticism. Mr. Obama taught constitutional law at the university law school. The university said Friday that Dean Ellision and the university president, Robert R. Zimmer, were not available to discuss the letter or what prompted it, but Mr. Manier referred queries to Professor Stone, a former university provost. Last year, a faculty Committee on Freedom of Expression, appointed by Dr. Zimmer and headed by Professor Stone,  produced a report stating that “it is not the proper role of the university to attempt to shield individuals from ideas and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even deeply offensive. ” “We didn’t feel we were doing something, internal to the University of Chicago, that was in any way radical or different,” Professor Stone said Friday. It is clear that some colleges are retreating from the same free speech values, he said, “but my guess, if you asked most of these institutions 10 or 20 years ago, they would have said more or less what we said in our statement. ” Since Professor Stone’s committee produced its report, several other universities, including Princeton, Purdue, Columbia and the University of Wisconsin system, have adopted similar policies or statements, some of them taken almost verbatim from the report. And this week’s letter to University of Chicago freshmen draws from that and specifically cites the report as embodying the university’s point of view. Many academics say the concerns reflected in the University of Chicago letter, while real, are overblown. “I asked faculty if any had ever been asked to give trigger warnings,” said Dr. Roth, of Wesleyan. “I think one person said they had. ” There often seems to be a generational divide on campus speech  —   young people demanding greater sensitivity, and their elders telling them to get thicker skins  —   but a survey by the Knight Foundation and Gallup gives a murkier picture. It found that 78 percent of college students said they preferred a campus “where students are exposed to all types of speech and viewpoints,” including offensive and biased speech, over a campus where such speech is prohibited. Students were actually more likely to give that response than adults generally. But when asked specifically about “slurs and other language on campus that is intentionally offensive to certain groups,” 69 percent of college students said that colleges should be allowed to impose restrictions on such expression. Eric Holmberg, the student body president at the University of Chicago, said the letter suggested that administrators “don’t understand what a trigger warning is,” and seemed “based on this false narrative of coddled millennials. ” “It’s an effort to frame any sort of activism on campus as    just young people who are upset,” Mr. Holmberg said, “when in reality I’d say the administration is far more fearful of challenge than any student I know. ” Sara Zubi, a Chicago junior majoring in public policy, said the dean’s letter seemed contrary to some of the support programs the university has created or endorsed, like a “safe space program” for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. “To say the university doesn’t support that is really hypocritical and contradictory,” she said, “and it also just doesn’t make sense. ”",0
18202,"Fighting Racism Where White Workers Are Hurting, Too","Fighting Racism Where White Workers Are Hurting, Too Fighting Racism Where White Workers Are Hurting, Too By 0 118 
Since 2011, Maine’s bombastic Republican governor Paul LePage has given America a taste of what it might be like to live under a Donald Trump presidency. 
Like Trump, LePage has made outrageous comments against immigrants and communities of color. They include telling the NAACP to “kiss my butt,” publicly complaining about “guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty” selling drugs and impregnating “young, white” girls , and blaming “illegals” for spreading diseases like HIV — all while cutting funding to cities that offered health care and other assistance to undocumented immigrants. 
After five years of LePage practicing an extreme form of wedge politics, people like Ben Chin are working to heal the resulting divisions in Maine. 
Chin, the 31-year-old grandson of an undocumented Chinese immigrant, has been working with the Maine People’s Alliance to rally support from white working class neighborhoods for a series of progressive ballot measures this November. (Photo: David McSpadden / Flickr) 
Countering the racist and nativist appeals of candidates like LePage and Trump, their goal is to get people to reject the politics of scapegoating immigrants and people of color and to instead focus on the real causes of — and solutions to — their economic distress. 
“We’re starting out a conversation in which we’re making it clear we’re on their side,” Chin said in a recent phone interview. “That’s the foundation that gets laid for whatever comes next.” 
These conversations are based on the research and experience of a broad range of grassroots organizations that have been struggling to get working-class white voters across the nation to see beyond the color line. 
Chin got a personal taste of division politics when he was racially caricatured during his 2015 run for mayor of Lewiston, Maine. During his campaign, a local businessman paid for billboards that said, “Don’t vote for Ho Chi Chin. Vote for more jobs not more welfare.” 
Since then, Chin’s turned his political focus to ballot initiatives that include increasing the state’s minimum wage and levying a 3 percent tax on household incomes over $200,000 a year. 
Chin and his fellow Maine People’s Alliance members don’t have a “silver bullet” set of talking points that disarms the people they encounter with racist or anti-immigrant attitudes. Instead, they focus on questions that get people to think about their economic anxieties in a deeper way. 
One question they ask is, “Why do you think some people are poor and other people are rich?” 
That opens up a discussion about the ways a small group of the wealthy and powerful are stacking the economic deck against ordinary people of all colors, with their black and brown neighbors feeling it the most because of America’s history of systemic racism. 
Chin said he was particularly struck by a recent conversation with a voter in Auburn, Maine. The voter was undecided about whether to support a referendum that would increase the state’s wage to $12 an hour by 2020. 
“One of his ideas was that ‘certain people’ were going to get a wage increase,” Chin said. “We tried to unpack that.” 
They talked about his life experiences and whether he really believed that increasing the minimum wage was about helping some “certain” group of undeserving freeloaders. 
Chin said that though this voter wasn’t a “raging justice activist” by the end of their conversation, he was more thoughtfully considering the minimum wage. 
Conversations like these are happening in many states around the country this election season, as progressives grapple with the mainstreaming of racist and nativist appeals by Trump and other far-right politicians. 
These types of empathetic conversations are the nemesis of the conservative-corporate elite who have engineered extreme wealth inequality and, for too many, the disappearance of the American dream. 
The last thing politicians who benefit from wedge politics want to see is working people across the nation transcending racial and cultural lines, and realizing those same politicians are the common source of their pain.",0
18203,"For Millennials, It’s Never Too Early to Save for Retirement - The New York Times","You have probably heard it yourself: the impression that millennials are financial freewheelers. The theory goes that today’s   or   spend with little regard for savings and even less regard for retiring. Retirement planning experts say that this assumption isn’t entirely accurate  —   though it is perennially true that most young adults don’t make retirement savings a financial priority. But, as the experts point out, millennials are in an ideal position to get started, because whatever they set aside will grow and accrue interest greatly over time. “The value of compounding means you’ll have to contribute less later,” said Maria Bruno, a senior investment strategist at Vanguard, the investment management company. She recommends that people open retirement accounts as early as they can  —   that way, the savings have more time to build and be reinvested. Eventually, the interest an account accrues will begin to earn interest of its own. The New York Times spoke to five people in the   to    age group, a small sample of millennial savers. Two experts from the retirement division of Prudential Financial offered advice and feedback on each person’s profile. Though advice differed based on the individual situation, advisers across the spectrum were consistent on two broader points: ■ Young investors should take advantage of Roth retirement fund options. Roth funds, which include individual retirement accounts and 401( k)’s, differ from traditional retirement accounts in that contributions are made after tax once money is invested, earnings and withdrawals are  . ■ Younger workers should contribute at least as much as an employer is willing to match in a 401( k) or similar program. With this advice in mind, read a snapshot of millennials at various stages of retirement planning. Mr. LaCasse doesn’t see himself jetting off to exotic destinations at the end of his career, but he does hope to have some financial security and independence. He makes about $52, 000 a year and contributes 4 percent of every paycheck to a 403( b) account  —   a retirement account primarily for teachers. His school does not match his contributions, but he did receive an initial,   contribution of $1, 200. He currently has about $6, 000 in a savings account he doesn’t touch, and he puts away a little from every paycheck. Though he would like to save more, Mr. LaCasse worries that he is not in a secure enough position to do so. “There’s kind of a feeling of short term versus long term, and unfortunately the short term comes first  —   I need to cover my    expenses,” he said. “The long term takes a major back seat. ” For one thing, student loan repayments (of nearly $500 a month) represent about a fifth of his monthly expenses and hinder his ability to squirrel away more.  THE ADVICE Stephanie Sherman, a certified financial planner at Prudential, said that Mr. LaCasse might be able to restructure his student loans to give himself more breathing room. “If he has a great credit score, he can refinance them and make the same payment and pay them off quicker, or free up more money for savings,” she said. Mr. LaCasse said he had already considered refinancing and was thinking about it more seriously after hearing Ms. Sherman’s advice. “The process seems so daunting, and it keeps getting pushed aside,” he said. “Now I feel more motivated to do it. ” If she is able to break into theater or film, Ms. Craven would like to keep working for a lifetime. “As an actor, I’m going to want to tell stories and do that as long as I can,” she said. Even so, she hopes by her late 60s or early 70s to prioritize family time and traveling. Though she has never had a job with retirement benefits, she would be comfortable putting aside 5 to 10 percent of her $45, 000 income on her own. She already has $7, 500 in savings, but not in a formal retirement account. Her main concern is seasonal fluctuations in her salary that could derail a   savings plan. “I’m in a very busy season for work right now, so I’m making more money, but once the tourists go away, it’ll be back to scraping by,” Ms. Craven said. THE ADVICE Ms. Craven said she felt she wasn’t doing enough to save for retirement, but the experts saw things differently. “Mollie sounds like she has it all together,” Ms. Sherman said, noting how much she already has in savings. She didn’t deny that seasonal income fluctuations were a challenge, but said that there were many ways to plan around them. She suggested that Ms. Craven find a financial adviser to develop a personalized strategy and perhaps open an independent retirement account. Ms. Sherman also explained that many people in the entertainment field built retirement benefit credits through organizations that they worked for, but that these benefits were not always well advertised to contractors. Ms. Craven said that she was fairly certain she had not accrued retirement credits through her performances, but was interested in finding an adviser and considering a formal retirement account. “It does seem disheartening that the savings account that I have just sits there and doesn’t grow hardly at all, maybe a cent every month or so,” she said. “I’d love to put some of that away and not touch it. ” Although he has worked at his current company, Redwood Logistics, for more than three years, Mr. Ruger has been hesitant to invest in its 401( k). “It’s such a millennial thing, but I don’t want to have to commit to a job,” he said. His career goal is to wind up on Broadway. And while he does some singing gigs on the side, the older he gets, the less likely he figures he is to start a   acting career. He doesn’t have a definite vision for his retirement, either. “If I’m being totally honest, I never saw myself as having that option,” Mr. Ruger said. He has a few thousand dollars in a checking account, but no specific savings. He also has a lot of college debt. “We’re paying off these crazy student loans with these crazy interest rates,” Mr. Ruger said. “Stuff that requires money  —   like houses and cars and retirement  —   are not in the cards. We can just pay off the interest on our student loans and our rent, and work until we die. ” Further on the topic of his company’s 401( k) Mr. Ruger said he was unsure how the plan worked and worried about losing his investment if he ever left the job. THE ADVICE Crystal Vacura, a retirement counselor at Prudential, said that Mr. Ruger’s feelings were not uncommon: Many people are hesitant to invest in a 401( k) for reasons like procrastination or confusion. She pointed out to Mr. Ruger that 401( k) contributions could usually stay invested in the original fund or could roll over into new accounts if he switched employers or went freelance. She also suggested that Mr. Ruger put aside all of the earnings from his singing gigs into a dedicated savings account: If he is really not comfortable with a   401( k) he should consider opening an I. R. A. she said. Mr. Ruger particularly liked Mrs. Vacura’s suggestion of investing the money he earned from singing, and said that if he had to choose between a 401( k) and an I. R. A. “I’d go with getting my act together and opening a retirement account through my job, because they offer one, and it’s ridiculous that I haven’t done that yet. ” As a state employee, Ms. King is eligible to invest in the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, and she anticipates staying with her employer for the duration. “I hope to retire at some point  —   my expectation is, after 30 years of service,” she said. “Because I am working for a public institution, 30 years is pretty much the standard. ” She has been in her current role for only three years, but was able to start contributing to Opers (the acronym for the Ohio retirement system) as a student employee and already has $15, 000 in her account. Though she has no other formal savings, Ms. King owns a house and contributes 10 percent of her $   salary to the account, with the university contributing an additional 14 percent. Ms. King is paying off student loans but expects to be   by the end of the winter, at which point she will be able to diversify her savings plan and increase her contributions by as much as 25 or 50 percent. THE ADVICE “Cherita certainly seems   on paying off her student loans,” Ms. Sherman said. “She also seems very focused on redirecting that to increasing her retirement savings. ” Ms. Sherman and Ms. Vacura agreed that Ms. King was in a good position for retirement, though they recommended that she open a separate “rainy day” savings account. Ms. King said the rainy day fund was her next priority after paying off her student loans. And she was happy her efforts had won good reviews. “It’s validating to hear that people who know about finance are saying I’m on the right track,” she said. Ms. Hamilton has been planning for her retirement since she was 17. “I took a class in high school, and they showed me the building of compounding interest,” she said. That prompted her to get a weekend job and put her earnings into an I. R. A. which has grown to about $30, 000. She also has a separate 401( k) through her employer, with a similar amount invested. “I want to work really hard now and save really hard so I can travel the world and not have to worry about finances” in retirement, Ms. Hamilton said. Her husband is a strong partner in her savings plan. When they married last year, they agreed to live on a single income and put the rest into savings: They already have more than $100, 000. Ms. Hamilton is very reluctant to touch her primary income for anything beyond basic necessities. When the time came to buy new furniture, she got a weekend job at Restoration Hardware to cover the expense. THE ADVICE Ms. Sherman of Prudential said that while Ms. Hamilton would seem to be a model of thrift, she could be even more proactive, perhaps by buying life insurance or opening a   retirement savings plan. “Really start to address the things that could derail your retirement, as you’re a fabulous saver,” she suggested. Ms. Hamilton said that her personal financial adviser gave similar feedback and that she was encouraged to be receiving such consistent advice about reaching her goals. “I may not make a million dollars a year, but I feel like I can one day hopefully have a retirement that’s comparable,” she said.",0
18204,"Gorka: ‘Forgotten Man’ Was Given a Voice on November 8, and the Media Can’t Stand It","Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Trump and former national security editor for Breitbart News, joined SiriusXM host Lee Stranahan for Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily. [Stranahan brought up the outrageous allegation by a   blogger that Gorka was a Nazi sympathizer, based on a medal he was seen wearing. The false story was eagerly repeated, without the slightest bit of   by Chelsea Clinton and the Southern Poverty Law Center, among others.  “My parents escaped Communist Hungary in 1956,” Gorka recalled. “My father actually escaped from a prison, a Communist prison, because he was an   and he had been betrayed and given a life sentence at the age of 20. In exile, he was awarded a medal  —   it’s the Order of the Vitez  —   for his resistance to dictatorship in Hungary. ”  “That Order, for some people, because it is associated with the regent, Admiral Horthy, they think that makes my father, who escaped from a Communist prison, a fascist, and, therefore, ” he explained. “It’s never about policies, Lee. It’s always about attacking the individual,” Gorka told Stranahan. “My father was tortured in the basement of what used to be the Nazi secret police headquarters, at the age of twenty. He was tortured by Communists who, just a few years before, had been members of the Arrow Cross. That’s the irony of central Europe. A lot of fascists became Communists. ” “Remember, on the radical Left, facts are optional. I am on TV. I’ve been a vocal supporter of President Trump during the campaign. They have to attack me. It’s about Steve Bannon. It’s about Jared Kushner. It’s about General Mike Flynn. It’s not about the policies. It’s not about the substance. It’s about ad hominem attacks. If you want to be effective, it’s about triangulation and isolation. That’s all it is, Lee. You know it better than anybody,” Gorka said. “The irony is, the first person who wrote this article about me was allegedly fired from his last employer for     attitudes,” he noted. “That’s the reality. You read my book, Defeating Jihad. It’s about how Israel is our closest ally. Not only that, I have said, for me, groups like ISIS and   are the new fascists. The linkage between groups that burn people alive, that behead people because they have the wrong passport, the linkage between them and the Communist and the fascists is the same. They’re all totalitarians. One of them may have worshiped Karl Marx. The other may have worshiped the Aryan purity and Mein Kampf. These people are totalitarians, as well, groups like ISIS. They’re just doing it in the name of their version of Islam. ” Gorka agreed with Stranahan that attacks on Trump administration officials like himself are actually attacks on his “audience. ” “It has to have that broader connection. Why? Because what I’ve seen in the last     weeks of us being in office is all we have is a majority of the media reporting reflects one thing, Lee: they cannot believe, refuse to believe, what happened on November the 8th. The American people spoke. The ‘forgotten man’ was given a voice. And they can’t stand it, Lee. ”  “As a result, what President Trump stands for must be attacked day in and day out. It’s not about policies. Remember, we never talk about Russia policy. It’s about who bugged Mike Flynn, and what he said to the vice president. It’s never about policy. It’s never about ISIS. It’s the classic attack, Lee: ‘When did you stop beating your wife?’ Remember? That’s what they’re doing,” he said.

18206,From an Anchor’s Lips to Trump’s Ears to Sweden’s Disbelief - The New York Times,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   On Friday night, Fox News aired an alarming   segment in which the host, Tucker Carlson, interviewed a documentary filmmaker about a crisis of violence in Sweden ignited by the recent wave of Muslim migration. “The government has gone out of its way to try to cover up some of these problems,” declared Ami Horowitz, the filmmaker. “That is grotesque,” Mr. Carlson responded. One of his viewers agreed, and in that moment was born a diplomatic incident that illustrates the unusual approach that President Trump takes to foreign policy, as well as the influence that television can have on his thinking. After watching the program, Mr. Trump threw a line into a speech the next day suggesting that a terrorist attack had occurred in Sweden the night before. Just like that, without white papers, intelligence reports, an interagency meeting or, presumably, the advice of his secretary of state, the president started a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization and called it false. The president’s only discernible goal was to make the case domestically for his plans to restrict entry to the United States. The Swedes were flabbergasted. “We are used to seeing the president of the U. S. as one of the most   persons in the world, also well aware of the importance of what he says,” Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden, said by email on Monday. “And then, suddenly, we see him engaging in misinformation and slander against a truly friendly country, obviously relying on sources of a quality that at best could be described as dubious. ” While aides sought to clarify that Mr. Trump’s remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general, rather than any particular event or attack, the president chose to escalate. In a Twitter post on Monday, he accused American journalists of glossing over a dark and dangerous situation in Sweden. “Give the public a break,” he wrote. “The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, responded hours later at a news conference, noting that Sweden ranks highly on international comparisons of economic competitiveness and human development. “We have challenges, no doubt about that,” he allowed. But he added pointedly, “We must all take responsibility for using facts correctly and for verifying anything we spread. ” Sweden is hardly the first American friend to find itself uncomfortably at odds with the new president. Mexico’s president canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump over his plans to build a border wall and bill the United States’ southern neighbor for it. Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Australia’s prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly. But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains, processes and uses information differently from any modern president. He watches television at night and tends to incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed, speeches and interviews. “It begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration’s global approach,” said Mark Brzezinski, the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama. “To do so in an improvisational way, based on snippets picked up from cable news, is a major mistake. ” Immigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden, Germany and many other European countries. Sweden, which prides itself as a humanitarian leader, processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications in 2015. But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave. Preliminary data released last month by Sweden’s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups. Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods. “Immigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime  —   but that’s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it’s something we can live with,” he said. “I know everybody won’t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell. ” Although terrorism is a concern for Sweden  —   an   Swede blew himself up in central Stockholm in 2010  —   the authorities say they are equally worried about racist hate crimes, including attacks on migrants. The Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, “Stockholm Syndrome,” depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries. In the Fox interview, Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does. “They’ll make excuses for it,” he said. “The majority of the population in Sweden still wants to have an   policy. It’s confounding. ” Mr. Trump was clearly struck by the interview, and he cited Sweden at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday as he argued for stronger borders. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. “Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. ” Aides later said “last night” referred to the Fox program, not to an episode the night before. Mr. Carlson argued on Monday that although “the president ought to be precise in what he says, there should be no confusion about what he means. ” Mr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was “in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening. ” Critics of Sweden’s migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden’s pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults. “Half of the suspects we cannot even be sure of because they don’t have any valid papers,” he wrote. “Most often this means they are lying about their country of origin and identity. ” But the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Monday quoted two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom, as saying that the filmmaker had selectively edited and distorted their comments to prove his thesis. They said that Mr. Horowitz had asked them about   neighborhoods and that they did not agree with his argument about links between migration and crime. “We don’t stand behind what he says,” Mr. Goranzon said. “He is a madman. ” Mr. Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment, but he went back on Mr. Carlson’s show on Monday night to defend his work, citing crime statistics and asserting that the police officers had recanted because they were under pressure. “My record stands for itself,” he said, “and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. ”",0
18207,Arson Suspected at Mosque That Orlando Nightclub Gunman Attended - The New York Times,"The members of the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce had broken their fasts and left the mosque near Florida’s eastern shoreline. In the waning minutes of Sunday, less than an hour later, a surveillance camera recorded a man as he approached the mosque. Then came a flash as flames damaged the house of worship where the man who attacked an Orlando, Fla. nightclub often prayed. The authorities, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were investigating the fire as a potential hate crime, even as officials cautioned that they remained uncertain about the motive. The blaze occurred on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and nearly three months after Omar Mateen opened fire at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. It also happened around the beginning of Eid   a Muslim holiday. “Today was supposed to be a day of this community exchanging gifts with their kids, visiting their family members, having dinners, having lunches,” Wilfredo Ruiz, a spokesman for the mosque, said at a Monday afternoon news conference in Fort Pierce, Fla. “Instead, they needed to go to another place to worship. ” No one was injured in the attack, and the St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office sought help identifying the suspect, whom the authorities described as a white or Hispanic male. Video showed the man arriving at the mosque, which is in a former Presbyterian church, about 11:38 p. m. on Sunday, appearing to carry paper and a bottle of some type of liquid. The camera recorded a flash, presumably when the fire ignited, and the man waved his arms, perhaps from a burn, before he fled on a motorcycle. Officials refused to speculate about a connection between the fire and the anniversary of the terrorist attack. A spokesman for the Sheriff’s Office, Bryan Beaty, declined to discuss whether Mr. Mateen’s ties to the mosque might have prompted the fire. With its painted star and crescent, palm trees and occasional protester outside, the Sunni mosque is central to Islamic life in Fort Pierce, a city of around 44, 000 people about an hour’s drive north of Palm Beach. Yet it has also been a hub of controversy, drawing attention twice in recent years as a place where young men who staged attacks had worshiped. In addition to Mr. Mateen, who was killed during the siege at Pulse, which left 49 other people dead, the Islamic Center was a frequent stop for Moner Mohammad Abusalha, who carried out a 2014 suicide bombing in Syria. (The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, said the men had known each other “casually. ”) In June, the Islamic Center’s imam, Syed Shafeeq Rahman, distanced himself and the mosque from Mr. Mateen and, more generally, from extremist ideology. “There is nothing that he is hearing from me to do killing, to do bloodshed, to do anything, because we never talk like that,” the imam said of Mr. Mateen. The mosque, like many in the United States, has expressed concerns about security and the commitment of the local authorities to protect its members and property. Tensions mounted in July after the authorities arrested a    man they said had repeatedly punched someone who had been at the Islamic Center to pray. The case is pending in the local circuit court, where a prosecutor said in a filing last month that the accused man had “evidenced prejudice” during the attack. Mr. Beaty said deputies had also investigated two suspicious vehicles and a harassing phone call at the mosque since the June 12 attack in Orlando. The fire at the Islamic Center is at least the third suspected arson at a Florida mosque this summer. A Tampa mosque was targeted twice in less than 24 hours last month, and a spokesman for the city’s Fire Department, Jason A. Penny, said Monday that the inquiry there remained active. In Fort Pierce on Monday, people responded to the attack with a mix of outrage and sadness. “An attack on any house of worship is an attack on all houses of worship,” said Ahmed Bedier, a Muslim activist in Florida. “It’s unacceptable. ”",0
18208,"Illegal Immigration Fell 67 Percent under Trump, Says Fmr. Border Chief","During Congressional testimony Tuesday, a former federal border commissioner claimed that illegal immigration across the Mexican border is progressively dropping each month since the inauguration of Donald Trump. [David V. Aguilar, former U. S. Border Patrol and acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee that March 2017 figures he reviewed indicate illegal border crossings are down 67 percent, according to The Washington Times. By comparison, February statistics indicating the number of illegal alien apprehensions fell 40 percent.  “It’s actually up to 67 percent drop compared to last year,” Aguilar told the Senate committee. The former Border Patrol chief explained that similar decreases occurred during the Reagan Administration but later spiked in the decades to follow. Mr. Aguilar’s Capitol Hill comments were not immediately verified by U. S. Customs and Border Protection. The retired law enforcer’s statement does, however, follow news previously reported by Breitbart Texas related to the mothballing of temporary holding facilities for the   surge of migrants throughout 2016. In   a Rio Grande Valley Sector facility near the   Bravo International Bridge was closed after the prior month’s Family Unit Aliens (FMUA) and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) border apprehensions exhibited   tumbles. Days later, Breitbart Texas reported on a second overflow facility closure located about 40 miles east of El Paso. Both plants were placed in “warm standby” status capable of reversal in less than 24 hours. March 2017 figures have not yet been released by CBP.

18209,Trump Era Invites a Bolder Hollywood Red Carpet - The New York Times,"At last weekend’s round of movie and television awards, doled out by the producers’ and actors’ guilds, the likes of John Legend and Julia   among others, swung hard at President Trump and his travel ban, to rapturous applause. The friendly reception to hostile fire represented a departure for awards shows, where political acceptance speeches have elicited reactions from eye rolls to noisy dissent. In 1973, the Native American actress and activist Sacheen Littlefeather was met with jeers and later, she said, Hollywood blacklisting after Marlon Brando sent her to refuse an Oscar on his behalf. After Vanessa Redgrave, a supporter of Palestinian rights, deplored “Zionist hoodlums” while accepting her Oscar in 1978, the screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky drew hearty applause for upbraiding “people exploiting the occasion of the Academy Awards for the propagation of their own personal political propaganda. ” Boos rained down on Michael Moore, winner of the 2003 documentary prize, for tearing into George W. Bush’s newly started Iraq war. Getting political at the Oscars was risky, and the assorted causes were always scattershot. But now Hollywood finds itself in 2017. If current trends hold, using stage time at the Academy Awards to take a stand won’t be just de rigueur, but expected. Mr. Trump’s travel ban, along with his combative rhetoric and internet outbursts, have directly shaped this year’s awards race. And Hollywood’s ever more polarized   with him has imbued the season with a heightened sense of both superfluousness and purpose. On the one hand, against a backdrop of geopolitical unrest, the monthslong circuit has felt, to whiskered campaigners, especially frivolous. On the other hand, stars are using the spotlight to broadcast their resistance, starting with Meryl Streep at the Golden Globes. Not everyone wants to hear actors bang on about politics, and audience reception depends on political bent. Many in America who are supportive of Mr. Trump already feel alienated by “Hollywood elites,” and might not be tuning in to the Oscars anyway. But as public arts funding is threatened with cuts, and Mr. Trump unveils other contentious policies, many actors suddenly feel that they must speak out, even if they’re preaching to a choir eager to lap up their every word. Matters came to a head when the travel ban went into chaotic effect over the weekend. One Oscar contender who was immediately affected was the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose drama “The Salesman” is up for the Academy Award for best   film. (His “A Separation” won in 2012.) Now he’s subject to the ban, which sharply limits travel from seven   countries. Mr. Farhadi said that even if he were granted an exemption to travel, he wouldn’t attend. “To humiliate one nation with the pretext of guarding the security of another is not a new phenomenon in history and has always laid the groundwork for the creation of future divide and enmity,” Mr. Farhadi said in a statement. He went on to condemn “the unjust conditions” the order had forced upon citizens of the seven nations. Will this affect Mr. Farhadi’s Oscar chances? You betcha. Not only has the fracas raised the visibility of his film, but it has also made voting for it a political act. The same goes for the nominated documentary short “The White Helmets,” about civilian Syrian rescuers. One of the film’s subjects and a cameraman were to attend the Oscars, according to the filmmakers, but now are shut out, too. The   Swedish actress, Bahar Pars, a star in the Swedish entry “A Man Called Ove,” has said that  she is determined to attend as a statement but that details were still being sorted out. The ban, which the United Nations says has imperiled 20, 000 refugees, also stands to raise the profile of nominated films that explore migrants’ plight, like the documentary feature “Fire at Sea” and the shorts “Watani: My Homeland” and The New York Times’s   “4. 1 Miles. ” As widespread protests roiled airports last weekend, there were questions in Hollywood about whether speakers and winners would take aim at Mr. Trump at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday. Ms. Streep had already set a precedent at the Golden Globes in January: She publicly castigated Mr. Trump for being a bully. If that speech increased her chances at landing an Oscar nomination for her role in “Florence Foster Jenkins”  —   and Hollywood chatter holds that it totally did  —   Mr. Trump sealed the deal. His tweet the next day, calling her one of Hollywood’s “most overrated actresses,” fell smack in the middle of the voting window for Oscar nominations. And, lo, a few weeks later, Ms. Streep became a   Oscar nominee. But she’s Meryl Streep, occupying the tippy top of Hollywood’s living pantheon. Awards strategists rarely want their clients to get political, for it could cost them their audiences, especially in red states. While this might not matter much for this season’s smaller films like “Moonlight” or “Loving,” it could hurt films with bigger   ambitions, or television shows with outspoken stars. This year, though, Hollywood doesn’t seem keen to hold back. At the Producers Guild Awards, presenters and winners emphasized religious freedom, empathy and diversity. Mr. Legend, a presenter at the PGAs and a star of “La La Land,” said he and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, had wrestled with attending given the larger national controversy afoot, and then drew cheers for declaring, “Our vision of America is directly antithetical to that of President Trump. ” Then came the SAG Awards, which are way more lustrous, for they dole out prizes to glamorous actors and are televised. If the night’s winners were not emboldened by, erm, Ashton Kutcher, who kicked off the ceremony by welcoming “everyone in airports that belong in my America,” they surely were by the first winner, Ms.  . A member of Hollywood royalty, and clearly comfortable in the spotlight as well as in her own skin, Ms.   made the political personal by revealing that her father had fled religious persecution in   France and by denouncing the immigrant ban as “ . ” This opened the door, making it O. K. for those who followed to speak out. And they did: Sarah Paulson, Bryan Cranston, Lily Tomlin, Emma Stone, David Harbour and Taraji P. Henson all made assorted impassioned pleas. The classiest one came from Mahershala Ali (“Moonlight”) who, in a quavering voice, spoke of how he and his Christian mother had overcome their differences after he converted to Islam 17 years ago. Mr. Ali is favored to win the Oscar for best supporting actor, and his speech, perhaps the night’s most quietly profound, all but made that certain. If there was one consequence Mr. Trump probably didn’t foresee from his travel ban, it would be helping a Muslim American secure an Academy Award. Whether all of this portends a night of politicizing come the Academy Awards, on Feb. 26, depends on whether controversies set off by the White House or incendiary executive tweets settle down in the next three weeks. Will things calm down? Inshallah.",0
18210,’Hamilton’ Producer Lin-Manuel Miranda ’Sobbing’ After Obama Frees Domestic Terrorist Oscar Lopez Rivera,"Hamilton producer   Miranda is “sobbing with gratitude. ” Why? Because President Obama announced his decision to free Oscar Lopez Rivera, a Puerto Rican domestic terrorist serving 55 years in prison. [Rivera was a leader of the FALN   Puerto Rico terrorist group who claimed responsibility for more than 120 bombings, including the bombing of a New York bar that killed four people in 1975 and wounded 60 others.  Rivera’s freedom is a cause for leftist Latinos, something that Senator Bernie Sanders seized during his presidential campaign to rally Latino activists. “Oscar Lopez Rivera has served 34 years in prison for his commitment to Puerto Rico’s independence,” Sanders wrote on Twitter in May 2016. “I say to President Obama: let him out. ” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also celebrated Rivera’s freedom on Twitter. “Thank you @POTUS for freeing #OscarLopezRivera,” he wrote in English and Spanish. “Congratulations to all who fought for this day. ” Rep. Luis Gutierrez was also emotional about the news. “I am overjoyed and overwhelmed with emotion,” he said in a statement calling Rivera a “national hero. ” “It will be a blessed day when I can walk and talk with my friend in the fresh air, far from prison walls, and I am so looking forward to that day,” Gutierrez continued. According to the White House, Rivera was serving prison time for the following crimes after FBI officials discovered dynamite and blasting caps in his apartment: “I have no regrets for what I’ve done in the Puerto Rico independence movement,” Rivera said in 1998. “The onus is not on us. The crime is colonialism. ” Thanks to Obama, Rivera’s prison term will expire on May 17, 2017, allowing him to walk free.",0

18212,"Critics See Stephen Bannon, Trump’s Pick for Strategist, as Voice of Racism - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   A fierce chorus of critics denounced   Donald J. Trump on Monday for appointing Stephen K. Bannon, a nationalist media mogul, to a top White House position, even as President Obama described Mr. Trump as “pragmatic,” not ideological, and held out hope that he would rise to the challenge of the presidency. “It’s important for us to let him make his decisions,” Mr. Obama said. “The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see. ” Mr. Obama’s conciliatory remarks disappointed supporters who had hoped that he would add his voice to the criticism of the   for naming Mr. Bannon as his chief strategist. Civil rights groups, senior Democrats and some Republican strategists have assailed Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, will bring   nationalist and racist views to the West Wing. In the midst of the furor over Mr. Bannon’s appointment, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, emerged as a leading candidate to be secretary of state, according to people familiar with the deliberations in the   office in Trump Tower where Mr. Trump was ensconced throughout the day. That would make Mr. Giuliani, a contentious former prosecutor, the president’s emissary to a turbulent world. There has been intense jockeying among several of Mr. Trump’s   campaign advisers, suggesting a competition to lead the new administration’s foreign policy, national security and   agencies. Mr. Trump is also considering naming Mr. Giuliani or Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as the next attorney general, according to the people familiar with the discussions. But Mr. Giuliani said Monday night at a Wall Street Journal election forum that he would not be going to the Justice Department. And if Mr. Sessions, a relentless critic of illegal immigration, is nominated for attorney general, he can expect opponents to bring up the fact that he was once rejected for a federal judgeship after officials testified that he had made racist comments. Mr. Giuliani seems more eager to be secretary of state, though John R. Bolton, a fierce foreign policy hawk who served as ambassador to the United Nations and under secretary of state under President George W. Bush, is also under consideration, the people familiar with the discussions said. Richard Grenell, who was Mr. Bolton’s spokesman at the United Nations, is being considered as ambassador there. People with knowledge of the process described a series of chaotic discussions and said Mr. Trump might also choose Mr. Giuliani or Mr. Sessions to lead the Department of Homeland Security, though neither has expressed interest in that job. In 1986, before Mr. Sessions became a senator himself, a   Senate rejected his nomination by President Ronald Reagan to a federal judgeship. Several United States attorneys testified that he had made racist comments, including calling an   lawyer “boy,” and that he had been hostile to civil rights cases. Mr. Sessions denied making most of the remarks, but apologized for once saying that he had thought the Ku Klux Klan was O. K. until he heard that some members smoked pot he called it a joke. As for Mr. Bolton, he was known in the Bush administration for his conservative and sometimes confrontational views. Before his nomination as United Nations ambassador, he once said of the   United Nations building in New York, “If it lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference. ” If named to Mr. Trump’s cabinet, Mr. Bolton could clash with the president on Russia: He has accused the Obama administration of being weak in that area and recently wrote in favor of NATO membership for Ukraine, a move that would infuriate Moscow. Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Monday with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and according to a statement released by the Kremlin, the two men agreed “on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations” and vowed to improve them. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment on reports of the leading contenders for cabinet posts. But Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser, defended Mr. Bannon in brief remarks to reporters in New York, describing him as the “general of this campaign” and saying that “people should look at the full résumé. ” “He has got a Harvard business degree. He’s a naval officer. He has success in entertainment,” Ms. Conway said, calling him a “brilliant tactician. ” Ms. Conway denied that Mr. Bannon had a connection to   nationalists or that he would bring those views to the White House. “I’m personally offended that you think I would manage a campaign where that would be one of the going philosophies,” she said. Mr. Bannon has said that while there are fringe elements associated with the   nationalist movement, his critics are painting with too broad a brush. “These people are patriots,” he said. “They love their country. They just want their country taken care of. ” Even as Mr. Trump works to fill his administration, his team has yet to begin the real work of transitioning to the helm of the government because they have not completed the necessary paperwork. White House officials said Monday that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was in charge of Mr. Trump’s transition team until Friday, had signed a memorandum of understanding that ensured confidentiality. But Mr. Christie was dismissed on Friday and replaced by Vice   Mike Pence, invalidating the agreement and leaving the transition process in a state of suspended animation. At a news conference before leaving on a weeklong trip to Greece, Germany and Peru, Mr. Obama appeared to be doing his best to give Mr. Trump space as he begins forming his administration. The president also continued his efforts to persuade Mr. Trump to preserve his legacy, pointedly reminding him that repealing the Affordable Care Act could be politically unpopular and that ripping up global agreements like the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accord would be difficult. Mr. Obama refused to say whether he still considered Mr. Trump unfit to sit in the Oval Office and have access to the nuclear codes, and equated Mr. Trump’s shortcomings with his own troubles organizing paperwork on his desk. The closest he came to criticizing Mr. Trump was when he said the   would have to temper his impulses to make explosive comments and lie once he was sworn in. “There are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them,” Mr. Obama said. “I think he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people. ” Congressional Republicans remained largely silent about the appointment of Mr. Bannon, choosing instead to praise Mr. Trump’s choice of Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, as the new White House chief of staff. In remarks to reporters, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican majority leader in the House, said he would “not prejudge” Mr. Trump’s choice. But critics of Mr. Bannon continued to raise questions about his background and his tenure as the chairman of Breitbart News. A 2011 radio interview surfaced in which Mr. Bannon praised Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin by saying they were not “a bunch of dykes that came from the Seven Sisters schools up in New England. ” “That drives the left insane,” he added, “and that’s why they hate these women. ” The Council on   Relations said the selection of Mr. Bannon “sends the disturbing message that   conspiracy theories and white nationalist ideology will be welcome in the White House. ” That view was echoed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups and said Mr. Trump “should rescind this hire. ” “In his victory speech, Trump said he intended to be president for ‘all Americans,’” the center said. “Bannon should go. ” Republicans who had long opposed Mr. Trump’s candidacy also took to Twitter on Sunday night and Monday morning to warn that his choice to rely on the advice of Mr. Bannon was an indication of the way he would govern. “The racist, fascist extreme right is represented footsteps from the Oval Office,” said John Weaver, a Republican strategist who ran the presidential campaign of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and previously advised Senator John McCain of Arizona. “Be very vigilant, America. ” But people close to Mr. Bannon came to his defense. Joel B. Pollak, an author and editor at Breitbart, called him an “American patriot who also defends Israel and has deep empathy for the Jewish people. ” Jewish leaders and supporters of Israel expressed alarm at Mr. Bannon’s appointment, pointing to   writings on the Breitbart website. “In his roles as editor of the Breitbart website and as a strategist in the Trump campaign, Mr. Bannon was responsible for the advancement of ideologies antithetical to our nation, including   misogyny, racism and Islamophobia,” said Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, the director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism. “There should be no place for such views in the White House. ” Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, accused Mr. Bannon’s critics of sour grapes. On Twitter, he wrote that Mr. Bannon should embrace the criticism from the Council on   Relations, or CAIR. “Critics of Steve Bannon know he’s smarter and tougher than they are,” Mr. Huckabee wrote. “When CAIR doesn’t like you, that is a good thing. ”",0
18213,Group’s Tactic on Hillary Clinton: Sue Her Again and Again - The New York Times,"In between her extensive debate prep and her final, frenzied bid to raise money and win over voters, Hillary Clinton has had to carve out time to answer 25 detailed questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The questions came not from the F. B. I. which has closed its investigation into the issue, or from Congress, or even from a news outlet. They came from a nonprofit organization called Judicial Watch. If the 2016 election has brought forward a new generation of Clinton antagonists  —   WikiLeaks, Breitbart, Russia  —   it has also reintroduced America to an old one. Judicial Watch was one of the Clintons’ original tormentors, a charter member of what Mrs. Clinton famously called a “vast   conspiracy” to destroy her and her husband by seizing on any potential scandal. The organization filed its first lawsuit against the Clintons shortly after its formation in 1994, and it pretty much never stopped. It is currently the plaintiff in more than 20 suits involving Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee. “People always used to say to me, ‘What are you going to do when the Clintons leave? ’” Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said in an interview. “Well, the Clintons never really left. ” Neither has Judicial Watch, the indefatigable Clinton adversary that has probably done more than any other individual or organization to create the narrative that Mrs. Clinton is still battling: that she is untrustworthy. It is a narrative that her Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump, has tried to exploit at every turn, whether he was labeling her “Crooked Hillary,” saying there was something “very fishy” about the suicide of her former law partner, Vincent W. Foster Jr. or suggesting that she might be concealing serious health problems. Judicial Watch’s strategy is simple:   the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits. A vast majority are dismissed. But Judicial Watch caught a break last year, when revelations about Mrs. Clinton’s private email server prompted two judges to reopen two of the group’s cases connected to her tenure as secretary of state. The lawsuits have since led to the release of hundreds of Mrs. Clinton’s emails  —   which have, in turn, spurred dozens of news releases and   letters from Judicial Watch that hype the significance of these documents, while putting them in the least flattering light possible for Mrs. Clinton. The group’s lawyers were given permission to depose several of her senior aides from her time at the State Department. What is more, Mrs. Clinton herself will have to answer 25 detailed questions about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. The questions, some with multiple parts, ask her to explain her rationale for using the private server and her reaction to warnings about the potential for security breaches, among other things. Her answers, to be provided via written testimony to the court, are due by Thursday. Just getting this far has represented a victory for Judicial Watch, which operates out of a nondescript office building in the shadow of the Capitol. Suing the government, repeatedly, is an expensive proposition Judicial Watch has an annual budget of about $35 million that pays for close to 50 employees  —   a mix of lawyers, investigators and  . Mr. Fitton says the group receives donations from nearly 400, 000 individuals and institutions every year. One of its biggest funders, according to public filings, is the Sarah Scaife Foundation, which was created by the banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife, who died in 2014. In the 1990s, Mr. Scaife was one of the leading financiers of the   effort to bring down the Clintons, bankrolling conservative think tanks and publications  —   as well as Judicial Watch. Litigiousness is in the organization’s DNA: Its founder, Larry Klayman, once sued his mother. Mr. Klayman has described himself as a conservative Ralph Nader, but during Bill Clinton’s presidency, he often behaved more like a   Kenneth W. Starr, papering Washington with subpoenas related to every   Clinton scandal. His departure from the organization in 2003 was accompanied, unsurprisingly, by litigation: Mr. Klayman accused the organization, and his successor, Mr. Fitton, of “fraud, disparagement, defamation, false advertising and other egregious acts. ” Mr. Fitton responded that the allegations were “full of lies and distortions. ” The suit is still in the courts. Since he took over in 2003, Mr. Fitton has sought mainstream respectability for the organization. It describes itself as a “nonpartisan educational foundation,” but Mr. Fitton says it is also a media organization. “We’re filling multiple roles here in a Washington where the traditional vehicles for government accountability have broken down,” he said. Last year, he nominated Judicial Watch for three Pulitzer Prizes. He was told that because Judicial Watch was an advocacy group, it did not meet the Pulitzer committee’s eligibility criteria, a ruling he attributed to liberal bias. If Mr. Fitton is seen as less flamboyant than his predecessor, he has been no less dogged in his pursuit of Mrs. Clinton. In 2009, Judicial Watch sued to prevent her from becoming secretary of state, claiming that an obscure clause in the Constitution prevented former members of Congress who voted to increase the salary of a government position from being appointed to that position. For that matter, Judicial Watch is still suing the government to obtain a draft of the indictment against Mrs. Clinton that federal prosecutors prepared in 1998, when they were considering bringing charges against her in the Whitewater investigation. “I think to say that they are not partisan would not be accurate,” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. “Look at the way that they have dealt with the Clintons. It seems as if they’ve been out to do them harm. ” According to Mr. Fitton, however, Judicial Watch’s persistence has been rewarded. “The documents we have uncovered in the last year or so are gobsmacking in terms of what they say about what Mrs. Clinton was up to, the depths of her criminality,” he said. There is little doubt that the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public. More contentious is the claim that these documents illuminate Mrs. Clinton’s behavior, at least in the absence of the organization’s spin, which has broadly asserted that the Democratic presidential nominee used her position at the State Department to further the interests of her family’s foundation. A Judicial Watch news release from August highlighted a newly disclosed 2009 email from a Clinton Foundation official to two of Mrs. Clinton’s senior aides at the State Department, requesting a meeting between a foundation donor and the United States ambassador to Lebanon. “Clinton’s top aides’ favors for and interactions with the Clinton Foundation seem in violation of the ethics agreements that Hillary Clinton agreed to in order to be appointed and confirmed as Secretary of State,” the organization wrote. But the ambassador, Jeffrey D. Feltman, subsequently denied that the meeting had taken place. Judicial Watch is a polarizing group, even among advocates for greater government transparency. Critics accuse it of weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes. They argue that its unending barrage of lawsuits does more harm than good by draining federal resources, tying up the courts and wasting public servants’ time. The Freedom of Information Act “is a legitimate tool for government transparency, but it’s possible to abuse it,” said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists. “There is a question about whether they are enriching or distorting political discourse. ” The group’s defenders argue that its success in bringing to light thousands of buried emails speaks for itself, and that people can ignore the organization’s spin and make their own decisions about what the records mean. “They are obviously not just going on fishing expeditions, because they are producing documents that are resulting in stories and public debates,” said Danielle Brian, the director of the Project on Government Oversight. Mr. Fitton, the Judicial Watch president, said his group fought just as hard for transparency during George W. Bush’s presidency. Notably, it teamed with the Sierra Club in an unsuccessful effort to obtain the records of Vice President Dick Cheney’s energy policy task force. Judicial Watch’s claims of nonpartisanship will be tested if Republicans win the White House next month. For now, anyway, Mr. Trump seems safe from the group’s scrutiny. Mr. Fitton, when asked if he was concerned about the Republican nominee’s unwillingness to release his tax returns, said he was far more troubled by the Internal Revenue Service’s decision to audit Mr. Trump. “I think the I. R. S. is a Sword of Damocles over the First Amendment, and I think it is a menace,” he said. And the pending federal action against Trump University for defrauding students? Mr. Fitton, whose organization has filed about 300 lawsuits against the Obama administration, described it as “ambulance chasing. ” As for Mrs. Clinton, she can expect to remain in the group’s sights whether she wins or loses. “Everyone wants to move on,” Mr. Fitton said. “We don’t move on. ”",0
18214,Creator Wins the Belmont Stakes - The New York Times,"They hit the wire together in a blur, two gray horses that had shown promise on their way to the Kentucky Derby but once beneath those iconic twin spires looked as if they hardly belonged in America’s greatest race. Maybe they had excuses. The colt named Destin had broken poorly that day and was roughed up early in the race, and Creator, who had closed like a freight train in the Arkansas Derby, barely lifted a hoof in Kentucky, clunking down the track as if wearing concrete shoes. It was not a hard decision for the trainer Todd Pletcher to bring Destin home to his barn here in New York and start over. It was a   for Steve Asmussen to try to retool Creator at Churchill Downs, where he perennially leads the trainers’ standings. As the placing judges puzzled over a     rush to the finish of the 148th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, each trainer remained on edge. One of them was going to look smart, the other not smart enough. Those in the grandstand clutching betting tickets on the   grays were confessing their sins and saying their prayers: Destin went off at odds of nearly   and Creator at  . All, however, were in better spirits than the trainer Keith Desormeaux and his rider and brother, Kent, who saw the heavily favored Exaggerator first stall, then sputter at the top of stretch, ending his bid to take   of the Triple Crown. The colt that had vanquished the Kentucky Derby champ Nyquist in the Preakness was nowhere near when the real running started. In the clubhouse, Kenny Troutt, the owner of WinStar Farm, was balancing thoughts of a Belmont Stakes that he lost two years ago, and a decision that he had made earlier in the week. In the 2014 Belmont, his colt named Commissioner hit the midstretch looking every bit of the winner, but he was run down and beaten by a head by Tonalist. In Creator, however, Troutt had a   horse who turned in his optimal performances when a fast pace softened up the  . So Troutt met with his WinStar brain trust and decided to enter a swift   by the name of Gettysburg  —   a rabbit, in the parlance of the racetrack. “We needed a fast pace, and then Creator could run his race,” said Troutt, who had watched his colt come from 10 lengths back to win the Arkansas Derby. It was tricky, though. Troutt had to take Gettysburg from the barn of Pletcher, one of his main trainers (in fact, they won the 2010 Derby together) and give him to Asmussen to enter in the Belmont. Troutt knew that Pletcher already had Destin and Stradivari, another contender, in the race. “It was not an easy decision,” Troutt said. “I felt like it was the right thing to do was to realign the camps because Todd had the second and third choice in the race, and I just felt like it would be easier on him to answer to his other owners it would be easier on us if we realign the camp for this race. ” Pletcher became one of the nation’s leading trainers by keeping powerful owners happy so his large,   stable remains that way. This time it cost him a third Belmont Stakes victory. Gettysburg’s rider, Paco Lopez, gunned his colt to the lead and laid down testing fractions of 48. 48 seconds for a   and 1 minute 13. 28 seconds for   a pace that more often than not wobbles the legs of horses trying Belmont’s     distance for the first and usually last time. Through a mile, the pace thinned the ranks of   challengers, who did not include Nyquist, who was withdrawn weeks ago because of illness. Governor Malibu and Stradivari could not keep up. And Exaggerator? He feigned a move coming around the turn. “I put him down for a mad drive and said, show me your stuff, but there was nothing there,” said Kent Desormeaux, who wrapped up the Preakness winner and allowed him to galumph home in 11th place. Through a mile, Javier Castellano, aboard Destin, had waited patiently for Lopez and Gettysburg to run out of gas. When they did, he shot past them like a bullet train and set Destin’s gaze on the finish line. Behind him, however, Irad Ortiz Jr. had Creator in full flight. They had been blasting past horses two at a time and were bounding down the middle of the stretch as if skipping from one trampoline to another. “When we got clear, he started running,” Ortiz said. In the clubhouse, Asmussen had watched Ortiz save yards by deftly slicing through openings without having to slow Creator down. Now he knew that it was going to be a matter of inches if his colt was going to pass the Test of the Champion, as this grueling marathon is known. Creator pulled alongside Destin, and they matched strides for 10, 20, 30 yards. Asumussen’s counterpart, Pletcher, meanwhile, was alternating between his binoculars and watching the video board, hoping the wire would get there. Soon. It did not. Ortiz extended his arms once, twice, and with a final surge got past Castellano and Destin by a nose. Pletcher’s onetime horse Gettysburg had done his job well enough to deprive him of another Belmont Stakes to go along with the ones he had earned in 2007 with Rags to Riches and in 2013 with Palace Malice. “Tough beat,” Pletcher said stoically. It was WinStar and Asmussen who looked like geniuses, bringing home an $800, 000   check to boost the colt’s earnings past $1. 5 million. His final time of 2. 28. 51 was good enough to deliver a $34. 80 win ticket to those who risked $2 on him. “He was the perfect horse by inches,” Asmussen said. “That’s how you have to be on big race days. ”",0
18215,Obama Legacy: Medical Tyranny? New Order Issued for Detainment and Quarantines,"Forced vaccinations are already common around the world, and President Obama’s Executive Order may make this a reality in the U.S. also. Photo courtesy of Dawn.com . 
by Paul Fassa Health Impact News 
Almost on the eve of the 2016 presidential election, outgoing president Barack Obama issued an executive order that is intended to coordinate all the world’s health agencies in alignment with the CDC’s intention to increase detainment and quarantining guidelines enforcement worldwide. 
Executive orders (EO) are legally binding as laws, though an incoming president can issue EOs to cancel or revise some of those issued by the previous president. They are handy for an administration to avoid Congressional delays and conflicts, which can create unfavorable amendments or nullifying it completely. 
Congress can also amend executive orders and the Supreme Court can nullify them. But those are lengthy and give the administration involved time to enforce the executive order through the executive branches several agencies, including the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
The executive branch can end-around Congress to create statutes and enforceable policies with executive orders, euphemistically called “presidential memoranda” these days. Executive Order to be Used Against Vaccine Resistance? 
This recent executive order is of grave concern for advocates of health freedom. It is called “Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats,” and it was signed and issued on November 4 th , 2016. 
It seems innocuous at first glance, but one set of initials shows up often, GHSA . It stands for Global Health Security Agenda. 
This term first appeared in a CDC proposal in 2014, during the Disney measles outbreak. This proposal focused mostly on its “vaccine package.” It rested comfortably on the nationally orchestrated outcry against vaccination resistance . Some journalists even suggested jailing parents who did not have their children vaccinated. 
Several state legislators jumped in with proposals to create laws mandating vaccinations by removing exemptions previously allowed and not allowing kids to attend school without vaccine compliance. Fortunately for the rest of the nation, only California succeeded completely with State Senator Pan’s push of SB 277 despite strong grassroots opposition. 
The hysteria made it into presidential politics. Congressional Senator Bernie Sanders, who was vying to become the Democratic presidential nominee, declared in so many words that unvaccinated children are killers prior to his attempted run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. 
Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton openly declared: 
“The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and vaccines work. Let’s protect all our kids.” 
All this innocently ignorant or pharmaceutical industry rewarded hysteria was perfect timing for the CDC to set the goals expected to be implemented within five years of 2015. Here is some of their 2014 “suggested” policy that is now framed within Obama’s recent Executive Order: A functioning national vaccine delivery system that is able to respond to new disease threats. At least 90% coverage of the country’s fifteen-month-old population with at least one dose of measles containing vaccines. Note: The CDC’s doctored Atlanta children vaccine 2004 study threw out evidence proving children under three years of age were vulnerable to autism from the MMR, per testimony and original documents provided by CDC whistleblower Dr. William Thompson . The CDC claimed in this document that their emphasis on measles serves as a proxy for what they consider “vaccine preventable disease (VPD)” compliance. It also helps that most of the nation was swept up in pro-vaccination hysteria after the not so large Disney measles outbreak that resulted in no deaths. In other words, the CDC is seeking absolute 90 percent plus compliance eventually with all VPDs, even as records of outbreaks among highly vaccinated populations prove vaccines are not so effective after all. A fact denied is how extremely dangerous vaccines are and how they create lowered health among those spared serious acute vaccine injuries. (Source) 
This late 2014 CDC document is the root of Obama’s recent (November 4, 2016) executive order that grants worldwide government health agency cooperation and police power, even from Interpol (The International Criminal Police Organization (ICPO). 
Also mentioned as sources of policing the unvaccinated and suspected disease carriers in this are the Department of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security. Serious policing, indeed. More CDC Vaccination Policy to Bolster Their 2014 Policy “Suggestions” 
To bolster the initial 2014 vaccine package, the CDC issued a proposed directive for isolating and quarantining suspected disease carriers in August of 2016. This time it was a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the Federal Register to amend the Public Health Service Act, which governs public health law. 
It’s uncertain if public feedback, allowed until October 14th, 2016, had any influence on this CDC proposal to amend public health policy or not. 
National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC) founder Barbara Loe Fisher was on the forefront of public feedback, leading an NVIC petition to the CDC. Over 15,000 comments overall were sent to the CDC, mostly protesting this latest move toward medical tyranny. 
Often the FDA, USDA, or CDC’s opening for public commentary is merely a procedural formality that has little to no effect on the outcome. This has apparently happened once again. 
The CDC’s recent NPRM makes it possible for anyone, including those who are employed in travel services, to be a snitch and report suspected illness . Isolation can extend to a 72 hour detainment to determine one’s potential or actual disease level and enforce treatment or vaccination as a condition for being released. 
After you’ve been released, you could be electronically monitored. As usual, the viral shedding of vaccinated individuals that spreads disease is ignored. Jail time and large fines can be used against those who refuse to cooperate. 
Page 32 of this 88 page NPRM document gives examples of quarantining passengers of commercial aircraft and ocean going vessels under the heading of CONTACT INVESTIGATION (CI) CRITERIA BY DISEASE. 
Several life threatening diseases are mentioned, including Ebola, MERS, SARS, TB, and others, as well as measles . Most CIs thus far are measles cases. According to this document, CIs should be isolated according to their proximity of an individual with symptoms of any of the diseases listed. How they’re handled is advised in the column with the heading “Recommended activities.” 
Here’s the recommended activity for those in proximity of traveling measles cases (verbatim): “MMR vaccination if unvaccinated and <72 hrs since exposure; immune globulin if indicated and within 6 days of exposure.” (Source) False Media Fear Hysteria Helps Promote Medical Tyranny 
There’s a chain of historical events that demonstrate the disaster of enforced vaccination policies, starting with the cowpox vaccine for small pox in England and elsewhere, excerpted from NaturoDoc.com. 
… compulsory smallpox vaccination campaigns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that played a major role in decimating the populations of Japan (48,000 deaths), England and Wales (44,840 deaths, after 97 percent of the population had been vaccinated), Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, India (3 million — all vaccinated), Australia, Germany (124,000 deaths), Prussia (69,000 deaths — all re-vaccinated), and the Philippines. The epidemics ended in cities where smallpox vaccinations were either discontinued or never begun, and also after sanitary reforms were instituted (most notably in Munich — 1880, Leicester — 1878, Barcelona — 1804, Alicante — 1827, India — 1906, etc). [Emphasis added] (Source) 
Fast forward to the Swine Flu episode that led to legislated vaccine industry exemption from liability lawsuits. This episode occurred in 1976, where one Army boot camp trainee fell ill, but went on a forced full pack march and died. His was the only death from that flu. But many died or were paralyzed from the vaccine rather than the flu. Here’s that story . 
More recently, another Swine Flu scare was exposed as false by intrepid CBS News producer Sharyl Attkinson, author of the book Stonewalled . 
Her investigative pursuit for actual facts regarding vaccines may have helped force her “resignation” from CBS. She and her team were investigating the 2009 and previous year’s Swine Flu, which was classified as a pandemic or worldwide epidemic based solely on the numbers of purported stricken victims. 
After the CDC announced they were no longer tracking Swine Flu incidents and deaths, Sharyl and her team wanted to know why, but the CDC refused to respond. 
Using Freedom of Information Act’s (FOI) provisions, they went to each state’s Board of Health agency and discovered the actual count of H1N1 Swine Flu cases was incredibly low, single digits in some states. The majority of actual cases were not even any version of the flu. 
The CDC responded by publicly claiming there were a million or more H1N1 cases in the USA alone, and millions worldwide. The CDC and WHO simply lied about the whole thing and got away with it. (Source) 
CDC and WHO epidemics are psy-ops (psychological operations) designed to create hysteria and have everyone roll up their sleeves to receive those shots that enrich vaccine makers’ coffers. And flu shot adverse reactions are the most commonly represented in the government’s vaccine court , the legislatively designated “buffer” protecting the vaccine industry from direct lawsuits. 
What large scale death toll has occurred from any of the several contagious diseases covered by mainstream media over the past few decades since that 1976 Swine Flu debacle? None. 
Yet whether Ebola or Zika or SARs or MERs or Bird Flu or Swine Flu, the hysterical fear mongering has its way on mainstream media as though it’s factual, actual, and pressing. 
The original 1956 movie “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” and its 1978 remake of the same name, both of which coined the term “pod people,” were about humans overtaken and recreated in pods, which then become obedient drones for the masterminds of invading aliens. 
They are beyond Sci-Fi. They are simply accurate portrayals of our current human condition: Ignoring without questioning what’s really going on all around them over and over again and getting their vaccinations.

18216,Comment on New Report Shows Colorado Cannabis Industry Contributes More to Economy Than All Other Industries by Leonor G Arango,"Home / Good News / New Report Shows Colorado Cannabis Industry Contributes More to Economy Than All Other Industries New Report Shows Colorado Cannabis Industry Contributes More to Economy Than All Other Industries Justin Gardner November 3, 2016 2 Comments 
The Colorado cannabis industry has quickly gone from bud to full flower, as indicated by a new in-depth data analysis by the Marijuana Policy Group. 
Using a new “Marijuana Impact Model” they say is the first to “accurately characterize how this industry impacts the overall state economy,” the researchers confirmed the astounding positive impact that legalization has brought upon Colorado. Legal cannabis activities generated an output of $2.39 billion in 2015, with almost $1 billion in sales for the year. The sales represent a 42.4 percent increase from the previous year, translating into a staggering 112 metric tons of buds and 132 metric tons of “flower-equivalent” products (edibles, concentrates, etc.). 
Cannabis now ranks number six in terms of product sales, following closely behind cigarette sales. It beats gold mining by a large margin, and even performing arts and sports venues as well as all non-grain crop farming. 
However, the real impact is seen when put in terms of “output and employment per dollar spent,” where spending in the cannabis industry outperforms all private industries in Colorado – including coal and other mining, oil and gas, casinos, business services, general manufacturing and retail trade (incl. alcohol). 
Each dollar spent on retail cannabis generates $2.40 in state output, while cannabis manufacturing follows with $2.34 and cannabis cultivation comes in at a close $2.13. Combining the three, cannabis is generating far more than any other entity, including federal government spending. 
Much of this has to do with the fact that the Colorado cannabis industry operates almost entirely within the state, due to continuing prohibition in other states. 
There is equally impressive news in the jobs sector, where legal cannabis created more than 18,000 jobs in a year . 
“Legalization of marijuana created 18,005 fulltime equivalent (FTE) jobs in 2015. Among those jobs, 12,591 were employees directly involved with the marijuana business — either in stores and dispensaries, cultivations, or infused product manufacturing operations. The remaining 5,414 full-time equivalent positions were generated by intermediate input purchases made by the cannabis industry for general business goods and services, and through general spending by marijuana industry employees and proprietors.” 
Security guards comprise a significant portion of these indirect jobs, due in large part to the fact that the industry is still being forced to operate on a cash basis — because of asinine banking prohibitions by the federal government and the Federal Reserve . 
This isn’t stopping entrepreneurs and other productive individuals from taking advantage of the new, wildly popular market. Legal cannabis is having profound effects in many other industries, including commercial real estate, construction, and a raft of business services. 
The cannabis industry itself is growing at a faster pace than any other sector, at an astonishing 42.4 percent. Colorado’s general economic growth is at 3.5 percent and the U.S. average is 1.75 percent. 
The growth analysis found a very interesting result that supports a primary argument for ending prohibition. 36.2 percent of the economic growth was the result of the disappearance of the black market. 
When people are free to indulge in the personal behavior of ingesting a substance – as they can with alcohol – they will naturally choose to do so through the legal market, even if it means having to pay exorbitant taxes. 
And Colorado is gladly raking in this tax revenue. 
“In 2015, marijuana taxes were the second largest revenue source among excise products in the state (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, and gaming). 
Combined marijuana excise and sales tax revenues were $63.4 million in 2014, and $121.2 million in 2015. 5 For 2015, they were 14 percent larger than casino/gaming revenues, 6 about 5 percent less than lottery revenues, and almost three times larger than alcohol revenues.” 
The huge increase in tax revenue is primarily caused by the rapid increase in recreational use sales since legalization in 2014, and the fact that recreational products are taxed at a much higher rate than medical cannabis products. 
Interestingly, the report noted that a significant portion of the cannabis industry growth is coming from visitors who go to Colorado on cannabis vacations, rather than some other reason like skiing or hiking. 
“This visitor demand segment is poised to grow from 14 metric tons in 2015, to 55.1 metric tons by 2020, based upon these new, sole-purpose visitors choosing Colorado as a marijuana destination.” 
If there is one negative aspect to the report, it is that small cannabusinesses are struggling to stay alive as the industry becomes dominated by larger companies. While some of this is the natural result of competition, it appears that many of them are being regulated out of business by the state. 
“Private industry owners purport that consolidation is not being caused purely by price competition, but instead by high compliance costs. For example, the owner of one of Colorado’s largest retailers recently stated that many small operations are unable to properly comply with the state’s complex regulations, leading them to exit the market.” 
There lies the hidden barb of legalization. There’s no question that ending prohibition is the right thing to do, but government tends to place needless, cumbersome burdens on free enterprise which favors larger conglomerates and smothers the little guy. This ultimately leads to less competition and the tendency for monopolies to develop, which makes it easier for government to siphon their taxes. 
All in all, though, the analysis by the Marijuana Policy Group is heartening, and it shows other states how incredibly beneficial it is when people regain freedom and a new market is born. The report is especially timely, as nine states will be voting in less than a week to expand legal access to cannabis through recreational and medicinal means. Share Google + T. Mohr 
Someone needs to be the first to open and operate a banking system for the Cannabis industry. The ‘Cannabank’. ANY ideas? 
Morning absolutely it has supplied great job opportunities. This is a job that once you learn to love it, it’s a career. 
Only issue is lots are seasonal, unless you have ponics plants. 
Truly, an atmosphere at work that feels great.

18217,Texas College Declines Sanctuary Campus ’Right Now’,"The University of Texas at Arlington president told students they cannot become a sanctuary campus —  for now. [“The answer right now is no,” said   President Vistasp Karbhari on Wednesday during “Pizza with the President,” a regularly scheduled lunchtime gathering where the top admin serves free pizza and the student body tackle issues.  Karbhari explained their campus is a public institution and fueled by state and federal dollars. He said it stands to risk losing its funding if the university does not follow all laws, according to student newspaper The Shorthorn. This comment follows recent   city legislation that passed in the state Senate and next moves into the House. Senate Bill 4, which, if signed into law, would punish sanctuary cities, counties, and public colleges that fail to cooperate with federal immigration officials. Governor Greg Abbott placed banning sanctuary city policies on his emergency items for the 2017 legislative session. “The moment we don’t follow a law, we become a private institution,” said Karbhari, “and that is something we cannot do. ” Even without adopting sanctuary campus policies, Karbhari indicated the university would only give out information and data requested by government agencies like the U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with a court order or subpoena. Otherwise, they would not release the data, The Shorthorn reported. Karbhari said   does not often receive subpoena requests. Interestingly, part of Duke University’s sanctuary campus policy is to withhold illegal immigrant students’ status from federal immigration officials unless they have a subpoena. Breitbart Texas reached out to Karbhari for clarification on his similar proposed action and awaits a response. “We will do everything we can to make sure that our students are safe and secure on this campus, he said. Mark Napieralski, a   senior and Progressive Student Union president, attended and felt Karbhari did not address illegal immigrant student safety sufficiently, according to The Shorthorn. On January 20, Napieralski led an inauguration day campus protest to “reject Trump’s agenda” and delivered a sanctuary campus petition to Karbhari. The “union” again rallied for sanctuary status on February 9, railing against the U. S. suspending its refugee program or placing temporary travel restrictions on individuals from the seven   nations named in President Trump’s recent executive order. The Progressive Student Union describes itself as an “intersectional activist community fighting for the rights of marginalized people on campus and beyond. ” Their Facebook profile links to a parent organization, the National Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) a reboot of the 1960’s radical group Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The SDS chapter at the University of California, Davis, staged a violent MILO protest, Breitbart News reported. The “union” hosts a link to the online petition to make   a safe space. It states: In a recent email to the students of UTA, our president said “As the 5th most diverse college campus in the nation, we treasure the ethnic and cultural richness that makes UTA unique. We pride ourselves on the pivotal role we play in the community of Arlington, North Texas, and beyond, through the global impact that our tremendous scholarship, research, and outreach produces. It is you, our faculty, staff and students, who make this impact possible, and we cherish each and every one of you. ” We are calling the University President to hold his word and protect Muslim, refugee and undocumented students. On Facebook, the group shared its displeasure with Karbhari’s decision on Wednesday, calling it “unacceptable to put the needs of a system over the needs of students. ” The Progressive Student Union also had a meltdown over Trump backing the blue. On Facebook they posted: “And so  —   Trump shows he stands besides Police Brutality. Our fight and struggle to have UTA condemn Police Brutality will continue!” A petition to declare the flagship   a sanctuary circulated in December. President Greg Fenves said the university had no legal authority to become a sanctuary campus but said he signed a petition supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) former President Obama’s 2012 executive amnesty for children of illegal immigrants brought into the U. S. illegally, The Daily Texan reported. The Arlington branch of the UT system is located within the     Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).   enrolls slightly less than 40, 000 students on the campus, of which roughly 28, 200 of them are undergraduates, and nearly 25 percent are Hispanic, 12 percent international.

18221,These Foods Aren’t Genetically Modified but They Are ‘Edited’ - The New York Times,"In a few years, you could be eating the next generation of genetically altered foods  —   potatoes that do not turn brown or soybeans with a healthier mix of fatty acids. And you may have no idea that something is different, because there may be no mention on the labeling even after a law passed by Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect. A new generation of crops known as   rather than genetically modified is coming to the market. Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations, they, at least for now, largely fall outside of current regulations. Unlike older methods of engineering genes, these techniques, like Crispr, so far have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants. The federal Agriculture Department has asked companies to advise it of their plans. But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops, the agency is giving businesses the green light. Hundreds of acres of   crops have already been grown in several states, unencumbered by oversight or regulations. And a few people have eaten them already. “This is not Frankenfood,” said André Choulika, chief executive of Cellectis, one of the companies developing   crops. In October, Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York, the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant, and served dishes made from its   soybeans and potatoes. Guests included professors, journalists and celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, the actor. “I don’t even know what gene editing is,” Mr. Harris said. “I thought we were supposed to wear jeans. ” Calyxt, a subsidiary of Cellectis doing the   food, is also developing new versions of wheat including one with greater resistance to fungal diseases, another lower in carbohydrates and higher in dietary fibers. Other companies also developing   crops including DuPont Pioneer, which has used the technology for a new variety of waxy corn, used most commonly not for food but for starch in adhesives. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used Crispr to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly. The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses  —   typically from plant pests  —   to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plant’s DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with  . M. O. crops. Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text. Federal agencies have not yet said how they intend to regulate   foods, and the incoming Trump administration, while criticizing overregulation in general, has not weighed in. Other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate   foods and how to do so. In Europe, where many countries have banned the cultivation of G. M. O. s, the European Commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue, with debate resuming this year. Dr. Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by   Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentier’s work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted. Still, few wanted to eat them. In 1778, Parmentier organized the first in a series of lavish dinners for the high society of Paris, serving dishes all made with potatoes. Potatoes became a fixture in French cuisine. With farmers harvesting the first substantial plantings of the Cellectis   potatoes and soybeans last year, Dr. Choulika thought of throwing a modern version of Parmentier’s gathering. “This is the first dinner on Earth with   foods,” Dr. Choulika said to the diners. “Things that you eat today, millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century, and this will not stop. ” Food is a side business for Cellectis, which focuses on pharmaceuticals. After some collaborations with big companies like Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer, Cellectis started Calyxt, to explore opportunities for using gene editing for foods. Dr. Choulika said he considered G. M. O.s safe, but that the   techniques like those used by Calyxt would be more acceptable to consumers. Often in G. M. O. s, the inserted genes came from unrelated species, like the bacterial genes that were added to cotton so that it would exude a toxin to repel bollworms, a mixing of species known as transgenesis. “There’s not this blockage of transgenesis that freaks out people for no reason,” he said. “I think it is a question of perception. ” Instead of using bacteria and viruses to burrow into a cell,   techniques  —   Calyxt uses one called Talen  —   create molecules that act as a template to match a specific segment of DNA and then make a cut there. For the Calyxt soybeans, for example, the only change was to turn off two genes. “There is nothing taken out or added to the plant,” Dr. Choulika said. “It’s what nature would have produced. ” Those edits change the mix of fatty acids and perhaps make for a better cooking oil. “Better than olive oil,” Dr. Choulika said. At the dinner, the soybeans were transformed into a several dishes including soy blinis, mini tofu and soy burgers, and soybean hummus. Carole Pourchet, director of the Lab, the research and development arm of Mr. Ducasse’s food enterprise, said the   soy cooked like normal soy, but that the potatoes were a little drier, leading to the idea to confit them to retain moisture. The potatoes showed up in mashed potatoes, potato pie and blinis. “The dinner was maybe potatoes cooked 10 ways,” said Richard C. Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who was one of the guests. Dr. Choulika worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Mulligan’s laboratory two decades ago. Federico Tripodi, chief executive of the Calyxt subsidiary, said the company hoped the soybeans would be used in cooking oil for commercial and industrial use by 2018. The potatoes, edited to remain fresher longer and not produce carcinogens when fried, could be grown and sold in 2019. A second potato that is slower to turn brown just got word from the U. S. D. A. that it, too, is not subject to regulation. Gene editing is not being used only with plants. A Minnesota company, Recombinetics, is editing the genes of farm animals  —   for example, creating cattle without horns. Critics warned that the industry was repeating the same mistakes of G. M. O. s. “We’ve never been against any of this technology,” said Michael K. Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union. “We don’t say it’s inherently bad or these crops are inherently dangers. It’s just they raise safety issues, and there should be required safety assessments. ” While the   templates match a specific sequence, it is possible that the same sequence occurs elsewhere in the genome or they will match similar sequences, and the DNA will be sliced in those places, too, with unknown consequences. “They make it sound very exact,” Dr. Hansen said. “It will have   effects. ” Dr. Hansen said unregulated   crops could also create trade havoc if traces of them accidentally mixed into exports to countries that prohibited them. Daniel Voytas, chief science officer of Calyxt who was one of the inventors of the Talen   technology, said the company had not checked the entire genomes of their plants, but did look for unintended changes within sections that were similar to the parts they were editing. “We didn’t find any,” he said. Dr. Voytas said it would not be “a huge amount of work” to sequence the entire genome and that all of the data they presented was available on the U. S. D. A.’s website. A U. S. D. A. advisory board in November unanimously recommended that standards for organic foods exclude   crops even if they were grown without chemical fertilizers and abided by the other strictures of organic farming. Dr. Mulligan of Harvard said he was not sure that people would see much difference between   and genetically modified. “The objection that people have is a more visceral and vague objection to messing with DNA,” he said. “It’s hard to see that the public would see the difference. ” He admitted that he was more excited by the chef. “The good thing with this is Ducasse is such a culinary artist,” Dr. Mulligan said. “He is really well known for being able to take anything and make it taste good. ” For Mr. Harris, the dinner provided a whirlwind introduction to biotechnology  —   “realities that I thought were theoreticals,” he said.",0
18222,Jon Stewart Returns on ‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ - The New York Times,"In his first live “Late Show” broadcast since the start of the Republican National Convention, Stephen Colbert promised the return of an old friend from his   days, but instead, viewers got to see two familiar faces: first, Jon Stewart, the longtime host of “The Daily Show,” and then “Stephen Colbert,” the unctuous conservative commentator that Mr. Colbert portrayed for nearly a decade on his Comedy Central program, “The Colbert Report. ” The guest appearances from Mr. Stewart and that other Mr. Colbert appear to have paid off for “The Late Show. ” According to preliminary ratings information on Tuesday, “The Late Show” was the No. 1 broadcast   show in overall viewership on Monday night, the first time the program has surpassed all its competitors (including Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show on NBC and “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC) since Feb. 15. “The Late Show” announced in June that it would present two weeks of live broadcasts, Monday through Thursday, to air after each night of the Republican and Democratic conventions. Though the current iteration of the program made its debut to considerable fanfare in September, it has had trouble finding a consistent voice under Mr. Colbert, who succeeded David Letterman as host and who has tried to expand his horizons beyond the irreverent political comedy he performed on “The Colbert Report. ” Monday’s installment of “The Late Show” on CBS began with an elaborate, pretaped musical number performed by Mr. Colbert, paying satirical tribute to the Republican convention in Cleveland and the party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. (As Mr. Colbert sang: “This week, you and me, we will witness history   As the R. N. C. crowns their orange manatee. ”) The host followed with a live monologue in which he riffed on moments from the first night of convention and Mr. Trump’s “60 Minutes” interview with his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana. Later, a taped comedy sketch followed Mr. Colbert to what appeared to be an isolated cabin in the woods, where he knocked on its door and was greeted by a bearded,   Mr. Stewart, who was Mr. Colbert’s boss for many years at “The Daily Show” and is now an executive producer of “The Late Show. ” Alerting Mr. Stewart that it was once again time for a Republican convention, an animated Mr. Colbert told him, “You will not believe who the nominee is. ” He paused to let Mr. Stewart take a sizable drink of water from a mug, then told him, “It’s Donald Trump,” at which point Mr. Stewart doused him in a sizable spit take. The sketch revealed that Mr. Stewart had been sharing his cabin with the Colbert character (brandishing a sword and a Captain America shield). And then “Stephen Colbert” (still holding the sword and shield) returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater and performed a new edition of “The Word,” a recurring segment from “The Colbert Report,” which ran from 2005 to 2014. Just as “The Colbert Report” helped introduce audiences to the word “truthiness,” Mr. Colbert used this latest installment to contemplate the condition of “Trumpiness”: “Remember, elections aren’t about what voters think, it’s about what voters feel. And right now, at least half of Americans feel their voices aren’t being heard. ” (An onscreen graphic delivered the punch line: “Especially Mike Pence. ”) After a commercial break, Mr. Colbert returned as  —   presumably  —   himself. “It was really great to see Jon Stewart again,” he said. With a knowing smile, he added: “You know what would be nice? To have that happen again some time this week. ”",0
18223,"Berlin, Russia, Donald Trump: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The German authorities are searching for a    Tunisian man in the deadly truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin. He is known to have used multiple aliases and is believed to be armed and dangerous. Local news agencies reported that he has ties to an Iraqi preacher arrested in Germany last month who is accused of recruiting soldiers for the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack. Identification papers indicating that the Tunisian man had been denied asylum were found in the truck. A German official said prosecutors had been observing him on suspicion that he was plotting an attack. _____ 2. The jockeying has begun for ambassadorships under   Donald Trump. Donors, loyalists and people close to his children are trying to put themselves in the running. There are some early favorites, including Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, above with Vice   Mike Pence, for Britain. _____ 3. Speaking of appointees, Mr. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, the Exxon Mobil chief Rex Tillerson, above left, was once a vocal critic of Russia’s justice system. Then he came to realize that the key to success in Russia, a country deeply important to the company’s future, was developing personal relationships with President Vladimir Putin and the head of the state oil company. _____ 4. Two   YouTube stars said they were kicked off a Delta Air Lines flight at a London airport for speaking Arabic. Adam Saleh and Slim Albaher were on their way home to New York after performing their stage show, which mixes comedy and inspirational speaking. Social media erupted with anger against the airline industry, but also skepticism, since Mr. Saleh, above, has perpetrated video hoaxes in the past. He insisted that this was no prank. _____ 5. Extremely warm temperatures in the Arctic over the last two months could lead to record low levels of ice this summer, with cascading effects around the globe. Over all, 2016 broke the Arctic’s record for the warmest year. “We need people to know and understand that the Arctic is going to have an impact on their lives no matter where they live,” a scientist said. Above, a cruise ship off Alaska in August, on a journey made possible by diminished sea ice coverage. _____ 6. Executions, death sentences and public support for capital punishment in the U. S. have all fallen to their lowest levels in decades. State executions this year hit a   low, and juries imposed the fewest death sentences since 1972. Executions halted that year and death penalty laws had to be rewritten after the Supreme Court struck down existing laws, saying that capital punishment as administered in the U. S. constituted “cruel and unusual punishment. ” _____ 7. We went out on patrol with Arizona Border Recon, which calls itself a nongovernmental organization. Others call a militia. Many members are armed  —   retired law enforcement agents or veterans who operate with little oversight. They say they’re protecting the border and hunt for migrants to hand over to Border Patrol. “Because we live out here, we do this ” one said. _____ 8.

18226,Donald Trump construirá un muro alrededor de cada mexicano,"Donald Trump construirá un muro alrededor de cada mexicano SE CONSTRUIRÁN DOS ""O QUIZÁ TRES"" MILLONES DE MUROS racismo 
Asegurando que es la forma más efectiva para evitar que la comunidad hispana se “disperse libremente” por el territorio estadounidense, el nuevo presidente americano, Donald Trump, ha informado esta semana que ha modificado su proyecto de construir un muro en la frontera y que, en vez de eso, se rodeará a todos los mexicanos con un muro circular de carácter individual. 
“Los mexicanos estarán a un lado del muro y los americanos al otro lado, no va a haber mayor problema”, insistía Trump ayer en una entrevista a la CNN. El muro será circular y cerrado en sí mismo, por lo que las labores de construcción se llevarán a cabo alrededor de cada ciudadano mexicano y de dentro hacia fuera. 
Gritar “construye el muro” cerca de la cara de cualquier ciudadano con aspecto extranjero conllevará beneficios fiscales 
Trump ha pedido a los mexicanos que residen actualmente en Estados Unidos que elijan un lugar “que a ellos les guste, en el que estén bien, cómodos y donde se vean viviendo una larga temporada” y que esperen a que diversos operarios construyan una pared circular a su alrededor. Con 3.200 kilómetros de largo, la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos es una de las más transitadas del mundo y cruza desiertos y montañas, por lo que la construcción de muros individuales parece una alternativa más barata y efectiva que el jaleado muro que prometió Trump durante la campaña. 
El nuevo presidente ha querido tranquilizar a la oposición asegurando que el plan es que los mexicanos que lleven diez años en el país y hayan contraído matrimonio con ciudadanos estadounidenses puedan optar a un muro “de matrimonio” o familiar. 
Fuentes de la Casa Blanca han informado que Trump también está pensando construir muros alrededor de todos los ciudadanos estadounidenses que él considere unos perdedores.",0
18227,Justice Department Quits Pro-Transgender Lawsuit - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice has dropped a 2016   lawsuit against the state of North Carolina, marking another success for mainstream advocates who wish to preserve normal   facilities and institutions. [The lawsuit was filed in May 2016 by deputies working for President Barack Obama, who was ideologically opposed to any civic or legal recognition that men and women are biologically different as well as legally equal.  That   hostility towards biological heterosexuality is deeply unpopular among Americans, who prefer that civic society help women and men cooperate to ensure the next generation is birthed and educated. For example, most Americans recognize that women and men have a civil right to prefer their   institutions, including bathrooms, changing rooms and sports leagues. The decision to quit the   lawsuit was denounced by groups who are trying to impose a nationwide “genderless society” which would suppress any civic or legal recognition of the differences between the two sexes. For example, Chase Strangio, a   activist at the ACLU complained that the decision by Trump’s Attorney General Jeff Sessions means “there is no civil rights division” at the agency. There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore. We are the civil rights division. We are the resistance. And we will win.  —   Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 14, 2017,  There is no civil rights division at DOJ anymore. We are the civil rights division. We are the resistance. And we will win.  —   Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 14, 2017,  ACLU, @LambdaLegal, @ACLU_NC condemn Trump Administration’s withdrawal of #HB2 lawsuit https:  .   —   ACLU National (@ACLU) April 14, 2017,  The May 2016 lawsuit was filed then by Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and it demanded that the state’s residents give up their civil right to have   public bathrooms and locker rooms for both biological sexes. The lawsuit was reinforced by Obama’s directions to the nation’s   schools, which told administrators to accept and support any child’s claim they are transgender, to hide children’s sexual claims from their parents, and to punish other  children who decline to use pronouns favored by a “transgender” child   —   such as “him” or her”  —   even in science class. In the lawsuit against North Carolina, Obama’s lawyers claimed   facilities discriminate against men or women who want to live as members of the opposite sex. They insisted that 1970s civil rights laws actually require that a person’s feeling about their maleness or femaleness, dubbed “Gender Identity,” be treated as more important than their actual male or female heterosexual biology. “Transgender men are men  —   they live, work and study as men. Transgender women are women  —   they live, work and study as women,” declared Vanita Gupta, the acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice’s civic regulation division, in a May press conference. Gupta was forced out of the agency after Americans choose Trump as their new president in November. Since then, Obama has twice admitted that his focus on transgender ideology helped Trump win the election. On Friday, Gupta denounced the Justice Department’s decision. Sadly predictable. They can dismiss but they cannot erase. The fight for LGBTQ justice is strong. https:  .   —   Vanita Gupta (@vanitaguptaCR) April 14, 2017,  Despite pressure from business, the establishment and the sports industry, North Carolina’s voters and legislators decided that the state officials will decide who is treated as a legal male or a legal female in the state. They passed HB2 in 2016, and then defeated a business boycott of the state by passing H142 in March 2017. Both laws were bitterly opposed by transgender activists because they reinforce the existing rules that treat men and women as equal, different and complementary in a heterosexual society, while also allowing people to flip their legal sex once they undergo a medical procedure. Transgender activists vowed to continue their lawsuit against the state, and their political campaign against the “gender binary. ” The state’s HB142 law is being defended in court by a Democratic Attorney General. But we’re not backing down. Our lawsuit with @ACLU and @ACLU_NC will continue. We will keep fighting. #WeObject https:  .   —   Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) April 14, 2017,  It is unclear if the Justice Department will fully switch sides and help defend the state’s   HB142 law. The transgender hostility to heterosexual differences is deeply unpopular among Americans, and only about   of Americans support the idea that people should be allowed to easily change their legal sex. The number of transgender Americans is very low. Advocates claim that a third of one percent of Americans are at least somewhat transgender. But a study of the 2010 census showed that only about  400 adults had changed their name from one sex to the other.",0

In this video during the Dr. Phil show the network appeared to ‘leak’ the poll results, the problem is that this video was shot 4 days before the elections, and while the live ‘polls’ seem to have Donald Trump in the lead, we also see that all the votes are yet to be counted.
http://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hillary-Media-collusion.mp4 This paranormal streak continues below, in this video by PayDay Monsanto, where WRCB a NBC affiliate news stations again appeared to have its own predictions about the poll results. This time officially declaring Hillary Rodham Clinton as the winner.
Things start to get even weirder when a woman who works in a book store discovered that
Newsweek already has an issue in print, boxed and ready to ship, declaring Hillary Clinton the winner. 
Newsweek has reportedly shipped thousands of boxes of magazines all across the country. In these boxes are magazines congratulating Hillary on her election win. Congratulations, Madame President. This is less of an election, and more of a selection. The decision has been made. It was always Hillary. If you look at the Wikileaks emails, you will find ample support for collusion and corruption in the Democratic National Committee–why would anyone assume it stopped there?

Those who believe this is evidence of the rigged system point to the bar-code image on the magazine. That would be the last element added to a magazine before publication, and we are yet to see any evidence that Trump could have even the slightest chance of winning even though some polls, and most cyberspace discussion seems to have him in the lead.

18230,Russian contributions rich in Silicon Valley | Russia Direct,"Nov 6, 2016 Axel Tillmann Opinion 
There are plenty of talented Russians working in U.S. tech companies. Such partnerships are sure to create wealth and be beneficial for both countries. 
Russians have a high chance of succeeding in Silicon Valley if they surround themselves with others whose talents complement their own. Photo: Theory and Practice 
Although it may come as a surprise to many, Russians have long had a presence in the U.S., particularly in Silicon Valley . It’s a mistake, especially for businesspeople, to trust the picture politicians and the media paint of Russia. Many Russian IT companies view Silicon Valley as the promised land, and many Russians have much to contribute here. 
Most Russians arrive in the U.S. with a strong education and a different way of looking at the world that enables them to “design” products. I speak from experience. In one of my startups, I partnered with a Russian named Vladimir who quietly worked away in his office. Occasionally he would get up from his chair and step to a white board to sketch out his design plans. Eventually there would be the sound of his keyboard clicking as he produced on his screen what he had designed in his mind. Eventually we created a great product. There are plenty of Vladimirs working away in U.S. tech companies. Recommended: "" Russians in America: How to find success in Silicon Valley "" 
In other cases, whole Russian companies have found success in the U.S. market. One company worth highlighting is Kaspersky Lab . The Moscow-based firm was a dark horse in the software security business, up against such competition as McAfee and Symantec. Yet today, Kaspersky’s market share is in the top eight of all vendors in the sector, and it is twice the size of McAfee’s. Kaspersky is an important case study in what it takes to be truly successful in the market. The company had a great product, but what made the firm successful was its brilliant go-to-market strategy, crafted in cooperation with North American market managers. 
Wisely, Kaspersky’s leadership chose to tap experts in the local market to craft the company’s strategy rather than trying to do it by themselves. I’m not ashamed to admit that as a German immigrant, I started down the path of launching a product with a limited sense of marketing skills, believing in The Field of Dreams theory, “if we build it, they will come.” Unfortunately, that’s just not so. After a long and painful journey of my own, I finally came around to seeing the benefits of hiring professionals who know how to play the game, but this required that I make a change in my way of thinking. 
I have met many talented Russians during the last five years and they are hungry to succeed; but most need the same kind of awakening I had in order to create their own success stories. Not everyone will become Google co-founder Sergey Brin, or even Birger Steen, who created the extremely successful software platform Parallels, but the opportunity to be a success is available to all who can combine their love for technological achievements with excellence in marketing and sales. Here are few more examples of innovators with Russian who have found that success: Valentin Gapontsev (IPG Photonics), Yuri Milner (investor), Stepan Pachikov (Evernote), David Yan (ABBYY). 
Silicon Valley is truly a magical place, and anyone who comes to work here learns quickly that the main advantage of the Valley is the network that exists. Russians have a high chance of succeeding in Silicon Valley if they surround themselves with others whose talents complement their own. One way to do this is to join a networking organization. Two of the larger networking organizations for Russian entrepreneurs and developers are AMBAR (American Business Association of Russian Speaking Processionals) and the Global Technology Symposium, led by the legendary Alexandra Johnson. 
While current geopolitics is encouraging Russian entrepreneurs to take another look at China , culturally Russians are closer to the U.S. mentality . In the long-term, Russia and Russians have little to gain from China. What interests do the Chinese have in helping Russia develop a culture of innovation? Chinese companies have a clear track record of observing the ideas and the scientific research of others, and then reverse engineering it to create their own products. 
I encourage investors to embrace Russian entrepreneurs and help them find a U.S. partner. Only if we encourage this free entrepreneurial spirit can we stop the long-standing intellectual brain drain that Russia has experienced for so many years. 
Let’s work together to make some money.

18231,"Russian Hackers Acted to Aid Trump in Election, U.S. Says - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   American intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that Russia acted covertly in the latter stages of the presidential campaign to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances and promote Donald J. Trump, according to senior administration officials. They based that conclusion, in part, on another finding  —   which they say was also reached with high confidence  —   that the Russians hacked the Republican National Committee’s computer systems in addition to their attacks on Democratic organizations, but did not release whatever information they gleaned from the Republican networks. In the months before the election, it was largely documents from Democratic Party systems that were leaked to the public. Intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians gave the Democrats’ documents to WikiLeaks. Republicans have a different explanation for why no documents from their networks were ever released. Over the past several months, officials from the Republican committee have consistently said that their networks were not compromised, asserting that only the accounts of individual Republicans were attacked. On Friday, a senior committee official said he had no comment. Mr. Trump’s transition office issued a statement Friday evening reflecting the deep divisions that emerged between his campaign and the intelligence agencies over Russian meddling in the election. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again. ’” One senior government official, who had been briefed on an F. B. I. investigation into the matter, said that while there were attempts to penetrate the Republican committee’s systems, they were not successful. But the intelligence agencies’ conclusions that the hacking efforts were successful, which have been presented to President Obama and other senior officials, add a complex wrinkle to the question of what the Kremlin’s evolving objectives were in intervening in the American presidential election. “We now have high confidence that they hacked the D. N. C. and the R. N. C. and conspicuously released no documents” from the Republican organization, one senior administration official said, referring to the Russians. It is unclear how many files were stolen from the Republican committee in some cases, investigators never get a clear picture. It is also far from clear that Russia’s original intent was to support Mr. Trump, and many intelligence officials  —   and former officials in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign  —   believe that the primary motive of the Russians was to simply disrupt the campaign and undercut confidence in the integrity of the vote. The Russians were as surprised as everyone else at Mr. Trump’s victory, intelligence officials said. Had Mrs. Clinton won, they believe, emails stolen from the Democratic committee and from senior members of her campaign could have been used to undercut her legitimacy. The intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russia tried to help Mr. Trump was first reported by The Washington Post. In briefings to the White House and Congress, intelligence officials, including those from the C. I. A. and the National Security Agency, have identified individual Russian officials they believe were responsible. But none have been publicly penalized. It is possible that in hacking into the Republican committee, Russian agents were simply hedging their bets. The attack took place in the spring, the senior officials said, about the same time that a group of hackers believed to be linked to the G. R. U. Russia’s military intelligence agency, stole the emails of senior officials of the Democratic National Committee. Intelligence agencies believe that the Republican committee hack was carried out by the same Russians who penetrated the Democratic committee and other Democratic groups. The finding about the Republican committee is expected to be included in a detailed report of “lessons learned” that Mr. Obama has ordered intelligence agencies to assemble before he leaves office on Jan. 20. That report is intended, in part, to create a comprehensive history of the Russian effort to influence the election, and to solidify the intelligence findings before Mr. Trump is sworn in. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt about any intelligence suggesting a Russian effort to influence the election. “I don’t believe they interfered,” he told Time magazine in an interview published this week. He suggested that hackers could come from China, or that “it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. ” Intelligence officials and private cybersecurity companies believe that the Democratic National Committee was hacked by two different Russian cyberunits. One, called “Cozy Bear” or “A. P. T. 29” by some Western security experts, is believed to have spent months inside the D. N. C. computer network, as well as other government and political institutions, but never made public any of the documents it took. (A. P. T. stands for “Advanced Persistent Threat,” which usually describes a sophisticated   cyberintruder.) The other, the G. R. U.  unit known as “Fancy Bear,” or “A. P. T. 28,” is believed to have created two outlets on the internet, Guccifer 2. 0 and DCLeaks, to make Democratic documents public. Many of the documents were also provided to WikiLeaks, which released them over many weeks before the Nov. 8 election. Representative Michael McCaul, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN in September that the R. N. C. had been hacked by Russia, but then quickly withdrew the claim. Mr. McCaul, who was considered by Mr. Trump for secretary of Homeland Security, initially told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, “It’s important to note, Wolf, that they have not only hacked into the D. N. C. but also into the R. N. C. ” He added that “the Russians have basically hacked into both parties at the national level, and that gives us all concern about what their motivations are. ” Minutes later, the R. N. C. issued a statement denying that it had been hacked. Mr. McCaul subsequently said that he had misspoken, but that it was true that “Republican political operatives” had been the target of Russian hacking. So were establishment Republicans with no ties to the campaign, including former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Mr. McCaul may have had in mind a collection of more than 200 emails of Republican officials and activists that appeared this year on the website DCLeaks. com. That website got far more attention for the many Democratic Party documents it posted. The messages stolen from Republicans have drawn little attention because most are routine business emails from local Republican Party officials in several states, congressional staff members and party activists. Among those whose emails were posted was Peter W. Smith, who runs a venture capital firm in Chicago and has long been active in “opposition research” for the Republican Party. He said he was unaware that his emails had been hacked until he was called by a reporter on Thursday. He said he believes that his material came from a hack of the Illinois Republican Party. “I’m not upset at all,” he said. “I try in my communications, quite frankly, not to say anything that would be embarrassing if made public. ”",0
18232,California Democrat Who Cheered Turkey Coup Wants to Impeach Trump - Breitbart,"Rep. Brad Sherman ( ) joined a fledgling effort to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday  —   even before former FBI director James Comey was set to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday. [“The standard for ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ has been met,” Sherman declared to reporters, according to The Hill. He did not explain, apparently, what crimes Trump had actually committed.  In fact, Sherman seemed to admit that the evidence against Trump was flimsy: “If articles of impeachment based on obstruction of justice were on the floor of the House today, they would not succeed,” he told The Hill. Nevertheless, he said, he planned to draft one article of impeachment to   a process that he said would accelerate over time. Sherman is working with Rep. Al Green ( ) who is also submitting articles of impeachment to the House. Another California Democrat who has led calls for Trump’s impeachment is Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Waters was spotted in the business class section of a flight from Los Angeles to Dulles International Airport on Tuesday evening, but declined to be interviewed by Breitbart News. Last year, Sherman found himself in trouble after he appeared to endorse a coup attempt against Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “Military takeover in Turkey will hopefully lead to real democracy  —   not Erdogan Authoritarianism,” he tweeted at the time. As the coup effort faltered, Sherman had to scramble to explain himself. Evidently, Sherman hopes his prospects for removing a president from power will be brighter this time. However, Comey is not expected to offer any evidence that Trump tried to obstruct justice. In fact, a written version of his prepared remarks indicates that Comey will corroborate Trump’s claim that he told the president he was not under FBI investigation. Comey is also expected to describe his discomfort with being asked for his “loyalty” by the president. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

18233,A Rising Black Leader Who Pulled Off His Own Fake Obituary - The New York Times,"It is impossible to know what Grady O’Cummings III might have represented to the group of youngsters he was holding court with in this photo taken in September 1963. Mr. O’Cummings, who was photographed with the youngsters outside his office in Harlem, announced the next month that he would seek the Democratic nomination to run for president in 1964. He was one of the first   to run for president. Certainly Mr. O’Cummings must have represented hope and possibility to the boys who had gathered around him that day. Dedicated to economic and political empowerment for blacks, Mr. O’Cummings founded the National Civil Rights Party in 1963 to foster black enterprise and to appeal to liberal whites. He said at the time that the organization had 450 members, with branches in Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia. The party designated him its presidential nominee days before he decided to run as a Democrat. It will never be known where Mr. O’Cummings’s ambitious political aspirations might have taken him. His dreams appeared to be cut short when it was reported that he had had a massive heart attack and died at home in November 1969, at just 36. The New York Times ran an obituary about the unexpected death of the promising political novice who, sadly, was lost in his prime. Or was he? Mr. O’Cummings was not quite the determined political    that he seemed. He had faked his death and was very much alive when he bamboozled The Times and The Amsterdam News into publishing his obituary. In fact, this report might well also serve as the newspaper’s long overdue correction. For it was only during the reporting for this article that The Times realized it had written of Mr. O’Cummings’s hoax. This is what actually happened. Just four months after he sent in his obituary to The Times, he    —   at a news conference in Brooklyn, which went unnoticed by The Times. For an explanation of why he faked his death, Mr. O’Cummings said he had simply been trying to elude members of the Black Panthers, who he said had made death threats against him and his family, according to an article about the news conference in The Amsterdam News. “I had to get out because I was trying to protect my family,” The News quoted Mr. O’Cummings as saying. He explained that he had fled to Buffalo, where he remained for months. “My wife, Winnie, was assaulted by four Black Panthers, and it made me very angry. I didn’t go to the police because I am not an informer and didn’t want to get involved. ” The News’s account never explained why he had decided that the threat to his family had diminished enough in just four months for him to   and in such public and dramatic fashion. Perhaps at least partly because he had misled the public, he never attained the political success he sought. Years before, Mr. O’Cummings’s presidential run had proved to be as   as his faked death. In early March 1964, about five months after he was designated the presidential candidate of his National Civil Rights Party, he withdrew and said he would become his party’s candidate for the seat held by Representative John J. Rooney, a Democrat, in Brooklyn’s 14th Congressional District (as reported by The  Times in a brief article). Several decades later, The Times did mention Mr. O’Cummings and his candidacy for City Council, in an article about the 1993 race. Even then, though, the newspaper did not correct the story of his death or run an editor’s note about it. Professionally, Mr. O’Cummings worked in public relations, including as the community relations representative for the Welfare Policemen’s Benevolent Association. He was a native of Greenville, S. C. who graduated from City College of New York. Mr. O’Cummings also was publisher of New York Speakout, a weekly newspaper in Brooklyn, where he lived. And he served as a president of the youth council of the Manhattan division of the N. A. A. C. P. Mr. O’Cummings went on to live a long life. As for his death, it is never too late to set the record straight. The Times can now report with the authority of having seen Mr. O’Cummings’s death certificate that he died of natural causes on June 2, 1996, at the age of 63. It was 27 years after his obituary appeared in this publication. The Times did not publish a second one. This series will be part of a book with additional unseen photographs, and new stories, titled “Unseen: Unpublished Black History From the New York Times Archives,” to be published by Black Dog  Leventhal in the fall of 2017.",0

18235,Breaking: The FBI Is Reviewing News Emails In Clinton Scandal Just 11 Days Before Election,"Email 
FBI Director James Comey said Friday that investigators had found new emails related to the bureau’s previously closed inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information, restarting a long-simmering debate over the Democratic nominee’s conduct as secretary of State in the closing days of a presidential campaign that Clinton appeared to be putting away. 
Via USAToday SPONSORED LINKS 
In a letter to senior lawmakers explaining his decision, Comey said “the FBI cannot yet assess” whether the information is “significant” nor could he offer a timetable for how long it will take investigators to make an assessment. Scroll Down For Video Below 
But an official familiar with the matter said Friday that the new materials, perhaps thousands of emails, were discovered in the ongoing and separate investigation into sexually charged communications between former New York congressman Anthony Weiner and a 15-year-old girl. Comey was briefed on the findings in recent days, resulting in the director’s notification to Congress, said the official who is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 
The emails were discovered in a search of a device or devices used by Weiner, who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Abedin also had access to the same device or devices. The official said it was not likely that the FBI’s review of the additional emails could be completed by Election Day. 
In a brief news conference in Iowa on Friday evening, Clinton said, “The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,” a position earlier outlined in a statement from her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The Democratic nominee called on the FBI “to release all the information that it has.” 
“As you know I’ve had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,” Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Thursday night. During a speech in New Hampshire earlier in the day, the Republican presidential nominee gleefully discussed the “breaking news announcement.” 
“Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,” Trump said, and her “criminal scheme” should not be allowed in the Oval Office. “Perhaps justice will be done,” the GOP nominee said of the development. In his statement, Podesta demanded that the FBI director “provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter” to lawmakers. 
“Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,” Podesta said. “In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. 
“It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,” Podesta added. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said nothing had “surfaced to change the president’s opinion and views of Secretary Clinton.” 
“He’s going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day,” Schultz said. In July, Comey announced that while Clinton and her aides during her tenure as secretary of State had been “extremely careless” in the way they’d handled classified information, he recommended that no criminal charges be filed. 
In her press conference Friday, Clinton said she was “confident” whatever is included in the new messages under review “will not change the conclusion reached in July.” In July, Comey testified before skeptical Republican lawmakers to explain the bureau’s recommendation, which had been adopted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. 
“We’re mystified and confused by the fact pattern you laid out and the conclusion you reached,” House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Comey. Comey, however, was unequivocal in maintaining that the conclusion of investigators was not a close call. 
“There is no way anybody would bring a case against John Doe or Hillary Clinton for the second time in 100 years based on those facts,” he told the House panel on July 7. Trump has cited the closed FBI probe as evidence that the election was “rigged” against him, and at a recent debate the GOP nominee said that, if he’s elected president, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton. 
Following Comey’s announcement Friday, Republicans blasted the Democratic presidential nominee. “Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. 
“This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators,” Ryan said in a statement, adding that he was again calling for Clinton to no longer receive classified briefings, a traditional courtesy afforded major-party presidential nominees. 
Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said the timing of the decision, so soon before the election, demonstrated “how serious this discovery must be.” Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on Twitter that “a great day in our campaign just got even better.” A great day in our campaign just got even better. FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe @CNNPolitics https://t.co/WBltG2lAK6 
— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 28, 2016 
Meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that “without knowing how many emails are involved, who wrote them, when they were written or their subject matter, it’s impossible to make any informed judgment on this development.” 
She added: ” The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results. Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.” 
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi accused Republicans of attempting to “misrepresent” the FBI’s work. “Sadly but predictably, Republicans are doing their best to … warp the FBI’s work to serve their partisan conspiracy-mongering against Hillary Clinton,” Pelosi said. 
The uncertainty of what the new FBI review will yield, and when it will be completed, leaves open the question of how much of an impact it will have on the presidential campaign, as Trump looks to mount what would be a historic comeback, as polls show him trailing nationally and in key battleground states. 
“Unless the FBI closes this new investigation one way or the other next week, the likely impact will be to cut into Clinton’s margin, with the bigger effect being on down-ballot races than on the outcome of the presidential election,” said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in an emailed statement. 
Whatever the long-term impact, the short-term jolt to Trump and his supporters, at least, seemed clear. 
In his New Hampshire speech, the GOP nominee suggested the rest of his message for the day would no longer matter as much, given the FBI announcement. “The rest of my speech is going to be so boring,” he joked.",0
18236,"Italy’s ‘Fertility Day’ Call to Make Babies Arouses Anger, Not Ardor - The New York Times","ROME  —   One ad pictured a woman holding an hourglass next to the words: “Beauty has no age limit. Fertility does. ” Another portrayed a pair of baby shoes wrapped in a ribbon of the Italian flag. Yet another showed a man holding a   cigarette: “Don’t let your sperm go up in smoke,” it read. They were part of a government effort to promote “Fertility Day” on Sept. 22, a campaign intended to encourage Italians to have more babies. Instead, the ads set off a furor, were denounced as being offensive, and within days were withdrawn. What they did succeed in doing, however, was to ignite a deeper and lasting debate about why it is that Italy has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, and what can be done about it. The problem is not a lack of desire to have children, critics of the campaign say, but rather the lack of meaningful support provided by the government and many employers in a country where the family remains the primary source of child care. “I should be a model for their campaign, and I still feel very offended,” said Vittoria Iacovella, 37, a journalist and mother of two girls, ages 10 and 8. “The government encourages us to have babies, and then the main welfare system in Italy is still the grandparents. ” Many working women, without an extended family to care for a child, face a dilemma, as private child care is expensive. Some also worry that their job security may be undermined by missing workdays because of child care issues. Many companies do not offer flexible hours for working mothers. Not surprisingly, Italy’s long slowdown in childbirth has coincided with its recent economic slump. But Italian families have been shrinking for decades. In 2015, 488, 000 babies were born in Italy, the fewest since the country first unified in 1861. It has one of the lowest birthrates in Europe, with 1. 37 children per woman, compared with a European average of 1. 6, according to Eurostat figures. By contrast, in France, the economy has been flat, too, but a   system provides a far more generous social safety net that includes day care and subsidies for families to have children. There, women have two children each on average. “On paper, Italian women have equal rights,” said Tiziana Bartolini, the editor of Noi Donne, one of Italy’s most prominent feminist magazines. “But reality tells us a different story. Women are expected to care for children. If they live in regions where services are good, or in small towns, they keep their job. If they live in big, chaotic cities and have no family nearby, they are very prudent about becoming pregnant. “Or they stop working,” she added. The Ministry of Health began the fertility campaign on Aug. 31 with a group of online advertisements and a hashtag on Twitter. The goal was to publicize a series of public meetings on Fertility Day and encourage Italians to have more children. Yeah, sure, thought Maria Scioli, 41, a teacher who depends on her family to care for her    boy, when she spotted the debate on her Facebook page. “I’d love to have a second child,” Ms. Scioli said, “but my job situation worries me. And I even feel lucky. I think about all those women my age or younger that couldn’t have babies and had to watch that offensive ad. ” Even Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose own health minister started the campaign, distanced himself from the ads in a radio interview, noting ironically that none of his friends “had their kids after seeing an advert. ” Mr. Renzi said that to increase the birthrate, structural issues like day care and services needed to be addressed. Under Mr. Renzi, Italy’s government has tried to help families with a   baby bonus of 80 to 160 euros, or about $90 to $180, for   and   households, and it has approved labor laws giving more flexibility on parental leave. But Italy allocates only 1 percent of its gross domestic product to social protection benefits  —   half the European average. One child out of three here is at risk of relative poverty. “Italy has a terrible combination: low birthrate, low women’s employment and high risk of child poverty,” said Alessandro Rosina, a professor of demography at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. “On this path, Italy can only but have increasing costs for aging people, and increased public debt. ” “We defend our present, but can’t design the future,” Professor Rosina said. Figures from Istat, the national statistics agency, show that Italian women with children are far less likely to work than mothers in other European countries, which provide greater social services. In much of northern Europe, where social services are greater, about 70 percent of women work  —   and almost all of them continue to work after having children. By comparison, according to Eurostat, Italy has the   female employment rate in Europe, especially in the south. “So many young women are even asked to presign a resignation letter here, especially in small companies,” said Teresa Potenza, a longtime women’s advocate in Naples, referring to a practice in which some women are asked to sign a resignation letter in case of pregnancy before they are hired. “Even to all those women, that campaign is a punch to the gut. ” “Without the ‘family welfare,’ I would have never been able to have children myself,” Ms. Potenza said. Ms. Iacovella, the journalist, said her child’s kindergarten closed two hours before she got off work and noted that working mothers “are frustrated by the little help that Italy gives to women. ” She was so offended by the government advertisements that she vented her anger on Facebook soon after they started appearing, and her comments went viral online. Italy’s health minister, Beatrice Lorenzin, responding on Facebook, wrote that the Fertility Day campaign was not a “call to reproduction” but a day to discuss “the fertility issues that 15 percent of Italians deal with. ” She promptly canceled the campaign. “I am saddened that the launch of the advertising campaign misled many people,” Ms. Lorenzin said. “I withdrew it to change it. ”",0

18238,Russia's FSB arrests Ukrainian terrorists in Sevastopol (Video),"November 11, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski -  


The Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia has published footage of the arrest of saboteurs from the Ukrainian defense ministry in Sevastopol. 
As reported earlier, a saboteur-terrorist group from the Ukrainian ministry of defense planning terrorist attacks on military targets in Crimea was arrested in Sevastopol.  A source from Russian security agencies told Interfax: “All three of the arrested are citizens of Ukraine. They are suspected of preparing acts of sabotage on the peninsula.”   

“Russian law enforcement had operative information on saboteurs’ infiltration of the peninsula around two weeks ago. Tight surveillance followed them to identify their contacts, routines of travel and communication, and the operation contributed to the identification of informants on the peninsula. In this regard, new arrests are not ruled out,” he added.  
It is now known that the detainees in Sevastopol were staff officers of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. They pleaded guilty and offered confessions. 
During the search of their apartments, a map was discovered with marked military facilities and infrastructure targets on the Crimean peninsula. The source added that “considering the interrogations of those arrested, it has been established that they were preparing acts of sabotage against power plants, water purification plants, and also gas distribution networks in Crimea.”  

The video footage shows the capture of one of the Ukrainian terrorists and the search of his apartment, where FSB officers found weapons and ammunition. The clip also shows security forces recovered a package, presumably of explosives, from an underground safe.

18239,"Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-Destroying – The Resistance: The Last Line of Defense","Home Leftist Corruption Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-Destroying Wikileaks Gives Hillary An Ultimatum: QUIT, Or We Dump Something Life-Destroying Freedom Leftist Corruption , Leftist Perversion , News 0 
On Sunday, Wikileaks gave Hillary Clinton less than a 24-hour window to drop out of the race or they will dump something that will destroy her “completely.” 
Recently, Julian Assange confirmed that WikiLeaks was not working with the Russian government , but in their pursuit of justice they are obligated to release anything that they can to bring light to a corrupt system – and who could possibly be more corrupt than Crooked Hillary? 
“The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That’s false – we can say that the Russian government is not the source,” Assange said in a recent interview. “Hillary Clinton is just one person. I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick – for example faint – as a result of going on, and going with their ambitions. But she represents a whole network of people, and a whole network of relationships with particular states.” 
“Hey, @HillaryClinton, you have until Monday to drop out, or we will destroy you completely,” the cryptic tweet says. 
It is unknown what information WikiLeaks has that has not already been released. Is it proof that Bill molested children when he was with his friend Epstein? Is it something, dare I say, worse? 
Part of me hopes that she stays in the race so we can find out what it is. The rest of me just wants her gone.

18240,Illegal Aliens in Maryland HS Bathroom Sex Case Face Child Porn Charges,"Prosecutors in the “sanctuary state” of Maryland are dropping sexual offense charges against the illegal aliens accused of sexually assaulting a    girl in a high school bathroom. The Rockville High School freshmen now face charges of distribution of child pornography. [Montgomery County State’s Attorney John McCarthy told reporters “The facts no longer support the original charges filed,” the Washington Post reported. Prosecutors are now focusing their efforts on allegations of child pornography distribution after police found images of the victim on both suspects’ cell phones.  Defense attorneys appeared to admit to the crime, telling the Washington, D. C. newspaper the girl willingly shared the images with one of the defendants. The images were then passed along to the other, they said. Henry Sanchez Milian’s attorney, Andrew Jezic, attempted to downplay the potential new charges saying, “it is hardly uncommon behavior for teenagers. ” Defendant Jose Montano’s attorney, Maria Mena, appeared to deflect to her    client’s   saying the child pornography charges are made to go after adults, the Washington Post reported. Sanchez Milian   old and legally an adult. The national public outcry after the alleged oral, vaginal, and anal rape became public in March was called “racist” and “xenophobic” by Montgomery County Public School Superintendent Dr. Jack Smith. If convicted, Sanchez Milan could face a sentence of five years in prison for child porn distribution charges. The younger Montano could face up to 10 years in prison for possession and distribution of pornography. Lawmakers in various states have been debating how to deal with the issue of teenagers sexting photos of their underage classmates, Breitbart News reported. In the lead up to filing sexual assault charges, law enforcement investigators reported the young teen said she cried out in pain and begged them to stop. A forensic investigator found blood and bodily fluids in the boys’ bathroom.  ’s attorney countered that the young girl “actively planned a sexual encounter,” and a school video showed the girl and the    accused teen walking into the bathroom together. Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) told Breitbart News’ Katie McHugh, “The only reason the older youth, Sanchez Milian, was in the country at all was because of the Obama administration’s catch and release policies that allowed him to be resettled in Maryland (with the support of taxpayers) with few questions asked. ” “Few groups of illegal immigrants have left such a violent mark in our community as these   unaccompanied minors —  they are almost like modern day Marielitos (the Cuban inmates released by Fidel Castro decades ago),” she added. “Dozens have been arrested for violent crimes in Maryland, New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Texas. ”    Henry Sanchez Milian, an El Salvadorian national, and    Jose Montano from Guatemala were enrolled as freshmen at the high school. As reported by Breitbart News: The 1982 Supreme Court Case Plyler v. Doe forbids public schools from withholding taxpayer funding from illegal aliens, allowing them to enroll in schools meant to educate citizens’ children. As Breitbart News has reported, illegal aliens and their children are entitled to U. S.   educations in spite of breaking many U. S. laws. American communities are forced to divert nearly $60 billion in funding each year from their own children to illegals,   students, refugees, and U. S.  children of illegals granted citizenship by a footnote in the   Doe ruling. Milian was encountered by border patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas in August 2016 before the alleged rape on March 16, 2017. He was turned over to the custody of his father. The    had a “pending alien removal” case against him, but he was nevertheless allowed to enroll at Rockville High School. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers detained Henry Sanchez’ father,    Adolfo   after determining the Guatemalan to be an illegal alien, reported Breitbart News on March 27.   is being held at the Howard County Detention Center. Breitbart News reported in 2014 that Montgomery County had been one of the “’most prominent’ sanctuary cities in the country. ” On March 27, U. S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged the state of Maryland to abandon any plans to make Maryland a   “sanctuary state. ” On March 21, the largely Democrat Maryland House of Delegates approved the Maryland Law Enforcement and Trust Act which would prevent police officers from asking a suspect about their immigration status. It would prevent police officers from giving illegal aliens to federal authorities unless “required by federal law. ” Officers would also have to get a warrant before complying with an ICE detainer request. As reported by Breitbart News, Maryland’s Republican Governor Larry Hogan threatened to veto the bill. On Friday, ICE confirmed they are seeking to deport Sanchez Milan to Guatemala, reported the Washington Post. Even though they do not have him in federal custody, ICE has issued a detainer. Montgomery County officials confirmed they will honor the ICE detainer because of the child pornography distribution charges. Editor’s Note: This article has been updated.

18242,Obama running out of time to Pardon Clinton,"Obama running out of time to Pardon Clinton 02.11.2016 AP photo By Michael Wells Friday, 11 days before the American Presidential election, FBI Director James Comey announced that he has re-opened the criminal investigation into Hillary Rodham Clinton , former American First Lady, regarding the private email server that she used to illegally circumvent the government's official, secure digital record storage and retrieval systems. Why she needs to be pardoned During the 4 years that she was Secretary of State under the Obama Administration, she admittedly diverted all official electronic communications that she sent or received through her own email server, which was not secured properly to store sensitive government information. This left the information vulnerable to hacking by criminals or other governments. Moreover, the server was in her non-approved basement location, which even left the digital records subject to possible physical theft. Print version Font Size She controlled which official communications got passed on to the government and which were selectively held back from the historic record of our country, with common sense telling us that the ones that incriminated her never made it to the official record. The collection, removal, or storage of sensitive government documents in an insecure location constitutes espionage under American law, and Clinton's dereliction of duty in securing the electronic documents is all that is needed to prove a crime. Even if she had ""accidentally"" left the information unsecured, her negligence would still constitute espionage . Not done with her yet The announcement by Comey on Friday that the investigation was once again open (based on newly discovered emails that were recovered from a laptop in an unrelated investigation of the husband of one of Clinton's aides) was a serious blow to the Clinton campaign, casting light once again on Clinton's deceptive and megalomaniacal character . (Note: the case was never ""closed."" It was technically still ""open,"" pending finalizations and administrative procedures, but the investigation had completed and the case would have been closed pending those finalizations). Comey had originally declared the case against Clinton closed in July, stating that while Clinton had obviously broken laws, he felt that there was no reason to prosecute. This was a truly baffling decision, as the publicly-known facts of the case alone are enough to bring a successful espionage indictment. Not only had Clinton secretly housed and controlled government documents at her home, she actively destroyed subpoenaed documents . Clinton and her aides showed clear intent to mislead investigators in the face of a "" mountain of evidence of her criminal behavior ."" ""Although there is evidence of potential violations regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,"" Comey stated in July when he originally ""closed"" the case. Equal treatment under the law Any other person in America who was investigated for mishandling state secrets, and there was ""evidence of potential violations regarding the handling of classified information,"" would face a swift and unpleasant prosecution for the Capital offense of espionage. They would be held in prison while the investigation and trial proceeded. One Navy submariner was recently charged with espionage for taking selfies in the engine room where he worked. Once he realized he was being investigated, he destroyed a laptop, cell phone, and memory card. He was charged under the Espionage Act and pleaded guilty to Retaining Classified Information on his phone, but the Obstruction of Justice charged was dropped. Even so, he faces 10 years in prison. By comparison, Clinton removed thousands of government documents, controlled which ones the government had access to, and housed them at her home for years exposed to hackers. According to the U. S. Code , this crime carries varying levels of prison time and monetary fines, with a maximum penalty of death, at the judge's disposal based on the actual specifics and severity of the case. The re-opening of the case is based on the recovery of several thousand new email messages, and it is going to take time to review and analyze the new material. This is not a task that will be completed before the Presidential election on November 8. Therefore, Hillary Rodham Clinton will be the first Presidential candidate in history to be under criminal investigation for espionage by the FBI at the time of the election... unless she is pardoned first . It seems that the only chance her campaign has of winning now is if she receives a Presidential pardon, and quickly. This would completely absolve Clinton of any wrongdoing concerning her email server, and prevent her from being subject to prosecution for the crime or any related crimes, now or in the future. Her espionage crimes against the country would vanish, as though she had never done anything wrong. The Clinton Family would simply walk away from Hillary's 4-year international crime spree that resulted in the deaths of many of our most loyal Americans, while she represented the United States of America and wielded all the power that comes with being the Head of State to her personal gain. Obama had better hurry The sooner President Obama pardons her, the better the chance of Clinton's campaign successfully righting itself by feeding lies to the voters and attacking her opponent, Donald Trump . Having been pardoned will restore much of her credibility with her voters, who would tend to see it as a statement of innocence. With only 10 days until the election, Obama will need to act quickly to save his magnificent successor and seal his legacy as the true enabler of the most corrupt politician in history .President Obama pardoned 98 people Thursday, bringing the total number of people that he has expunged of guilt this year to 688. According to USA Today , this is ""the most commutations ever granted by a president in a single year."" It sounds like President Obama is quite familiar with the process of ""officially forgiving"" criminals for their digressions against humanity. Why wouldn't he forgive yet another career criminal, then, in a desperate bid to keep his political party in power? It's obvious that he will . He is too much of a pawn for the Clinton Machine to rise up against their power. That's why the world witnessed the head of the Justice Department (Loretta Lynch) improperly meet with Bill Clinton (the husband of the subject of an ongoing Justice Department criminal investigation) in a jet in Phoenix. That's why Lynch promised to accept the findings of the FBI during the first Clinton investigation, no matter what conclusion they reached - even though she had never done that before. And that's why you saw James Comey buckle and ""close"" the case the first time. It was (obviously, to the layman) a badly orchestrated ""pretend Hillary didn't break the law"" order that came down from Obama. James Comey stopped his investigation, as he was instructed, and came up with the ""she's guilty but we're not going to prosecute"" line. Director Comey has finally stood up to Clinton by ""re-opening"" the case, and he's playing a dangerous game by investigating her again. It is a widely accepted notion that crossing the Clintons can result in one's death , usually with ""suicide"" or ""unusual circumstances"" listed as the cause. Of course, there are rarely and suspects charged in these cases. Keep them out In my opinion, the world would be a better place without the Clintons in power, and America should keep them out of the Whitehouse at all costs. The FBI won't have time to indict Hillary before Obama pardons her, and the most corrupt politician in history will be cleansed of all wrongdoing, ready to destroy the most powerful office in the world with her greed and sense of entitlement.

18243,"Two Russian Compounds, Caught Up in History’s Echoes - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   A pair of luxurious waterfront compounds outside New York and Washington have for decades been a retreat for Russian diplomats, places to frolic in the water, play tennis and take lengthy steam baths. On Thursday, Obama administration officials described the compounds differently: as beachside spy nests sometimes used by Russian intelligence operatives to have long conversations on the sand to avoid being ensnared by American electronic surveillance. They ordered all Russians out of the compounds within 24 hours. The move was one of a number of retaliatory measures the White House announced in response to what it called a Russian campaign to wreak havoc on the presidential election, and to what it said was systemic harassment of American officials in Russia. Besides the shuttering of the two compounds, administration officials announced the expulsion by Sunday of 35 unnamed Russian officials  —   and their families  —   who they said were working undercover as spies. The announcement had echoes of the    reprisals that were common during the Cold War, and the government of Vladimir V. Putin announced within hours that there would be a swift response. That seemingly ensured that the Obama administration’s final days would be consumed by escalating accusations and retaliation between Washington and Moscow. The Obama administration offered no proof on Thursday linking the two compounds or the Russians being expelled to intelligence activities, and veterans of the spy games offered mixed assessments of the administration’s actions. “I think these sanctions are pretty weak. It’s more perhaps symbolic,” said Steven Hall, a former senior C. I. A. official who ran Russia operations until his retirement in 2015. But Mr. Hall said that the other measures could cause more irritation in Moscow. He said that he could not recall a previous move similar to the shuttering of the two compounds  —   one on Long Island and the other on the Eastern Shore of Maryland  —   and that expelling the 35 officers and their families “will slow down Russia’s activities in the United States. ” One former senior American official said that the group, made up of officials working at the embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco, makes up about a third of the suspected Russian intelligence officers operating in the United States under diplomatic cover. It is unclear how many of the expelled Russians spent time at the two compounds. The dismissals are believed to be the largest expulsion of Russian officials from the United States since 2001, when about 50 suspected Russian intelligence officers were forced to leave after Robert Hanssen, a senior F. B. I. official, was arrested and charged with spying for Moscow. “I would be flabbergasted if the Russians didn’t reciprocate and expel 35 American officials from Russia,” Mr. Hall said. The C. I. A. has long posted undercover officers in Russia  —   and nearly every other country in the world  —   who pose as diplomats, businessmen or other professionals. It is unclear whether any of the Russians being expelled played a part in the hacking that interfered with the American election. Law enforcement officials said that the White House and the State Department had come up with the number 35 and had then turned to the F. B. I. to list Russian officials in the United States who it believed were actually intelligence officers. While the expulsions send a powerful message, they will force the F. B. I. to go back to work trying to identify a new crop of spies the Russians will almost certainly send to the United States. After the expulsions were announced, officials described a pattern of harassment of American government employees working in Russia. In June, a uniformed officer with Russia’s Federal Security Service, called the F. S. B. attacked an employee of the United States Embassy in Moscow seemingly without provocation. “Our diplomats have experienced an unacceptable level of harassment in Moscow by Russian security services and police over the last year,” President Obama said in a statement on Thursday. Before this year, the most notable recent episode to become public was in 2013, when Russian officials arrested Ryan C. Fogle, an employee of the embassy in Moscow who the Russian government had discovered was a C. I. A. officer. Mr. Fogle, officially posted in Russia as the third secretary of the embassy’s political department, was picked up on the street wearing a blond wig under a baseball cap. He was carrying a knapsack holding a compass, a Moscow street atlas and $130, 000 in cash, money that Russian officials said was meant to be used to recruit a Russian security officer as a spy. The episode’s amusing details garnered much of the attention, but Mr. Fogle’s arrest and expulsion from Russia was a public indicator that the spying activity between the United States and Russia was heating up  —   and in many ways had never ended. The F. S. B. took the unusual step of releasing a video showing Mr. Fogle facedown on a street as a Russian officer pinned his hands behind his back. American law enforcement and intelligence agencies have little indication that the compounds in Maryland and New York played any role in the cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. The Long Island retreat is a   estate in Upper Brookville, known as Norwich House. Upper Brookville’s mayor, Elliot Conway, confirmed on Friday that the federal government had ordered the house shut. Federal agents could been seen on Friday morning in the estate’s driveway, shortly before four vehicles with diplomatic license plates drove away. A few of the people in the cars waved to reporters, in an apparent goodbye. The Russian government has owned the property, and another one nearby in Glen Cove, since the days of the Soviet Union, and relations between the owners and local residents have at times been strained. In 1982, Reagan administration officials said Russians were using the Glen Cove mansion to conduct electronic surveillance of Long Island’s defense and technology industries. The Glen Cove City Council responded by barring the Russians from obtaining free beach parking stickers and discounted tennis permits. The Council’s lone dissenting voice described taking away the tennis permits as “petty” and said that “it’s a matter the professionals at the State Department should handle. ” On Thursday, White House and F. B. I. officials said it was the Glen Cove estate, Killenworth Mansion, that was being shuttered. On Friday, they confirmed that it was in fact the Upper Brookville house. The Maryland compound is a sprawling complex of several buildings fronting the Corsica River in Centreville, including a   brick   mansion that has long been a retreat for Russia’s ambassador to Washington. It has a swimming pool, a soccer field and lighted tennis courts. Anatoly Dobrynin, who served as ambassador to Washington from the Kennedy administration to the Reagan administration, was frequently at the estate, and the Russian government held on to the property after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unlike on Long Island, relations between the Russians visiting the Maryland compound and local residents have generally been placid  —   even if the Russians did not always adopt the local folkways. Julie Patterson, 44, who has lived on a horse farm near the compound for 12 years, said the Russians largely kept to themselves but were cordial neighbors, inviting locals to an annual Labor Day party. She said that she believed that the property was largely used as a weekend retreat and that she often saw children, families and buses heading to the estate. She said people often held parties there and hosted a sailing club. In 1992, a Centreville resident told a reporter for The Associated Press that the Russians did not cook crabs the local way, by throwing live crabs into a pot of boiling water. “They stab them with a screwdriver, break the back shell off, clean them and then boil the body,” she said.",0
18244,"Obama Vetoes 9/11 Bill, but Congressional Override Is Expected - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   President Obama vetoed legislation on Friday that would allow families of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot, setting up an extraordinary confrontation with a Congress that unanimously backed the bill and has vowed to uphold it. Mr. Obama’s   veto of the measure, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, is the 12th of his presidency. But unless those who oppose the bill can persuade lawmakers to drop their support by next week, it will lead to the first congressional override of a veto during Mr. Obama’s presidency  —   a familiar experience for presidents in the waning months of their terms. In his veto message to Congress, Mr. Obama said the legislation “undermines core U. S. interests,” upending the normal means by which the government singles out foreign nations as state sponsors of terrorism and opening American officials and military personnel to legal jeopardy. It would put United States assets at risk of seizure by private litigants overseas and “create complications” in diplomatic relations with other countries, he added. “I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, who have suffered grievously,” Mr. Obama wrote. But enacting the measure “would neither protect Americans from terrorist attacks nor improve the effectiveness of our response to such attacks. ” Mr. Obama issued the veto behind closed doors on Friday without fanfare, reluctant to call attention to a debate that has pitted him against the families of terrorism victims. Not long before he did so, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, who had previously backed the measure, confirmed that if she were in the Oval Office, she would sign it. Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee, also said he would have signed the bill, calling Mr. Obama’s veto “shameful. ” The leaders of both chambers, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have said they expect the override vote to be successful, which requires a   majority. Mr. McConnell’s office said it would consider the veto message “as soon as practicable in this work period,” essentially ruling out the possibility, pressed by opponents of the measure, that the vote could be delayed until after the elections, when lawmakers might feel less political pressure to support the bill. Still, pressure is building on Congress to reconsider the measure, whose passage underlined the lasting political clout of the   families that have long demanded it  —   and the diminishing standing of Saudi Arabia and its supporters in Washington. Mr. Obama argues that the measure would overturn longstanding principles of international law that shield governments from lawsuits, potentially opening the United States to a raft of litigation in foreign countries. But supporters note that those principles already have several exceptions, and contend they are merely seeking to add another narrow one that would allow United States courts to hold foreign governments responsible if they assisted or funded a terrorist attack that killed Americans in the United States. Saudi officials have denied that the kingdom had any role in the Sept. 11 plot, and an independent commission that investigated the attacks found “no evidence” that the government or any senior official funded it. But the commission’s narrow wording left open the possibility that less senior officials or parts of the Saudi government had played a role. The Saudi government has deployed powerful lobbyists and public relations professionals to try to kill the measure. In recent days, it has turned to national security leaders, Fortune 100 corporate executives and retired military personnel for backing. White House officials were making the case to lawmakers that they should sustain the president’s veto. “We continue to make a forceful case to members of Congress that overriding the president’s veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U. S. service members, and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said before Mr. Obama vetoed the measure. He acknowledged that the stance was “politically inconvenient,” given the strong sympathy that exists for the families of the victims. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called Mr. Obama’s action “disappointing,” and said it would be “swiftly and soundly overturned in Congress. ” “If the Saudis did nothing wrong, they should not fear this legislation,” Mr. Schumer said. In a statement, the Sept. 11 families said they were “outraged and dismayed at the president’s veto” and the “unconvincing and unsupportable reasons that he offers as explanation. ” “When we left at 5 o’clock yesterday, we were feeling very confident that we would have the votes for the override, but we’ve got to maintain that support through until next week,” said Terry Strada, a leading activist on the bill who lost her husband on Sept. 11 and was one of dozens of family members who traveled to Washington this week to lobby lawmakers to continue backing it. “Nobody is going to sleep this whole weekend. ”",0

18246,Bangladeshi Assault Kills 2 Militants but Fails to End Standoff - The New York Times,"DHAKA, Bangladesh  —   Bangladeshi troops using armored vehicles and firing bullets and tear gas assaulted an apartment house on Sunday in the northeastern city of Sylhet, killing two of the militants besieged in the building, the authorities said. But the troops did not succeed in ending a violent   standoff that has left six other people dead, including two police officers, and has injured at least 43. Zedan Al Musa, an additional deputy commissioner of the Sylhet Metropolitan Police, said in a telephone interview that the injured included two officers of the army’s antiterrorism Rapid Action Battalion, including its director of intelligence, Lt. Col. Abul Kalam Azad. A spokesman for the battalion, Cmdr. Mufti Mahmud Khan, said on Sunday that Colonel Azad was in critical condition and had been flown to Singapore for treatment. The six deaths and most of the injuries, including those to the colonel, occurred Saturday night, Commissioner Musa said, when two explosions were set off by   militants at a checkpoint about 400 yards from the apartment building, where a crowd had gathered. The Islamic State claimed responsibility on social media “for a bombing on Bangladeshi forces in Sylhet,” according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist communications. Bangladesh’s elite police forces have been trying to crack down on militant groups since a deadly attack on a restaurant last year, arresting and sometimes killing suspected militants. The   attacks that had become commonplace in the country in recent years have largely stopped. Reports of attacks on religious minorities have increased in recent weeks, though, including the killings of a Sufi spiritual leader and his daughter and an attack on a Bangladeshi Christian. So far, neither crime has been officially linked to extremists. The Sylhet siege follows a week of botched suicide bombings in Dhaka. A man detonated explosives on Friday at a police checkpoint near the international airport in Dhaka, killing only himself, the police said. The Islamic State claimed responsibility. Mr. Musa said the police began the Sylhet operation Thursday night, when they received word that militants were hiding on the ground floor of the   building on the edge of the city. He said officers cordoned off the building that evening, and were joined Friday by a specially trained police unit from Dhaka. More than 70 residents of the building were evacuated that day, he said, and army commandos took over the operation Saturday. Brig. Gen. Fakhrul Ahsan said in a televised news conference that the militants had small arms, explosives and suicide vests, and had planted improvised explosive devices in the building. “They are well trained, and have thrown back the grenades we lobbed at them,” he said. Army commandos led the assault on Sunday, General Ahsan said. The two militants killed were wearing suicide vests, and one of them managed to set his off, the general said, adding that one or two more militants were believed to still be in the building. “The operation will take more time,” he said. “There are risks involved, and we are not in any hurry. ”",0
18247,Ford Expands Costly Door Latch Recall - The New York Times,"Ford will spend $640 million to replace door latches on nearly 2. 4 million cars, trucks and vans because the doors can pop open while the vehicles are moving. On Thursday, the company announced it would add 1. 5 million vehicles to the growing   recall, which has become so costly that Ford had to cut its estimated   pretax profit to $10. 2 billion from at least $10. 8 billion. Customers have been complaining about the problem, which has affected much of Ford’s North American model lineup, since 2014. At least three million vehicles have been recalled after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation found 1, 200 customer complaints about doors failing to latch. Thursday’s announcement came under pressure from the highway safety agency, which deemed an Aug. 4 recall of about 830, 000 vehicles inadequate. Ford said in a regulatory filing that the $640 million would cover the cost of both the Thursday recall and the one announced Aug. 4. The latest recall includes the   Ford Focus, the   Ford Escape and   the 2015 Ford Mustang and Lincoln MKC and the   Ford Transit Connect small van. Ford says a spring tab in the door latches can break, and the doors either won’t close or could pop open. Dealers will replace the latches without charge. The company said it knows of one crash and three injuries that may be related to the problem. The Aug. 4 recall was limited to Mexico and 16 states with high temperatures and sunlight exposure because, Ford said, the rate of reports of failure was higher. Customers can check whether their vehicle is included on ford. com by clicking on safety recalls and entering their vehicle identification number.",0
18248,Michael Moore Owes Me $4.99,"Email 
Michael Moore has made some terrific movies in the past, and Where to Invade Next may be the best of them, but I expected Trumpland to be (1) about Trump, (2) funny, (3) honest, (4) at least relatively free of jokes glorifying mass murder. I was wrong on all counts and would like my $4.99 back, Michael. 
Moore’s new movie is a film of him doing a stand-up comedy show about how wonderfully awesome Hillary Clinton is — except that he mentions Trump a bit at the beginning and he’s dead serious about Clinton being wonderfully awesome. 
This film is a text book illustration of why rational arguments for lesser evilist voting do not work. Lesser evilists become self-delusionists. They identify with their lesser evil candidate and delude themselves into adoring the person. Moore is not pushing the “Elect her and then hold her accountable” stuff. He says we have a responsibility to “support her” and “get behind her,” and that if after two years — yes, TWO YEARS — she hasn’t lived up to a platform he’s fantasized for her, well then, never fear, because he, Michael Moore, will run a joke presidential campaign against her for the next two years (this from a guy who backed restricting the length of election campaigns in one of his better works). 
Moore maintains that virtually all criticism of Hillary Clinton is nonsense. What do we think, he asks, that she asks how many millions of dollars you’ve put into the Clinton Foundation and then she agrees to bomb Yemen for you? Bwahahaha! Pretty funny. Except that Saudi Arabia put over $10 million into the Clinton Foundation, and while she was Secretary of State Boeing put in another $900,000, upon which Hillary Clinton reportedly made it her mission to get the planes sold to Saudi Arabia, despite legal restrictions — the planes now dropping U.S.-made bombs on Yemen with U.S. guidance, U.S. refueling mid-air, U.S. protection at the United Nations, and U.S. cover in the form of pop-culture distraction and deception from entertainers like Michael Moore. 
Standing before a giant Air Force missile and enormous photos of Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore claims that substantive criticism of Clinton can consist of only two things, which he dismisses in a flash: her vote for a war on Iraq and her coziness with Wall Street. He says nothing more about what that “coziness” consists of, and he claims that she’s more or less apologized and learned her lesson on Iraq. 
What? It wasn’t one vote. It was numerous votes to start the war, fund it, and escalate it. It was the lies to get it going and keep it going. It’s all the other wars before and since. 
*She says President Obama was wrong not to launch missile strikes on Syria in 2013. *She pushed hard for the overthrow of Qadaffi in 2011. *She supported the coup government in Honduras in 2009. *She has backed escalation and prolongation of war in Afghanistan. *She skillfully promoted the White House justification for the war on Iraq. *She does not hesitate to back the use of drones for targeted killing. *She has consistently backed the military initiatives of Israel. *She was not ashamed to laugh at the killing of Qadaffi. *She has not hesitated to warn that she could obliterate Iran. *She is eager to antagonize Russia. *She helped facilitate a military coup in Ukraine. *She has the financial support of the arms makers and many of their foreign customers. *She waived restrictions at the State Department on selling weapons to Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Qatar, all states wise enough to donate to the Clinton Foundation. *She supported President Bill Clinton’s wars and the power of the president to make war without Congress. *She has advocated for arming fighters in Syria and for a “No Fly” zone. *She supported a surge in Iraq even before President Bush did. 
That’s just her war problem. What about her banking problem, prison problem, fracking problem, corporate trade problem, corporate healthcare problem, climate change problem, labor problem, Social Security problem, etc.? 
Moore parts company from substantive critique in order to lament unproven rightwing claims that Hillary Clinton has murdered various people. “I hope she did,” screams Moore. “That’s who I want as Commander in Chief!” Hee hee hee. 
Then Moore shamelessly pushes the myth that Hillary tried to create single-payer, or at least “universal” healthcare (whatever that is) in the 1990s. In fact, as I heard Paul Wellstone tell it, single-payer easily won the support of Clinton’s focus group, but she buried it for her corporate pals and produced the phonebook-size monstrosity that was dead on arrival but reborn in another form years later as Obamacare. She killed single-payer then, has not supported it since, and does not propose it now. (Well, she does admit in private that it’s the only thing that works, as her husband essentially blurts out in public.) But Moore claims that because we didn’t create “universal” healthcare in the 1990s we all have the blood of millions on our hands, millions whom Hillary would have saved had we let her. 
Moore openly fantasizes: what would it be like if Hillary Clinton is secretly progressive? Remember that Moore and many others did the exact same thing with Obama eight years ago. To prove Clinton’s progressiveness Moore plays an audio clip of her giving a speech at age 22 in which she does not hint at any position on any issue whatsoever. 
Mostly, however, Moore informs us that Hillary Clinton is female. He anticipates “that glorious moment when the other gender has a chance to run this world and kick some righteous ass.” Now tell me please, dear world, if your ass is kicked by killers working for a female president will you feel better about it? How do you like Moore’s inclusive comments throughout his performance: “We’re all Americans, right?” 
Moore’s fantasy is that Clinton will dash off a giant pile of executive orders, just writing Congress out of the government — executive orders doing things like releasing all nonviolent drug offenders from prison immediately (something the real Hillary Clinton would oppose in every way she could). 
But when he runs for president, Moore says, he’ll give everybody free drugs. 
I’ll tell you the Clinton ad I’d like to see. She’s standing over a stove holding an egg. “This is your brain,” she says solemnly, cracking it into the pan with a sizzle. “This is your brain on partisanship.”",0
18249,Magnificent Jellyfish Gardens Purify The Water While Growing Food,"These Jellyfish Lodges are capable of purifying waterways, collecting discarded trash, and even growing nutritious food! By Amanda Froelich 
Intriguing eco-friendly innovations are unveiled all the time, but the floating Jellyfish Lodge is probably unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. In addition to being aesthetically appealing, the lodges can purify the land, air, and water and grow nourishing food.
Designer Janine Hung relays that the structures combine trash-collecting tentacles, aquaponic gardens, and a filtration system that all work to benefit the environment.

The solar-powered lodges utilize aquaponic technology to grow fruits and vegetables while cleaning the air with an electrostatic system. Each structure features and interior garden that thrives by filtering polluted water. Additionally, long tentacle arms which appear similar to a jellyfish’s collect drifting trash without harming wildlife.
Unfortunately, it’s not likely this design will be realized, as it only received an Honorable Mention award in this year’s Biodesign Competition , reports Inhabitat . However, it’s so neat we figured the concept needed to be shared.


An intriguing feature of the lodge is that it can test water for toxicity and start the process of treating water through a unique microbial digestion chamber. Once the water is purified, it can be returned to the surrounding environment.
If these structures are eventually created, they’d ideally be maintained by nearby residents who could utilize the foods in their holistic kitchens .

Hung hopes that the Jellyfish Lodges are eventually constructed to serve as a solution to problems plaguing the world’s waterways, including acidification and pollution .

18250,"Actor, Trump Supporter Antonio Sabato Jr. Running For Congress in California","Soap opera star and Donald Trump supporter Antonio Sabato Jr. is set to make his own foray into politics with a run for Congress in California. [According to the Los Angeles Times, the    General Hospital and Melrose Place star will challenge Democratic Rep. Julia Brownley in California’s 26th Congressional district, which encompasses a large portion of Ventura County and part of the central coast.  The actor  —   who has competed on Dancing with the Stars and worked as a model  —   spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of Trump in July. Sabato strategist and fundraiser Charles Moran told the Times that the actor’s experience at the convention sparked his own desire to affect change in Washington. “Being a Republican and with proximity to the White House and Republican leadership, he’s going to be able to get more done  —   being in the majority, with his notoriety, for the residents of the 26th [Congressional] District,” Moran told the paper. Sabato was a vocal supporter of Trump throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. At the Republican convention in July, the actor  —   who immigrated from Italy to the United States in 1985  —   said he had never considered himself to be a political person before, but expressed concern about the direction of the United States, and said those wishing to enter the country should follow the same procedures he did nearly thirty years ago. “Having secure borders, protecting our citizens, none of this is hateful,” Sabato said at the time. “This is the responsibility of the government. And it’s the right thing to do. ” The candidate will reportedly campaign with a focus on veterans and substance abuse issues. In August, Sabato said in an interview that he had been blacklisted from Hollywood due to his political beliefs. “t’s not just me. I know a lot of people in the industry who are in the same boat,” he told Variety. “The reality is if you’re associated with the Republican Party, the casting directors and producers already blacklist you based on that. ”   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0
18251,Future Diwali celebrations to be organized by ISIS!,"Monday, 31 October 2016 Diwali firework celebrations cause environmental disaster over India!! 
This weekend's Diwali celebrations all over India have caused more pollution than Chinese factories produce in a year! The WHO measured record levels of air pollution hanging above major cities and declared India an environmental catastrophe! 
The Indian government refused to comment on the catastrophe fueling the idea that they purposely allowed, encouraged and perpetrated the environmental disaster to happen in the hope that it would cause a cull in their over-bloated population. 
The WHO are sending scientists in to Indian's major cities to find out how many people have died after inhaling huge amounts of smoke caused by their own fireworks. Under the cover of a thick layer of smog, government bulldozers were observed cleaning up the debris, dead bodies and giving holy cows smog masks; the perfect cover-up. 
Exactly how many people did not survive the celebrations is not yet clear because it will take days for the smog to disintegrate, but the Indian Government are hoping the bulldozers will do a fine job and many slums surrounding Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, etc, will be half empty when the smog disappears! 
The annual celebration of suicidal firework displays will continue until the Indian Government cull the population by at least a third and proposals to engage ISIS to help in organizing future Diwali festivals has received a positive response from ISIS fighters fleeing Iraqi bombs in Mosul. ISIS fighters have been promised refuge and amnesty if they can organize mass killings in India just as good as they did in Syria and Iraq! Make Jaggedone's  ",0
18252,California Has 6 of Top 10 Worst Cities for Smog in America - Breitbart,"The American Lung Association’s “State of the Air” report named 6 California cities among the top 10 worst for   smog in the United States. [The Lung Association report card highlighted continued improvement in air quality during 2016. But about 166 million, or 52. 1 percent, of Americans are still at risk from the health effects of air pollution, including higher levels of lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage, and developmental and reproductive harm.  The Lung Association has utilized data averages from the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to calculate its “State of the Air. ” This year’s 17th annual report used 2012, 2013 and 2014   ozone data from America’s 228 major cities in the United States to calculate the top ten “Most   Cities:: The good news from the “State of the Air” report is that most U. S. cities improved their ozone levels. Although Los Angeles dropped its average number of unhealthy days to its lowest level ever recorded, the   still suffers the most ozone pollution in the nation. Another five U. S. cities with historically high ozone levels experienced their lowest number of unhealthy ozone days on average since the report began in 2000, including: Visalia —  Porterfield —  Hanford, CA Sacramento, CA Dallas —  Fort Worth, TX El Centro, CA and Houston, TX. Four other California cities also experienced their lowest number of unhealthy ozone days, including: Bakersfield, CA Fresno —  Madera, CA and Modesto —  Merced, CA. San Diego had more   days on average in this report compared to the 2015 report. Harold P. Wimmer, President and CEO of the American Lung Association commented: Thanks to cleaner power plants and cleaner vehicles, we see a continued reduction of ozone and   particle pollution in the 2016 ‘State of the Air’ report. However, climate change has increased the challenges to protecting public health.   …     There are still nearly 20 million people in the United States that live with unhealthful levels of all three measures of air pollution the report tracks: ozone,   and   particle pollution.",0
18253,Kochs and Other Madoff Investors Are Winners in Fight Over Profits Held Abroad - The New York Times,"The company led by the American billionaire Koch brothers, along with dozens of banks and fund managers, kept billions of dollars in profit from Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme in accounts offshore. As it turns out, that was a good decision. Koch Industries and others who invested in the Madoff fund from offshore accounts won a key ruling in federal bankruptcy court on Monday, when the judge said certain funds held abroad  —   estimated at about $2 billion  —   could not be made available to victims of the Madoff scheme. The ruling highlights the    that has been raging between those who lost money when the scheme fell apart eight years ago and those who walked away before the fraud came to light, having recouped their original investments and then some. Irving H. Picard, the trustee appointed to recover money for the victims, had argued that he should get the money because the investors used   feeder funds that operated in the United States even though they were registered offshore. Those funds gathered investor money on behalf of Mr. Madoff. But Judge Stuart M. Bernstein of Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said foreign bankruptcy proceedings blocked the trustee from accessing the money. A spokeswoman for the trustee, Amanda Remus, said the decision by Judge Bernstein was “under review,” but added she could not comment on next steps. The decision can be appealed to the Federal District Court. Mr. Picard is still trying to recover more than $5 billion for victims. So far, according to his website, he has obtained $11. 5 billion for about $17. 5 billion in claims. Among the largest recoveries have been $5 billion from the estate of the Florida investor Jeffry Picower, $1 billion from Tremont Group, $550 million from the investor Carl J. Shapiro and others, and $470 million from Union Bancaire Privee, a Swiss bank that ran a Madoff fund. Koch Industries is one of 88 cases in which management, service providers and investors received overseas transfers of money. They have been fighting Mr. Picard’s attempts to recover the money, arguing that it was transferred from these overseas accounts to banks and others outside the United States before the fund collapsed. Koch Industries began investing in the Madoff fund well before its collapse and pulled its $21. 5 million out in 2005. The money withdrawn from the Madoff fund went to a fund registered in the British Virgin Islands and then to a Koch entity in Britain. In addition to Koch Industries, several European banks were listed in court papers as having had Madoff money offshore, including HSBC Bank of London, UBS AG and Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an international arm of Merrill Lynch and the French money manager Natixis. Collectively, the institutions represent “a ‘Who’s Who’ of the European investing class,” said Jonathan Sablone, an attorney from the firm Nixon Peabody in New York. The presence of Koch, based in Wichita, Kan. gives the issue “a political tone,” he added. Its main owners, the brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, are known for supporting Republican political candidates and    causes. Koch, whose oil refineries, chemicals, fertilizers and forest products generate estimated annual revenues of $100 billion, is the   privately owned American business after agricultural commodity producer Cargill, according to Forbes magazine. Mr. Picard sued Koch Industries in February 2012, arguing that the money ultimately went back to Koch’s parent company. Asked about the case in June, a Koch Industries spokesman, Rob Carlton, said in a statement: “The Koch entity involved made an investment in an entirely separate fund. That Koch entity no longer exists and its investment was redeemed in 2005, long before anyone knew of Madoff’s fraud. ” Asked for comment about Monday’s ruling, Mr. Carlton declined to comment. A   extraterritoriality issue in this case centers on whether investor money withdrawn from the Madoff feeder funds counted as overseas distributions beyond Mr. Picard’s reach. In Monday’s ruling, Judge Bernstein noted that two key funds in the case are being shut down, and the people engaged in that overseas process are trying to go after the same assets being pursued by Mr. Picard. Although Koch’s name appeared in the Madoff court record as early as 2012, its involvement was not publicly revealed until June 3, when its role in the cases was reported by Bloomberg News. Mr. Picard has noted that the Madoff fund transferred $3 billion to Fairfield Sentry in the six years before the fraud came to light in December 2008, with $1. 6 billion of that total withdrawn in the two years before December 2008, and $1. 1 billion transferred just 90 days before that same date. A July 2014 decision by Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan blocked clawbacks of   transactions outside the United States between foreign parties, in this case money that went from the Madoff firm to foreign funds and then to other investors outside the United States. But in subsequent bankruptcy court filings and arguments, Mr. Picard has said the funds were really in the United States and should thus be fair game. Both main funds at issue “did business in New York, almost all their employees were in New York, they listed New York as their primary place of business, and they dealt with their shareholders from New York,” lawyers for Mr. Picard said in a filing on June 27, 2015. Mr. Madoff, who in March 2009 pleaded guilty to 11 felonies including securities fraud, is serving a   sentence in federal prison in North Carolina.",0

Rares sont ceux qui savent que ce magnifique style de peinture prend ses origines dans la peinture d’icônes. Par Ilaria Kantorova , Pavel Inzhelevsky , Igor Davidov 
L’ancien village russe de Palekh est situéà 350 km au nord-est de Moscou, sur l’Anneau d’or. Inspirés par les styles de peinture d’icônes de Friaj et de Stroganov, les maîtres de Palekh créent leur propre technique. 
La peinture d’icônes de Palekh prospère au début du XIXe siècle. Les icônes fabriquées dans la région se vendent à travers la Russie et à l’étranger. Les peintres de Palekh jouissent d’une grande demande aux niveaux les plus élevés. Lire aussi : Lire et comprendre une icône russe 
Ils furent chargés de peindre les murs du Palais à facettes du Kremlin et de restaurer les fresques des cathédrales du Kremlin de Moscou , du couvent Novodevitchi, de la laure de la Trinité-Saint-Serge, des cathédrales et églises de Pskov et de nombreuses autres villes russes. 
L’Hymne Acathiste au Sauveur, datant du milieu du XVIII e siècle, est la pièce maîtresse des icônes de Palekh. L’Acathiste est un éloge chantéà l’ église . Les hymnes, textes liturgiques et textes poétiques louant la gloire du Christ et de la Sainte Vierge figurent dans de nombreuses œuvres de Palekh. Ce fondement musical se reflète dans la structure de la composition et dans le rythme des couleurs des icônes. Lire aussi : Les secrets de fabrication des plus belles cloches russes 
Dans les Acathistes du milieu du 18e siècle, de 1870 plus précisément, nous retrouvons le trait caractéristique de la peinture de Palekh : le mélange de la peinture de Friaj (dimensionnalité) et de la peinture tardive de Stroganov (plasticité des figures). Ici, nous voyons les constructions composites très complexes. Les peintres d’icônes de Palekh préféraient les compositions complexes avec de nombreux personnages. 
Quand les bolchéviques prirent le pouvoir, la peinture d’icônes subit un brusque coup d’arrêt. Mais, contre toute attente, les maîtres de Palekh trouvèrent une nouvelle niche dans la production de miniatures laquées. Lire aussi :",0
18255,Leighton Meester: Trump’s Election Worse than Birth of Hitler,"If she could change any one event in all of world history  —   including possibly going back in time to thwart genocidal dictators  —   former Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester would choose to ensure Donald Trump lost the 2016 presidential election. [The    actress  —   set to play Paul Revere’s daughter in the upcoming Fox series Making History  —   made the claim in an interview with Yahoo! Style to promote the show.  “Like, if I could snap my fingers? Trump would not be elected. That’s all,” Meester told the outlet. The actress noted that she may have opted to change an altogether different historic event had Trump not won the presidency in November. “As of right now, I feel that way,” she said. “Before Trump, I would have said that Hitler was never born. Humans are so f*cked up. ” Meester wasn’t particularly politically outspoken during the 2016 presidential campaign. But in a recent interview with beauty outlet Byrdie, the actress described the atmosphere in   America as “crazy” and said she found it “challenging” to constantly tune in to the news. The actress added that issues of sexism and climate change continue to plague the country. “I’m not saying we should take these issues for granted. But I think what can’t be as easily defended is the environment, and people are doing irreparable damage,” she said. “It’s pretty unbelievable that there are people out there who don’t think so. They just ignore the facts, and that’s pretty scary. Four years: Maybe we don’t have that long. ” The actress  —   who played socialite Blair Waldorf in the popular Gossip Girl television series  —   is hardly the only star to compare Trump to Nazi leader Hitler. Numerous celebrities, including John Legend, Bill Maher, Louis C. K. Eva Longoria and Cher, to name just a few, have all made the comparison. So have news outlets like the Washington Post. Adolf Hitler oversaw the slaughter of six million Jews, as well as the murders of millions of others, including Polish, Serbian, and Russian political prisoners the mentally and physically handicapped (who often underwent forced sterilization) gypsies, and gay people in concentration camps across Europe during World War II. The Nazi Holocaust of Europe’s Jews  —   who were singled out for destruction  —   is considered the most infamous genocide in modern history. Hitler’s victims were gassed to death, forced on   “death marches,” lined up to be shot in firing lines, and had their remains burned in crematoriums. Others starved to death or died from illnesses and diseases spread throughout the camps. Trump was elected president on November 8, 2016, and it was not immediately clear which of his policies could be reasonably compared to the death and destruction wrought by Hitler.

18256,"I Planned My Wedding in 5 Days. You Could, Too. - The New York Times","It was the day before my wedding, and I still didn’t have a dress. In less than 24 hours, family and friends would be gathering to celebrate the occasion, and at this point my “something borrowed” was going to be an entire church outfit. Was I concerned? Not really, and not for long. I decided to throw a Hail Mary at my mom by asking if she would make a skirt to match the $10 top I found. She did. And it was lovely. My wedding dress was just one of many things I wasn’t concerned about. For example, five days earlier (on a Thursday, which also happened to be New Year’s Eve) I was on the phone with the woman who would become my banquet coordinator. The conversation took place about an hour after I was officially engaged (with an $8. 88 Walmart wedding ring purchased that morning) while hiking in the Sedona Verde Valley in Arizona. It went like this: HER (choking cough) “Excuse me? You’re getting married in five days, and you’re just calling me now?” ME “Well, I actually think I’m being quite generous. I just got engaged, and you’re my first call. I figured I should work out some logistics before texting everyone. And no, I’m not pregnant. ” HER “Well this is unusual. How many people are you expecting?” ME “Probably 100. ” HER (cough) “One hundred people with five days’ notice?” ME “People do it for funerals all the time. If I’ve underestimated, we’ll have leftovers. If I overestimated, I’ll just make my family eat last. ” HER “I’m not sure how to process this. O. K. let’s talk about flowers. ” ME “Ha. No, thank you. ” HER “No flowers?” ME “The room is beautiful enough, so I don’t think anyone will notice. Seems wasteful. ” HER “How about tablecloths and napkin colors?” ME “Just whatever is cheapest and most convenient. ” HER “You don’t have colors?” ME “Well, I guess the only suit my fiancé has right now is navy. Plus, he has a pink tie. So I guess we’ll go with that for our wedding colors. Navy and pink. ” HER “Is this a joke?” The entire luncheon was planned in an hour. Because Rob Reading, now my husband, and I knew each other for four years and had been dating for a year, we already knew we wanted to spend eternity together. (We had already met with our bishops for premarriage approval but had not become officially engaged.) And because of my husband’s maritime work and subsequent transfer from London to the Bay Area, along with my working on the legal team for the Little Sisters of the Poor Supreme Court case, we figured we had two options in the moments after his proposal: get married in a week or in a year. We eagerly decided it was   five days to put my theory to the test. Why five days? Long ago, I became convinced that modern weddings were unnecessarily burdensome. My theory: You could plan a beautiful wedding in a week. The second call I made that day in the desert was to my parents (who told me their prayers were answered). The third call that afternoon was to the Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints. I wasn’t concerned about getting a slot at the temple because early Tuesday morning isn’t prime time for weddings. It was still Day 1 of planning at this point. I already had my ceremony and reception sites secured. Wedding invitations were soon sent (yes, that day) via text message with a collage of selfies saying: “Would love to have you come if you can make it. No gifts. Just love. ” I called in favors from my best friends to do photos, hair and makeup. I pulled strings to get performers and an M. C. for the event. As I was the last of six children to marry (not to mention my 13 foster siblings) my parents certainly weren’t complaining. In addition, the small farm town that I grew up in  —   more cows than humans  —   was rejoicing that the two of us, in our 30s and 40s, were marrying at all. To be sure, five days’ notice was inconvenient for our guests, and there were a few who could not make it. But whether five days or five years, it would have been inconvenient and there would have been those who would have missed it. And surprisingly, there were only a handful of close friends who couldn’t make it, the same rate as any wedding. And some of the best parts? Total planning time: 26 hours. Total cost: $4, 500. The result, on Jan. 5, 2016, was the perfect wedding day. People said that it couldn’t have been more lovely if we had had a year to plan it. No one noticed that we didn’t have flowers. Or, as my mother, Marilyn, said: “Hallelujah! Hallelujah for putting the relationship above a wedding reception. Hallelujah for not worrying about complicated logistics. And hallelujah for not having enough time to change your mind!” Rob kept saying to me throughout the   planning process, “What do you want me to do?” I told him there really wasn’t a lot that has to be done to plan the wedding, and here’s why: With each social expectation for weddings, I asked myself: “Does this achieve the goal of making the people at my wedding feel loved and appreciated for the role they play in my life? Will it help strengthen my marriage and the promises we made to each other?” If the answer was no, I didn’t waste any more time. I now appreciate applying this to other areas of life. Is where we go to dinner eternally significant? If not, it’s not worth arguing over. Do party favors for the barbecue you’re giving matter? Probably not. Enjoy the path of least resistance. If it truly represents the most important elements of your life and relationship, put time, energy and creativity into it. If not, do yourself a favor and skip the stress. Rob also saw the beauty in our short engagement and the microburst planning period. “The longer it plays out, the longer the nuisance,” he said. “It would have been just an obstacle to starting our life. So why wait?” We may not have a $200 gravy boat, and I may have worn an $8. 88 Walmart wedding ring that eventually turned my finger green, but our flowerless,    wedding set the perfect precedent for married life  —   elegantly simple.

18257,Comey’s Blindside: You’re Just a Cop,"Email 
Every day, it seems, we talk about Prison America; the profitable high growth industry that entombs millions of our people… stealing years, often decades, of their lives while destroying families and communities along the way… as we continue to subsidize a vicious, sagging economy built upon death… not life. Though the debate centers largely on the question of why we continue to prosecute and bury mostly young people of color and poverty for drug crimes and other non-violent offenses, the equation often misses a core component of the challenge concerning how to control willful cops… those in uniform and out… who cross the line with mostly unbridled power to dictate who goes to prison and who does not, whose reputation remains solid and whose becomes soiled, and then set about to do whatever it takes to see their view of justice be had. 
In the US, result oriented justice is not new or even creative; it’s as old as the frontier sheriff with boundless power to rule with a firm hand to control who got to walk down the streets of Dodge and who did not. Of course, cops plant evidence, coerce statements and entrap folks… that’s a given. Torture, rendition and agent stings are very much now the norm. No breaking news here. Ultimately, when all else fails, it’s the modern day version of the old school way to ensure “case closed”… another “victory” for those who not only relish their power but see its arbitrary application as just fine as long as they get their man… or woman. 
It seems most cops, from those directing traffic on the boulevard to the guy in the designer suit before Congress, lose sight along the way that their power is but power on loan… not owned by them to use and do with as they please when their own social, political or “security ends” justifies their means… or where they seek to lay the groundwork for future employment. 
Once again, this past week, FBI Director James Comey proved that point. 
Although finely polished and experienced, this lifelong Republican cop seems to feel that there’s one set of rules for all those he’s helped to send to prison and a completely different one for him… one blue book of conduct for all others in the Department of Justice but, apparently, not a volume to be found among the personal library of he who now occupies the Director’s desk of the FBI. 
Time and time again, throughout the Clinton email scandal, Comey has proven himself to be not much more than an old fashioned ward healer… but with a badge… desperate for the feel of flesh or to see the flash of bulbs or, perhaps, a novice candidate for political office looking for a hook to, some day, launch his own career. 
FBI Directors do not hold press conferences to discuss or explain why charges have not been pursued against a potential subject of interest or a target of an investigation. They just don’t. Inexplicably, he did. 
As a matter of long settled policy, these matters are simply not offered up to the public for Monday morning debate or talking head analysis which can not only tarnish the reputation of persons cleared of criminal wrongdoing but expose investigative sources or techniques that can endanger the reliability of future investigations or the safety of agents. Indeed, legend is the cases where the door to on-going or post hoc litigation leads has been slammed shut, without hesitation, by federal judges for this very reason. 
As well, the all too convenient mass publication by the FBI in this matter of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of its sensitive 302 reports (official FBI case progress memoranda) are simply unprecedented. Indeed, prisoners (and journalists) often spend years litigating access to this material which is challenged by the FBI, every step along the way, with endless technical statutory excuses for keeping it secret; even in cases, long closed, where its release might offer a ray of hope to those perhaps wrongfully convicted or overcharged. 
Most stunning of all however was the cheap political ploy by Comey where but 11 days prior to the election he suggested, in a public writing to Congress, that he had uncovered newly discovered, potentially damning evidence with regard to the Clinton email scandal. The tenor and tone of the Director’s insinuation is remarkable, indeed astonishing, given the fact that apparently neither he nor any of his agents had, as of the time of the written press conference, reviewed the material itself. Can anyone say deceitful? 
Even more disingenuous was the timing of this claim which not only rubbed up against firmly rooted and sound DOJ policy but, in fact, swallowed it whole as the Director slobbered away from the political dining table with a scheming smile on his face. 
Although periodically ruptured, by design the mandate of federal law enforcement necessarily excludes witting participation in the political process, let alone becoming ensnarled in it, as an ostensible partisan or one consciously seeking to impact upon it one way or another. That’s the job of politicians not cops. 
Indeed, the Department of Justice has, for decades, avoided taking actions that might be viewed as an attempt to influence an election. As noted in a 2012 Justice Department memo “… all employees have the responsibility to enforce the law in a neutral and impartial manner…which is ‘particularly important’ in an election year.” According to Matthew Miller, former Director of the Justice Department’s Public Affairs Office, this becomes all the more sensitive, nay, critical as Election Day draws near: 
“Justice traditionally bends over backward to avoid taking any action that might be seen by the public as influencing an election, often declining to even take private steps that might become public in the 60 days leading up to an election.” 
This rule finds firm footing in the position of a host of former and current Attorneys General and senior prosecutors. For example, it has been reported that former AG Janet Reno was “adamant… anything that could influence the election had to go dark,” as she suspended a politically sensitive investigation… one much further removed in time from Election Day than the most recent blindside, by the FBI Director, just 11 days before the vote to see who will lead this country for the next four years. 
Remarkably, it appears Comey completely ignored the “preference” of current Attorney General Lynch… his boss… as well as her deputies that he adhere to a well established DOJ policy of remaining silent about on-going investigations and refrain from taking any steps that could influence the outcome of an election . This view has been shared by Republican prosecutors as well. As noted by George J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general under President George Bush, “There’s a longstanding policy of not doing anything that could influence an election.” He added “Those guidelines exist for a reason. Sometimes, that makes for hard decisions. But bypassing them has consequences.” 
Sadly, Comey’s palpable decision to charge full steam ahead and place his own view and reputation before that of the electoral process as so much the ultimate arbiter of what he believes the public should know and not… real or otherwise… on the eve of this election is not sui generis . Although different in approach, and context, he now follows a long and time tested tradition of corrupt and venal FBI directors who have not hesitated to implement personal political agendas ranging from the Palmer raids upon anarchists of the early 20 th century, to the blacklisting and perjury traps of McCarthy , to the murder of black activists under COINTELPRO . 
Comey is many things. He is not however stupid or brash. He had to know that what essentially constituted a vaguely worded personal press release, in the final desperate days of a very ugly campaign, would be seized upon, by an opposing candidate, media pundits and the public, as newly discovered evidence of criminality, even without verification, that might very well alter the course of US history. 
To him, it mattered not that the “new” emails were as yet unparsed. Nor did he care that their timed release would almost certainly have the consequence, if not the intended effect, to mislead the American people already battered and tired by unprecedented levels of empty rhetoric and unfounded accusations by both sides. 
One can only wonder whether Comey’s blindside was simply breathtaking in its carelessness or… like the beat cop who has decided who goes to jail and who goes home… a calculated decision to place his own personal stamp of approval on who he wants to see as his next uber boss. 
The path from street corners or, at times, even Board Rooms to prison cells is not a complicated walk at all. It seems these days the road to the White House is pretty much the same march… just a bit longer and nastier.",0
18258,"Mike Pence Has G.O.P. Candidates’ Respect. Just to Be Safe, They Keep Him at a Distance. - The New York Times","Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana has so far played the role of Donald J. Trump’s translator to conservatives, character witness to evangelical Christians, and clarifier in chief, issuing explanatory statements after Mr. Trump has committed a variety of unforced political errors. By now, he had hoped to add another line to his 2016 political résumé: surrogate in chief, stumping with and raising money for Republican Senate candidates. But, especially among vulnerable incumbents, the reception has been tentative at best. The problem is not Mr. Pence, strictly speaking: He is largely viewed with respect and appreciation by fellow Republicans. The problem is the man on top of the ticket  —   and the fear that Mr. Pence is an unwitting carrier of a kind of political toxicity. “This notion that, ‘I’m Mike Pence, I’m here to help, and people won’t notice I’m associated with Donald Trump,’ in these close Senate races, is notionally absurd,” said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who was a senior adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. “The association with Trump that Pence brings into your campaign  —   I think most Senate candidates are going to want Mike Pence in their states the way they’re going to want a mosquito bite in Miami. ” Aides to Republicans in several contested Senate races, when asked if their candidates had any plans to appear with Mr. Pence, politely demurred. “Kelly is focused on the Senate race and talking to as many New Hampshire voters as she can, and we’ll see what happens,” said Liz Johnson, a spokeswoman for Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. “We look forward to helping Republicans up and down the ticket to make sure career politicians from the past like Senator Feingold and Hillary Clinton aren’t elected,” said Brian Reisinger, a spokesman for Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. And from the team of Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania: “Pat and Mike are friends, and Pat would be happy to see him in Pennsylvania, but there are no plans to campaign together at this time,” said Ted Kwong, a campaign spokesman. Even the campaign of Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said the senator had no events scheduled with Mr. Pence, though he was “not closing the door. ” At one point after his selection by Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence  —   the understated,   half of the Republican ticket  —   was expected to play the role of national cheerleader, bringing party loyalty and a frisson of   excitement to the aid of Republicans in statewide and Senate races and helping to rally conservative voters to turn out in November. “Pence gives vulnerable senators an opportunity to campaign with the presidential ticket without the baggage of the photo op with Donald Trump,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg and Gonzales Political Report. “Trump makes it hard for many Republicans to be excited or unified about this entire election, but Pence is a breath of fresh air for them. ” But that may be in doubt, as Mr. Pence has increasingly backed up Mr. Trump, echoing some of his more contentious statements. In a CNN interview Thursday, Mr. Pence seconded Mr. Trump’s contention that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was a stronger leader than President Obama. “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,” Mr. Pence said. Mr. Pence did, however, break with Mr. Trump in saying he believes Mr. Obama was born in the United States. And on Friday, he released 10 years of his tax returns  —   though it remained unclear whether Mr. Trump would follow suit. Some   appearances involving Mr. Pence may yet unfold: His aides have held discussions with several Senate campaigns, including that of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, about coordinating joint outings. (“Marco has tremendous respect and admiration for Governor Pence,” said Olivia   a campaign spokeswoman, “but we have no joint events scheduled with him at this time. ”) To be sure, Mr. Pence is no outcast: Some Republicans believe that he can help shore up the party’s base in states like Arizona, Georgia and Missouri, helping to energize social conservatives who appreciate his opposition to abortion rights. He recorded a video testimonial for Representative Joe Heck, the Republican candidate in the competitive Senate race in Nevada. He has appeared with at least 17 House members, many in solidly Republican districts where turnout will be crucial three governors and four senators  —   including Richard Burr of North Carolina, who is in a tough   fight, and Mike Lee of Utah, who hosted Mr. Pence at a policy forum recently. “Mike’s excited to continue to unify the party behind the ticket and he looks forward to helping competitive Senate races wherever he can,” said Marc Short, a senior Pence adviser. “He knows it will be important to have a Republican Senate when he and Mr. Trump are elected. ” But Mr. Pence’s firepower in attracting favorable attention, including that of major political donors, is somewhat limited. He lacks the star power of a Sarah Palin or Paul D. Ryan: Though reporters, aides and Secret Service agents were looking on while Mr. Pence got a haircut in Pennsylvania recently, the barber had no idea his customer was a   candidate. Another indication: He has appeared on Fox News only about a dozen times since becoming Mr. Trump’s running mate. As Mr. Pence himself likes to joke, he’s “kind of a   Republican celebrity. ” Instead, he has been more active behind the scenes, not only helping Mr. Trump, but also burnishing his own credentials and relationships  —   something that could help further his own  political ambitions if Mr. Trump is defeated. He has quietly reached out to former Trump rivals, like former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and to fierce opponents, like the Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes, to try to quell lingering tensions. “It’s a very, very soft sell,” said Mr. Sykes, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump who met privately with Mr. Pence during a recent campaign swing through the state. “He asks nothing. He basically said, ‘Can we keep the lines of communication open? ’” The Trump campaign has also largely ceded donor outreach to Mr. Pence, according to an Indiana Republican briefed on the discussions Mr. Trump does not enjoy making donor calls, and Mr. Pence’s team has an existing   apparatus. On Tuesday, Mr. Pence will headline a   in Washington  —   the first in the capital for the   campaign. Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012, said that while Mr. Pence was “a nice guy” and generally   some Senate candidates understandably choose to avoid unnecessary risks. “The concern isn’t that Mike Pence is going to say something crazy,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s that Donald Trump, on the other side of the country, is going to say something crazy, and he’ll have to clean it up  —   and that will involve other Republicans at the event. So even just having Mike Pence there could be a distraction. ”",0

18260,Smaller Bathrooms on Planes Pose Challenges for Passengers - The New York Times,"Smaller lavatories are helping airlines to add extra seats to new and existing aircraft for more profit, but some passengers  —   if they can get into the bathrooms  —   say they are being shortchanged. The continuing installation of smaller and reconfigured bathrooms, which began in late 2013, has led to complaints about safety issues, say travelers and flight crew, who are concerned about restricted access for the physically disabled, as well as ease of use for other passengers Barry Brandes, a retired singer from Somers, N. Y. travels several times a year on United Airlines. At    Mr. Brandes said that getting into the new lavatories on the Boeing   a   airplane, is not easy. “If I don’t duck, I hit my head on the door,” he said. “I can’t stand up completely, so I have to twist myself into a pretzel to use the facility. ” United has a total of 250 Boeing   and   aircraft that feature a combination of the new lavatory and the traditional lavatory, according to Erin Benson, a spokeswoman. In an email, she said the airplanes are reconfigured for the best use of space. In some aircraft, she noted, lavatories in first class have a new design, but have not decreased in size, while new lavatories located between first class and the first row of economy have decreased in size. The configuration of the toilets can make it especially difficult during medical emergencies to help travelers who are incapacitated or unable to move on their own, said Jeffrey A. Tonjes, a spokesman for United flight attendants in the Association of Flight   a union that represents 50, 000 flight attendants at 18 airlines. “Both passenger and flight attendant are in harm’s way for injury or slowed response if we have difficulty getting to the passenger,” Mr. Tonjes said. “United Airlines is aware of this, and committed to addressing the issue about a year ago, but has been slow in getting the fix done. ” The square footage of the old and new bathrooms varies, depending on their location  —   whether they are in the back next to the galley, on the sides of the plane in front of the galley,   in coach or in first class  —   and the model of aircraft. This reporter recently measured the lavatories on a Boeing   which had the traditional, older bathrooms, and on a   which had the newer bathrooms. The traditional lavatories in first class and coach on a Boeing   measured, 41 inches long by 34½ inches wide by 75 inches high. On a Boeing   the new bathroom in first class measured 36 by 27 by 77, and in coach measured 39¾ by 24½ by 77. The new lavatories, which had smaller sinks and trash receptacles, were a bit taller than the traditional bathrooms, but narrower and less deep. Ms. Benson, who declined to give official dimensions, said only that the newer bathrooms shrank three to four inches from the sink to the opposite wall, and lengthened two to three inches from the back of the toilet to the door. The smaller bathrooms, combined with smaller galleys and trimmer seats with less pitch, allow space for an extra row of seats in the rear. Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said that airlines choose their own lavatory, galley and seat arrangements from various suppliers to create optimal use of cabin space. He declined to reveal lavatory dimensions and added, in an email, that “there is currently only one supplier for lavs across all models of the 737  —     Aerospace. ” Numerous phone calls requesting an interview with executives from   Aerospace, which has its headquarters in Wellington, Fla. were not returned. Ms. Benson of United declined to comment on complaints about the smaller bathrooms and referred questions to Airlines for America, a trade group that represents major United States airlines. Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for the group, wrote in an email: “I’m not aware of issues or complaints on the matter. ” United is not the only airline to install smaller lavatories on its newer   aircraft. Bobbie Egan, an Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, said six of its airline’s 153 Boeing 737s have lavatories that were slightly reduced in size, and that no customer complaints have been registered. “Separately, adjusting [the seat] pitch and removing a   lavatory and closet on these six planes enabled us to add one row of seats,” Ms. Egan wrote in an email. Delta Air Lines flies the Boeing   which all have the smaller lavatories, and Airbus 320s, which are undergoing cabin modification. “A small number of the A320s now have the smaller lavs,” said Morgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta. He said that in customer surveys, there has been no significant feedback or complaints about the size of the lavatories, and no reports of related injuries. Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight   has a different perspective. “The concerns are uniform across the industry,” said Ms. Nelson, who added that   does not represent Delta flight attendants, who are not unionized. Describing facing lavatories, she said that “the doors of these restrooms open into each other, creating safety issues. There are a lot of injuries, with smashed fingers, doors hitting people, bumps and bruises. ” Ms. Nelson said that the rear cabin restroom doors also create a barricade between the cabin and the back galley when open, limiting the ability of crew to maneuver if a passenger in the cabin is in trouble. Some parents with small children say they cannot help their kids in the toilet unless the door stays open. Passengers of size, and those with physical challenges, say getting into the smaller lavatories is often not possible for them. Jake Fitzpatrick, who is in the process of introducing a   that reviews travel accommodations for the physically challenged, has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, which requires a caregiver’s help in order to use the restroom. When he takes Delta and Alaska Airlines, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, it’s impossible for him to get into their    bathrooms, so he uses restrooms at the airport before boarding. “It’s hard to hold it, even for three to four hours,” said Mr. Fitzpatrick, who lives in Portland, Ore. “If I go before, it takes 30 to 45 minutes to board everybody, and when we land, we often have to wait for a gate. A   to   flight means someone with a disability might have to wait five to six hours to go to the bathroom. ” Department of Transportation rules require at least one accessible lavatory on   aircraft, but do not require accessible lavatories on   aircraft like the Boeing   or Airbus 320, which are used for many   to   flights. Caitlin Harvey, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote in an email that the department has not received a significant number of written complaints from passengers with disabilities about the size of bathrooms on   aircraft. However, she said, disability rights advocates have consistently raised the issue, advocating a rule requiring airlines to provide an accessible lavatory on   aircraft. So the department has formed the Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation, which comprises industry representatives, disability rights advocates and other experts, to look into it. “The committee is studying a range of promising design and layout solutions, both with respect to the lavatories themselves and with respect to onboard wheelchair design, that may be implemented in the     and ” Ms. Harvey wrote in an email. “The committee is also studying the costs and   that may come with imposing any new accessibility standards. ” Such changes can’t come soon enough for travelers like Wilma Abbey, a retired teacher from the Nashville area, whose two hip replacements have made maneuvering in airplane bathrooms very difficult. “Just wait until someone gets stuck in one of those bathrooms, causing an emergency landing, and the airline gets sued,” Ms. Abbey said. “How much money do the airlines have to make before they provide the basic necessities? I’d like to see airline executives sit in coach and use the bathrooms they’ve provided us. It’s just an insult to the customers. ”",0

18263,"To Survive, Evolve - Russia News Now","This post was originally published on this site 
The concept of evolution should not be limited to the scientific assertions around Darwin’s theory of natural selection, but ought to include the more general idea that people and processes constantly evolve in response to the forces that surround them. We evolve from childhood into adulthood, and, ideally, from self-centeredness toward the good of larger entities like our community or nation (and now, faced with climate change, the good of our planet). Political arrangements have evolved from the divine right of kings into still–evolving democratic systems. 
A Supreme Court justice’s orientation toward evolution in this basic sense determines whether he or she is a strict originalist (a nicer word for fundamentalist), or sees the Constitution as a living document that must be responsive to changing conditions. No founding father composing the second amendment could have foreseen the surfeit of guns decimating our country today. 
Such evolutionary processes are alive, dynamic, an unstoppable juggernaut pervading every aspect of reality. Against them, even the determination not to evolve has evolutionary effects, as we have seen in the bizarre presidential process of the past year. A Neanderthal candidate has helped awaken a generation of young women, and ideally young men also, to evolve beyond being victims of crude chauvinist stereotypes. 
The whole cosmos has been evolving for 13.8 billion years, from energy to matter to, here on earth, life and self-conscious life. Evolution is the context of our reality, the story all humans share. This story is beginning to seep into collective consciousness in a way that may yet render obsolete divisions such as those between Shia and Sunni, let alone between “radical Islamic fundamentalism” and the “post-Enlightenment West.” We all evolved from the same mysterious source. Every differentiation in that largest context, by race, tribe, religion, ethnicity, feels arbitrary and abstract. 
It is not surprising that fundamentalism in whatever form has often found the evolutionary paradigm threatening, because it implies a challenging dynamic of change that feels insecure. For many believers, to generalize unfairly, religion provides behavioral rules that can be a source of security and comfort even as they are used as excuses to remain exclusive and resist evolving. 
Within each world religion, there are minority enclaves (the Sufis in Islam, Zen practitioners of Buddhism, Catholic mystics like Teilhard de Chardin) who understand that their spiritual discipline is an opportunity to evolve toward inclusivity, toward looking within at fears and projections rather than looking outward for enemies, and toward expanding our identifications and responsibilities beyond the national to the planetary. 
Far from being a benign, feel-good process, evolution is often painful, one step forward, two back. Take the tortured but necessary demise of the American coal industry. No one wants to see the debilitating effects of unemployment on real people with real families, but so far the technology of coal burning hasn’t evolved a way not to accelerate global warming. 
We humans are supposedly not built to respond effectively to long-term threats like changes in climate, but, late in the game as it is, we do seem to be collectively learning what is at stake and evolving locally and globally. Entrepreneurs are rapidly bringing to market solar, wind, and other cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. 
Unfortunately, negative and harmful processes can also become subject to an evolutionary juggernaut. Since 1945 weapons systems have evolved (more accurately, we have evolved them) to a level of complexity and destructive power that we are already powerless to control. The Pentagon is reported to be spending its usual vast sums on research into computer-controlled robotic drones capable of making their own autonomous decisions about who is an enemy. The defense establishments of other great nations are presumably up to the same mischief, or soon will be, because the arms race never stops evolving. Or won’t until we embrace a new way of thinking: that we must evolve to survive. 
We, we the nations, are hopelessly complacent in our present reliance upon deterrence as a workable security system. As the fellow falling from the hundredth floor said as he passed the sixtieth: so far so good. The system, an emperor with no clothes solemnly worshipped by legions of self-confident experts, is too complex not to be subject to breakdown at any moment, perhaps by accident, perhaps where NATO and Russia push up against each other in Eastern Europe, perhaps in Kashmir. 
The threat of nuclear extinction provides a new context for the obsolete parochialism of the world’s major religions. If this threat isn’t enough to accelerate the ecumenical impulse, what is? As people of diverse spiritual worldviews acknowledge that they have in common the possibility of annihilation, our shared anxiety can energize evolution toward inclusivity and nonviolent solutions to conflict. The world is in a race between fundamentalists and arms manufacturers on the one hand, and evolutionaries who see clearly both the futile dead-end of the arms race and the possibility of a security built upon the truth of interdependence, which appears in similar form in all the religions as the Golden Rule. We will live together or die together. As we treat others, so we will be treated. Whether they each understand this or not, this is the hidden-in-plain-sight background behind the Trump-Clinton mud-wrestle. 
Will the arms manufacturers and the politicians in league with them evolve in the face of the nuclear threat in a way similar to our positive responses to the challenge of climate instability? I live in Maine, where the state’s largest private employer is the Bath Iron Works. They are building three of a new kind of guided missile destroyer that is contoured to hide from radar. Each one costs 4 billion dollars. Recently I had a conversation with an Iron Works employee. I made the assumption that, given his job, he would be hawkishly supportive of a robust military. Not at all. His exact parting words were “I’d be much happier building solar panels.” Related ",0

The long await IPO of Snapchat is finally coming: according to Bloomberg the social media will seek to raise as much as $4 billion in its planned initial public offering, making it the biggest social media company to go public since Twitter's initial public offering in November 2013.

18266,O’DONNELL: A Turning Point in the American Revolution -- the Battle of Guilford Courthouse and Washington’s Unknown Immortal,"This year, the Ides of March marks the 236th anniversary of one of the most important  —   yet widely unknown  —   battles of the American Revolution: The Battle of Guilford Courthouse. [Near   Greensboro, North Carolina, Robert Kirkwood and his men lined up facing the Redcoats, including the dreaded Banastre Tarleton, a cavalry officer known for his ruthlessness. A light breeze carried the sound of fifes and Highlander pipes across the field in front of the county courthouse. With blood dripping from his sword, the Patriot cavalry officer, Light Horse Harry Lee, father of General Robert E. Lee, delivered a stirring address to prepare his men for battle: “My brave boys, your lands, your lives and your country depend on your conduct this day  —   I have given Tarleton hell this morning, and I will give him more of it before night. ”  Listen to O’Donnell discuss this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM: Forming the front line,   members of Kirkwood’s Delaware Blues, flanked by militia and cavalry, stared across the   recently plowed cornfield at the “scarlet uniforms, burnished armor, and banners floating in the breeze” as Cornwallis’s army assembled in formation more than four hundred yards in front of them. In the damp, cold morning air, the Americans took their carefully plotted positions in the defense and prepared for what proved to be one of the most crucial battles of the war. Born in 1746, Kirkwood graduated from Newark Academy (now the University of Delaware) and worked on his family’s farm before becoming a first lieutenant in the Delaware Regiment at the age of  . Later promoted to captain and brevetted to major at the end of the war, “Captain Bob” was a man of steel who marched thousands of miles and, beginning in 1775, took part in at least   battles for his country during the Revolution. His order book, which served as a daily diary, recorded that he and his men marched more than 5, 000 miles, many times barefoot, often without pay or shelter, and with limited food and threadbare uniforms. Typically, Washington employed Kirkwood’s unit for reconnaissance missions or as an indefatigable rear guard. Against the odds, Captain Bob and his Delaware Blues fought and made the difference at many inflection points during the Revolution. The story of this epic battle and the intrepid Robert Kirkwood is recounted in Washington’s Immortals, a bestselling book released in paperback this week. The first    treatment of the Revolution, it captures key events of the war from the point of view of the soldiers in the Maryland and Delaware Continentals (Washington’s elite shock troops). This groundbreaking book offers a     perspective from the most elite units in Washington’s army, the fighting force the general called upon, time and again, to hold the line or turn the tide in decisive battles. The fighting at Guilford began on March 15, 1781, with artillery volleys from both sides. As the men heard and felt the ominous thunder of the cannons, Lee reminded those in the front lines to “stand to make two fires” before falling back. They would use the same “collapsing box” defense tactics that had served them well at the Battle of Cowpens, where Kirkwood’s men and the Marylanders repulsed the British and conducted a famous bayonet charge that altered the course of history. The British advanced across the field. Remembering their orders, Kirkwood and the others shot twice before withdrawing through the second line of defense. Their goal was to entice the British to follow them deeper into the Patriot lines, forcing the Redcoats to fight through dense brush and gullies before they reached the backbone of Washington’s Army, the Maryland Line, accompanied by the rest of the Delaware Regiment and Virginia Continentals. The British succumbed to the ruse. Thinking the Americans were fleeing, they surged forward. But as the British drew near, the second line of defense opened up with devastating effect on the enemy troops. Stunned, the British advance momentarily stalled as the Americans continued picking off soldiers. Falling back from the front line as Lee ordered, the Delaware Blues’ fight was far from over. Now positioned within the trees flanking the battlefield, they used the foliage for cover as they continued firing, drawing the enemy ever closer to the Marylanders and other Continental units that comprised the third and final line of defense. Approximately and hour and thirty minutes after the battle commenced, the British reached the third line of defense. The fresh Marylanders stood ready to hammer the British troops who were, by then, exhausted from fighting. At first, the Marylanders appeared to be winning, but inexperienced militia were sprinkled within the ranks of the   veterans. As the British bore down with the cold steel of their bayonets, some of the militia began to break. Yet most of the Continental Line held as the engagement became a    brawl between men from the opposing sides. Desperate for a victory, British General Cornwallis attempted a dangerous gamble. He ordered his artillery to fire into the mass of fighting men. Deadly grapeshot tore through the limbs of British and Americans alike. Exposed to the deadly fire, the Marylanders began a slow withdrawal. The American commander on the scene, General Nathanael Greene, decided it was time to cut his losses. He had achieved his objective of badly damaging Cornwallis’s army and inflicting enormous casualties. He left scores of bleeding and dying in his wake. Cornwallis’s commissary general Charles Stedman captured the carnage: “The night was remarkable for its darkness accompanied with rain which fell in torrents. Nearly fifty of the wounded, it is said sinking under their aggravated miseries, expired before the morning. The cries of the wounded and dying, who remained on the field of action during the night exceeded all description. Such a complicated scene of horror and distress, it is hoped, for the sake of humanity, rarely occurs, even in military life. ” Harry Lee summed it up differently, calling the battle an American strategic victory and singling out Kirkwood and his men, saying, “The company of Delaware under Kirkwood, to whom none could be superior. ” Despite having achieved a pyrrhic victory, Cornwallis’s army was too attenuated to pursue the Americans as they retreated. The British general relocated his army to Wilmington, North Carolina, to rest and recover, initiating a chain of events that would eventually allow the Americans to trap and defeat his army at Yorktown. Neither side realized it at the time, but the Battle of Guilford Courthouse was a major turning point that positioned the Americans for their ultimate victory. For Robert Kirkwood, Guilford Courthouse was just one more episode in a   military career. He would survive throughout the Revolution and continue serving his country afterward. He met his fate as he would have desired  —   on the battlefield. In November 1791, he participated in the fight against Native Americans at the Battle of the Wabash (St. Clair’s Defeat) near   Fort Recovery, Ohio. A fellow officer recalled that Kirkwood had been sick for weeks “yet always ready for duty. ” At the start of the epic battle, Kirkwood was “cheering his men, and by his example, inspiring confidence in all who saw him. ” A veteran of more than thirty battles, Kirkwood, shot through the abdomen, fell mortally wounded. Asked if he wished to be carried off the field, he faced the Indians and told a fellow officer, “No, I am dying save yourself, if you can, and leave me to my fate. . . . I see the Indians coming and God knows how they will treat me. ” The enemy scalped and killed Kirkwood in one of the worst defeats ever for an American army. Forgotten heroes such as Robert Kirkwood, steeled by resilience and courage, bent history by fighting for a country not yet born and a cause in which they believed with all their hearts and souls.   Patrick K. O’Donnell is a bestselling, critically acclaimed military historian and an expert on elite units. He is the author of ten books. Washington’s Immortals is his newest, which has just been released as a soft cover and has been named one of the 100 Best American Revolution Books of All Time by the Journal of the American Revolution. O’Donnell served as a combat historian in a Marine rifle platoon during the Battle of Fallujah and speaks often on espionage, special operations, and counterinsurgency.

18267,It Happened: Personal Notes From A Young Chicago Cubs Fan,"Chicago Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the World Series rally in Grant Park and choked up, as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the 38-year-old catcher David Ross, who was a mentor to him. Rizzo, Ross, and center fielder Dexter Fowler stood shoulder-to-shoulder singing that silly jingle, the one that goes, “Go Cubs Go! Go Cubs Go! Hey, Chicago, whaddya say? Cubs are gonna win today.” It all really hit home for me as a Cubs fan.
Life is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them. The Cubs team is owned by Tom Ricketts, a man who donated $1 million to Donald Trump and bears a frightening resemblance to Ted Cruz; so much that one might think Ricketts was his brother. The Cubs also signed Aroldis Chapman, a closer, who served a 30-game suspension this year for domestic abuse. Cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of Wrigleyville. With that said, almost all of the Cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fan-fueled folklore around “curses” defeat them. That made the postseason truly blissful.
This is where I wrote, Thomas G, my father’s name on the wall. I had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalk.
I live about seven blocks from Wrigley Field. I went down there multiple times in the past week. The day after they won, I went down to Wrigley Field to write my father’s name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other Cubs fans in paying tribute to family, who died before they could see the Cubs win a World Series. In the immediate hours after their sweet victory, I took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around Clark and Addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with “World Series Champions” emblazoned on it.
On Sunday, right before Game 5, down 3-1 in the series, I stood outside the friendly confines and said to myself—and to my father, even though I don’t really believe in this kind of stuff, this was going to be the game where they turned it all around. That they could still come back. Also, I bought a copy of the Chicago Sun-Times after each game, even the editions with the devastating headlines on Game 3 and Game 4, because it was important to have the full story. I can now put those papers side-by-side and forever see the journey the Chicago Cubs took and relive the heart-wrenching and euphoric moments that took place.
This seismic sports event—ending the longest championship drought in American sports history—gripped me like so many other Americans. It taught me, once again, the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences. Which I know is easy for me to say. I did not have a boss, who told me I had to work a night shift or else I would be fired. I did not have to worry about what I was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed. I did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis, but all too often we just go, go, go, and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life. Or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routine.
Additionally, during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us, the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball. Players like Rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us. They were on a world stage, where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity. Rizzo, on the other hand, as he now famously told Ross during Game 7, was an “emotional wreck,” and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confession.
Many of us were “emotional wrecks.” Everyone watching this series felt like “emotional wrecks” at some point. Not everyone watched all moments of the games, unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the games.
I’ll never forget how Ross told Rizzo it was only going to get worse in the 9th inning. He was right. The Cleveland Indians tied the game in the 8th, acrobatic second baseman Javier Baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the 9th, and fans had to bow their heads and hope Chapman would not make a mistake, even though manager Joe Maddon clearly overworked him the past few games.

The weather went from great to pouring rain. There was a delay. That delay gave the team a kind of gift, a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the 10th inning. (It was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first baseman, Ernie Banks, who was “Mr. Cub.” Or, legendary third baseman Ron Santo, who later became a WGN radio broadcaster. )
So, Rizzo, the “emotional wreck,” stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor, “Grandpa” Ross, who played his last game on November 2.
“Gramps and I sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with Boston. He was a free agent, and we just talked,” Rizzo shared. “We had the same agent. We’re talking, and I say to my agent, man, this is what the Chicago Cubs need. He is exactly what we need to bring everything together. Obviously, a lot of pieces came through with that, but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner. He’s like a brother to me.”
Fighting back tears, Rizzo continued, “He’s taught me a lot in life—on the field, off the field, how to be a better person. I’m forever grateful for him. He’s going out a champion forever. For the rest of his life, he can say the last game that he played he’s a world champion.”
That to me is what has made these past moments special. The fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all three-to-four generations were brought together. Sons and daughters know their parents longed for this, and many of them have parents, who longed to see what happened. If those parents are still alive, their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a Cubs World Series.
Kevin Gosztola
Families shared stories about their first games, games they remembered, games they want to forget, and games they saw with their fathers or mothers. They shared stories of players they remembered or recalled when they first put on a Cubs baseball hat or wore a jersey with their favorite player’s name on the back. I dug out a photo of me when I was a toddler wearing my Cubs shirt.
I am 28 years-old. I waited 13 years for this because 2003 was the first postseason, where I really got into watching the Cubs play and experienced what it meant to fail to end the drought when they lost to the Florida Marlins in the National League Championship Series. That is a rather short time span when compared to legions of fans.
Maddon said, “It’s a players’ game.” Indeed, but for the Cubs, it’s unique. Cubs baseball was essentially a fans’ game, much more so than other ball clubs.
The last two years of decisions by business executives were made for the fans. The scouts, who went out and found these all-star players, did it for the fans. They recognized there were so many aging Chicago Cubs fans, who kept asking them on the street if they were going to live to see the Cubs win a World Series. Theo Epstein, one of the executives who enabled this team, did not want to have to tell any more fans to take their vitamins when asked if this would be The Year.
Even with 103 wins in the regular season and the status of number one team in baseball, all too many fans were aware of the record for teams, who came in to the postseason on top and did not make it to the World Series. We also took note of the statistics for comebacks in the World Series when teams were down 3-1. So few ever win not only three games in a row but three games in a row, including two on the road.
That put tremendous pressure on the Cubs players. They clearly felt it, and we thank them for putting up with millions of “emotional wrecks.”
As fans process and revel in the fact that it happened (as Maddon would say, how we did not suck), I think about what this means for next year. For the first time, it is possible to watch the Cubs without bringing a legacy of doubt and negativity to games. There are no more goats. There is no more Steve Bartman. There are no more distractions that are not typically part of baseball. Everyone’s favorite punchlines don’t really work anymore. They all are part of the past, and the immediate future is baseball with a team that will have some of the players, who won this championship and who will undoubtedly find ways to dazzle us again as they attempt to repeat as champions in 2017.
*** 
For a coda, Chicago Cubs fan Caitlin Swieca pledged a day after Chapman signed with the team in July to donate $10 to a Chicago domestic violence organization every time he got a save. Her campaign managed to raise over $31,000, especially when it took off after she shared it on Twitter.
Swieca told ESPN she thought during Game 7, “We all compromised what we believed in to root for this guy, and he’s gonna blow it.” Then, it shifted to a celebration. Cubs pitcher Mike Montgomery got his first career save ever, and it was in Game 7 of the World Series. She was happy Chapman did not get the glory and said it couldn’t have been scripted better.
Oh, and at the parade, some of us fans looked up to see a plane with a banner that read, “Chinese Americans For Trump Go Cubs.” I stood next to a Filipino American family, who had some Chinese heritage in their ancestry. She thought it must be a joke. Then, someone told her it was real. They read something about this group of Chinese Americans. Instantly, she said she was insulted.
We’re not all Trump fans because Ricketts owns our team. Only a small segment are, and they are the same kind of white men and women disconnected from reality, who you will find in the fandom of just about every American sports team. They would probably support Trump whether Ricketts was a Cubs executive or not.
Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel were at the rally, but they are both hot garbage. Neither took the stage to speak, and I view that as some kind of small political victory that sweetens the victory over a baseball team with a racist/colonialist sports mascot, which should be replaced immediately. In fact, let’s conjure the Curse of the Racist Mascot and say the Cubs passed it on to them and that’ll prolong their championship drought until they replace Chief Wahoo. Maybe then the Indians will get rid of him.

18269,Donald Trump Attacks Bring Team Obama out of Retirement,"After President Donald Trump described former President Barack Obama as a “sick guy,” the former president’s loyal team rose in unison to defend him. [Obama’s office quickly asserted that the president had a “cardinal rule” not to interfere with investigations led by the Department of Justice.  “Enough said,” wrote former White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, sharing the statement on Twitter. Trump’s accusations clearly triggered a nerve among former Obama staffers, as many of them spent their weekend battling back the suggestion that their boss engaged in shady tactics to take down Trump. Obama’s former foreign policy spokesman Ben Rhodes sprang into action on Twitter, directing a series of challenges to Trump’s statements. “No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you,” he wrote on Twitter, challenging Trump. He also denounced Trump’s assertion that a lawyer could make a case that Obama was wiretapping his phones. “No. They couldn’t. Only a liar could do that,” he replied. Rhodes appeared disturbed that the pundits had lauded Trump’s speech to Congress earlier in the week, suggesting that they were part of the problem and shaming them for their assessment. “Dear Pundits who lauded his speech. Is it still ‘presidential’ to call your dignified predecessor ‘Bad (or sick) guy! ’” he asked. Rhodes, who famously bragged about creating an “echo chamber” to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public, was deep in the process of creating a new one as Trump’s claims rocketed through the news. “This isn’t a campaign anymore. WH needs to explain what’s going on with these repeated blatant lies about a matter of justice and natsec,” he wrote. “He’s lying no matter what ‘3 people with direct knowledge’ say. This isn’t he said   he said. Obama did not order a wiretap. That is a fact. ” “This seems ‘nutts,’” Obama’s former campaign chief David Axelrod chimed in on Twitter. “Frantic way in which Donald Trump is kicking up dust only adds to suspicions and the need for full public reckoning. If there were the wiretap Donald Trump loudly alleges, such an extraordinary warrant would only have been OKed by a court for a reason. ” Former Obama speechwriters Jon Lovett and Jon Favreau, who recently launched a “Crooked Media” left wing media outlet, immediately launched a series of snarky messages on Twitter. “They said Trump was presidential on Tuesday,” Lovett wrote on Twitter. “Nixon got weird at night. Trump wakes up angry. ” He directed his angry followers on Twitter to question members of Congress. “Important also to direct your anger at the Republicans in Congress who have enabled and apologized for this awful devious moron,” he wrote. Obama former senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer also questioned Republicans for their failure to denounce Trump’s accusations. “Have any elected Republicans had the courage to speak out against Trump’s deeply, deranged tweets this morning?” he asked. Other Obama staffers were still reacting to initial accusations. “Jesus, I can’t sleep until 8am on Saturday anymore?” complained Favreau‏ on Twitter on Saturday. After Obama’s statement was released, Favreau asserted that the former president never denied any wiretapping of Trump Tower, suggesting that Trump was guilty. “I’d be careful about reporting that Obama said there was no wiretapping. Statement just said that neither he nor the WH ordered it,” he wrote. Other staffers reacted with incredulity. “Why would Obama decide close out his presidency by illegally wiretapping a buffoon that everyone thought was going to lose in a landslide?” questioned Tommy Vietor, Obama’s former National Security Council spokesman. Citing a report from CNN’s Jake Tapper asserting that Trump’s claim came from a Breitbart News story, Vietor added,”Jake confirms what we all assumed. Trump shares conspiracies with all the forethought of your crazy uncle on Facebook. ” Favreau quickly slipped into gallows humor as the afternoon wore on. “By tomorrow morning, the party line will be that Obama personally bugged Trump Tower while disguised as the cable guy,” he wrote, and added, “I just learned that Trump robbed a bank. And I have exactly as much evidence for that claim as Trump does that Obama tapped his phone. ” “Wiretap birtherism is not a governing strategy,” Rhodes replied, citing Favreau’s tweet. On Sunday, former White House press secretary Josh Earnest went on ABC’s This Week to deny the allegations and raise more questions about Trump’s involvement in Russia. “The bigger the scandal, the more outrageous the tweet,” he said as he joined the show with Martha Raddatz. Earnest stoked the fires of speculation surrounding Trump’s campaign communications with the Russians. “It is almost like a Russian novel to try to keep up with all these conversations,” Earnest said, citing multiple incidents of Trump campaign officials coming into contact with representatives of the Russian government. When pressed for details about the investigation, Earnest feigned ignorance, pointing out that he was “not aware” of any details but repeated that Obama did not meddle with the investigation. “Here’s the simple answer to that question, is, Martha, I don’t know and it’s not because I’m no longer in government,” he said. “The fact is, even when I was in government, I was not in a position of being regularly briefed on an FBI criminal or counterintelligence investigation. ” But as the day wore on, the team appeared increasingly frustrated that Trump’s narrative was taking hold. “Needs to be repeated: this is not he     it’s   Obama didn’t do what Trump said. Trump lied about it and offered no proof,” Rhodes urged on Twitter. “[F]or the MILLIONTH TIME, the White House doesn’t interfere in independent investigations,” Favreau complained in response to the former United States director of National Intelligence’s denial of the existence of a wiretap on Trump Tower in an interview on Meet the Press. The group, who maintained discipline during the Obama administration, appeared to enjoy their new found freedom to defend their boss and detract from his successor. The squad began cynically floating their own conspiracy theories with a thread of gallows humor. “What did you know and when did you know it about Trump lying about where Obama was born, when he founded ISIL, ordering wiretaps?” Rhodes joked to Favreau, who promoted his upcoming podcast about the fiasco. Citing a claim from Trump’s former campaign manager Cory Lewandowski, Rhodes mockingly added that “the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy” joined Obama by listening into a meeting between the Russian ambassador and Sen. Jeff Sessions. “Remember that time Valerie and I took the space shuttle to the moon to get the forged birth certificate?” he wrote to Favreau and Feiffer. “Do you even know how many Mass voters I drove to NH on Election Day?” replied Favreau, citing another one of Trump’s claims of voter fraud. “Don’t tell anyone, but I worked with Ted Cruz’s dad to kill JFK,” joked Feiffer. “My last act on the job was using massive amounts of Iranian invisible ink to make Trump inauguration crowds disappear,” Rhodes continued.",0
18270,South Carolina Defeats Mississippi State to Win Women’s Title - The New York Times,"DALLAS  —   In the final seconds on Sunday, Dawn Staley gave a group hug to her assistant coaches. As confetti showered South Carolina’s first women’s basketball title winners, she put on a championship cap she had waited a career to wear. Later, she wore a net like a necklace. The   win over Mississippi State, a fellow member of the Southeastern Conference, was a victory that represented a diversity of opportunity, both for coaches and for teams playing for a championship. Staley became the second   coach to win a title since the N. C. A. A. began sponsoring a women’s basketball tournament in 1982. (Carolyn Peck coached Purdue to the 1999 championship.) And for the first time in five years, a program not named Connecticut won a national title. After Peck won her championship, she gave Staley a piece of the net that Purdue cut down in celebration that night, telling her to return it when she won her own title. For years, Staley kept the strand of net in her wallet. “I’m going to have to pass a piece of my net on to somebody else, so they can share it and hopefully accomplish something as big as this,” Staley said. Staley was a fierce point guard from Philadelphia and one of the most renowned players in the history of women’s basketball as a collegian, professional and Olympian. She became a coach only reluctantly. But now, as an N. C. A. A. champion and the recently named Olympic coach for the 2020 Tokyo Games, Staley has a chance to become a   for women’s basketball as Geno Auriemma of UConn and Tara VanDerveer of Stanford move closer to retirement. “Basketball is an incredible gift that keeps on giving,” Staley, 46, said Sunday. Earlier, at the Final Four, she said, “I’m one that thinks basketball is a place of utopia and fairness. ” For the third time this season, the Gamecocks beat the Bulldogs. Mississippi State ( ) appeared to be somewhat tired, or anxious, after Friday night’s epic overtime upset of UConn. South Carolina attacked from the opening tip, then sputtered after building a   lead in the third quarter. But the Gamecocks were settled by their    post player A’ja Wilson (23 points, 10 rebounds) and guard Allisha Gray (18 points, 10 rebounds).   of South Carolina’s points were scored in the lane. Three times, Staley had reached the Final Four as a player at Virginia. And this was her second appearance in the past three seasons as South Carolina’s coach. She had not won until Sunday, but a championship that had remained elusive finally became inexorable. “She was the best leader I ever coached,” said Nell Fortner, who led Staley and the United States to an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. “It isn’t overbearing, just a natural aura she has about her. Players follow her. ” Yet opportunities for minority women to become head coaches at the top levels of women’s college basketball have been rare. Excluding historically black colleges and universities, among 320 Division I women’s teams, only 35 (10. 9 percent) have   women as head coaches, while 45 percent of the players are black, according to a report to be released this week by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida. (Nineteen   men also coach women’s teams.) After John Thompson became the first black men’s coach to win an N. C. A. A. basketball title at Georgetown in 1984, “more athletic directors were open to putting an   in charge,” said Richard Lapchick, the director of the diversity institute. “Hopefully, that will be the case here” after Staley’s triumph, Lapchick added. Staley said: “I don’t know what athletic directors will think about. I’m not one that looks at race. Basketball has been faceless and colorless and genderless when I approached it. I think athletic directors need to hire what’s best for them. ” She added: “If it’s an   male or female, then that’s who they should hire. If it’s somebody else who they feel can take their program to the next level, it has to be the best fit for them, and not necessarily  . ” The daughter of parents who moved from South Carolina, Staley grew up in public housing in Philadelphia. She played baseball, football and basketball with her three brothers and other boys and sometimes shot baskets until 2 a. m. She developed a robustness that allowed her to win three Olympic gold medals as a player and be named one of the top 15 players in the formative years of the W. N. B. A. “She’s basically a gym rat, and definitely ball is life for her,” said Gray, the guard. With Sunday’s title, Staley joined Pat Summitt of Tennessee, Kim Mulkey of Baylor and Marianne Stanley of Old Dominion as former star women’s college players who went into coaching and won N. C. A. A. championships. “I have always respected Dawn’s competitiveness, her work ethic, her absolute passion for the game of basketball,” said VanDerveer, who coached Staley to a gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. “But if she tells you she beat me in chess, she’s a liar. ” While still playing in the W. N. B. A. Staley was somehow persuaded in 2000 by Dave O’Brien, then Temple University’s athletic director, to coach the university’s women’s basketball team. Perhaps more out of hometown devotion than enthusiasm, Staley agreed, though she has said, “Not one ounce of me wanted to coach. ” In eight seasons at Temple, Staley guided the Owls to six appearances in the N. C. A. A. tournament. But she grew weary of a sobering realization: She could not recruit the caliber of players needed to get Temple beyond the second round of the tournament. “At tournament time, we always got ” Staley said. “We outplayed people, but they   us. ” In 2008, she left for South Carolina, a team that was underachieving but seemed to have great possibility, with the financial resources available to a school in a major football conference. Staley expected the same kind of dedication that she played with, and some of her players transferred early on. But the Gamecocks soon grew into a national power and, as of Sunday, into a national champion. Referring to her fellow semifinalists Auriemma (11 N. C. A. A. titles) and VanDerveer (two) Staley said, “I want to be among greatness. ” With Sunday’s championship, she moved into rarefied company. “It means I can check off one of the things that has been a void in my career,” she said.",0
18271,BREAKING: FBI Has Been Compromised! Look What Hillary Did to Sabotage New Investigation... * LIBERTY WRITERS NEWS,"0 
Hillary Clinton has gone and done it now! After acting like she has nothing to hide in the emails seized by the FBI, she managed to pull some strings and sabotage the NEW investigation before it even began… 
It turns out that she got her good friend Loretta Lynch to assign a man named Peter Kadzik from the Department of Justice to oversee the case against her. Peter Kadzik 
So who is Peter Kadzik? Well, thanks to Wikileaks we know that he is a good, personal friend of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager and future Chief of Staff if she wins. 
In fact, Peter Kadzik was mentioned more than TWENTY TIMES in Podesta’s emails! 
Now just try and tell me that is not as rigged as it gets. 
This is gonna be an all out war between the FBI and the Department of Justice, and if we want Hillary to get her just deserts, we gotta be ready to help Director Comey fight back!

Just a few weeks ago on Jimmy Kimmel’s show, Obama mocked Donald Trump saying he’d never be president. The audience laughed and cheered. Everyone was so sure Obama was right. 
The Daily Beast reported: 
Obama Fires Back at Trump’s Mean Tweets on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live’ 
For the second time in two years, Obama read some “mean tweets” about himself on Jimmy Kimmel Live, including one that called him “the Nickelback of presidents” and another that compared him to Sharknado: “Loud, stupid and over-hyped!” 
But the inevitable kicker came when Obama read one from Donald Trump. “President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!” Trump once wrote of the president. “Really? Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president,” Obama replied.

18273,"Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen Likes It Hot, but Not Hellish - The New York Times","For a long time, very few people thought there was money to be made selling hot chicken. This is almost certainly because for a long time, very few people outside certain neighborhoods in Nashville knew what hot chicken was. The ones who did know usually lived somewhere near Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack, which was known as Prince’s BBQ Chicken Shack until it was taken over by a member of the family who thought it was time to acknowledge that what the Princes did to chicken had nothing to do with barbecue. Prince’s is and always was a   restaurant. The chicken was never cooked in advance. It spattered away in a skillet while the customer who had ordered it waited, and waited. But the thing that made Prince’s famous, to the extent that it was famous, was what happened to the chicken after it came out of the skillet. Still dripping with oil, the legs, thighs and breasts were given a glossy finish with spicy oil. Prince’s kitchen is a restricted area. The family guards the recipe for that oil fiercely. But the seasonings are said to include brown sugar, dried garlic, paprika and, crucially, cayenne. Depending on how much oil is applied, the cayenne can make a   eater cry. When Anthony Bourdain was asked about the scariest situations he’d been in while filming his television shows, he named Congo, Libya and Beirut, followed by hot chicken in Nashville. Pain was the point all along. According to the family legend, which fortunately for everybody took shape long before   became a household phrase in America, Thornton Prince’s girlfriend cooked the first hot chicken for breakfast one morning during the Depression to get back at him for his nocturnal wanderings. Forgetting that revenge is best served cold, she loaded the chicken with spice, only to find that her unfaithful man loved hot chicken, shared hot chicken with his friends and made hot chicken into a business that has lasted more than 70 years. Although Prince’s had local competition from a hot chicken place started by a former cook, it was only in this decade that entrepreneurs began to think that cooking chicken that makes customers cry might be a good way to earn money. In the Nashville area there is Slow Burn, Pepperfire and Hattie B’s, among others. KFC began selling its version of Nashville hot chicken throughout the United States in January. Independent operators have set up across the country from Los Angeles to Cambridge, Mass. to Brooklyn, where Carla Hall opened a tiny Nashville chicken spot in June. Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen doesn’t lack for branding. Slogans and catchphrases are written all over the menu and the walls, inside and outside on the corner of Kane and Columbia Streets. The place is so clearly positioned to spawn multiple locations that it almost seems pregnant. When you have decided whether you want thighs, drumsticks, breasts, tenders or some combination of these, one of the smiling people working at the counter will ask: “Do you want Southern, Hoot  Honey, Hoot, Hootie Hoot,    or Boomshakalaka?” It’s like having a conversation with an owl. Even when you know that Ms. Hall, a host on “The Chew,” has been identified with the phrase “hootie hoo” since her days as a “Top Chef” contestant, this is not an easy question to answer the first time you hear it, or the second or third time, either. Most customers fall back on a number system, one to six. Level one, Southern, gets no hot oil and is easy enough to eat. Like all the chicken, it sits on white bread and has pickle slices pinned on it with toothpicks. Level two is slicked all over with just enough oil to give it a rounder flavor that is sweet, savory and spicy but not cruel. Heat tolerance is of course a personal thing, but at level three I became slightly more aware of my skin at level four, I became conscious of the passing of time at level five, I began tearing off chunks of white bread and stuffing them into my mouth. Level six gave me second thoughts, but not serious pain. (If you want to go to the dark side, the chicken for you is the extra hot at Peaches HotHouse in   Brooklyn, although the chile payload is delivered by a spice powder sprinkled over the top parts of the crust that aren’t powdered just taste like regular fried chicken.) The meat at Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen tastes natural, which is to say it hasn’t been twisted beyond recognition by aggressive brining of the kind practiced at Root  Bone and other places around town. Ms. Hall seems to have focused her efforts on the crust, and it is excellent, a darkish shell both formidably crunchy and a little chewy. Spice or no spice, this is not a style of fried chicken you often find in New York. The hottest and crunchiest chicken I ate was the one I waited longest for. The least exciting, though it was still well worth eating, was a piece of white meat that came out before I’d moved from a counter to one of the few chairs. This is a small restaurant, not built for lounging, and Ms. Hall may not want hungry crowds hanging out while the chicken sizzles away. But her recipe is good enough to make you wish every piece were cooked to order. The sides and desserts will not draw anybody to Columbia Street, but a few of them are very good. I tend to sigh when I hear that collards were cooked without meat, but Ms. Hall’s are lively and tangy better, actually, than many pots of collards around town. No reforms have been inflicted on the candied yams, and that is good news. The pimento cheese, punched up with flecks of hot green pepper and served with a   bag of Ritz crackers, was exactly what I hoped it would be. I felt the same way about the biscuits, which had a tenderness that tends to elude Northern cooks. The potato salad, on the other hand, needed perking up, and the macaroni and cheese was the opposite of creamy, a hard, bland lattice of noodles. The bread pudding was dried out, too, and something seemed to have gone wrong with the whoopie pies. They were dense and lumpy, as if a distracted baker had left out an ingredient. I can’t imagine why Ms. Hall is bothering with whoopie pies when her banana pudding is (a) charming, with caramelized bananas and a swirl of what looks like whipped cream but turns out to be a version of Marshmallow Fluff and (b) the only dessert anybody needs after pimento cheese and fried chicken.",0

18275,Madonna Says She'll Give A Blowjob To Anyone That Votes For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"Home / News / Madonna Says She’ll Give A Blowjob To Anyone That Votes For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) Madonna Says She’ll Give A Blowjob To Anyone That Votes For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) Heisenberg 1 min ago News Comments Off on Madonna Says She’ll Give A Blowjob To Anyone That Votes For Hillary Clinton (VIDEO) Pop star Madonna got raunchy while introducing comedian Amy Schumer at a performance in New York City Tuesday night, promising the crowd sexual favors in exchange for their support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. 

“If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a blowjob. OK?” the 58-year-old Rebel Heart singer told an audience at New York’s Madison Square Garden Tuesday night. “I’m really good. I’m not a douche, and I’m not a tool. I take my time, I have a lot of eye contact, and I do swallow.” 
The comments came as Madonna warmed up the crowd with a very brief standup set ahead of the Trainwreck star’s performance at the Garden Tuesday night, according to the New York Daily News . 
Schumer took the stage afterward for her first stand-up gig since hundreds of supporters of Republican candidate Donald Trump stood up and walked out of her performance in Tampa, Florida earlier this week after the comedian called him an “orange monster.” As Breitbart previously reported, Shumer was widely booed during the performance at Tampa’s Amalie Arena, where she instructed security to remove hecklers. 
During her performance Tuesday night, Schumer read aloud a letter she composed in response to the Trump fans who walked out on her show in Tampa. 
“Dearest Tampa, I’m sorry you didn’t want me, a comedian who talks about what she believes in, to mention the biggest thing going on in our country right now,” Schumer said, adding: “How could I think it was OK to spend five minutes having a peaceful conversation with someone with different views? After the show, I want you to know that I will go straight to a rehab facility.” 
The comedian added that she looks forward to “putting this all behind us” in November, when “ Hillary Clinton is our motherf*cking president.” 
Madonna has previously used sex appeal to drum up support for the Democratic presidential candidate; in September, the singer joined fellow pop star Katy Perry in stripping off her clothes to encourage Clinton voters to head to the polls in November. ",0
18276,Angry Dems get blame-y as FBI probe resumes – but not against Hillary,"Print 
[Ed. – How do they go through all this hair-tearing, the sackcloth and ashes, and not question the quality of their candidate — or their choice to run her?] 
[Clinton’s allies] said they were “dumbfounded” by the revelation that the new FBI review may have been spurred by a separate investigation into Anthony Weiner sending lewd texts to a minor. Weiner is separated from wife Huma Abedin, one of Clinton’s closest aides. 
And they worried that Clinton’s unconventional email arrangement had finally caught up to her and might imperil her presidential bid less than two weeks before Election Day. 
“I’m livid, actually,” one Clinton surrogate told The Hill. “This has turned into malpractice. It’s an unforced error at this point. I have no idea what Comey is up to but the idea this email issue is popping back up again is outrageous. It never should have occurred in the first place. Someone somewhere should have told her no. And they didn’t and now we’re all paying the price.” 
Another ally called the campaign’s mood something akin to “paralysis,” and blamed Weiner’s behavior for railroading the campaign. 
One strategist said the developments would further cement the notion that Clinton has something to hide. 
“It’s made people think there’s always going to be something around the Clintons, some investigation, some inquiry,” the strategist said. “It never goes away.”",0
18277,Baseball Tragedy: Two Players Die in Crashes in the Dominican Republic - The New York Times,"When Yordano Ventura won Game 6 of the 2014 World Series for the Kansas City Royals, he wore the initials of Oscar Taveras on his cap. Taveras, an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals, had just been killed in a car accident in the Dominican Republic, the homeland they shared. Early Sunday morning, Ventura was killed in a car accident there at 25. Andy Marte, 33, a former infielder who spent parts of seven seasons with Atlanta, Cleveland and Arizona, was killed in another car crash Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Major League Baseball announced the deaths on its social media accounts. The traffic authorities in the Dominican Republic said that it was not clear whether Ventura had been driving when he died on a highway about 40 miles northwest of the capital, Santo Domingo. Marte died when the   he was driving hit a house about 95 miles north of Santo Domingo, the authorities said. Ventura was a     who reached the majors in September 2013 and seemed destined to stay for many years. He had a record of   with a 3. 89 earned run average, and he was part of the team’s core, with a $23 million contract that could have bound him to Kansas City through 2021. “I love you my brother,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer wrote on Instagram, sharing a photograph of himself with Ventura. “I’m in disbelief and don’t know what to say. I love you ACE. ” Only one qualified starting pitcher, the Mets’ Noah Syndergaard, had a harder average fastball last season than Ventura’s Syndergaard’s averaged 97. 9 miles per hour, Ventura’s 96. 1 m. p. h. Ventura made three World Series starts, two in 2014 against the San Francisco Giants, and then a loss to the Mets at Citi Field in 2015. He gained a measure of notoriety last season when he was suspended for eight games for hitting Baltimore’s Manny Machado in the back with a fastball, inciting a brawl. Ventura was   with a 4. 45 E. R. A. in his final season. Marte spent the past two seasons playing professionally in South Korea. Once a promising prospect for the Braves, he was traded to Boston for Edgar Renteria in 2005, and he was then quickly sent to Cleveland in a multiplayer deal that brought Coco Crisp to the Red Sox. Marte played 278 of his 308 career games with the Indians, and batted . 218, with 21 homers and 99 runs batted in, over all. “He was a genuine person who always greeted you with a warm smile,” the Indians wrote on Twitter. Tony Clark, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said in a statement: “It’s never easy to lose a member of our fraternity, and there are no words to describe the feeling of losing two young men in the prime of their lives. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families, friends, teammates and fans throughout the United States and Latin America. ” The Dominican Republic’s president, Danilo Medina, posted on Twitter that the nation “is dressed in mourning with the deaths of Andy Marte and Yordano Ventura, great sportsmen who raised high our national banner. ” Fans began arriving at Kansas City’s Kauffman Stadium shortly after Ventura’s death was announced, leaving flowers, hats and other mementos outside. Flags at the ballpark were lowered to  . A 2015 study by the World Health Organization found that the Dominican Republic had the highest traffic accident death rate in the Americas, 29. 3 per 100, 000 inhabitants. The deaths of Ventura and Marte follow the death of another major leaguer, the Miami Marlins’   pitcher Jose Fernandez, in a boating accident in September.",0
18279,Understanding Transgender Access Laws - The New York Times,"The highly charged debate over transgender rights has resulted in a tangle of contradictory laws governing access to public bathrooms and locker rooms across the country. Many states permit transgender people to choose bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity, considering it a civil rights issue. But in a handful of states and cities, legislators are moving in the opposite direction. Here are some milestones in the national debate. 2012 | Cities including Austin, Tex. Berkeley, Calif. Philadelphia Santa Fe, N. M. and Seattle were among the first to pass laws requiring     restrooms, following a pattern emerging at schools and universities. Soon museums, restaurants and even the White House (in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) began rebranding restrooms, resulting in a dizzying range of creative signage and vocabulary. December 2014 | In a memo by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. the Justice Department took the position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied to claims of discrimination based on gender identity. The memo was one of a combination of policies, lawsuits and public statements that the Obama administration used to change the civil rights landscape for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. May 2016 | The Justice and Education Departments issued guidance that, under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student’s transgender status  —   and that the departments would treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX. Jan. 20, 2015 | President Barack Obama mentioned transgender people in his State of the Union address, a presidential first. “That’s why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,” Mr. Obama said. Nov. 3, 2015 | After a yearlong battle, Houston voters easily repealed an   ordinance that banned discrimination based on several “protected characteristics,” including gender identity. Opponents said the measure would allow men claiming to be women to enter women’s bathrooms and inflict harm. The message ”No Men in Women’s Bathrooms” on signs and in television and radio ads turned the debate from one about equal rights to one about protecting women and girls from sexual predators. (Houston became the largest city in the United States to elect an openly gay mayor, Annise D. Parker, in December 2009 she had pushed hard for the ordinance.) November, 2015 | Public schools began to write policies requiring transgender students to use private changing and showering facilities, drawing complaints of discrimination. February 2016 | The South Dakota Legislature approved a bill that would require public school students to use bathrooms and other facilities that correspond to their biological sex, defined in the bill as “a person’s chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. ” Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, vetoed it. The Legislature announced in January that it would consider a similar bill. March 23, 2016 | Meeting in special session, North Carolina legislators passed a   bill known as House Bill 2 barring transgender people from bathrooms and locker rooms that did not match their biological sex. Republicans unanimously supported the bill, while in the Senate, Democrats walked out in protest. “This is a direct affront to equality, civil rights and local autonomy,” the Senate Democratic leader, Dan Blue, said in a statement. The bill’s passage prompted the N. B. A. to withdraw this season’s   Game from Charlotte and led the N. C. A. A. to move playoff games in several sports  —   including   and   games in its most prominent event, the Division I men’s basketball tournament  —   out of the state. May 12, 2016 | The Obama administration took up a legal fight with North Carolina over the issue, quickly issuing guidance  —   signed by Justice and Education Department officials  —   that was sent to all school districts, outlining what schools should do to ensure that no student was discriminated against. The letter did not have the force of law, but it contained an implicit threat: Schools that did not abide by the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal dollars. The measure attracted criticism and support from across the country. Cities in the Deep South were increasingly at odds with their states on gay rights and other benchmarks, moving toward common ground with big cities on the coasts. And North Carolina, the rare Southern state that is evenly split between liberals and conservatives, was considered to be up for grabs in the November presidential race. But backlash against the law roiled the governor’s race and affected other crucial contests. April 19, 2016 | A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. ruled in favor of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who was born female and wanted to use the boys’ restroom at his rural Virginia high school. April 22, 2016 | As the Republican presidential   Donald J. Trump said that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with. At a town   event, he said that North Carolina’s legislation had resulted in an exodus of businesses and “strife” from people on both sides of the issue. “You leave it the way it is,” he said. “There have been very few complaints the way it is. ” Aug. 21, 2016 | A federal judge in North Texas blocked the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. In his ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, Judge Reed O’Connor said the government had not complied with federal law when it issued “directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. ” The Trump administration has decided not to challenge the injunction in court. September 2016 | Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed a bill requiring all   bathrooms to be gender neutral, effective March 1, the first such state legislation in the country. Jan. 5, 2017 | A bill revealed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities based on their “biological sex,” overruling any contrary local rules, and raising the prospect of a new confrontation with college sports officials and professional sports leagues. Feb. 22, 2017 | President Trump rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice and Education Departments rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. With Mr. Trump’s decision, the focus shifts to the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm’s 2016 lawsuit is scheduled for oral arguments at the end of March.",0
18280,Comment on Invention Secrecy At All-Time High: Thousands Of Patent Applications Placed Under Secrecy Orders by Physicists Say Consciousness Should Be Considered A State of Matter: The “Non Physical” Is Real – Collective Evolution,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Government secrecy is running rampant in an age where more and more people are demanding transparency. Did you know that the U.S. Government classifies over 500 million pages of documents each year? Justification for the mass classification of information is (apparently) done for the sake of “national security,” but as we know:   “The dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts, far outweigh the dangers that are cited to justify them. There is a very grave danger that an announced need for an increased level of security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of censorship and concealment. That I do not tend to permit, so long as it’s in my control.”– JFK ( source ) If a scholar wanted to research political, historical, scientific, or any other type of archival work, it would prove difficult and limiting seeing that most of their government’s activities are kept a secret. It is truly impossible to access the factual history of their country. The declassification of classified documents (a small portion) does not occur until decades after that information has been concealed, one great example of that is the UFO phenomenon, once believed to be a “conspiracy theory” by the masses before the substantial release of government documents showing otherwise. You can read more about that and access some of those documents here . Evidence is now pointing to the fact that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is no different. The office is supposed to legally protect the inventions of entrepreneurs and companies, some of whom have developed ground breaking technology. Unfortunately, that’s not the case as new documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reveal how the Patent Office has been using a secret system to withhold the approval of some applications. This 50-page document was obtained by Kilpatrick Towsend & Stockton, LLP, who commonly represent major tech companies that include Apple, Google and Twitter (to name a few). You can view that entire document HERE . ( 1 ) The program delaying patent applications is called the Sensitive Application Warning System (SWAS). Usually, when an application is submitted for a patent approval it requires a couple of examiners who work with the Patent office to go through their process of approval. This process usually takes approximately 1 to 2 years, but applications that are filed in SAWS must be approved from several people, and can be delayed for a number of years.   “There is no official channel to notify an applicant once their patent is placed in the system, and the Patent Office has denied requests to divulge what applications are on the SAWS list.” ( source ) The documents also indicate areas of technology that might have a patent application placed in the SAWS program – these include smartphones, internet-enabling systems and more. This information is set to be published in an online journal called “Law360” to inform the public. Tech Columnist Alyssa Bereznak at Yahoo News states that most companies are fully aware of this. I first came across this recent information in her article, which you can view here , but I felt compelled to add more information. As you will see below, there is more information that has surfaced prior to these documents that suggest this type of “invention secrecy” goes far beyond these technologies. One great example (out of many) of delayed patent applications comes from Dr. Gerald F. Ross. He filed a patent application for a new invention he had devised to defeat the jamming of electromagnetic transmissions at specified frequencies. It was not until June 17, 2014 (almost 37 years later) that this patent was granted. ( 2 ) Invention Secrecy Is Still Going Strong 
As great as it is to see new information pertaining to invention secrecy come to light, it’s also important to note (as reported by the Federation of American Scientists; see annotated bibliography) that there were over 5000 inventions that were under secrecy orders at the end of Fiscal Year 2014, which marked the highest number of secrecy orders in effect since 1994.( 3 ) This is all thanks to an act many people are unaware of. It’s called the “Invention Secrecy Act” and it was written up in 1951. Under this act, patent applications on new inventions can be subject to secrecy orders. These orders can restrict their publication if government agencies believe that their disclosure would be harmful to national security.( 4 )( 5 ) As mentioned earlier, “national security” has become an excuse and justification for the classification of a large amount of information on a variety of topics that the public is deliberately kept in the dark about. Apparently, many of these projects and inventions go far above and beyond presidential knowledge. “It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars, have been spent on projects which both congress and the commander in chief know nothing about.” ( source ) – Paul Hellyer, Former Canadian Defense Minister. So what type of technology is under restriction under the Invention Secrecy Act? We don’t really know, but a previous list from 1971 was obtained by researcher Michael Ravnitzky. Most of the technology listed seems to be related to various military applications. You can view that list HERE . ( 6 ) As Steven Aftergood from the Federation of American Scientists reports: “The 1971 list indicates that patents for solar photovoltaic generators were subject to review and possible restriction if the photovoltaics were more than 20% efficient. Energy conversion systems were likewise subject to review and possible restriction if they offered conversion efficiencies in “excess of 70-80%.” ( source ) Secrecy is No Secret A couple of years before the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951, the National Security Act was created. As a result, a number of intelligence groups and executive bodies followed. None of these groups had any active congressional oversight. The United States has a history of government agencies existing in secret for years. The National Security Agency (NSA) was founded in 1952, its existence was hidden until the mid 1960’s. Even more secretive is the National Reconnaissance Office, which was founded in 1960 but remained completely secret for 30 years. Along with this secrecy is the information these agencies obtained, and continue to obtain until this day. Special Access Programs are another great example of secrecy. From these we have unacknowledged and waived SAPs. These programs do not exist publicly, but they do indeed exist. They are better known as ‘deep black programs.’ A 1997 US Senate report described them as “so sensitive that they are exempt from standard reporting requirements to the Congress.” ( 7 )(8) We don’t really hear about black budget programs, or about people who have actually looked into them. However, the topic was discussed in 2010 by Washington Post journalists Dana Priest and William Arkin. Their investigation lasted approximately two years and concluded that America’s classified world has: “Become so large, so unwieldy and so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people it employs, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the same work.” (9) You can read more about the Black Budget in detail HERE . Today, it seems to be evidently clear that secrecy has lead to what Dwight Eisenhower warned us about: “In the council of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential disaster of the rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.” ( source ) What Has All This Secrecy Led To? 
The fact that so much information is concealed from the public domain has led to a kind of “breakaway civilization.” A term coined by Richard Dolan . 
Someone, or some groups are “in the know.” This or these groups who have had access to information over many decades that the public hasn’t is no doubt living and perceiving the world in a different way from what the masses do. This has led to a world within worlds, a separate civilization apart of our own who have access to knowledge that we don’t. Who are they? What are they doing? Why are they doing it?

18281,Dark Horses Abound at the United States Open - The New York Times,"Cilic, 27, won his first Masters 1000 tournament at Cincinnati on Aug. 21 and vaulted back into the top 10 with a   victory over Andy Murray, the reigning Wimbledon and Olympic champion. Cilic, who had three match points against Roger Federer in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, kept Murray off balance with a nearly unreturnable wide slice serve, followed by flat bombs up the middle. After parting ways with his longtime coach Goran Ivanisevic, Cilic hired Jonas Bjorkman to help strengthen his forehand and his return, both of which let him down in crucial moments against Federer at Wimbledon. Against Murray at Cincinnati, Cilic returned brilliantly. Cilic is seeded seventh at the United States Open, and his rising level of play suggests that he could be rounding into the kind of form that led him to the title in 2014. With his classic technique and his flowing   backhand, Dimitrov has long been compared to Roger Federer, his idol. But Dimitrov, a    Bulgarian nicknamed Baby Fed, has struggled to live up to the lofty expectations of his early years on tour. At Cincinnati, he reached the semifinals before succumbing to Marin Cilic in three sets. Dimitrov played with remarkable discipline and attention to detail, reining in his tendency to try for a flashy winner in favor of playing   shots. Since Wimbledon, he has been working with Dani Vallverdu, who spent several years coaching Andy Murray, and the results look promising. Seeded 22nd, Dimitrov looks determined to reach his considerable potential. Since his stunning victory over Roger Federer in the 2009 United States Open final, del Potro has been sidelined for long periods by injuries to both wrists. But he has persevered against long odds to return to top form. Del Potro, a laconic Argentine, rejoined the tour full time this year and has steadily improved his conditioning and his match toughness. It all came together at the Olympics, where he beat Novak Djokovic in the first round and Rafael Nadal in the semifinals before narrowly losing the gold medal match to Andy Murray. Ranked 142nd, del Potro, 27, needed a wild card to get into the Open, but his return bolsters a draw weakened by the absence of Federer. With his blistering serve and his overpowering forehand, del Potro has the weapons to thrive on quick hardcourts. But it is his love of the battle that makes him a crowd favorite. After losing to Simona Halep in a tight final in Montreal, Keys reached the semifinals at the Olympics and then lost a heartbreaking   match for the bronze medal to Petra Kvitova. It is clear that Keys, a    American, is gaining confidence with each   match. After skipping the Cincinnati event and withdrawing from the Connecticut Open with a neck injury, Keys enters the United States Open as the eighth seed and should be fresh. With her powerful serve and her   groundstrokes, Keys has the ideal game to win on fast hardcourts. And as the youngest American player in the top 10, she should be buoyed by the crowd. While dominating the field at Cincinnati, Pliskova gave up only four games in her semifinal victory over the reigning French Open champion, Garbiñe Muguruza. In the final, Pliskova equaled that feat with a breathtaking display of power tennis, outhitting Angelique Kerber in nearly every baseline exchange to win,    . A       Czech, Pliskova has a booming serve and follows that up with clean, flat groundstrokes that push opponents deep behind the baseline. What sets her apart from her peers is her willingness to play stingy defense when necessary. She tracks down nearly every ball and has an uncanny knack for restarting points with neutralizing shots that frustrate opponents even more than her    winners do. Although the   Pliskova has never advanced past the third round of a major, her remarkable play at Cincinnati makes her a serious Open contender. At 22, Puig made history this month by winning Puerto Rico’s first Olympic gold medal, defeating three former Grand Slam champions (Garbiñe Muguruza, Petra Kvitova and Angelique Kerber) along the way. Puig played to win and went after her opponents on the big points with fearless ball striking. She has a somewhat unorthodox   backhand, hit with a loose and whiplike backswing, but it is deceptive, accurate and lethal. The confidence she gained from her momentous win in Rio de Janeiro is hard to calculate, but Puig showed that she could compete with anyone in the world. Seeded 32nd at the Open, she will be a dangerous presence in the draw.",0
18282,Why Trump’s Victory Wasn’t a Surprise,"Bernstein interview with John Pilger November 16, 2016 
America’s liberal elitists, who look down on the discontented working class and put up a presidential candidate representing a failed Establishment, set the stage for Donald Trump’s victory, journalist John Pilger tells Dennis J Bernstein.By Dennis J Bernstein 
Despite Donald Trump’s long history of stiffing workers, dodging taxes and abusing women, he will become the 45th President of the United States, a remarkable turn of events that has a lot of liberals and Democrats scratching their heads and wondering how he could have beaten the powerful Clinton political/money machine. 
One person who was not surprised was journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, who was born in Sydney, Australia, and now is based in London. Pilger has reported from all over the world, covering numerous wars, notably Vietnam. When he was in his 20’s, he became the youngest journalist to receive Britain’s highest award for journalism, Journalist of the Year, which he won twice. He also has an Emmy and his most recent book is Hidden Agendas and the New Rulers of the World . 
Dennis Bernstein: I’m going to ask you later on about the new film, which I’m very excited about. But let’s begin with [the Nov. 8] victory over Clinton, by Trump. Were you surprised? What do you think was at the core of the Trump victory? Journalist John Pilger (Wikipedia) 
John Pilger: You know, I wasn’t surprised. Brexit undoubtedly helped this. I wasn’t surprised. I think I’m quite surprised by how decisive his victory is. But I must say I felt rather angry, and I think we probably expended enough anger on Trump. He’ll, no doubt, provide us with plenty of material coming up. But I think it’s time for people, so-called liberal people, to look in the mirror. 
Who created Trump? Who created this disastrous election, so-called campaign? In my opinion the enablers of all of this was the liberal class, in the United States. The liberal class has refused to acknowledge, in its arrogance, the huge disaffection and discontent among ordinary people. And painting them in such broad strokes has been… what did Clinton call them?…”deplorables” and “irredeemable”? That’s really disgraceful. 
DB: Yes, that’s my father. 
JP: You know, Clinton was an extremely dangerous prospect. Dangerous because she represented a war making, rapacious status quo. The status quo would have, actually, altered slightly under her. It’s my understanding, in fact, I believe that she might have provoked a very major war, with Syria and with Russia. 
We don’t know what Trump will do. We have to now, putting aside all the parodies and the abuse, we have to now be thinking in terms of practicalities. He’s running the show. What will he do? But I think before we do that, again, we have to reflect on all the myths. 
I heard a Harvard professor on the BBC, on the very night, before the count began, talk about the hard left in the Democratic Party, and how she would have to embrace the idea of Bernie Sanders and what he stood for. You know, this kind of drivel, and misrepresentation has been everywhere. The media, personally, and I’m speaking of journalists, produced probably the most unfettered propaganda I can remember at any time. In my career, this has been the worst. 
There was no serious attempt, really, to analyze and examine either candidate and what they stood for. Trump was dismissed as a demon, with all the salacious stuff around him, undoubtedly some of it true, and all of that. But he was a serious candidate, he was never analyzed, and that’s why there’s a great surprise, and a great shock. 
And, it’s something that liberal America has to start coming to terms with itself. We had Barack Obama presented seriously as a candidate of hope and real change. He was nothing of the kind. He was in fact a warmonger. He’s got four wars going at once. He conducted an international terrorist campaign using drones. He has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any president in American history. And, you know, when you think of Trump’s disgraceful remarks about throwing people out of the country, and building a wall… who is the Deporter-in-Chief? The liberal Barack Obama. He has deported more people than any other president. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arresting suspects during a raid in 2010. (Photo Courtesy of ICE) 
So, all of these facts have been lost and they represent a real crisis for the opposition in the United States, the broad opposition. Barack Obama’s great achievement was that he killed off the anti-war movement, because people, doe-eyed from the beginning, thought that Barack Obama was some kind of genuine inspirational liberal, instead of the warmonger that he is. I think there’s a lot of these people [who] are going to be listening to your program, they need to hear this. 
Say that there is a real opposition to Trump and what he’s going to do. We don’t know what he’s going to do, but also an understanding of his constituency, the majority of Americans eligible to vote voted for him. That’s a fact that has to be come to terms with, we have to come to terms with. 
DB: You know I think, John Pilger, you know I’m thinking about all the things Hillary Clinton accused by Trump of, oh, you know, supporting Bill Clinton’s attacks on women, and molestations. I’m not really interested in that, at this point, because what I’m interested in is how she sustained Bill Clinton’s war policy. You remember Layla Al-Attar, right? You remember how Bill Clinton sowed his oats in his first days of his presidency by killing this leading artist of the Middle East who welcomed women into the art world, an unusual situation. It happened in the context of Hillary Clinton giving her famous speech in Beijing about women. But she never mentioned Layla Al-Attar. She never apologized to the family. Layla’s daughter was blinded, in that attack. She was getting operations, getting medical treatment near Stanford where the Clintons would go visit Chelsea. And she never said a word. But, anyway, more on that? 
JP: Yeah, well, that’s a very good and rather notorious example. Clinton’s war making is on the record, her destruction, and she was the lead destroyer of a modern state, Libya. And as a result of that destruction–which she gloated, on camera, she gloated about the gruesome murder of Gaddafi–in that destruction some 40,000 people died. Honduras, she was responsible for the coup against the democratically elected government. 
DB: They call her there the Deposer-in-Chief. 
JP: Yeah, yeah. And the idea that among certain liberal people that she represented some kind of honorable alternative to the verbose and unpredictable Donald Trump is so absurd. I think, again, I think all this is important because there will not be an opposition, there won’t be an opposition to Trump, and there won’t be an opposition to the great national security machine that really runs the United States. 
I mean, okay, he’s anti-establishment, but that establishment isn’t going anywhere. And, yes, he will bring in his own establishment. He’s talking about defense secretary. Who is it? Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican of Alabama. And national security advisors will have a hawkish edge: General Flynn and Representative Duncan Hunter of California, there. So all this is unknown. The point is, there was very little between Trump and Clinton. And what really distracted people, diverted people, from understanding this was what is unfortunately called, because there has to be […] a better term, identity politics. 
Clinton was said to represent an advance for women. She’s anything but. She’s a diametric opposite of that. Clinton, the Democrats were meant to be an advance for people of color. Well, it was Clinton, the two Clintons, Bill and Hillary Clinton in the mid-90’s, who devised the so-called welfare reforms that most historians, political historians, now agree was the trigger for sending so many African-Americans into the gulag that is America’s prison system. 
So these, these have to be confronted because an opposition is going to be needed. At the present, there isn’t one, in my opinion. There was never an opposition to Barack Obama, a violent president, who seduced the media. It’s interesting that the more unpopular or that Donald Trump was made, with the media, and all of them were against him, all of them, bar some Murdock outlets, and others. But most media was against him. I think that helped to give him support. The media is held in such low regard by ordinary people. The so-called elites are held in such low regard by ordinary people. This is a class issue. There was a class issue running right through this campaign. And that has to be understood. 
DB: Indeed, that word class does not come up in the United States. We’re the upwardly mobile society. Everybody can make it. 
JP: Well, it didn’t. But it is, you know, that’s what I mean by identity politics. Gender and race are separated from class. And it’s not who you are, or what the color of your skin is, sometimes it is, perhaps often it is, but in the final analysis it’s the power you serve. And that’s class. And until the resistance to an intelligent understanding of that is swept aside, people are going to be mired in this, the distractions of identity politics. Where they don’t feel any obligation, really, to find out. To find out about how the rest of humanity, how the rest of their compatriots in the United States live and what their problems are. It’s all about “me, me, me.” And until that is understood and discarded, discarded, and real feminism returns, not the kind represented by Hillary Clinton, real feminism, to take one major issue, then the Trumps will triumph.

DB: Real feminism? What do you mean by that John, real feminism? 
JP: Well, I mean feminism that is part of class. The feminism that understands that it’s not just simply the privileges of bourgeois women. That’s it not simply the privileges of the readers of the New York Times, and the Guardian in this country. It is the rights of women everywhere. It is the right of women to life, in places like Iraq, but are bombed by Americans. I think it was actually the New York Times source for this but one extraordinary statistic I read not long ago, there were 700,000 widows created since 2003. The last 13 years in Iraq, widows, women… 
DB: 700,000… 
JP: 700,000… Now until those proclaiming themselves as feminists but keeping their feminism very parochial, very tight, and saying that a woman should be in the White House even if she’s Hillary Clinton, I would suggest they consider that fact. Those women have a right too. And those deaths were caused by American policies. And, all I’m saying is that the so-called identity, single issues have to stop being single issues. Feminism should be part of class, all the time. Because it’s poor women who suffer most. And a lot of the people who voted for Trump were those women. I read that, is it 52% of white women voted for him? 
DB: Something like that, yeah. 
JP: Well, that has to be understood. Those women have rights too. 
DB: In a little bit, I want to talk more about the press. I’m going to do that with you in the context of Jeff Sessions. Let’s talk specifically about one huge foreign policy issue. How do you understand… were you able to understand the difference between Clinton, Syria, Russia and Trump? You know, we know that the Clinton machine played Trump as a dupe of Putin, in Putin’s pocket, the Russians sabotaged the election, that’s what most people who were supporting Clinton probably now feel that Hillary would have won if the Russians didn’t subvert. But the actual policies, what do you understand about that? 
JP: If they believe that, Dennis, then they suffer from, I’ll be gentle, terminal naiveté. I really want to say that they are stupid. Because it’s really stupid to believe that. And it’s been proven to be stupid: that it was all down to the Russians. I mean, for God’s sake, what nonsense. You know? Those myths… projected by the media, should be rejected, immediately. We have to learn to deconstruct and reject these propaganda messages that come out. But that one is a particularly obvious one. How could people believe such nonsense? I find that, actually, quite depressing. And I’ve heard it from people. How could they believe such nonsense? That the Russians were actually on the side of Trump, he was in league with them, and all of that nonsense. 
What wasn’t reported was there was a strand running through a lot of Trump’s speeches that sounded to me like a kind of America first, what they used to call isolationist politics. We’re going to deal with our people at home, we’re not going to spend the treasure on overseas, and especially in going to war with countries. I mean, frankly, for those of us living outside the United States, who are not American, that’s encouraging. I always find it remarkable that I’ve got to this stage in life and that I haven’t really… and that I’ve survived American foreign policy. 
So, Clinton was a very dangerous prospect. Trump may be a dangerous prospect too. We don’t know. Will he do as he said, as he said in his acceptance, victory speech? We will have relationships, we will not have conflict with other countries, and all that. That could be just rhetoric. Trump is Mr. Rhetoric, so who knows? I think the most important thing is that an opposition is built, a genuine movement. Now, having been seduced and subverted by Obama, and largely by Clinton and others, there has to be a real oppositions in the streets. And it has to be informed. It can’t accept these terrible myths. 
DB: Hillary Clinton, just to bring it to Syria for a moment, she was very strong on a no-fly zone. And it did appear that Trump was a little more interested in negotiating. What do you see the dangers of a no-fly zone? That, to me, was perhaps the most frightening part of what her policy could have been. 
JP: I don’t know. I mean, he has said contradictory things on the Middle East. Very contradictory. He’s been bellicose, in one sense. But in another, he’s been… a thread that has run through Trump’s speeches, fairly consistent, and that is that he wants to do a deal with Russia. He doesn’t want to fight them. 
It’s ironic, because, as we speak… and I read only the other day, hundreds of thousands of NATO troops, Americans, British, and others, in effect, massing on the borders of Russia. Now what will happen to them? What will happen to that provocation? That’s a very, very dangerous provocation. Now, will Trump diffuse it? Will he step back? I don’t know. 
It’s interesting, he has spoken against NATO. In fact, for the Republican Convention Platform his people were asked to remove one issue, and that was that NATO would receive renewed shipments of weapons. And they were quite specific about removing that. That was pointed out to me by Professor Steven Cohen, who’s been very interesting on this at New York University, and taken a lot of criticism for taking seriously, or at least analyzing some of the things that Trump has said over Russia. But, you know, we never know if he meant it. He’s contradicted himself. So, now we’re about to find out. 
DB: I’m laughing a little bit because I think I’m a little bit afraid of the potential, in terms of where this could go. I’m not sure if I would be more frightened if Hillary was elected. A lot of people are furious with me for taking this perspective. But I, as you’ve outlined, Iraq, Libya… given the history, you know Honduras, Hillary Clinton, her hands are full of blood. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions donning one of Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” caps. 
JP: Dennis, it’s an uninformed, and often the… and often a willfully uninformed and ignorant fury that you’re describing. It’s a knee-jerk. You know we’re in the age of the knee-jerk, of social media, knee-jerk, government by Facebook, war by media. It’s an anti-intellectual time, not to think through. So the fury you describe, I would suggest, is almost a willfully ignorant one. Because what are we if we’re not questioning, and what are we, if we’re not pointing out that which the mob, as they used to call them in the 19 th century, disagrees with? 
DB: Now, let me sort of put Henry Kissinger and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, as he’s known inside Alabama, together in a question about the media. It was very interesting to me… I mean I have investigated a number of church burnings, probably 30 or 40 that took place in Alabama when Jeff Sessions was the attorney general. Before that he was the U.S. attorney prosecuting phony voter fraud. 
But Jefferson Sessions is the pre-eminent racist. I was interested, everybody was upset about David Duke. Well, he’s a frightening fellow, former Klan member. But it was Sessions who was the uptown Klan. He was one of the funders, he was one of the prosecutors of the same kinds of stuff that continue in terms of undermining people of color’s rights to vote, and poor people’s’ rights to vote in this country. But the media, they were upset about Duke, but they don’t know who Sessions is. 
JP: No, they don’t know. Isn’t that interesting? And Sessions is being considered, as I understand it, as Trump’s Defense Secretary. 
DB: Well, for him, anything outside the border of Alabama is foreign policy. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking to the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) 
JP: Yeah. Now, if that’s correct, then […] how you’ve described him, of course, it’s worrying. This is a new situation, entirely new situation. And this is Trump now building a completely new, presidential establishment. But I do stress, that the so-called old establishment, the Pentagon, the intelligence, the NSA, the CIA, and all the rest of them, are going nowhere. They are the establishment. They will remain the establishment. 
Actually, Trump reminded us, in his acceptance speech that he had something like 200 generals and admirals… I suppose there must be a lot of generals and admirals, former ones anyway hanging about. But he had 200 of them. Hillary had a lot of them because the Pentagon serving generals and admirals came out and demanded that Trump be beaten. Just as the CIA demanded that Trump be beaten. And the State Department demanded that Trump be beaten. He’s building his own establishment but those… the old establishment will remain as powerful as it’s always been. 
What will give Trump power is the fact that he has both the houses in Congress, including many of his enemies in the Republican Party. And they also demanded that he be beaten. So that’s a volatile situation. 
DB: Indeed it is. What about this? How do you see this sort of parallel structure that people talk about in terms of the relationship… you mentioned it in the beginning of the interview, between the Brexit vote and Donald Trump? Is this sort of a parallel structure? 
JP: Yeah, I think it’s related. And your first question, you know, was I surprised? Yes. Ah, no, I wasn’t surprised that much, because of Brexit. I think we are at a stage in contemporary history where people almost feel like a Greek chorus, they can see and they are aware of what is happening, but they feel they can’t do anything about it. I think that’s widespread. 
And it doesn’t only apply to working people. I think it applies, in the United States, of course, we go back to the issue of class. It certainly does apply to working class people, but it applies to many in the middle class which has been destroyed by these extreme neoliberal economic policies, in recent years. 
So, that’s what happened here, in Brexit. I always felt that Brexit was a rebellion. It was a rebellion. It was people saying, “We’re fed up with these arrogant elites, taking away our basic rights, ignoring us, not hearing us.” And I think many people…it wasn’t… it was painted, of course, by the liberal class in Britain, as the result of a possibility of increased immigration. Yes, that was part of it. But it wasn’t… it was only part of it. (Photo by Luis Felipe Salas, 2009) 
It was about impoverished people, people losing the very underpinning of their security and the security for their families. And that’s exactly true in the United States. You go to places like Kentucky where… in those ravaged coal areas, where the life expectancy, I read recently is less than that of Ethiopia. Alright, that may be right at the end of the spectrum. But, you know, it applies to all the states that Trump won. Pennsylvania, particularly, Ohio, and others. 
Yeah, and that applied here in a different sense, but not really. It’s about… it’s about a rebellion. In the United States, there is a vacuum on outside the establishment. I would say that both Clinton and Trump were extreme right-wing. That’s how I would describe them. 
DB: Well, it was a riveting moment, I guess you could say, when I think it was in a debate with Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton evoked, as one of her key advisors, Henry Kissinger. 
JP: Yeah. 
DB: That was pretty extraordinary, right? 
JP: Yeah, well, you know as someone who should have been prosecuted a long time ago, has been wrong on practically everything anyway, I’m not surprised. She is extreme right-wing. Trump is extreme Populist right-wing. And we’re still to find out what that means. 
But my point is, that that, even in the center, in the social democratic space, in the former, going way back, Democratic Party space which now doesn’t… Democratic Party as far as a reforming party is long gone. But that doesn’t exist. The United States has never had a Labor Party. They’ve got a Labor Party, we’ve got a Labor Party here, but that’s been corrupted by our very own, although rather different in personality, Clinton-type character, Tony Blair. And all the others. That’s been corrupted. 
And that… in Britain, that has given rise to the extraordinary popularity of Jeremy Corbyn, who never wanted to be leader of the Labor Party, but was really swept up in it by a popular movement, that came straight from this disenchantment, this disaffection, this rejection of the political system. 
The same disaffection and disenchantment is in the United States. But who do people vote for? Who do people vote for? In comes Trump, trumpeting all the American stuff about, you know, I’m a rich man, but I got rich because I knew how to do it, and you can too. Speaking this populist language. I don’t think Sanders was ever a threat. And really Sanders is a disgrace. You know, his embrace of Clinton was so false some, to the point where Clinton could declare him as an ally. So he was never a threat. He joined, he joined up. 
DB: That was really troubling, and obviously, a lot of young people who supported Bernie Sanders, were profoundly troubled. And, I’ve spoken to some of them, and they are furious, and they didn’t show up for Hillary even though they had it drummed into their heads, things like, “Even if it’s just the vote on the Supreme Court, that alone is worth it.” The appointment of liberal judges. 
JP: Yeah. This is grasping for straws, really. And people have got to be, got to stop being disappointed. They’ve got to be stopped being shocked. Stop being surprised. They’ve got to understand why something happened. They’ve got to inform themselves. And they’ve got to be part of a real movement, a real oppositional movement. Nothing less than that will do now.   uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2009. (White House photo) 
DB: John, you’ve got a new film that’s just coming out now, about to come out. Among other things, it’s sort of a document that calls attention to the fact that the United States, under Barack Obama, has been engaged in a massive, and very dangerous nuclear buildup. This is in the context of Hillary Clinton being Secretary of State. So would you tell us a little bit about what you’ve learned about Obama and about the film? 
JP: Yeah, not only… well, it’s about China as a target. At present… and, Dennis, this is truly shocking, in the northern hemisphere, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. led NATO forces since World War II, confronting Russia. In the Asia-Pacific, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. Naval forces confronting China. This was not an issue. This was not an issue. It is truly something in the election campaign that we just had. And the… you know, we’re faced with so much provocation [that] has gone on, and that’s what my film is about. It has to do with the Asia-Pacific. But the nuclear issue has returned. 
Under Obama, nuclear warhead construction and spending increased massively. It increased in spite of Obama’s pledge in 2009 to help get rid of nuclear weapons. The opposite happened. There’s something like a trillion dollars has been earmarked to be spent on nuclear weapons development in the coming years. Nuclear… the whole nuclear issue is so urgent, it’s so urgent because of this, these provocations against Russia, against China, both of them nuclear armed powers. China has reportedly changed its nuclear weapons policies to first strike, as a direct consequence of this pressure from the United States. Now what will happen to that? That’s such an important question, because war and peace really should be at the top. If a kind of apocalyptic war broke out then all other issues are irrelevant. 
DB: We see this in the so-called U.S. Pacific Pivot, how dangerous this is getting. Again, because of idiotic U.S. press, all attention is on this so-called maniac in North Korea that we have to do something about. But I think the point here is that we’ve got another… when it comes to nuclear proliferation, and weapons, we’ve got a maniac in the White House. 
JP: Well, yeah, that’s it. And there’s always been a maniac in the White House, I’m afraid. And that’s why I said recently I am always grateful that I’m still here, that I haven’t found myself witnessing my own demise in some nuclear apocalypse, that was the result of U.S. foreign policy. Our understanding of who’s the maniac… I don’t think North Korea is a threat, really, to anybody, frankly. 
What North Korea wants is a peace. They want a peace treaty with the South. They want a peace treaty with the United States. They almost had it a while ago. That’s what they want. And I don’t think they’re a threat. But they’re exploited. With their recent test of, I think a nuclear missile, the U.S. has employed, or is about to employ these THAAD missile defense system. These are very aggressive. They got the word defense in there but they’re very aggressive. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is launched during a successful intercept test by the US Army, September 10, 2013. (Wikipedia) 
DB: And they’re aimed, they’re meant to be aimed, at China. 
JP: They’re aimed at China. They’re not aimed at North Korea, well maybe in the end, North Korea. But North Korea is regarded, really, contemptuously, as an oppositions of power. They’re aimed at China. And China is being told now–this is from Clinton’s speeches, that WikiLeaks released–according to Clinton, you know, the threat against China is that you control North Korea or we’ll let you have some of their missiles, but they’re all aimed at China. And when I was in Okinawa recently, there’s no question, 400 – 500 miles from China, that in the 132 U.S. bases on the island, they were all aimed at China. Now that is a massive, provocative situation. Will Trump dismantle it? Or will he appease it? Or will he use it? These are the questions. 
DB: These are big questions. And this may seem a little bit silly but I think it makes a lot of sense. In the midst of everybody talking about the crazy person in the north, we learn that Park, the current president, the daughter of the late and bitter dictator of South Korea has been… one of her key advisors has been a seer. That she’s been taking advice from somebody who has been essentially sort of a phony, if you will, a crystal ball reader who has the attention of the president. And so we find out that policy coming out of our allies in the south, with this huge massive military operation happening in Jeju and other places. She’s taking orders… people made fun of Nancy Reagan. 
JP: Yeah, well I’m not surprised. I mean, South Korea is a colony. It’s not an ally. It’s an American colony. But it’s a colony that, as a lot of colonies, can cause you a lot of trouble. The French found that with Algeria. And it’s got potential for trouble. It could, you know, it could… it has some very extreme people there, and they could start a war. But it is a colony. It has thirty odd thousand U.S. troops, bases all over it. And as you mentioned, it has this… the South Koreans have built this new naval base on Jeju Island, with facilities for nuclear submarines, and Aegis missile destroyers and all the rest of it. 
So… these places are flashpoints. They’re flashpoints in… almost in a war waiting to happen, or in a war that is being beckoned. During the old Cold War–and I think we’re in the second Cold War now–during the old Cold War, there were red lines, at least, [that] you didn’t cross, there were spheres of influence. And you might probe but you didn’t really cross the red lines marked down by the Soviet Union, and…which were mostly in Europe, to protect itself, of course. And the Soviets, although they supported liberation movements in the developing world, did not confront the Americans there. So there were these red lines. There are no red lines now. That’s the difference. It’s much more dangerous, now, in my opinion. 
DB: Well, and, you know, it’s interesting I’m on my way out to North Dakota, at Standing Rock, and where we see the Indigenous communities of North America trying to once again warn the genocidists of the United States government, how dangerous it is to be destroying the Earth, the water flow, not to mention destroying sacred burial grounds. We see, we’ve got Bull Connor coming back, in the sense that we’ve got dogs, an incredible, heavily armed force, brutally going after people who are resisting with their bodies, with their buffalo, with their beliefs. And the lines are drawn again. And no major candidate mentioned Standing Rock, I don’t think. JP: Yeah. 
DB: Trump is invested, by the way. He’s invested there. 
JP: None of these pressing issues were mentioned. That’s why it’s a very strange time. What is going to happen now? But, again I repeat, I think it’s time for people to organize. There has to be an independent, an extra-parliamentary, if you like, opposition. An opposition, a movement of the streets, a movement among people having been shamed into silence almost, during the Obama years. People have got to come back now. 
DB: It’s amazing how many smart people can be so stupid. I guess they are well schooled but they don’t have any ability to understand foreign politics. I don’t know. This country is desperate in that regard. How little the politicians know about the rest of the world. It’s incredibly troubling. 
JP: Yeah, so in one sense it’s up to us, in the broader sense of us. Not to believe the myths. Not to accept the propaganda, not to retreat in our own introspective worlds of me. But collectively to do something. 
DB: John, I left upstairs, all the background on your film. Could you remind us the name of the film and what’s the schedule in terms of the distribution, and how people can pay attention? 
JP: Yeah. Well, my new film is called “The Coming War on China.” And it will be broadcast on the ITV network in Britain, which is the biggest television network in Europe. It will be broadcast here [England] on the 6th of December. It will be released around the same time. As yet, we don’t have a distributor in the United States, and it’s always difficult but we’re doing work on that. And it really is about the recurring theme in much of my work, and that is the imposition of great power on people, and their resistance to it. And it’s very much, as I’ve mentioned, about the renewal of the nuclear danger. But it traces the history of the abuse of people in order to achieve a nuclear supremacy. Part of the film is set in the Marshall Islands where between 1946 and 1958 the equivalent of more than one Hiroshima was exploded every day. People were guinea pigs. The noon time “Human Chain” at the entrance of the Naval Base at Gangjeong Village, done to remind the South Korean Navy that the opposition to the construction of the naval base on Jeju Island has not ended. (Photo by Ann Wright) 
DB: And they’re still suffering. 
JP: And they’re still suffering. So the film traces this across a broad landscape. It starts there and it brings us across the Pacific to the 400 U.S. bases that ring China. One of which, a very important one, is in the Marshall Islands. So it tries to explain the geopolitical situation in the Asia-Pacific, and the resistance to it. It has some extraordinary people resisting this militarism in Okinawa, and Jeju, and the Marshalls. And we’ve got a lot to learn from them. 
DB: And just to note, I mean it is interesting the Chinese are not sitting still for this and they’ve just joined, if you will, with the Russian fleet on their way to Syria. So this is getting pretty ugly. 
JP: Yeah. 
DB: This is a touchstone for more terrible things. Well, John, I do thank you for spending the hour with us. It’s always enlightening, to have you. I want to tell people that your name is John Pilger. And you’re, really, an inspiration to me and many journalists who really believe in getting down and finding out what’s really going on. One of your latest books is Hidden Agendas and the New Rulers of the World. You’ve got your film coming out The Coming War Against China. And you wrote a piece most recently Inside the Invisible Government War: Propaganda, Clinton and Trump. And you did an excellent interview with Julian Assange. 
JP: Yeah, yeah. Interestingly, that interview with Julian Assange went out on, RT, Russia Today, and one of the reasons it did, well they a good job of it, such a good job that it ended up with something like four million viewers. But no other broadcast, mainstream broadcast would take it. They have their own agendas. And that has to be understood by people. If you want to find out what is going on, you abandon the media as it’s presented to us. It’s unwatchable, it’s really just a product of enduring propaganda. 
DB: And if you happen not to like Donald Trump, you can thank the corporate media who didn’t mind getting rich on Trump. And sort of gave him 50 to 1 coverage compared to the other candidates. 
JP: Yeah, yeah. 
DB: Unbelievable. What a struggle. Dennis J Bernstein is a host of “Flashpoints” on the Pacifica radio network and the author of Special Ed: Voices from a Hidden Classroom . You can access the audio archives at www.flashpoints.net .",0

18284,"This Will END Hillary’s Campaign, HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING DOWN","October 30, 2016 at 1:18 PM 
Right now we are at a pivot point in this nation’s history as important as any time in the past. We have the choice over the next 9 days to elect a woman who has proven time and time again that she and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, operate outside and above the law. Or we can elect a person who appears to represent values quite the opposite of Killer Clinton. 
This Moonpie Mafia’s last venture into the Oval Office was filled with scandals from the very minute they entered the White House through their exit, carrying every bit of furniture and silverware they could load in their U-Haul trailer. Their body count runs to the millions when you take into account the destruction of other countries during their despotic reign And Bush was even worse. 
Have we forgotten the nearly 80 men women and children (22)of the Branch Dividians, murdered by armed goons on the direct order of Janet Reno, Killer Clinton’s hired assassin and attorney General. 
Did we forget that Madeline Albright, Killer’s Secretary of State, when she bragged about a 500,000 body count as an acceptable death toll in Central Europe, as Killer’s husband sent in his mercenaries to slaughter innocent civilians in Croatia, Slovakia and Slovenia while supporting puppet regimes and war lords who murdered millions of their peoples through planned genocide. How about Rwanda with the death toll that was well in excess of 500,000. I recall Bill Clinton basically saying “Ooops. Sorry. I guess I kind of missed that one–hey Monica–how about another blow job. I really get off getting head while I shoot some cruise missiles at the people in Iraq and Afghanistan” It sure defines “Getting off” 
I guess the memory hole is just that deep. Idiots and morons will elect Killer because they either know nothing of history, don’t care about the Clinton’s death toll or actually like the idea that this psychopathic murdering mutant bitch might actually be elected to the highest office in the land. Anyone who voted for Killer votes for death by the number and democide by the millions. 
When it comes to Trump, I’m not a fan of his either. But when given the choice of Killer or Trump I am forced to chose between the lesser of two evils. BIG EVIL lives in the skin of Killer Clinton. Whatever lives in the skin of Trump is, I am convinced, is far less a danger to the Republic (in name only) than Killer Klinton and her Blood thirsty Killer Klown Klan",0

[In what was intended to be a private QA session at Wellesley College, Clinton was asked what aspect of her campaign she would do differently, to which she responded, “I’d win. ”  Clinton’s campaign was marred by controversy after private emails released by Wikileaks revealed extensive collusion between her campaign and the media. The FBI also investigated her on charges of mishandling her private email server midway through the campaign. The former secretary of state also drew criticism for describing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables,” as well as generally failing to provide a convincing message to the American people on issues such as the economy, national security, and immigration. Clinton also suggested that sexism damaged her chances of winning, arguing that as the first woman nominated for the presidency by a major political party, “you know you’re going to be subject to unfair and    criticism. ” Amazing to see @HillaryClinton speak today @Wellesley ! What a great way to kick off #womenshistorymonth #wellesleycollege pic. twitter.   —   Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) March 3, 2017,  On the subject of passing legislation, Clinton took the opportunity to make a veiled dig at Trump, arguing that “compromise is not a dirty word in a democracy. ” To avoid her remarks leaking out to the press, Wellesley closed the event to the media and asked attendees to keep their cell phones off.

18289,"Pamela Geller: Trump Gets an A for Riyadh Speech, But He’s Wrong to Say Terrorists Aren’t Invoking Koran","Pamela Geller of the American Freedom Defense Initiative joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday’s Breitbart News Daily to give her review of President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East. [“It was a good speech,” Geller said of President Trump’s remarks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the weekend. “It’s just that President Obama had set the bar so low that just the mention of Islamic terror is cause for jubilation. That’s how bad it is. ”  “It was a mixed bag. I hope that he follows through on many of these initiatives. These new centers for combating extremist ideology  —   again, the fear of not naming the motive, of a motiveless ideology, is deeply troubling,” she said.  “Of course, King Salman’s remarks were as telling and revealing as President Trump’s,” she added. “The idea that he does not speak to the Islamic teachings and text that call for jihad, he does not speak to jihadic doctrine. He spends the entire time telling us, preaching to us, that Islam is a religion of peace and that it has a history of coexistence. I don’t know what period he’s talking about because for 1400 years   Christians, and Jews, were forced to live in dhimmitude under denial of basic human rights. ”  “And, of course, he cites that famous Koranic quote that CAIR cites, that President Obama cites, about if you save one life you save the world entire  —   when, in fact, that is a Talmudic verse that was cribbed by the Islamic religion, and it really is an implied threat to the Jewish people. We don’t have to get into the   of it, but the whole speech of King Salman’s was a deception,” Geller charged. (CAIR is the Council on   Relations, a political organization in the United States.)  “I’m very glad that President Trump talked about fighting ISIS because according to leaked emails from Hillary Clinton, the Saudis were supplying ISIS, and Qatar was supplying ISIS. They can’t continue to play both sides, which the Saudis have done brilliantly for decades,” she said.  “So when President Trump says, ‘Drive them out of the mosques,’ that’s a tricky one because how are countries living under Muslim rule going to drive the most devout out of the mosques? That’s where I think President Trump got it wrong, when he said that terrorists were falsely invoking the name of God. No, they’re not. They’re citing Koran chapter and verse. That was misleading,” said Geller. “It is pure Islam. It is authentic Islam,” she insisted. “I mean, when he says that the terrorists do not worship God they worship death  —   that’s just not true. They’re dying in the cause of Allah. They’re not screaming, ‘Death akbar.’ They’re screaming ‘Allahu akbar.’ They pray five times a day. If you look at ISIS videos, they pray after they slaughter in the cause of Islam. ” “Abu Bakr   the Caliph of the Islamic State, has a Ph. D. and a master’s in Islamic theology from the world’s leading Islamic university,” she pointed out. “Do Western leaders presume that they know more than he does about Islam?” Geller went on to “emphatically state that the battle between good and evil was an extraordinary statement, wonderful” in Trump’s Riyadh speech. “Even though the White House released the text calling it ‘Islamist extremism,’ he said ‘Islamic extremism.’ That’s an important point because that word ‘Islamist’ is a ridiculous word. It’s nothing except the person using it doesn’t want to offend Islam by speaking unwelcome truths about the political nature of that religion,” she argued. “Overall, it was an A,” she graded Trump’s speech. Marlow noted that Trump surprisingly removed the qualifier of ‘radical’ Islamic terrorism and referred simply to ‘Islamic terrorism’ directly. “It was brilliant,” Geller said, mocking how adversarial media outlets chastised Trump for declining to denounce “radical Islamic terrorism” as if he were backing away from his campaign rhetoric, when, in fact, what he said in the Riyadh speech was even more blunt and direct. She also jeered at a CNN headline that took Trump to task for allegedly failing to discuss human rights in Saudi Arabia. “Oh, my God,” she exclaimed. “You had President Obama, who was aiding and abetting the mass slaughterers, who never uttered the word, who gave billions to one of the worst human rights violators on the planet, Iran  —   and that was the CNN headline  —   like they give a fig about human rights in Muslim countries! It’s extraordinary. The coverage is almost Kafkaesque. ” Geller said it was “thoroughly enjoyable” to watch the media struggle to come up with talking points that portray Trump’s Middle East trip as a failure. “He just delivered to the Saudis the largest arms deal  —   and, of course, we know that is really because of Iran. Iran is fighting the Saudis in Yemen,” she noted. “President Obama would harp on this, the biggest victims of this extremism are Muslims themselves. That’s a false narrative because the Sunni vs. Shia  —   you saw that with ISIS when they would line up their victims and ask them specific questions about Islam. The Sunni don’t think the Shia are Muslims, and the Shia don’t think the Sunni are Muslims. They’re fighting for who is the true Muslim. When the West says, ‘Oh, they’re killing Muslims’  —   again, that’s in your mind, but not in the mind of the Sunni and not in the mind of the Shia. ” “I am concerned about that arms deal,” she added. “The common enemy of Iran and the Saudis, of course, is Israel. Right now, the Saudis need Israel because Iran has been newly emboldened and newly enriched and newly armed, thanks to President Obama. That’s sort of scary. Where is the law of unintended consequences going to be?” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. ",0
18290,It Looks Like George Soros is Funding the Trump Protests Just Like He Funded The Ferguson Riots,"Does someone behind the scenes want to see civil war in the United States? 
The answer is almost certainly yes. 
And it isn’t likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. (If you aren’t prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe .) 
Just a little background: this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on Craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. 
For example, one Craigslist ad was answered by Paul Horner, who admitted he was paid $3,500 to cause a scene at a Trump event in Fountain Hills, Arizona. “As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to…” ( source ) 
Actors Wanted – Knowledge of politics or skilled fighting a plus! (see image ) 

The same report goes on to say: When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally. “Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back” 
You can also read this article , in which a quote caught on video from Project Veritas shows how the Clinton campaign caused disruptions via “bird-dogging.” There’s a lot of evidence that someone is funding these protests. 
An eyewitness in Austin, Texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses. 
Then there was this Craigslist ad. (see image ) 

There are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the Clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the American people. Why would anyone want to cause all this trouble? 
That’s where the web gets tangled. It certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to America. After all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny – like martial law, for example. 
Exactly. 
That’s precisely the plan. 
Back in August, hackers from a group called DC Leaks got into the private documents of the Open Society, an organization founded by George Soros. Soros, whom DC Leaks referred to as “the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years” is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades. 
Zero Hedge reported on the findings in the Soros leak: The documents are from multiple departments of Soros’ organizations. Soros’ the Open Society Foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. Files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the USA, to Europe, Eurasia, Asia, Latin, America, Africa, the World Bank “the President’s Office”, as well as an unknown entity named SOUK. As the Daily Caller notes , there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016. Documents in the leak range from research papers such as “ EUROPEAN CRISIS: Key Developments of the Past 48 Hours ” focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled “ The Ukraine debate in Germany “, to an update specific financials of grants. They reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by Soros, and include reports on European elections, migration and asylum in Europe. An email leaked by WikiLeaks earlier this week showed Soros had advised Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State on how to handle unrest in Albania – advice she acted on. 
As well, it’s important to note that Soros provided a whopping $33 million to activists in Ferguson, Missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. The Washington Times reported: …liberal billionaire George Soros, who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org. Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times. In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson , according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations… 
This is business as usual for the OSF (Open Society Foundation), as explained by director Kenneth Zimmerman : Mr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early ’90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros’ grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society . “The incidents, whether in Staten Island, Cleveland or Ferguson , were spontaneous protests — we don’t have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “But these circumstances focused people’s attention — and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation.” Soros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson , building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. Other Soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive. The plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros‘ funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on another’s website, referencing each other’s news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook “likes” and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds. 
Soros was busted for paying protesters to go into Ferguson and stir things up. This is not theory. It’s FACT. The Daily Mail reported that Soros spent $33 million to bankroll the protests. The Washington Times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, Soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement ( source ). What a guy. Of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. The Ford Foundation and Rockefeller foundation also fund “social activism.” Which is kabillionaire code for “mess stuff up and wreak havoc.” 
Keep in mind that the organization Black Lives Matter was born through the Ferguson riots. Does this look familiar? 
If the Modus Operandi in these protests looks familiar, that’s because MoveOn.org is organizing a lot of them, and MoveOn is funded by …you guessed it: George Soros. The organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of Bill Clinton…are you seeing a link here? Another proud instigator is the Answer Coalition which also – are you sitting down? Has links to Soros. ( source ) 
There are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a Trump presidency. The unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. They are acting based on misinformation and they’re being professionally manipulated. 
The next step here is martial law, which nobody wants. 
Well, nobody except George Soros and friends. 
Someone who wants to see America ripped apart is causing this division. Last summer, it was leaked that Soros attempted to destabilize Russia and depose Putin in 2012. Putin responded by banning Soros and all of his organizations from Russia. In 2014, Putin issued an international arrest warrant for Soros. 
We could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing Soros immediately.

18291,A Computer Security Start-Up Turns the Tables on Hackers - The New York Times,"Standing before a crowded room of entrepreneurs and investors at a conference in San Francisco last summer, former Vice President Al Gore described how climate change could be contained, possibly even reversed. Next to take the stage was Kevin Mandia, the founder of Mandiant, a security company acquired by another security company called FireEye, who said nothing could be done to stop hackers from conducting digital attacks. The juxtaposition did not sit well with Oren Falkowitz, a former analyst at the National Security Agency. “I thought, ‘Really? We can solve global warming but we can’t stop cyberattacks? ’” Mr. Falkowitz recalled. He didn’t buy it. For the last two years, Mr. Falkowitz’s   Area 1 Security, has been trying to persuade the owners and operators of computer servers that have been compromised by state spies, criminals and hacktivists to allow the company to tap into those servers to monitor the attackers’ activities. Those servers have given the Area 1 team a much clearer picture of who is being targeted and what tools and websites attackers are using. And the security company has started to block attackers, heading them off days or even months before they hit their targets. It’s a new tack in an industry that in recent years has appeared less confident that it can block digital attacks. Most security   seeking funding today have resigned themselves to the inevitability of a breach and are focused more on identifying an attack as it plays out and praying that they can respond before the perpetrator makes off with something important. It’s as if everyone in the cybersecurity industry forgot that customers pay them to keep from being hacked in the first place. Mr. Falkowitz and his   Blake Darché and Phil Syme, think they have found a new way to turn attackers’ tools against them. For as long as there have been cyberattacks, hackers have relied on a vast network of compromised servers around the globe to funnel their malicious code, search out targets and steal data. By watching what happens on those compromised servers at dentists’ offices, farms, welding shops and tech companies, Area 1 believes it has secured a unique vantage point for monitoring and even blocking attacks. Area 1’s technology addresses one of the most pernicious digital threats:     attacks, which bait unsuspecting workers into clicking on links in emails and unknowingly giving attackers a toehold in their employers’ systems. Phishing attacks have become an epidemic. To date, more than 90 percent of breaches have begun with a phishing attack, according to Verizon. Intelligence experts say that phishing attacks are the preferred method of Chinese hackers who have managed to steal things as varied as nuclear propulsion technology and Silicon Valley’s most guarded software code. “Oren does not take it as writ law that we have to live that way, and he wanted to do something about it,” said Ted Schlein, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers, which has invested in Area 1. “If we could look every company in the eye and say, ‘We can stop your phishing attacks,’” Mr. Schlein said, “then Oren could look Kevin Mandia in the eye and say, ‘Thanks for the inspiration, but you’re wrong. ’” One of the biggest challenges in combating phishing attacks has been a lack of   among victims, security firms and law enforcement. Victims are reluctant to publicize security breaches, potentially keeping competitors from heading off similar attacks. And the role of the government in sharing threat data has been constrained since the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked documents revealing the scale of government monitoring. The Obama administration has been pushing to collect and share more threat data with the private sector. But few companies want to share any more data with the government than they are compelled to by law. Intelligence agencies say the lack of   works to attackers’ advantage. “We are in a very complex digital world that’s only going to get more complex as innovation presents challenges we haven’t even anticipated,” said Daniel Ennis, former director of the Threat Operations Center at the N. S. A. “People have incredible expectations of the government to keep them safe” online. “My concern is that the bad guys are going to   us,” he added. “The only way we’re going to   them is a partnership between the government, the private sector, the victims and academia. ” Until that happens, Area 1 may have found a way to circumnavigate the politics by recruiting the owners of those compromised servers around the globe. “Cyber is perceived as this ‘Matrix’  structure, but people forget that it’s also physical in nature,” Mr. Falkowitz said. “The players are not just the attackers and the victim there’s an entire underbelly of the web that has been subverted. ” Area 1 discovers, on average, 859 new targeting phishing sites a day. Now it can use its unusual vantage point to help its customers stave off attacks. It is still early days, but Area 1 aims to eventually end phishing attacks altogether, Mr. Falkowitz said. “We just went to Mars and found water, and people are saying we can’t solve this?”",0

18294,"N.J. Transit Engineer Has No Memory of Fatal Train Crash, Officials Say - The New York Times","HOBOKEN, N. J.  —   The engineer of the New Jersey Transit train that crashed into Hoboken Terminal on Thursday, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others during the busy morning commute, felt well rested and was unaware of any mechanical problems in the moments before the accident, federal investigators said on Sunday. At a news conference in Hoboken, officials from the National Transportation Safety Board said they had interviewed the engineer, Thomas Gallagher, as well as the train’s conductor, who was not identified, and still were no closer to determining the cause of the crash. It was the first fatal accident on New Jersey Transit trains since 1996, Bella   the vice chairwoman of the safety board, said. Ms.   said that Mr. Gallagher, 48, had no recollection of the accident itself and that the first thing he remembered was waking up on the floor of the cab afterward. She said Mr. Gallagher had told investigators that his cellphone was turned off and stored in a personal backpack, which remains in the cab of the control car. She also said Mr. Gallagher had reported that the train was traveling about 10 miles an hour when it entered Hoboken Terminal  —   a fact that apparently contradicted initial reports that the train was moving at a higher speed. New Jersey Transit announced on Sunday that all rail service in and out of Hoboken Terminal would remain suspended until further notice. However, the   Light Rail line at Hoboken was back in service, the agency said. The investigation into the crash has focused in recent days on retrieving data recorders from the badly damaged train that was carrying about 250 passengers when it failed to stop on the track and plowed through a barrier into a wall at the terminal. Transportation officials said on Sunday that investigators had retrieved one data recorder from the train’s locomotive, but that it was not functioning and had not provided any usable information. Investigators were trying to retrieve a second event recorder from near the front of the train, but it was still too dangerous to enter the area, officials said. The inquiry has also used drone footage and other videotapes to capture aerial images of the train, the officials said. But the investigators still have to determine precisely how fast the train was going when it entered the station. Ms.   would not discuss a separate audit of New Jersey Transit by the Federal Railroad Administration, except to say that it “will definitely be part of our process. ” The audit began in June after railroad officials noticed an increase in safety violations and a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency.",0
18295,Baby’s Extra Thumb Is a Blessing in Disguise as It Reveals a More Serious Problem on the Inside,"
It might seem strange for a parent to give thanks for a birth defect. 
However, in the case of one baby girl, being born with an extra digit might have saved her life. Image Credit: Flickr CC/ Lars Plougmann 
According to PopSugar , the newborn girl appeared perfectly healthy at birth— with one exception. Her tiny hand included an extra thumb. 
Love What Matters posted a photo of the baby girl on its Facebook page: Loading Facebook Post... 
As the newborn's parents explain, that third thumb earned their daughter some extra medical tests. And those extra tests led to an important discovery. They write : 
“Quincy has an extra thumb, which now we realize was a blessing in disguise. If she wouldn't have had this anomaly (along with her missing kidney), they never would have sent us to see a geneticist who referred us to a cardiologist. It was at her first cardiology appointment that we found out she has a congenital heart defect that will require surgery.” 
According to the National Institutes of Health , congenital heart defects affect approximately one out of 8,000 newborns, but can have few symptoms. It is even possible for doctors to miss the signs of a heart defect during a physical exam. Left untreated, a severe heart defect can lead to heart failure. However, with proper medical care, children with heart defects can go on to live healthy and active lives. 
Ironically, from the moment her mother first saw the extra thumb, she called it her daughter's “heart thumb.” Though she didn't realize it at the time, that nickname would be a perfect way to describe her “lucky” extra digit: 
“When Liv saw her thumb for the first time, she told us it was her heart thumb. If we would have only known how right she was! Quincy is our little heart warrior!” 
Affectionately calling Quincy their “little heart warrior,” her parents say they are fortunate that this “strong, beautiful baby” belongs to them. ",0
18296,How Electoral College Cheats Democracy,"How Electoral College Cheats Democracy November 13, 2016 
Exclusive: A shadow over Donald Trump’s “election” is the fact that Hillary Clinton appears headed toward a significant plurality of the national popular vote, a quirk from the archaic Electoral College, notes Daniel Lazare. 
By Daniel Lazare 
The election commentary now filling the Internet seems distinctly out of touch. Many analysts are castigating Hillary Clinton for all the things she did wrong, her failure to connect with white workers in the Rust Belt , her inability to sufficiently rally blacks , and so on. Or they’re criticizing the American people for falling for a racist, sexist know-nothing like Donald Trump. 
But these critics are ignoring the elephant in the parlor. The simple fact is that Americans didn’t elect Trump. An ancient relic known as the Electoral College did. For better or worse, a plurality of the people voted for Hillary Clinton. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking with supporters at a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, March 21, 2016. (Photo by Gage Skidmore) 
Indeed, her margin of victory is turning out to be bigger than many imagined. The latest count by the Associated Press has her ahead by about a half million popular votes, or Clinton’s 48 percent to Trump’s 47 percent. That’s about the same as George W. Bush’s losing margin in 2000 before a judicial coup d’état propelled him into office. 
But Nate Cohen of The New York Times ’s “Upshot” team is predicting that by the time all mail-in, absentee, and provisional ballots are counted, it will end up even bigger, i.e., as high as 2.2 million , or 1.7 percent. That’s ten times John F. Kennedy’s margin of victory in 1960 and four times Richard Nixon’s in 1968. 
If true, then Clinton will not only have won in terms of the popular vote, she will have won big (or as Trump might say “bigly” or “big league” depending on how you decipher one of his favorite expressions). Yet thanks to an obscure constitutional quirk, she’s not the one going to the White House. Instead, an orange-haired reality TV star is so that he possibly can do to the United States what he did to his own real-estate empire, i.e. drive it into bankruptcy. 
A Failure of Democracy 
Three things seem clear as a consequence. One is that America has a major problem on its hands. After all, this is the second time in 16 years that the people (or at least a plurality of the people) have been robbed of their choice for president. And both times political democracy has suffered a major body blow as a consequence. How much more abuse the democratic process can take without succumbing entirely is now open to question. An artist’s rendering of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 
A second thing is that no one has foggiest idea how to fix it. A third is that the ruling elite and its minions in the chattering classes don’t give a damn because, in contrast to the population at large, they benefit from the breakdown (it’s much easier to control a demoralized population that has lost faith in the value of democracy) and are therefore eager to sweep the entire issue under the rug. So let’s take these issues on one at a time and see where they lead. 
First, the problem. The Electoral College is a very Eighteenth-Century affair, an example of what happens when New World pragmatism combines with the Age of Reason’s love affair with ancient Rome. Faced with a tentative new republic in which “democracy” tended to be limited, local and individualist, the Framers concluded that a special body of elite electors was needed to hold the country together and ensure that a solid leader like George Washington took the reins. 
The decision may not have been unreasonable given the exigencies of the day. (The proposed Constitution was a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation, which made the states supreme. The Constitution shifted sovereignty to “We the People,” but the states, especially the small ones, still wanted a significant role in the new hybrid system.) 
Unexpected Problems 
But 230 years later, the device has turned out to have unexpected consequences. By awarding one vote for every senator and representative that a state sends to Washington, it triples the clout of demographic Lilliputians like Wyoming (population 586,107, according to the most recent estimate) at the expense of multi-racial giants like California (population 39.1 million). By forcing presidential candidates to concentrate on a handful of swing states, it sidelines Democratic strongholds like California or New York along with Republican bastions such as Indiana or the Deep South. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in an MSNBC interview. 
It also effectively cancels out millions of votes. Since Clinton carried New York State by 59 percent, it means that out of the 4.1 million people who voted her, some 632,000 might just as well have stayed home. Since she carried California by 61 percent, more than a million Golden State residents could have done the same. 
Since it makes it possible to rack up a majority of electoral votes by winning a plurality in a surprisingly small number of state contests, one reform group has calculated that a candidate could conceivably win with as little as 30 percent of the popular vote overall. Indeed, if a third party makes a strong showing, it could even be less since all the winning candidate would have to do is win a 34-percent plurality in as few as 16 states. 
As farfetched as such arithmetic may be, it shows how readily the two kinds of votes, electoral and popular, can diverge. The tighter the contest, moreover, the greater the chance that they will, which is why they did so in 2000 when Al Gore and George W. Bush were running neck-and-neck and again in 2016 when the race proved unexpectedly close. Rather than resolving differences fair and square, it’s a process all but designed to leave the majority (or a plurality) feeling cheated and scorned when races are hardest fought. 
Undercounting Urban Voters 
The Electoral College also tips the balance in favor of the Right by penalizing urban giants like California or New York, where ten times as many people ride the subways each day as live in all of Wyoming . Where Hispanics and racial minorities account for 44 percent of the ten most populous states, they account for less than 30 percent of the ten least. Yet it’s the latter who benefit. A protest placard at a rally in New York, April 19, 2016. (Photo by The All-Nite Images Flickr) 
This is unfair, undemocratic, and downright racist. But it’s also counterproductive because it prevents government from addressing human needs where they are most likely to occur, i.e. in crowded cities or traffic-snarled suburbs rather than in the Big Sky country of Montana where hardly anyone lives and cows outnumber people by better than two to one . 
Not that the Electoral College is the only institution that shamelessly flouts the principle of one person-one vote. The Senate is even worse since it gives equal weight to California and Wyoming even though the former’s population is some 67 times greater. But not only do two wrongs not make a right, but it turns out that Democratic senatorial candidates collectively outpolled Republicans on Tuesday as well by 45.2 million to 39.3 . But so inequitable is the system that the GOP still wound up with a 51-seat majority. 
Something must be done, which brings us to problem number two: the solution. The answer is that nothing can be done because, under the current system, the tools to fix it do not exist. In 2006, a Stanford computer science professor named John Koza came up with a clever scheme to sidestep the Electoral College by calling on each state to pledge its electoral votes to whoever won the popular tally. Once states accounting for a majority of electoral votes – as few as 16 as we have seen – signed on, it would be a done deal. 
But after ten states plus the District of Columbia lined up behind Koza’s reform, the movement stalled. One reason is that Republican states have no incentive to support a reform that clearly reduces their clout. Another is that swing states are even less inclined since they reap real-life rewards from their role as presidential battlegrounds . So the idea of democratizing the Electoral College appears to be a dead end. 
No Way Out 
That leaves reform via a constitutional amendment. But this is the unlikeliest of all thanks to an arcane amending process that requires two-thirds of each house plus three-fourths of the states to approve any change, no matter how minor. The first is a non-starter since Republicans control both the House and Senate, while the second is even worse since it allows just 13 states to block any reform sought by the remainder. U.S. Capitol. 
Thirteen micro-population states representing as little as 4.4 percent of Americans are not likely to do away with an arrangement that augments their own power. By the year 2030, they’ll be even less likely since their share of the population by that point will have shrunk to just 3.5 percent, according to Census Bureau projections . 
Unfairness thus appears to be locked in – not for years or decades but for as long as the current constitutional arrangement persists. 
Which brings us to item number three: the role of the political elite. As The New York Times pointed out on Friday , Clinton criticized the Electoral College during the “battle of Florida” in November 2000. 
“I believe strongly that in a democracy, we should respect the will of the people,” she said, “and to me that means it’s time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president.” 
Twelve years later, Trump lashed out at it as well, tweeting that it is “ a disaster for a democracy .” 
This time around, the silence is deafening. Trump didn’t mention it since he is obviously loath to quarrel with an arrangement that put him over the top. But Clinton said nothing in her concession speech about outpolling her opponent either. Why not? 
One reason is that she had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution as senator and had then invoked it too many times on the campaign trail to talk about changing the rules now that they had gone against her. But another is that any mention would lead to questions about how such an outmoded and inequitable system had been allowed to persist 16 years after the political disaster of Bush v. Gore. 
Why did the politicians fail to fix a system that is so obviously broken or – for that matter – even take any initial steps? How could they be so lax? These are questions that Clinton now finds inconvenient because she knows there is no easy answer, so she held her tongue. Her devotion to the constitutional status quo outweighs her loyalty to the plurality of Americans who voted for her. (One can only imagine how Trump and his angry supporters would have reacted if Trump triumphed in the popular vote but was denied the presidency. One might assume that he would cite that fact as proof that the system was “rigged.”) 
Losing Credibility 
But the problem is not going away. The system is, in fact, collapsing before our eyes. Elections are a mess because they’re in the hands of thousands of state and county officials with their own special rules and procedures – not because a system like this makes sense (it obviously doesn’t), but because that’s what the Framers decreed (or didn’t anticipate) and no one knows how to change it. President James Madison, an architect of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, but also a Virginia slave owner. 
Congress is frozen and corrupt while democratic accountability is nonexistent in an age of filibusters and anonymous Senate “holds” allowing a single legislator to prevent certain actions, such as confirmation votes for senior officials, from reaching the floor. Poland disappeared from the map in 1795 because a bizarre “liberum veto” allowed gave each senator power to block any bill and thus throw the entire government into paralysis. Yet today’s Senate “holds” allow individual legislators to do much the same. 
Meanwhile, the only thing worse than a rightwing thug like Trump is a rightwing thug whose legitimacy is in question and who therefore can be counted on to turn even more thuggish by way of compensation. 
Something should be done but nothing will be because the Founders had no idea that the system would last as long as it has and therefore neglected to include a workable toolkit with which to perform the necessary repairs. It’s not a pretty picture. But it will not get any better until the people face the problem of how to fix it on their own.

18297,How to Nurse Your Hangover (and Head One Off) - The New York Times,"Your head feels like it’s inside a bass drum, your mouth is cottony and the contents of your stomach might not stay put. Maybe you partied hard and had a little too much to drink  —   or maybe a lot too much  —   so you turn to the internet to search for cures to a hangover. To spare you the bleary   research, here’s what you should know before you drink. If you have to ask, count yourself lucky not to have experienced one. Not surprisingly, the more alcohol you consume, the better your chances of getting a hangover. Binge drinking of four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men during any one episode increases the likelihood of a hangover, Laura J. Veach, an associate professor of general surgery at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in   N. C. said in an email. Dr. Veach said a hangover occurs when the concentration of alcohol in one’s system is decreasing. It is at its worst when all the alcohol has been eliminated. “Addiction specialists have often noted that a hangover is technically a form of alcohol withdrawal at its most benign,” she said. The scientific community does not completely understand what causes hangovers, Dr. Preston R. Miller, a surgeon at Wake Forest, said in an email. Alcohol is a diuretic that causes dehydration and irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to nausea and dilation of blood vessels, which can cause the headaches associated with hangovers. Unless you are going to abstain or drink in moderation, the answer is no, experts said. Some commercial products promote themselves as surefire remedies but Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said in an interview: “The bottom line: When you get the hangover, there is nothing clinically proven to make it go away. There is no magic pill. ” A detailed survey of medical literature and research in 2005 concluded, “No compelling evidence exists to suggest that any conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. ” Among the commercial products promoted as cures: IV drips with a blend of saline solution and electrolyte replacement fluid, patches that are said to replenish the vitamins and acids lost when consuming alcohol, and a “natural dietary supplement,” only one dose of which is required to “prevent” a hangover, its manufacturer says. Dr. Miller said most cures treat the symptoms, such as a headache or dehydration, “but the only way to truly get over a hangover is time. ” Dr. Marc I. Leavey, a primary care physician in Lutherville, Md. who writes a blog, “String of Medical Pearls,” said in an email that the products were “gimmicks” that either relied on a placebo effect or were no more effective than slowly sipping ice chips or an electrolyte sports drink. “Alcohol consumption is a   market,” he wrote. “It would seem logical that attempts to cash in on the inevitable aftermath would spawn any number of products claiming to help, despite the lack of any foundation for those claims. ” Dr. Glatter recommended staying away from   liquors such as bourbon and whiskey. They contain more congeners, complex organic molecules that give the liquors their color and taste but also generate more intense hangovers. Better to drink clearer liquors, such as vodka and gin, which have fewer congeners, he said. Once the damage is done, Dr. Reed Caldwell, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, recommended hydrating with water, electrolyte drinks or coconut water, getting proper nutrition and exercise and taking a cool shower. He added that caffeine may help relieve symptoms from poor sleep but it will not reverse the effects of alcohol or a hangover. Before you start drinking, eat some food (it slows the absorption of alcohol) and have something nonalcoholic between drinks. Before bed, take a nonsteroidal pain reliever and drink water, Dr. Glatter said. Hangover cures remain a hotbed of research, he said, adding: “I think we’re going to get there. We’re not there yet. ”",0

18299,"As More Devices Board Planes, Travelers Are Playing With Fire - The New York Times","The Federal Aviation Administration, citing fire hazards, has warned against using Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on aircraft. Three Australian airlines and the German carrier Lufthansa have outright banned their use onboard. But the threat of airliner fires is not limited to Samsung devices, which the company has offered to replace. And the hazard is far more than theoretical. Qantas, one of the Australian carriers, had an onboard fire during a   flight this year when a passenger’s cellphone was crushed in the mechanism of a   seat and the phone’s   battery ignited. In January as a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta arrived at the gate, crew members discovered that a   bag containing two laptop computers had burst into flames, according to the F. A. A. The smoke prompted some passengers to use the emergency exits and wait on the wings until help arrived. The problem is   batteries, which have become the standard for portable consumer electronics, including phones, tablets and laptops, because of the power they can pack into a small package. They are also highly volatile. Battery fires were considered a contributing factor in the crashes of three cargo planes in the last 10 years: an Asiana 747 in 2011, a UPS 747 in Dubai in 2010 and a UPS   in Philadelphia in 2006. In January, the F. A. A. issued a warning that   batteries in a cargo hold carried the “risk of a catastrophic hull loss” on an airplane. So far there have been no airliner disasters specifically attributed to passengers’ digital devices. But experts worry about the sheer mathematics. The Royal Aeronautical Society in Britain estimates that even a   jet with only 100 passengers might have more than 500   batteries aboard. Those numbers, and the attendant fire risks, could eventually catch up with the   public. The question is: What to do about it  —   besides issuing advisories? The F. A. A. administrator, Michael P. Huerta, said in an email statement that the agency recognized that the batteries posed risks and that it was tracking all incidents in aircraft cabins “to help us determine what we can do. ” Mr. Huerta urged passengers to put their devices “in a   bag or other safe location” when not using them. But the F. A. A. is in a tough situation. Under the regulatory rules, it cannot ground the Galaxy Note 7 until the Consumer Product Safety Commission orders a recall. On Friday, the safety commission said it was working with Samsung on the terms of a recall and urged owners of the phones to stop using them. On Saturday, Samsung offered new guidance to owners: Turn off your phone and bring it in for a replacement. Congress has limited the F. A. A. ’s ability to place restrictions on   devices on airplanes beyond the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization, according to Laura Brown, an F. A. A. spokeswoman. The organization, a United Nations agency, says the devices should not be transported on passenger planes as cargo or in checked baggage. As for   use, the organization defers to each country’s rules. Any attempt to seriously restrict or even ban devices powered by   batteries would probably face an outcry from travelers, who have come to consider them an indispensable part of modern life. There would also be the question of who would enforce such rules, and how. Airport security   processes are already long and tedious, without adding a new layer of scrutiny. Until a few years ago, before the   use of phones and other electronic devices was allowed below 10, 000 feet, it was widely known that passengers surreptitiously defied the rule. Flight attendants complained that it was impossible to police. So the goal is to contain the hazard. In the event of a   battery fire in flight, F. A. A. standards may help minimize the damage. Seat covers, carpets, curtains and dividers are made of special materials that are flame retardant, even against a   battery fire, which burns in the neighborhood of 1, 000 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Isidor Buchmann, an engineer who runs the informational site BatteryUniversity. com. Some experts say those standards could suffice. “It’s damned near impossible to propagate a fire on an airplane,” said George J. Ringger, an aeronautical engineer with his own consulting company, who specializes in cabin interiors. “Could a passenger get burned? Yes. Would there be smoke that would propagate in the cabin? Do crews have protocols? Yes. ” But some other fire and safety experts are not as sanguine. A laptop battery fire could take hours to burn itself out. And the smoke emitted would be abundant and toxic. Michael Gilchrist is an engineer and   of PlaneGard, a maker of a case meant to contain the fire and smoke if a battery starts to malfunction. Customers include Air Tahiti Nui, which carries the PlaneGard case on transoceanic flights. “With a   laptop, you see what happens,” Mr. Gilchrist said. “You have a   or   event. That could cause a lot of problems. ” There is no global database with comprehensive information about battery fires from electronic devices in the cabins of passenger airplanes. The F. A. A. ’s tally  —   19 fires in the last five years  —   is based on what the agency’s spokeswoman, Ms. Brown, called an “informal list. ” The Australian authorities investigating the Qantas event in May found that there had been 17 episodes in their jurisdiction during the same period. A spokesman for the airline industry group, the International Air Transport Association, said its members had reported 24 cases in which a battery overheated and caught fire or released smoke in the passenger cabin. But Mr. Gilchrist says events often go unreported. “The reporting is horrendously bad, but if you sit and talk with a pilot or an aircrew, they’ll say it happens once a month,” he said. “This is not a remote occurrence. ” In 2013, after considerable pressure from customers, airlines began allowing passengers to use electronic devices from gate to gate. As the number of devices passengers typically carry has increased, more accommodations have been made for their use, including USB ports that let people watch   movies on their own devices and electrical outlets for chargers. “The advent of electronic devices, as well as an electric plane, raises new issues that ought to be addressed very carefully by the regulatory authorities,” said N. Albert Moussa, founder of the fire safety company BlazeTech and a consultant on airplane fire hazards. Although the Samsung recall is renewing public awareness of the problem, Mr. Moussa is not optimistic that it will prompt   solutions. “Historically, the community takes real action,” he said, only “when an accident happens. ”",0

18301,Hillary Clinton Refused to Fully Endorse Controversial NY SAFE Act,"Pinterest 
WikiLeaks’ email dump is proving a great deal of things about who Hillary Clinton really is and what she stands for. She’s rather comfortable with cozying up to Wall Street , she has nothing but contempt for the everyday American , and employs people who literally want to bring about a complicit and unaware citizenry (which she likely supports 100%). 
It is also no secret that she is very much a fan of sweeping foreign-style gun laws which would effectively destroy the Second Amendment without even repealing it (though she obviously has not read my refutation of her unconstitutional and oppressive platform ). She would be more than happy to make the laws of states like California, Maryland, or New York into federal law… 
So why did she not fully endorse the highly controversial and oppressive New York gun control law known as the S.A.F.E. Act, which does many of the things that she so ardently desires to do? Good question… 
The Washington Free Beacon reported: 
Top Clinton campaign staffers worried about embracing the 2013 New York gun control law known as the SAFE Act during a speech at a leading gun control group’s awards dinner, and ultimately decided to avoid praising some of the law’s more controversial provisions, hacked emails published on Wednesday show. 
While reviewing the speech Hillary Clinton was slated to give at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence’s 2015 Bear Awards, a number of top Clinton staffers discussed how to praise Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s work on gun control without embracing the SAFE Act. 
The leaked emails show top Hillary aide Huma Abedin express a desire to fully endorse the NY law, which effectively bans any and all AR and AK style sporting rifles, and limited magazine capacity to 10 rounds (originally it was 7, despite rather few firearms that use a 7 round magazine, but that was struck down as federal court). 
Despite Huma’s advice that Hillary endorse the law, Corey Ciorciari, a Clinton researcher advised against it. 
“Don’t see a need to fully embrace the SAFE Act,” he said. “There are some controversial items in there. We can highlight pieces that fit within our agenda.” 
… 
Ciorciari drafted a line that would highlight the parts of the SAFE Act the campaign liked while ignoring the rest. 
“I’m working with Megan to incorporate something like this: ‘After the tragedy of Sandy Hook, when Congress failed to heed the call of the American people to take action, you led the fight in New York and expanded life saving background checks,’ he said. 
Carrk, the campaign’s research director, agreed with Ciorciari. “SAFE is not a safe bet,” he replied. 
So the SAFE Act is “not a safe bet,” ehh? What exactly does that mean? 
If anything, it shows that the Hillary Clinton campaign knows that gun control is not a winning issue; it’s not a primary platform upon which the Democrats can win. 
Especially when it comes to things like banning the most commonly owned sporting rifle in the country, that’s something that is literally toxic for almost any candidate running for office right now, with a few exceptions in certain very Leftist districts. 
Nonetheless, Hillary has touted some very dangerous ideas about new laws that would severely infringe on our right to bear arms; ideas like universal background checks (code words for gun owner registry), placing liability for gun-related deaths on firearms manufacturers, closing the gun show and online “loopholes” (which don’t exist!), etc. Essentially, she’s advocating for things that will not solve crime, but will merely make criminals out of possibly a hundred million or more Americans. 
But of course, she can’t say that. She can’t say that she wants to ban your sporting rifle, force you to register it if it’s grandfathered, then prohibit transferring, thus creating de facto confiscation through the passing of a generation. 
She knows that saying that, or even saying anything close to that, would be immediately pounced upon by the NRA, National Association for Gun Rights, Gun Owners of America, and countless other national and state-level organizations that fight to protect our rights. So she uses vague language and capitalizes on emotionally charged terms to get support for an extremist agenda. 
Still, don’t be fooled. Though she did not explicitly endorse NY SAFE Act-style gun laws, she does support them, and you and I both know it. 
As is often attributed to Thomas Jefferson, “Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”",0
18302,Tom deLonge: Changing the cynical views of youth towards government,"link IMO, here is what is happening. you guys are jumping to conclusions by not having any context and taking this at face value. I've been into this a very long time, and with that perspective I see some repeating patterns. To the point of the op, this is the same old same old--with a new generation of players. We've seen the same exact thing over the last 70 years with people like George Adamski, David Fry, Billy Meier, William Moore, and Steven Greer. It's the same story: A privileged individual is given the keys to open a few doors about what ""really is happening."" Tom DeLonge believes (and that's all it takes) he has been given these keys, and he's running with it, as his handlers knew he would. Tom sees this whole ""Sekret Machines"" schtick as a ""franchise."" That's how he talks about it. when he says ""franchise"" he's talking in George Lucas Star Wars terms with movie tie-ins, merchandise, graphic novels, coffee cups, t-shirts, and back packs. That's his vision for this. He sees opportunity to make this thing BIG. Now, he's been writing to Podesta and who knows who else, but he and we know Podesta has an interest in UFOs. So Podesta is seen by Tom as an ""in"" for what he perceives as the new administration and he is offering himself as a legitimate representative of his generation. His statement to Podesta is one of POSITIONING HIMSELF as a natural go-between for these issues--especially with ""young people."" It has nothing really to do with young people being disenfranchised and cynical and everything to do with Tom DeLonge taking an important position vis-a-vis ""Disclosure."" If DeLonge pulls this off it won't be Stephen Bassett of the Paradigm Research Group or Steven Greer, who ""once had dinner with the head of the CIA"" whose name is forever associated with ""Disclosure."" The name everyone will remember is Tom DeLonge. THAT'S what is happening here. DeLonge is attempting to position himself to take major advantage of what he now thinks is reality, and which also includes a major Star-Wars-sized ""franchise"" that has the potential of turning him from a mere multi-millionaire into something much larger. Of course, he may also be a dupe and or delusional, but he may not know that yet. edit on 10/27/2016 by schuyler because: (no reason given)",0
18303,Hollywood Analyst Warns Studios ’Big-Budget Bombs’ Coming in 2017,"Hollywood studios could be in for another year of “  bombs” and increased volatility around   releases, film industry analyst Doug Creutz warned in a report this week. [As he has been warning for years, the Cowen and Co. media analyst said that film studios’ increasing reliance on tentpoles and superhero movies will contribute to a decline in   box office grosses in 2017, making what once seemed like   bets on   flicks a decidedly riskier enterprise.  According to Deadline, Creutz says the film industry in 2017 will be “at least as difficult” as it was in 2016, when operating profits at the major studios fell 14. 6 percent, even as total box office receipts inched up 2. 2 percent over 2015 numbers. That increase was due largely to inflation and the increasing cost of movie tickets, the analyst warned. And Disney  —   with its stable of established franchise properties like Star Wars and Marvel films  —   reportedly captured the lion’s share of the haul with a staggering 60. 5 percent of the industry’s $4. 18 billion in total operating profits. Creutz noted that nearly   upcoming releases from major studios this year boast budgets north of $100 million, and predicted Fox and Paramount could struggle the most with offerings like War for the Planet of the Apes and Transformers: The Last Knight, respectively. He added that Disney would likely continue its dominance with a new Star Wars film and the Guardians of the Galaxy sequel, while Warner Bros. could see success with Wonder Woman, Justice League and Christopher Nolan’s World War II epic Dunkirk. The Cowen and Co. analyst has expressed skepticism for years about the major studios’ shift toward pursuing similar release strategies, or what he described as putting “more and more eggs in the franchise picture basket. ” “History suggests  —   and we have ample evidence of this in the animation genre  —   that as the number of films in a given genre increases, the average   performance decreases, and that even the   films in a genre are not immune to the phenomenon,” Creutz wrote in a 2015 report, according to the Hollywood Reporter. After a brutal Summer 2016 that saw numerous   bombs like Alice Through the Looking Glass, Ghostbusters,   and The BFG, Creutz warned that the film industry is in “real trouble. ” Making matters worse, receipts from the   100 films at the international box office last year reportedly dipped 1. 7 percent as European territories have become inundated with a glut of blockbuster films. Creutz suggested last year to the New York Post that studios should focus on diversifying their release slates, or else just shut down altogether. “Where did all the romantic comedies go?” he asked.

18305,Video: Journalist Covering Pipeline Protests Shot While Conducting Interview,"Videos Video: Journalist Covering Pipeline Protests Shot While Conducting Interview During an interview, this journalist was shot point-blank by police. Fortunately, the entire ordeal was caught on camera. | November 7, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A member of the Stutsman County SWAT team who declined to give his name nor to be identifiable by badge stands guard by an armored personnel carrier while deployed to watch protesters demonstrating against the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Stand Rock Sioux Reservation, in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016. 
Tensions continue to escalate in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where protesters attempt to peacefully face off against riot police and the National Guard. In addition to being maced and beaten with batons, activists opposing the four-state Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) have been tased and even shot with rubber bullets. 
As the recent incident (below) reveals, violence seems to only be escalating rather than ceasing. Though the UN has called on the U.S. government to halt all construction of the pipeline , its development continues. Desperate and on edge, activists at Standing Rock continue to put their lives on the line, unaware of what will come next – prepared to expect anything. Unfortunately, what recently occurred is a reminder of the danger people protesting corporate greed face. I was shot by militarized police WHILE interviewing a man on camera at #StandingRock …and here's the footage. #NoDAPL https://t.co/FfWiSCbiKf pic.twitter.com/4DRwNPkfZ9

During an interview with Cantapeta Creek, activist and journalist Erin Schrode was talking when out of nowhere, police shot her with a rubber bullet. She can be heard screaming, “Ow!” before crumbling to the ground. 
In the Facebook post , Schrode wrote that while “militarized police” shot her at “point-blank range”, she was physically unhurt but shaken from the attack. In an interview with Fusion , she later relayed that she couldn’t fully comprehend what had happened but just remembered being in “excruciating pain.” 
She said: “I couldn’t fathom that I’d just been hit. Why would they target me? Why would they shoot anyone? There was absolutely nothing violent, aggressive, provocative going on at the protests yesterday.” 
The day after the activist realized she’d caught the entire incident on camera, she quickly uploaded it to social media to share with the world. 
What’s happening in Standing Rock doesn’t just pertain to the indigenous in the area, it affects present and future generations. In addition to trying to protect the Missouri river, activists supporting the Standing Rock Sioux tribe are hoping to preserve sacred burial ground and send a message about the need to respect Native American treaties. Commenting on the scene at Standing Rock, Schrode says: “I can’t believe what is happening here in Standing Rock. It’s a scene like I’ve never seen anywhere else in the world, and it’s right here at home.” 
You can bet that this activist isn’t leaving Standing Rock until justice is served. She’ll remain – like the majority of people who have set up camp on the edge of the reservation – until the pipeline is halted or all are physically forced off the land. If the latter occurs, expect deafening outcry from activists around the world. These men shot me at #StandingRock today. I pray for them– and for our peaceful, prayerful water protectors. #NoDAPL https://t.co/hUXigAF6u4 pic.twitter.com/5HI14dTEO8

18306,"MAINE GOVERNOR joins Kansas, Texas, and New Jersey in withdrawing from the federal (Muslim) refugee resettlement program","MAINE GOVERNOR joins Kansas, Texas, and New Jersey in withdrawing from the federal (Muslim) refugee resettlement program Gov. Paul LePage is withdrawing the state of Maine from the federal refugee settlement program, citing a loss of confidence in its ability to safely and responsibly run the program. Maine has become one of the Obama Regime’s favorite dumping grounds for unskilled, illiterate, welfare-dependant large Somali Muslim families. Obama doesn’t need a religious test for refugees because most of them are Muslims WCSH6 (h/t kafir) In a letter Friday, Gov. LePage informed President Obama and notified the director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) that Maine would no longer be participating in the program. “The federal government has proven to be an unwilling partner with states in ensuring that refugee settlement does not unduly put American lives at risk,” LePage wrote. Maine joins Kansas, New Jersey and Texas in severing ties with the ORR. In the letter, LePage included the case of refugee Adnan Fazeli of Freeport, who was revealed in August through an FBI investigation to have died last year while fighting for the Islamic State. “I sincerely hope that the federal government will re-evaluate its current refugee policy — both the quantity and nation of origin of refugees it resettles and the vetting process they are subjected in — in order to best protect the safety and interests of the American people,” LePage wrote. The typical size of Somali Muslim refugee families places an unfair burden on hardworking American taxpayers who must fund welfare for them According to LePage’s office, the governor has directed the state Health and Human Services Department (DHHS) to work with federal counterparts to implement a transition out of the ORR program. The ORR was created after the passing of the 1980 Refugee Act, which provided the legal basis. By withdrawing from the federal program, LePage has removed state workers from the integration assistance process but has not stopped refugees from entering or living in Maine.",0
18307,The Colombian Hit Man Who Became a YouTube Star - The New York Times,"Imagine if the former Mafia boss John Gotti, who went to prison for murder and cultivated the public’s fascination with his flamboyant New York lifestyle and menacing charm, had a YouTube channel. Imagine if he used that channel to become a video star by portraying himself as a penitent hit man and regaling viewers with tales of violence while seeking forgiveness for homicides past. For Colombians, the   equivalent of such an unlikely YouTube sensation can be found in John Jairo Velásquez. He is a former enforcer for the Medellín drug cartel who has boasted of committing hundreds of murders on behalf of his boss, Pablo Escobar. Mr. Velásquez spent more than 20 years in prison for plotting the killing of a Colombian presidential candidate in 1989 and goes by the nickname Popeye. Now, Mr. Velásquez, 54, is trying to rebrand himself as a sort of   evangelist in a series of   videos he began posting on YouTube last year.  The underlying message (there were 81 videos as of Sunday) is one of forgiveness. Now, he is known as Popeye Arrepentido, or Remorseful Popeye. “It’s not about monetizing my life story but about telling the stories, the things that happened,” he said in an interview on Sunday. “I’ve been famous for 30 years. I only want to have an opinion because I am an activist. I am against the Venezuelan and Colombian government. I am against Donald Trump because of his hatred of Latinos. I just want my opinion heard. ” His audience cannot seem to stop watching. The videos have gained more than 117, 000 subscribers and 9. 5 million views. The comments are filled with praise and admiration. One person signed off with “Hugs. ” But not all people are enthralled by Mr. Velásquez’s budding stardom  —   least of all the victims touched by the cartel’s acts of mayhem. The son of one victim  —   a man who was among 107 people killed by a bomb planted by the cartel on a plane that exploded over Bogotá, Colombia, in 1989  —   said Mr. Velásquez’s popularity overshadowed the harm he had unleashed, The Guardian reported. The son, Gonzálo Rojas, said that the former hit man had shown no real remorse and that he was trafficking in a perverse sort of celebrity because of his crimes. Most hit men do not turn up on YouTube seeking a second act by spilling secrets about past misdeeds. (Mr. Gotti died in 2002 while serving a life sentence.) But one expert described Mr. Velásquez as “an astute  ” who had capitalized on his infamy by claiming to have been reformed while glorifying  . Mr. Velásquez, however, said he felt reborn after being released  on parole in 2014, according to a description of his YouTube account. “I created this channel with the intention to be able to talk day to day about my process reintegrating into society as well as my process with true remorse,” he wrote. “Being an assassin is not normal,” he said in the interview. Now, he said, he “respects life and society. ” “I was resocialized: When I changed my way of thinking, I changed my way of being,” he added. In one video, he seeks forgiveness from a relative of one of his victims. When a viewer asked, “When can the victims of the drug war of the Medellín cartel meet you  —   the ones who lost brothers or fathers in the police force?” Mr. Velásquez said he found the question painful. But he asserted: “It was the war that killed your brother, but I am not going to justify that. I am going to assume responsibility because your brother was defending a country, an institution, and we were murderers paid by the cartels. ” If Mr. Velásquez, who uploads videos out of his apartment in Medellín, is troubled that his stated contriteness is at odds with the opening graphics of gunfire and bullet holes in his videos, he is not showing it. And he revels in the limelight. Some viewers have responded by welcoming him back to society. “Hello, Popeye,” one wrote. “I love all of your statements because they are full of honesty and courage. Hugs. ” Others celebrate his flair and ability to talk directly to the people: “You have the personality to be able to tell the truth to the Colombian society. ” Vincent T. Gawronski, a professor of political science at   College in Birmingham, Ala. said in an email: “In a twisted way, we celebrate ‘successful’ criminals, even   killers in Hollywood movies, cable television shows and soap operas: ‘Scarface,’ ‘Blow,’ ‘Breaking Bad,’ ‘The Sopranos,’ Netflix’s ‘Narcos. ’” Dr. Gawronski noted that nearly a dozen “narconovelas” had aired on   television and that there were many “narcocorridos,” or ballads, celebrating drug traffickers. “We mythologize those that challenge authority and do whatever they want and get away with it,” he said. He added: “Of course, Velásquez’s fame is directly tied to his relationship with Pablo Escobar. The stories he can tell will keep him popular, but they might also get him killed. ” In an interview published in The Telegraph in 2014, Mr. Velásquez, who said he had a wife and son living in the United States, declared that he could take care of himself if anyone came after him. In a video, Mr. Velásquez recalled where he was in 1993 when the authorities killed Mr. Escobar, the ruthless cocaine trafficker who ran the Medellín cartel. When one viewer wanted to know what Mr. Escobar had written in his notepads, Mr. Velásquez said: “Those notepads were simply to write the names of the people who he wanted to kill. If he wrote your name in those notepads, you were a dead man. ” If the mobsters from Mr. Gotti’s day had a strict code of silence about criminal activity, Mr. Velásquez seems unconcerned about revealing the inner workings of the cartel. In a video posted in October, he said he would always be an assassin. He boasted about his reputation on the streets, calling himself the living memory of the cartel. He said he would never speak ill of Mr. Escobar. “For me, Escobar was a terrorist, a drug dealer, a kidnapper  —   but he was also my friend he treated me with kindness and respect,” he said. “He was the kind of man that would look you in the eyes and do what he says. Everyone knows what he was, but with me he was good. ” “I loved Pablo,” he said. “He never owed me money for any of my hits. ”",0
18308,Forget Too Much TV. It’s Too Big TV We Should Worry About. - The New York Times,"It may have been “Tiny House Nation” that finally broke me. Last month this offbeat real estate show on the FYI network began its third season of cramming homeowners into trailers, bungalows and other mini abodes. The homes are little. The season premiere was not. The running time was nearly 65 minutes uninterrupted  —   a full hour and a half with ads. There’s been a lot of talk in the business about “Too Much TV”  —   the surfeit of hundreds of original scripted series every year. But there’s a corollary issue:   TV. Even as viewers’ time becomes more precious, individual episodes are bloating. Television has come down with a case of gigantism. HBO’s   drama, “Vinyl,” began with a   pilot, directed by Martin Scorsese, that vamped on like the coda to “Freebird. ” The series premiere of FX’s drama “Fargo” ran around 97 minutes with ads. “Fargo,” the Coen brothers movie it was based on, ran 98. Episodes of Netflix’s romantic comedy “Love” ambled up to 40 minutes. As a critic, I’m used to championing greater options for artists. We’re lucky to live in a time when TV creators have freedom from arbitrary constraints. But more and more of my TV watching these days involves starting an episode, looking at the number of minutes on the playback bar and silently cursing. Historically, network television was like a container ship the product had to fit standard boxes for ease of shipping. Networks needed predictable schedules and had to turn over specific time slots to affiliates. It was a process  —     episodes were a presence in the early days of television  —   but 30 minutes generally came to mean comedy, and 60, drama. Episodes used to be longer, in that commercial breaks were shorter, but the journey from beginning to end stayed the same. And networks occasionally tinkered with length. NBC supersized its popular Thursday night sitcoms in the early aughts Fox inflated “American Idol” like a Macy’s parade balloon. But those stunts were exceptions. Today’s great fattening, like so many trends in TV now, is in part the influence of streaming TV. The only thing limiting the length of a Netflix or Amazon binge show is your ability to sit without cramping. The menu is bigger, and so are the portions. Meanwhile, basic cable channels realized that there was no reason their “hourlong” series needed to end on the hour. If they pushed a 10 p. m. drama’s end to, say, 11:17, they could give their creators the kind of narrative real estate available on   HBO and Showtime. The most dramatic early claimer of elbow room was FX’s   drama, “Sons of Anarchy,” which piled on plot and ended its   episodes with music montages. Now it’s common for cable hits to plump up. The most recent season finale of “The Walking Dead” ran 90 minutes, though I have rarely seen an episode of “The Walking Dead” that needed its full 60. Like its zombies, it could be hacked down by a third and shamble along just as well. At best, extended episodes can make room for complexity. But focus and showmanship still matter. In a   era, being able to hook an audience is more important, not less. The best examples of Big TV make the most of each moment, instead of padding them out. Take Louis C. K. ’s   barroom drama “Horace and Pete,” whose first episode ran almost 68 minutes and played like live theater. Its third episode  —   essentially a long dramatic monologue about infidelity by Laurie Metcalf  —   is 43 minutes of regret and catharsis, the camera holding tight to Ms. Metcalf’s face. I did not look at my watch once. Louis C. K. may have earned the right to go long by proving he could also go short his FX comedy, “Louie,” included stories that would run only a few minutes if that was all they needed. AMC’s “Better Call Saul,” a more conventional drama, regularly overstays its   slot by a few minutes. But it uses its time mindfully, to suspend tension and let character moments play out. There’s a certain       aspect to longer episodes, even with great shows. When the sixth season of the sitcom “Community” moved to Yahoo from NBC, it was finally free of   constraints  —   and something was off. The pacing was sluggish the jokes were less crystalline. Maybe “Community”  —   a product of the fractious   compromise between art and business  —   needed limits in order to transcend them. Those time constraints and network scissors, much as writers love to bash them, can be the Marie Kondo method of comedy. The first season of Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” was originally made for NBC, and like its spiritual forebear “30 Rock,” it was packed like a diamond. The second season, made for streaming, is still funny, but you can feel the drag in some of its    episodes. TV was raised with rules, the product of technology and business models that had little to do with art. It’s shedding those strictures as it grows up, which is good  —   that’s given us anarchic comedies like “Broad City” and    dramas like “Rectify. ” But freedom also proves the values of the discipline you learn under restrictions. I appreciate ambitious storytelling. But I also appreciate getting a full night’s sleep.",0
18309,China’s Vaccine Scandal Threatens Public Faith in Immunizations - The New York Times,"HEZE, China  —   First the news rippled across China that millions of compromised vaccines had been given to children around the country. Then came grim rumors and angry complaints from parents that the government had kept them in the dark about the risks since last year. Now, the country’s immunization program faces a backlash of public distrust that critics say has been magnified by the government’s ingrained secrecy. Song Zhendong, like many parents here, said he was reluctant to risk further vaccinations for his    son. “If he can avoid them in the future, we will not get them,” said Mr. Song, a businessman. “Why didn’t we learn about this sooner? If there’s a problem with vaccines for our kids, we should be told as soon as the police knew. Aren’t our children the future of the nation?” The faulty vaccines have become the latest lightning rod for widespread, often visceral distrust of China’s medical system, and a rebuff to what many Chinese critics see as President Xi Jinping’s bulldozing,   rule. The scandal is just the latest crisis to shake public faith in China’s food and medicine supplies, but it is the first big scare under Mr. Xi, who had vowed to be different. He came into office promising to “make protecting the people’s right to health a priority. ” “If our party can’t even handle food safety properly while governing China, and this keeps up, some will wonder whether we’re up to the job,” Mr. Xi said in 2013, the year he became president. The anger here in Heze, the city in the eastern province of Shandong where the scandal has its roots, is evident. About two million improperly stored vaccines were sold around the country from an overheated, dilapidated storeroom. The main suspect in the case is a hospital pharmacist from Heze who had been convicted of trading in illegal vaccines in 2009 and was doing it again two years later. Many parents said they were especially alarmed that nearly a year had elapsed from the time the police uncovered the illicit trade and the time the public first learned about it in February. “Withholding information doesn’t maintain public credibility,” said Li Shuqing, a lawyer in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, who is one of about 90 attorneys who have volunteered to represent possible victims in the case. “In the end, it makes people more distrustful. ” To many here, the combination of lax regulation and the secrecy surrounding a potential public health crisis seems like déjà vu. In the SARS crisis of 2003, 349 people died across mainland China and hundreds more died elsewhere after officials hid the extent of its spread. In a scandal that came to light in 2008, at least six children died and 300, 000 fell ill with kidney stones and other problems from infant formula adulterated with melamine, an industrial chemical. “The customers worry about fake milk powder, fake medicine, fake vaccines, fake everything,” said Ma Guohui, the owner of a shop on the rural fringe of Heze that sells baby products. “This is certainly going to affect people’s thinking. My boy got all his vaccination shots. If he were born now, I’d worry. ” Despite such fears, the tainted vaccines are more likely to be ineffective than harmful. The World Health Organization has said that outdated or poorly stored vaccines rarely if ever trigger illness or toxic reactions. Chinese government investigators said last week that they had not found any cases of adverse reactions or spikes in infections linked to ineffective vaccines. The greater danger may be more insidious. The erosion of public trust could damage China’s immunization program, which has been credited with significant declines in measles and other communicable diseases. “Confidence is easy to shake, and that’s happened across the world and has happened here,” said Lance Rodewald, a doctor with the World Health Organization’s immunization program in Beijing. “We hear through social media that parents are worried, and we know that when they’re worried, there’s a very good chance that they may think it’s safer not to vaccinate than to vaccinate. That’s when trouble can start. ” After unfounded reports of deaths caused by a hepatitis B vaccine in 2013, such vaccinations across 10 provinces fell by 30 percent in the days afterward, and the administration of other mandatory vaccines fell by 15 percent, according to Chinese health officials. The illicit vaccines in the current case were not part of China’s compulsory,   vaccination program, which inoculates children against illnesses such as polio and measles at no charge. The illegal trade dealt in     vaccines  —   including those for rabies, influenza and hepatitis B  —   which patients pay for from their own pockets. The pharmacist named in the investigation, Pang Hongwei, bought cheap vaccines from drug companies and traders  —   apparently batches close to their expiration dates  —   and sold them in 23 provinces and cities, according to drug safety investigators. She began the business in 2011, just two years after she had been convicted on charges of illegally trading in vaccines and sentenced to three years in prison, which was reduced to five years’ probation. Officials have not explained how she was able to avoid prison and resume her business. Ms. Pang, in her late 40s, and her daughter, who has been identified only by her surname, Sun, kept the vaccines in a rented storeroom of a disused factory in Jinan. The storeroom lacked refrigeration, which may have damaged the vaccines’ potency. The police have detained them but not announced specific charges, and neither suspect has had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations. Lax regulation in the   commercial system allowed Ms. Pang’s business to grow, several medical experts said. Local government medical agencies and clinics were able to increase their profits by turning to cheap, illegal suppliers, People’s Daily, the official party paper, reported on Tuesday. Police investigators discovered Ms. Pang’s storehouse last April, but word did not get out to the public until a Shandong news website reported on the case in February of this year. Most Chinese had still heard nothing about it until another website, The Paper, published a report that drew national attention a month later. It was the government’s intolerance of public criticism, critics said, that kept the scandal under wraps, a delay that now makes it harder to track those who received the suspect injections. “We’ve seen with these problem vaccines that without the right to know, without press freedom, the public’s right to health can’t be assured,” said Wang Shengsheng, one of the lawyers pressing the government for more answers and redress over the case. In the last few weeks, official reticence has been supplanted by daily announcements of arrests, checks and assurances as the central government has scrambled to dampen public anger and alarm. Premier Li Keqiang ordered central ministries and agencies in March to investigate what had gone wrong. Last week, the investigators reported that 202 people had been detained over the scandal, and 357 officials dismissed, demoted or otherwise punished. Health and drug officials promised to tighten vaccine purchase rules to stamp out    trade. “How could this trafficking in vaccines outside the rules spread to so many places and go on for so long?” Mr. Li said, according to an official account. Without decisive action, he said, “ordinary people will vote with their feet and go and buy the products they trust. ” Mr. Xi has so far not publicly commented on the scandal. Dr. Rodewald, the World Health Organization expert, said the proposed changes were promising and would mean clinics would not have to rely on selling   vaccines for their upkeep. Xu Huijin, a doctor in Heze, said that the concern over the scandal  —   and unfounded rumors of deaths  —   had depressed the number of parents bringing children to her clinic for inoculations. “This was badly handled,” she said. “There was a lack of coordination, not enough information. We should have found out about this long ago. Doctors are taught to tell patients the full facts. ”",0
18310,Christians Celebrate Palm Sunday - Breitbart,"Christians worldwide celebrate Palm Sunday, commemorating the Triumphal Entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem at the beginning of Holy Week, a week that would end with his death on Good Friday, then followed by Easter Sunday. [For followers of Jesus, this week marks the culmination of a lifetime of sinless obedience to God, and the final five days of a teaching ministry that even the billions who do not claim the name of Christ must readily acknowledge changed the world forever.  But what does the Bible say happened as these final events of Jesus’ life began to unfold? The Old Testament Zechariah had prophesied that Israel’s great king, the messiah, would come mounted “on a colt, the foal of a donkey. ” From the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament: And when he [Jesus] had said these things, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples, saying, “Go into the village in front of you, where on entering you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it. ’” So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them. And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” And they said, “The Lord has need of it. ” And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. And as he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. As he was drawing near —  already on the way down the Mount of Olives —  the whole multitude of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen, saying “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!” And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples. ” He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones would cry out. ”  —  Luke 19:28 —  40 (ESV).

18311,The What-Ifs: 11 Debate Possibilities That Should Worry the Campaigns - The New York Times,"Hillary Clinton will be there. Donald J. Trump, too. Pleasantries will probably be exchanged. And after that, the road map for the first presidential debate is anyone’s guess. What are some of the most consequential “ ” ahead of Monday night’s showdown  —   the possibilities that make the campaigns sweat? Or should: He is off to a head start: Mr. Trump already threatened to invite Gennifer Flowers, who claimed to have had a   affair with Bill Clinton, as his debate guest. (Mr. Trump’s campaign later said that Ms. Flowers would not be there.) Still, a decision to confront Mrs. Clinton from the stage about her husband’s misdeeds would raise the stakes considerably. Mr. Trump plainly sees a benefit in reminding voters of past Clinton scandals they may have forgotten. But the risks are substantial: The move could make Mrs. Clinton appear more sympathetic and repel female voters already uneasy with Mr. Trump. Then there is Mr. Trump’s marital history to consider. No one likes a   . But voters, presumably, want their president to know at least a few things. Among some Republicans who hoped to stop Mr. Trump in the primaries  —   and who remain convinced that he could not survive a   civics class  —   a great regret persists: No one ever tried to insult his intelligence by stumping him with an easy question. What is the Common Core, which he claims to despise? Who is the prime minister of Canada? How does a bill become a law? Does Mr. Trump know the answers? It may not matter to some of his supporters, but an “oops” moment (looking at you, Rick Perry) could be the stuff of millions of cable news and YouTube replays. It can seem as though Mr. Trump loves no sound more than the swaggering Queens timbre of his own voice. But for a candidate not known for his policy depth, a    format poses a unique challenge. In the Republican primary debates, he often disappeared for extended stretches, letting his many rivals skirmish over assorted campaign proposals, before lumbering in with a memorably evocative quip about, say, the size of his genitals. This time, it is 90   minutes with Mrs. Clinton. That is a lot of airtime. Perhaps the greatest fear in the Clinton camp centers on the choices of Lester Holt, the debate moderator. Specifically, will Mr. Holt see fit to interject when the candidates shade the truth? Though Mrs. Clinton’s reputation for candor is checkered, her team hopes the debate might lay bare Mr. Trump’s prolific assemblage of falsehoods. Some signature untruths, like Mr. Trump’s insistence that he opposed the Iraq war from the beginning, have often been allowed to go unchallenged, including at a recent NBC candidate forum. Mrs. Clinton’s team has urged Mr. Holt to set a different tone. Mr. Trump fashions himself a master negotiator. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton will make him an offer he would have trouble refusing on live television. As the Clinton camp continues to press Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, she might be tempted to make a deal, or at least float one. She could offer to do his taxes for him next year. Or she could volunteer a charitable contribution, as Mr. Trump did while promoting the false “birther” movement questioning President Obama’s birthplace. Speaking of which  …     After five years as principal spokesman for the idea that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, Mr. Trump acknowledged this month that the president was born here. Also, Mr. Trump said, he would rather not talk about it anymore. But Mrs. Clinton would. So far, Mr. Trump has strained to identify a coherent reason for his change of heart. One of the most significant debate moments may arrive when Mr. Trump is compelled to provide one, before the watchful eyes of the many Obama supporters still wary of Mrs. Clinton. The sightings are rare, like an endangered animal wandering through Manhattan. But those close to Mrs. Clinton have long contended that she can be quite funny. In an election often defined by showmanship and confrontation, a   zinger might prove powerful, particularly from such an unexpected source. Even after dozens of debates in two presidential campaigns, the most memorable moment for Mrs. Clinton still may be when Representative Rick A. Lazio walked, with a finger pointed, into her personal space during the 2000 Senate race to demand she sign a pledge forsaking outside money. Female voters recoiled at his behavior, and Mrs. Clinton’s supporters are quietly hopeful that Mr. Trump may seek to prove his alpha status with a similar intimidation tactic. Can Mr. Trump  —   a man who recently insisted on divulging his testosterone levels, despite releasing scant medical records  —   resist the urge? Mr. Trump, well practiced at innuendo and ominous warnings, has often compelled reporters to ask questions they never thought would be necessary. Questions like: Did he just encourage violence against his opponent? (And, if not, what did he imply about the “Second Amendment people” who might take matters into their own hands if Mrs. Clinton is elected?) It is not clear if Mr. Trump views this tic as a shortcoming or as a strength of his oratory. But if Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Holt can challenge him in real time over such a flourish, Mr. Trump might be placed on the defensive, without a spokesman on hand to walk back his comments immediately after the fact. It might not prove anything. It might not be fair. But after decades of   conspiracy theories and Mrs. Clinton’s recent bout with pneumonia, supporters worry that a simple coughing fit  —   hardly implausible during a lengthy, uninterrupted gabfest  —   could feed perceptions about her fitness to serve. It would be especially damaging given how many voters have seen the video of her wilting this month while leaving a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony. Well before that, Mrs. Clinton had occasionally gone hoarse on the campaign trail, or slogged through a flurry of hacks at the microphone. Monday would be a poor time for a relapse. Mr. Trump has admired his leadership. He has cited his poll numbers in Russia. Mr. Trump has even played down the killing of dissident journalists, on the grounds that “our country does plenty of killing, too. ” The Republican nominee has had many nice things to say about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. And there is little that Mrs. Clinton would like more than to make Mr. Trump repeat them.",0
18312,Caitlyn Jenner to Attend Trump Inauguration - Breitbart,"Caitlyn Jenner soon takes part in another transition. [According to Us Weekly, the former Olympian has received and accepted an invitation to attend the inauguration of   Donald Trump:  Caitlyn Jenner accepts invitation to attend Donald Trump’s inauguration: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Us Weekly (@usweekly) January 11, 2017,  Jenner has fought back against charges from the Left that a Trump presidency would create negative effects on women and the LGBT community. Instead, Jenner argued that Trump stands “very much for women” in addition to remaining open on some LGBT issues. Jenner, a staunch Republican, gave some idea of what frames her political views in an interview with Bill Simmons in August. “I believe in the simple things,” Jenner explained. “I believe in our Constitution. I think the Republican side, although I’ve been very disappointed with them over the last 10 to 20 years, has a better opportunity to bring this country back to, really, as close as you can to what it was.  …     I have kind of positioned myself with the Republican Party to try to help these people understand, [to help] the Republican Party understand what the issues are for the LBGT community. ” The E! Channel canceled Jenner’s show I Am Cait in August, the same month in which she told Bill Simmons about her love of the Constitution and the Republican Party. Surely nothing more than a coincidence there. After supporting Trump and attending his inauguration, Jenner’s chances of scoring another   show rank only slightly higher than her chances of landing on another Wheaties box.

18313,A Debate: Should the Justice Department Police the Police? - The New York Times,"Blue lives matter. That is, in essence, what Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been saying since he took office, promising to protect the lives of police officers, stop undermining them as (he implied) the Obama administration had, and let them get back to enforcing law and order. For some in law enforcement, the message has done what it intended to do: mollify, soothe, inspire. With vilification on the street, who needed vilification from the top? But to others, it is as shrill and jarring as a traffic whistle, threatening to undo years of work toward dismantling policies that led to mass incarceration and the erosion of trust in the police. We asked two experts to weigh in. In the first camp is Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County, outside Detroit, who explains the perspective of   officers facing hostility and scrutiny by cellphone cameras as they perform a dangerous job. On the other side is Ronal W. Serpas, former chief in Nashville and New Orleans, who counters that not just civilians, but officers themselves, are safer when policing is done more fairly  —   sometimes at the insistence of the federal government. Sheriff Bouchard answered questions by phone, and Dr. Serpas by email. Their responses were edited for clarity and length. Michael Bouchard: I think that police agencies are expecting and capable of handling scrutiny. But I think that the tone and the rhetoric did in fact diminish it. It almost  —   in many situations  —   came from a “You’re broken,” adversarial position rather than “You’re a professional, occasionally you’re going to have situations that need rectifying and we want to work together to make sure that happens. ” It’s a very different kind of vantage. I think every police executive that’s worth their salt  —   and I believe that’s 99. 9 percent  —   believe that if police do something wrong they ought to be held accountable. Ronal Serpas: To the contrary, the Department of Justice must ensure that the federal Constitution is followed so that all citizens experience constitutional policing as a right. There are about 18, 000 police departments in America. Few police agencies have been part of a D. O. J. review since 1994, and even fewer have been party to a consent decree. In those departments, the data suggested it was indeed necessary. What really makes the job of American policing more difficult is when we fail to realize the police are just one part of an interconnected system of criminal justice (police, prosecution, judiciary, corrections, mental health, drug addiction, etc. Sheriff Bouchard: I think there’s a great deal of officers on the front line that are much more cautious about doing the job in a proactive way, for fear of negative exposure. I mean, what you want is proactive policing to question situations, to stop cars, to look for something that is on the precipice of being a crime and interrupt it before it happens. When you put a chilling effect on that kind of patrol, you basically become report takers. It’s the job of the chief to tell their folks, “Look, if you do your job as you’re trained and as I expect, I will stand behind you. ” And that’s a difficult thing for a lot of people to feel and understand in this environment  —   that they would be stood behind. Because use of force captured on a cellphone is not pretty. A street fight is not pretty. That does not make it inappropriate or illegal. Dr. Serpas: Yes and no. In the case of the Baltimore Police Department it’s been my personal experience, from interviewing nearly 100 officers, that the department has not “pulled back. ” In fact, to a person, every officer was clear  —   they see their job to save lives and make the community safe. “We did not take a knee” was a constant refrain. In Chicago, the data appears to be the opposite, in that officers have been far less proactive  —   and that has been a recent development. What the data in Chicago suggests is that there was a sudden and dramatic change in officer activity immediately following the public release of information regarding the tragic death of Laquan McDonald. We will likely need more time and information to understand the factors driving this  . Sheriff Bouchard: One of our concerns about the dialogue from the past administration about we need to be more involved with the community is the presumption that we weren’t already or didn’t care about it. I have a list of community engagement programs that are as long as my arm. But some of the engagement also goes back to funding. So for example, in one of the communities where we are policing, at one time they had 200   officers. Now we police that community with about 77. And so at the same time the past administration said, “You need to do more of that,” pointing their finger, they didn’t give me any grants when I applied for that community to do that. Dr. Serpas: There is no such thing as too much emphasis on community relations and partnerships. Crime reduction necessarily comes from the relationships the police have with the community. Despite the great advances in technology like DNA or ballistics evidence, our criminal justice system must have willing community members who will participate in criminal investigations and prosecutions. Every officer and prosecutor knows this. Sheriff Bouchard: Civil rights investigations are routinely undertaken by the Department of Justice, and we’re not suggesting that they stop, but the   approach that “virtually every department is broken” has been a frustrating dialogue. Clearly there’s some videos that we’ve all seen that are obviously out of bounds. But there are some videos that don’t lend themselves to context or totality of circumstance. So rushing to a decision based on that often incites problems, and not calms tensions. So the first thing ought to be a calming moment, saying: “Look, we don’t know all the facts and circumstances. We’re going to find out. And if there was wrongdoing, people will be held accountable. ” Dr. Serpas: Each of us demands that if a friend or family member encounters a police officer they will be treated fairly and with dignity. If not, then we expect the local police or political leaders to rectify the situation. But we all know this may not be the case in every local government. It is our federal Constitution that establishes what the requirements of policing are in this nation.",0

18315,Hitler’s ’Mein Kampf’ Becomes German Bestseller: Publisher,"BERLIN (AFP)  —    The first reprint of Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” in Germany since World War II has proved a surprise bestseller, heading for its sixth print run, its publisher said Tuesday. [The Institute of Contemporary History of Munich (IfZ) said around 85, 000 copies of the new annotated version of the Nazi leader’s   manifesto had flown off the shelves since its release last January.  It had initially planned to print only 4, 000 copies but boosted production immediately based on intense demand. The sixth print run will hit bookstores in late January. The   work had figured on the   bestseller list in weekly magazine Der Spiegel over much of the last year, and even topped the list for two weeks in April. The institute also organised a successful series of presentations and debates around “Mein Kampf” across Germany and in other European cities, which it said allowed it to measure the impact of the new edition. “It turned out that the fear the publication would promote Hitler’s ideology or even make it socially acceptable and give   a new propaganda platform was totally unfounded,” IfZ director Andreas Wirsching said in a statement. “To the contrary, the debate about Hitler’s worldview and his approach to propaganda offered a chance to look at the causes and consequences of totalitarian ideologies, at a time in which authoritarian political views and rightwing slogans are gaining ground. ”  —   ‘Not reactionaries or radicals’  —   The institute said the data collected about buyers by regional bookstores showed that they tended to be “customers interested in politics and history as well as educators” and not “reactionaries or rightwing radicals”. Nevertheless, the IfZ said it would maintain a restrictive policy on international rights. For now, only English and French editions are planned despite strong interest from many countries. The institute released the annotated version of “Mein Kampf” last January, just days after the copyright of the manifesto expired. Bavaria was handed the rights to the book in 1945 when the Allies gave it control of the main Nazi publishing house following Hitler’s defeat. For 70 years, it refused to allow the inflammatory tract to be republished out of respect for victims of the Nazis and to prevent incitement of hatred. But “Mein Kampf”  —   which means “My Struggle”  —   fell into the public domain on January 1 and the institute said it feared a version without critical commentary could hit the market. Partly autobiographical, “Mein Kampf” outlines Hitler’s ideology that formed the basis for Nazism. He wrote it in 1924 while he was imprisoned in Bavaria for treason after his failed Beer Hall Putsch. The book set out two ideas that he put into practice as Germany’s leader going into World War II: annexing neighbouring countries to gain “Lebensraum” or “living space” for Germans, and his hatred of Jews, which led to the Holocaust. Some 12. 4 million copies were published in Germany and from 1936, the Nazi state gave a copy to all newlyweds as a wedding gift.",0
18316,Three Illegal Aliens Arrested for Allegedly Kidnapping Texas Attorney,"Authorities arrested three illegal aliens for allegedly breaking into an attorney’s home and kidnapping him in the middle of the night. [Detectives from the Orange County Sherriff’s Office Criminal Division located German Adalid   19, Henrry Eduar   17, and Erik   17, in Port Arthur on Friday, 12 News reported.  Two of the three suspects allegedly broke into the home of Orange County attorney Jim Sharon Bearden Jr. on May 8 wearing masks and tied him up as they stole   items  —   guns and electronics  —   from his home. The third suspect, who acted as the driver, waited outside and served as a lookout. The three suspects then purportedly drove Bearden Jr. to a bank where they forced him to withdraw cash at which time they let him and his vehicle go. “The three were arrested for burglary of a habitation, a 1st degree felony and taken to the Jefferson County jail,” 12 News reported. All three suspects are reportedly illegal aliens from Honduras. Captain Cliff Hargrave said that the three illegal aliens supposedly confessed to the crime. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) immediately placed detainer requests on all three illegal aliens.

18317,Debbie Wasserman Schultz: Federal Government May Ban Passengers from Checking Guns in Baggage,"In the wake of the January 6 shooting in the Ft.   International Airport   zone, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (  ) makes clear that the federal government may no longer allow passengers to check a gun in their baggage. [According to NBC 6, Wasserman Schultz indicated that she wants to see the federal government do something. She said, “We certainly need to revisit and review whether or not you should be allowed to check firearms in your checked baggage and travel with them. ”  She also floated the option of creating a secure area where people who check guns have to go to pick up their firearm. And her third option was a ban on checking ammunition. Lost on Wasserman Schultz is the fact that Florida is one of only six states where it is illegal for concealed carry permit holders to carry a gun in unsecured areas for  . So large groups of unarmed innocents stand together in areas of the airport that lack security it is a mass public attacker’s dream come true. Banning guns in checked baggage would do nothing to stop further attacks, as a criminal or terrorist with a gun can walk into the unsecured areas from the pickup curb and kill easily. The solution here is clear: eradicate the law that mandates that concealed carry permit holders be disarmed in baggage claim areas. This is a   action, rather than a federal one, and Representative Jake Raburn ( ) has already introduced legislation to repeal the   requirements. Under Raburn’s plan, criminals and terrorists will have to deal with the fact that   citizens can shoot back.

18321,Hillary Clinton Denounces Donald Trump as Untrustworthy on Women’s Issues - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Hillary Clinton assailed Donald J. Trump on Friday as untrustworthy on women’s issues, sharpening her tone against him in her first major speech since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Finally free to focus on the general election, Mrs. Clinton signaled that she planned to hit her likely Republican opponent in an area of perceived weakness while working to mend fissures within her own party by focusing on issues dear to progressives, such as protecting abortion rights and funding for Planned Parenthood. “When Donald Trump says, ‘Let’s make America great again,’ that is code for let’s take America backward,” Mrs. Clinton said at a Planned Parenthood Action Fund event in Washington. In a   speech, Mrs. Clinton seized on Mr. Trump’s suggestion in March that abortion be banned and that women who violate such a ban face punishment. Although he later retracted the remark amid a bipartisan backlash, Mrs. Clinton made clear that she would not let it go. “Anyone who would so casually agree with the idea of punishing women, like it was nothing to him, the most obvious thing in the world, that’s someone who doesn’t hold women in high regard,” Mrs. Clinton said to loud applause. Mrs. Clinton said that protecting Planned Parenthood’s funding was a top priority amid an onslaught from Republicans who have threatened to shut down the government over its opposition to the organization. She also called for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of government money for abortions. Mrs. Clinton has struggled at times this year to appeal to younger women, but she does not expect that to be a problem against Mr. Trump. Her campaign plans to regularly remind female voters about his penchant for making sexist remarks, such as referring to women as “fat pigs” and “dogs. ” On Friday she quoted Mr. Trump as saying that he thought   leave made the country less competitive and that women should work harder if they wanted to earn more. Mr. Trump has said that he will be better for women than Mrs. Clinton, but polls show that so far he is turning them off in a big way. A Gallup survey from April found that 70 percent of women in the country had an unfavorable opinion him. By making Planned Parenthood Action her first campaign stop after capturing the nomination, Mrs. Clinton demonstrated that, instead of making a quick pivot to the center, she is intent on rallying the Democratic base after a bruising primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders. Another important step toward party unity came on Thursday night when Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts offered a rousing endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. The two women met privately on Friday morning in Washington to discuss the party’s path forward and how to beat Mr. Trump in November. Ms. Warren is a favorite of the progressive wing of the party and has become one of its most vocal and effective critics of Mr. Trump. She described Mr. Trump as a “racist bully” in a speech on Wednesday night and made a forceful case for Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy. The meeting Friday could also fan speculation that Ms. Warren is on Mrs. Clinton’s shortlist of potential running mates. While she has maintained that she loves her current job, Ms. Warren did say Thursday night on MSNBC that she felt she had the capacity to be president. For now Mrs. Clinton is taking on Mr. Trump on her own, and after a difficult week for him in which he drew widespread condemnation for making racist remarks about a federal judge, she is not holding back. She mocked him for walking back his claim that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel  —   who is presiding over a lawsuit against Trump University  —   was biased because of his Mexican heritage and lamented Mr. Trump’s disparaging treatment of a disabled reporter. Both were examples, she said, of how a Trump presidency would be problematic for more than just women. “Donald Trump would take us in the wrong direction on so many issues that we care about,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He does not see all Americans as Americans. ”",0
18322,Jeff Rovin: Clintons paid me to ‘fix’ their sex scandals,"It’s all old news to those of us who, unlike Democrat LIVs (low information voters), pay attention to the Alternative Media. But it’s still significant because the information made it to Fox News’ Hannity Show . 
His name is Jeff Rovin . 
After decades as one of Bill and Hillary Clintons’ many retainers, Rovin is outing himself as the Clintons’ “ fixer ” — defined by Oxford Dictionaries as “ A person who makes arrangements for other people, especially of an illicit or devious kind. ” In Rovin’s case, he claims to have been employed by the Clintons to suppress and remove from the media any scandalous news of their sexual affairs. Note: For a few of the Clintons’ other retainers, see “ Hillary Clinton’s medical handler, cleaner, & prompter were all at the last presidential debate ”. 
Rovin says he was paid $4,000 a month to keep the Clintons’ open marriage and their respective adulteries from the news. In Hillary’s case, she had “affairs” with Vincent Foster and with a female Hollywood honcho. Note: On July 20, 1993, Foster — who was Bill Clinton’s deputy White House counsel at the time — was found dead on a park bench in D.C.’s Ft. Marcy Park, supposedly from a self-inflicted gun shot. See “ FBI files linking Hillary Clinton to Vince Foster suicide vanished from National Archives “. Note: According to the Clintons’ former assassin Larry Nichols, when she was First Lady, Hillary regularly went to California on weekends to be with Hollywood producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and other women to “worship” Satan at “a church”. See “ Clinton friend and assassin Larry Nichols: Hillary is a satanist ”. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , 69, is a television producer who, with her husband Harry Thomason, is best known for creating, writing, and producing the TV series, Designing Women . The couple are notable for their friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton, which dates back to Bill’s days as governor of Arkansas. The Thomasons created several short-subject political propaganda films for Bill, the most famous of which was The Man from Hope that introduced Bill at the 1992 Democratic Convention. The Thomasons did similar propaganda films for Hillary’s run for the U.S. Senate and for other candidates, such as General Wesley Clark’s presidential bid. Clark has endorsed Hillary for president. (See “ Obama-supporter Gen. Wesley Clarke: Disloyal Americans should be put in concentration camps ”) 
Here’s Rovin on Hannity , on Oct. 24, 2016: 
The National Enquirer first broke Jeff Rovin’s story. Here’s what Rovin told the Enquirer : 
During the 1980s and 1990s, I was working in Hollywood as a reporter for several national magazines and newspapers. Because of my good relationship with stars, publicists and the press I became “a fixer”: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press. I helped keep secrets safe for some of Hollywood’s leading men. 
In 1991, my reputation was such that I was asked to work on behalf of a fast-rising figure on the national stage: Arkansas Gov. William Jefferson Clinton. I attended a meeting in Hollywood where I was told by an intermediary: “There will be a lot of stories coming out in the tabloid press. We want them buried.” 
I was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton‘s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. 
For a retainer of $4,000 a month — paid by a third party, not the campaign — I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for “positive” interviews, or by paying the reporters. 
The payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. 
It did not appear that the job would be terribly time-consuming: After all, Hillary reportedly had just one lover, and Bill’s girlfriends were all in the past. 
Not so. The sexual dalliances were ongoing — and so my communications with the West Wing, Air Force One and Camp David continued through 1998 — a stunning length of time when one considers that both the president and the first lady were supposed to be devoting their full energies to the business of the people of the United States! 
The gravest example of a Clintonian lack of judgment occurred in March 1994. Presidential brother Roger Clinton was marrying his eight-months-pregnant bride Molly. There was a bachelor party. Prostitutes were involved. Recordings were made. Recordings involving Bill Clinton. 
Arrangements for a meeting between Bill and a 26-year-old brunette were discussed when the president was to arrive in Dallas for the ceremony. 
The tape recording was offered, for sale, to The National Enquirer . Before the publication and its then-editor could publish a transcript, I swooped in and negotiated for the White House to give this paper exclusive access to the ceremony itself. Not even The Washington Post or The New York Times had that. The Enquirer was given leave to publish exclusive White House photographs. 
At the reception, while Bill Clinton sang with the piano player, Hillary was introduced to The Enquirer reporter. Her expression fierce, voice tight, she took and tightly held the reporter’s hand and demanded, “Are we done now?” The reporter replied, “Madam First Lady, with this incident, yes.” 
Of course, we were not done. This was one of many in an endless string of sexual stories arising from what effectively was the Clintons’ open, polyamorous marriage. 
I have kept these secrets for a quarter-century because Bill Clinton had become an elder statesman with heart trouble and Hillary Clinton seemed to be focused, at last, on the business of doing her job — for better or for worse. 
I am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons — many of which have yet to be revealed. 
Predictably, the liberal media is focusing on one man’s alleged misdeeds and ignoring another’s proven sins. 
I mention some of these here and now because we have only two serious candidates for the presidency. In the few weeks remaining until the election, we should not be weighing whose corruption is worse (the Clintons win by a landslide, if all were to be told), but who has the best ideas and leadership skills to become president of the United States. Hillary Clinton is transfixed by Christina Aguilera’s boobs, confirmed by the singer on the Ellen Degeneres Show in May 2016.

18323,"Philippine Leader Shifts Drug War to Officials, Meeting Resistance and Approval - The New York Times","MANILA  —   Samsudin Dimaukom, the mayor of a town in the southern Philippines, was watching television last Sunday after midnight when he was startled to hear the country’s new president call out his name. It was no honor. President Rodrigo Duterte was reading a list of more than 150 officials he said were involved in the illegal drug trade. He ordered Mr. Dimaukom and the others to turn themselves in within 24 hours or be hunted down. “We were really surprised when the president came out to announce it,” Mr. Dimaukom, the mayor of Datu   said by email. “Not once were we involved in drugs. In fact, we were fighting drugs. I support the president’s drug war. ” Since he took office six weeks ago, Mr. Duterte, 71, has roiled the nation with a violent war on drugs that has left hundreds dead, most of them poor and powerless. This week, in what seemed to be a new phase, he took on judges and police generals, military officials, more than 50 mayors and local officials, and three men said to be current or former members of Congress. He stripped them of their weapons permits and, in some cases, their government security details, potentially leaving them vulnerable to vigilantes. The escalation provoked a clash with the Supreme Court, nearly causing a constitutional crisis before Mr. Duterte backed down, and it has raised questions about the list, a McCarthyesque device of uncertain origin and unencumbered by evidence. “How are the lists being prepared?” asked Senator Leila de Lima, a former justice secretary and former chairwoman of the Philippine Commission on Human Rights. “Who are the sources? If they have evidence, they should file charges, and that’s the only time they should disclose the name. ” But if anything, the campaign has made him only more popular. His approval ratings soared to 91 percent in July, according to a Pulse Asia poll, far higher than the 39 percent of the vote he received on Election Day in May. Even some people who have been killed by vigilantes were wearing    “Duterte” wristbands when they were gunned down. “He’s doing what he promised,” said Ramon Casiple, executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform. “He’s not surprising anybody. People like him because he is an action man. ” Mr. Duterte, a combative former mayor and prosecutor, has repeatedly called for the killing of drug dealers, and an estimated 800 people have died at the hands of police or vigilantes since his election, officials say. Many were gunned down in the street and left with a cardboard sign identifying them as drug pushers. Such killings have become known as “cardboard justice. ” More than 600, 000 drug users and dealers, fearing for their lives, have turned themselves in, the authorities say. Most have been sent home after giving the police a statement and are likely to face investigation later. But his clash with public officials has been less  . On Monday, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court challenged the president over the seven judges on his list, telling them not to submit to arrest without a warrant. The court also announced that it would investigate any allegations of the judges’ connection to the drug trade. “To safeguard the role of the judges as the protector of constitutional rights, I would caution them very strongly against ‘surrendering’ or making themselves physically accountable to any police officer in the absence of any   warrant of arrest,” Justice Sereno wrote. Mr. Duterte angrily warned her not to interfere with his campaign to bring an end to what he calls the “pandemic” drug problem in the Philippines. In a speech at a military camp on Tuesday, Mr. Duterte said she “must be joking” by demanding arrest warrants, which he said could take months to obtain. And he warned her not to create a crisis “because I will order everybody in the executive department not to honor you. ” “Please, don’t order me,” he said. “I’m not a fool. If this continues, you’re trying to stop me, I might lose my cool. Or would you rather I declare martial law?” But on Thursday, Mr. Duterte apologized, saying he never intended his “harsh words. ” He said he had been moved by “the magnitude” of the drug problem and was seeking to solve it within his authority as president. At the same time, questions were being raised about the list of names that Mr. Duterte read on national television and the death threat it carried. Critics pointed to flaws in the list and questioned whether it had been properly vetted. Justice Sereno said that only four of the seven judges on the list were still on the bench. One of them died in 2008. Another was dismissed in 2007. Jeffrey Celis, who was listed as a congressman, never served in the body, according to the local news media. Many of the elected officials quickly denied any involvement in the illegal drug trade. Some volunteered to take drug tests. One vice mayor said he had been the victim of mistaken identity it was probably his brother the police were after, he said. Mr. Dimaukom, the Datu   mayor, said he had been wrongly placed on the list because of false accusations spread by political rivals. Mr. Duterte acknowledged that some names might be on the list by mistake. He said he would take responsibility for anyone who was wrongly accused, although what action he would take was not clear, particularly since the list might be seen by vigilantes or the police as a license to kill. Dionisio Santiago, former head of the Philippines Drug Enforcement Agency, said in an interview that the list was similar to one prepared by his agency that he presented in 2010 to the president at the time, President Benigno S. Aquino III. Mr. Aquino, he said, took no action. Mr. Santiago said some people might have been placed on the list erroneously or because of a grudge. But he said most of the list was accurate, and he defended the inclusion of deceased officials. “Does being dead exonerate you?” he asked. “Dying does not erase your reputation. ” The police said that most of the people the president named had reported to the authorities as he demanded. Mr. Duterte’s presidential immunity may shield him from any repercussions, which is fine with his supporters. “The president’s public shaming of government officials involved in the illegal drugs trade is the best use of the presidential immunity from suit in our history,” Representative Danilo Suarez, the minority floor leader in Congress, wrote in The Manila Standard. Ms. de Lima, who leads the Senate committee on justice and human rights, said the committee would hold hearings this month on the wave of extrajudicial killings. “He’s now a runaway train,” she said. “It’s very revolting to me. So far, the victims of the summary killings are the lowly ones, the powerless, who cannot afford lawyers, who cannot seek audiences with the president. ” Despite Mr. Duterte’s threat, so far that fate has not befallen the officials, suggesting that despite his bravado, he may not want to unleash a civil war. In Datu   a town of about 20, 000 people, Mr. Dimaukom said he was not worried about an investigation. “First, our defense is the truth,” he said. “If you are not guilty, why should you be afraid?” But he was taking no chances. The morning after the list was announced, he reported to the local police, then flew to Manila, the capital, to meet with officials there.",0
18324,5 Things You Can Do To Challenge Trump’s Presidency,"0 Add Comment 
THE OUTPOURING of anger, fear and frustration in Ireland at Donald Trump’s election victory has been brought into sharper focus as people to voice to their vehement opposition to many of the things the president-elect has said and done. 
Irish citizens were served a sharp shock last week when they woke up to learn that the country they live in had elected a man who stood for all that is wrong with the world. Countless thousands of people took to social media to admonish the billionaire, but people will be shocked to learn more can be done to avoid the tyrant-in-waiting from damaging Ireland during his 4-year term. 
It cannot be denied that Trump is probably the most reviled and debated person in Ireland today, with his proposed policies having a massive effect on many millions of people living here in Ireland. WWN has 5 things you can do to challenge Trump’s presidency and the legitimacy of many of his most controversial opinions and ideas. 
1) His treatment of minorities must be stopped. Act now 
Donald Trump, a xenophobe at heart and the source of all evil in this world, has previous when it comes to spreading hate. Not many people are aware of this fact, but Trump set up Direct Provision centres in Ireland, where asylum seekers are forced to live in a prison-like existence and live off an allowance of €19 a week. To question Donald Trump directly on this click HERE . 
2) He is a misogynist 
If you found yourself irate at his ‘grab them by the pussy’ comments, you will lose your shit when you discover Trump is in charge of a number of compensation schemes operated by the Irish government, which see the women of the Magdalene Laundries and Survivors of Symphysiotomy denied their payments and justice due to a slow and dysfunctional system. Just what is it about Trump and his utter contempt for women? Don’t bother tweeting Trump directly on this one, as he’s quite busy at the moment. However, his Nobody Has More Respect For Women Than Me office can be reached HERE . 
3) Trump thinks homelessness, specifically in Ireland, is hilarious 
Trump has endlessly tweeted about how he enjoys the plight of Ireland’s homeless, finding the increase in the cost of property and rent to be a source of joy. What better way to get back at that orange troglodyte than by volunteering for a homeless charity. You never know, if you give whatever time, money or resources you can afford to a charity you may even get a disparaging Twitter response from the president-elect. To piss off Donald Trump click HERE . 
4) Make Ireland Great Again 
Ireland’s 45th president is for tax breaks for the rich, ending universal insurance cover and an ill advised overhaul of the education system and so much more which could well lead to hardship for future generations. However, Ireland will hope it can safeguard previous policies of cutting social welfare for the under 25s, normalising free labour through an internship scheme, increasing the price of college education and smiling broadly at a 15% youth unemployment rate. If you’d like to urge your local representatives to make the case for changing nothing, you know where to find them.",0
18325,"Oh, What a Voice: A Revival for a Member of the Four Seasons - The New York Times","Don Ciccone may never have achieved the fame of Frankie Valli, but he was a vital member of the Four Seasons, and sang on some of their biggest hits. That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of “Who Loves You” and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),” both revived in the smash Broadway musical “Jersey Boys. ” Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like “Younger Girl” and “Mr. Dieingly Sad,” and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the ’90s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a   who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone’s vocals shone. “Don had that    kind voice and we always liked the tapes,” said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old    demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a “Ciccone Sings Gari” album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. “The week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos,” Mr. Gari recalled. “He said, ‘My next project is ‘Ciccone sings Gari. ’” Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone’s “last wish,” and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone’s remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, “I Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye” had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari’s stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone’s phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper. Some original elements would not be preserved, like the simulated rainstorm augmenting a lover’s farewell in “She Left on Good Terms. ” The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari’s apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone’s youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. “It had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died,” said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling,   apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for “Late Nite Comic,” which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari’s maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the    Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as “the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. ” Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on “ ” an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as “The Cool Ghoul. ” Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the “sunshine pop” vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including “Bicycle Ride,” and “Silent Celebration,” which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit “Escape (The Piña Colada Song). ” Mr. Gari said he would be happy if the “Ciccone Sings Gari” CD sold just enough copies to cover his recording costs. “I’m doing it because it’s the right thing to do. I’m doing this in his honor,” he said. “It fulfills my dream and his last wishes. I’m taking his death and making something positive out of it. ”",0
18326,Breitbart Rises From Outlier to Potent Voice in Campaign - The New York Times,"Breitbart News has arrived. The opinion and news site, once a curiosity of the fringe right wing, is now an increasingly powerful voice, and virtual rallying spot, for millions of disaffected conservatives who propelled Donald J. Trump to the Republican nomination for president. Known for gleefully bashing the old Republican establishment, Breitbart now finds itself at the center of the party’s presidential campaign. Its longtime chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, was named campaign chief by Mr. Trump, whose nationalist,   message routinely mirrors the Breitbart worldview. On Facebook, it rivals news organizations like The Washington Post and Yahoo, and it has challenged conservative favorites like Fox News in its influence on the campaign, if not in size of audience. On Thursday, the site received its biggest billing yet  —   in the form of a scathing condemnation. In a nationally televised speech, Hillary Clinton identified Breitbart as the Democratic Party’s media enemy No. 1, warning about a “de facto merger” between the Trump campaign and a news outlet that she described as racist, radical and offensive. For Mrs. Clinton, it was a strategic attack that linked Mr. Trump to leading avatars of the   right. But among Breitbart’s ideologically driven journalists, her remarks were taken as validation. “I’ll play it cool, but not that cool: It was a big moment,” the site’s editor in chief, Alexander Marlow, 30, said in an interview on Friday. “A major presidential candidate engaging us like that, and calling us out directly, was quite thrilling. ” The rise of Breitbart News, founded a decade ago by the provocateur Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012, is an unlikely outcome for a small, decentralized news outlet with a penchant for infighting. But it remains an outsize source of controversy  —   for liberals and even many traditional conservatives  —   over material that has been called misogynist, xenophobic and racist. The site refers to “migrant rape gangs” in Europe, and was among the first news outlets to disseminate unsubstantiated rumors that Mrs. Clinton was in ill health. Its writers often vilify the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing what they call a scourge of “   crime,” and described “young Muslims in the West” as the world’s “ticking time bomb. ” Before Mr. Breitbart died, the site had gained notoriety by championing the Tea Party movement and publicizing an undercover video that led to the closing of Acorn, the community organizing group. It also posted misleading footage of Shirley Sherrod, a black Department of Agriculture official, who was fired for seeming to express resentment toward a white farmer the White House later apologized. Last month, Milo Yiannopoulos, the site’s tech editor, was banned from Twitter after inspiring a sustained online harassment campaign against the “Saturday Night Live” actor Leslie Jones. Reports surfaced this week about domestic violence charges filed against Mr. Bannon stemming from a divorce in 1996. Supporters say it is the site’s willingness to embrace viewpoints considered far outside the bounds of respectable political discourse that is the very source of its success  —   in the same way that Mr. Trump’s more extreme proposals, like banning Muslims from entering the country, galvanized the Republican primary electorate. And like Mr. Trump, Breitbart excels on social media. Last month, it ranked as the 11th most popular site on Facebook, according to statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip. A year ago, its Facebook page had fewer than a million followers now, it has more than 2. 3 million. The Breitbart home page drew 18 million visitors last month, roughly the same as Politico, according to data from comScore. It beat conservative competitors like The Daily Caller, though mainstream sites like CNN draw tens of millions more visitors each month. Breitbart, which is privately owned, has declined to release revenue figures. The site appears to be backed by Mr. Breitbart’s estate its chief executive, Larry Solov and the family of Robert Mercer, a wealthy conservative donor and Trump supporter, according to corporate documents and two people briefed on the company’s finances. For Mr. Marlow, the editor in chief, the site’s success comes from attracting an underserved segment of conservatives  —   opponents of immigration and free trade who did not see their views reflected in other outlets. In online conservative news media, Mr. Marlow said, “The focus has not been on the traditional    dichotomy. It’s become populism and nationalism versus globalism. ” He said that Fox News, long a favored venue for the Republican establishment, had lost its feel for the   right, saying the network harps on older controversies, like the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, and that its owner, Rupert Murdoch, is unwilling to criticize open immigration. “Fox is critical of Trump and a lot of the values that his voters stand for,” Mr. Marlow said. “A lot of conservatives feel betrayed. ” (Fox News has drawn its   ratings amid this year’s campaign, and Mr. Trump routinely appears on the network. “We will let our   year speak for itself,” the network said in a statement on Friday.) For those who track hate groups, Breitbart’s success is particularly alarming. “Breitbart in the last year or so has consistently picked up themes coming from the ” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, using a nickname for a loosely affiliated online movement that includes   nationalists and many supporters of Mr. Trump. Ms. Beirich said that Breitbart came to her attention because she found that white supremacist websites, like The Daily Stormer, were increasingly linking to its coverage. “To people in the   who have basically been maligned and haven’t been part of the political system at all, this is a big, big deal,” she said, adding: “Their views are finally in the mainstream. ” It was this development that prompted aides to Mrs. Clinton to consider whether she should explicitly call out Breitbart to voters. “We think it’s important that people understand what Trump stands for, and what these groups stand for, and what it means that he echoes them,” said Glen Caplin, a Clinton campaign spokesman. Breitbart issued a statement on Thursday dismissing Mrs. Clinton’s address as “one of the most bizarre, paranoid, conspiratorial presidential campaign speeches in recent memory. ” On Friday it posted a list of what it called the “Top 20 lies in Hillary’s ‘ ’ speech. ” Not everyone affiliated with Breitbart is pleased with the site’s recent turn. Several longtime staff members quit earlier this year, saying that Mr. Bannon had turned a website founded on   grounds into a de facto propaganda outlet for Mr. Trump. “I don’t think it would be Andrew Breitbart’s proudest moment to be called the foundation for white supremacy on the internet,” Ben Shapiro, one of the editors who resigned, said on Friday. Did Mr. Shapiro ever expect to see Breitbart, which began as a   aggregator of wire stories, prominently featured in a speech by a   presidential candidate? “It wouldn’t have surprised me if a Democratic presidential candidate did that,” Mr. Shapiro said. “I’m just surprised that she’s not wrong. ”",0
18327,"Arab Intel Official Warns Israel, Jordan, Syria Borders at Risk of Becoming an Iranian Stronghold","TEL AVIV  —   There is fear that further advances by the Syrian army, assisted by the   Hezbollah and elite Iranian troops, may turn the    border area into an Iranian proxy base, an Arab intelligence officer said. [“It’s not so much the possibility that it happens, but the prospects of an Israeli retaliation if Iranian forces come near its border,” he said. “Israel made it clear, publicly and behind the scenes, that it would not tolerate Hezbollah and Revolutionary Guards’ presence along its border. ”  “Iran has exploited the campaign against Nusra Front and the Islamic State to take root in the border area,” he said. “Jordan and Israel too would like to see these organizations out, but not to the point that Hezbollah and Iran fill the void. ” Lately, Israel and Jordan have cooperated closely on the matter, he stated. “Israel knows that Jordan needs to act against extremist elements but both want to prevent Iran from taking advantage of it. ” “It is also in [Syrian President Bashar] Assad’s best interest to keep the Iranians out,” the official contended. “True, he has stated that the Golan Heights would be liberated by force, and he relies heavily on Hezbollah and Iran. But at some point he’d wish to rule over his own border areas, which is something Jordan can live with. But not Iran. ” He added that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards tried several times in the past to gain a foothold in Jordan. “But these cells were unveiled and dismantled before they became operational. ” He added that the joint operation room of the Syrian opposition groups has become almost completely inactive. “Its activity has been dramatically reduced,” he said of the operation room. “There are no more operational and tactical plans and directives. The world wants first and foremost to remove the jihadist threat, but the elements in the region believe that the jihadi threat will be replaced by an Iranian one. ” He said that Jordan has rebuffed Iranian proposals to increase economic cooperation despite the financial dire straits in which the Kingdom finds itself. “They want to prevent Iran from having any kind of foothold in the kingdom. ”",0

18329,"Taliban Chief Targeted by Drone Strike in Pakistan, Signaling a U.S. Shift - The New York Times","KABUL, Afghanistan  —   After months of failed Pakistani efforts to broker peace talks with the Taliban, an American drone strike against the leader of the Afghan militants signaled a major break with precedent as the United States circumvented Pakistan in an effort to disrupt the strengthening insurgency, officials said on Sunday. The Afghan intelligence agency said Sunday that the Taliban leader, Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, had been killed in the strike in the restive Pakistani province of Baluchistan. The United States announced the strike Saturday but could not confirm that Mullah Mansour had been killed. Although there was still no official reaction from the main Taliban spokesman, some Taliban commanders on Sunday denied the reports, saying their leader was not in the area of the strike. Even if Mullah Mansour was not killed, the attack was significant, as it is believed to be the first American drone strike in Baluchistan, the de facto headquarters of the Afghan Taliban, after years of such attacks in other Pakistani and Afghan areas. The death of Mullah Mansour, who was consolidating his authority over a fracturing Taliban as the militants made major gains on the battlefield, would throw the insurgency into its second leadership crisis within a year. Still, it was unclear whether it could create any significant breathing space for the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani, which has struggled to bring the insurgency into negotiations. Even with no clear successor to Mullah Mansour, the issue of peace talks has long been seen as deeply unpopular among the Taliban’s most senior leadership. The strike in Baluchistan was also seen as a signal that the Obama administration was growing less patient with Pakistan’s failure to move strongly against the Taliban insurgency. While Pakistan’s powerful military establishment has quietly cooperated with the C. I. A. ’s campaign of drone strikes against Al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban in the northwestern tribal areas, it has refused past requests from the spy agency to expand the drone flights into Baluchistan, former American officials said. The United States and the Afghan government have long pointed at the Taliban sanctuaries across the border in Pakistan, particularly in Baluchistan, as the main reason for the resilience of the insurgents despite a campaign against them that, at its peak, involved nearly 150, 000 international troops. But until the strike against Mullah Mansour on Saturday, consecutive administrations in Washington had resisted the temptation of going after Taliban sanctuaries out of fear of angering Pakistan. Instead, American officials focused on pressuring the Pakistani military to force the Taliban’s leadership into joining peace talks with the Afghan government. Pakistani officials were alerted to the attack against Mullah Mansour only after the strike, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential operational details. Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement Sunday denouncing the attack as a violation of the country’s sovereignty. The stance echoed Pakistan’s anger over the American raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Then, too, the United States informed Pakistan of the raid only after the fact. The Foreign Ministry said in the statement that a man carrying a Pakistani passport with the name Wali Muhammad, who entered from Iran on Saturday, had been targeted in the strike, along with his driver. It was not immediately clear if either was Mullah Mansour. American officials say President Obama authorized a strike against Mullah Mansour weeks ago as it became clear that the new leader of the Taliban had little interest in peace talks. Months of efforts involving Afghanistan, Pakistan, China and the United States to initiate    talks led nowhere, with Mullah Mansour only intensifying his attacks. The opportunity on Saturday, after a closer surveillance of his movements was activated, presented itself relatively quickly, in a matter of hours, and the military acted using the earlier White House authorization. It took the Afghan government until noon on Sunday to state that Mullah Mansour was dead. The Taliban brushed it aside as propaganda along the lines of similar claims in December. The Afghan government, at that time, said Mullah Mansour had been killed in fighting between rival Taliban factions, also in Baluchistan. “Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the leader of the Taliban group, was killed around 3:45 p. m. yesterday as a result of an airstrike in Dalbandin area of Baluchistan Province in Pakistan,” the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said in a statement. “He had been under close surveillance for a while, until his vehicle was struck and destroyed on the main road in the Dalbandin area. ” Mullah Hameedi, a top Taliban military commander in southern Afghanistan, confirmed a strike in the border area but denied that Mullah Mansour had been there. “We are going to persuade Mullah Mansour to publish his audio record to confirm he is alive,” he said. The United States did not offer confirmation of its own. “We are confident, but at this point we do not have indisputable facts that he is dead,” said Brig. Gen. Charles H. Cleveland, a spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, said on Sunday. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking on Sunday in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar, was the first senior official to talk about the attack. He repeatedly referred to Mr. Mansour in the past tense. Asked if Pakistan had been kept in the dark about the operation until it was complete, Mr. Kerry would not say “when we communicated. ” But he indicated that he talked with Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, on Sunday morning, after the strike was announced. “We have long said that Mansour posed an imminent threat to us and to Afghan civilians,” he said. “This action sends a clear message to the world that we will continue to work with our Afghan partners. ” Pakistan’s relatively muted reaction, similar to its standard protests against drone strikes by American forces, might be due to the fact that, according to Taliban commanders in recent months, Mullah Mansour had repeatedly resisted Pakistani officials’ pressure on him to join negotiations. “Mansour has not been cooperative in making progress on peace settlement discussions with Afghanistan,” said Seth Jones, an expert on Afghanistan at the RAND Corporation. “One red line for Pakistan has historically been a failure by Taliban operatives to accede to Pakistani priorities. ” Mullah Mansour rose to the Taliban leadership after the death of Mullah Omar in 2013 was revealed last summer. A former aviation minister lacking battlefield expertise, he ascended through the ranks of the insurgents gradually but was seen as a crucial figure in the Taliban’s regrouping after an initial defeat following the   invasion in 2001. Once he rose to the movement’s No. 2 position, he began a campaign of sidelining rivals and creating a monopoly over resources and  . After a very public leadership confirmation last summer in front of large gatherings of Taliban in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan, Mullah Mansour had limited his movements, Afghan officials said. While the reason given to his subordinates was security  —   he narrowly missed an attempt on his life, attributed to dissidents within the Taliban ranks, in December  —   keeping the leader at a distance from the commanders followed a pattern that became routine under Mullah Omar. A persistent question over whether Mullah Mansour would strike a peace deal with the Afghan government was his deep involvement in narcotics, a trade that has prospered in insecurity. The United Nations, as well as the Afghan government, has described Mullah Mansour as resembling the leader of a cartel rather than an insurgency that has relied on religious justification for its long war. “Mullah Mansour was involved in smuggling and the mafia besides the leadership responsibility he had, which is why he was in favor of continuing the war to better run his businesses,” said Jawid Kohistani, an Afghan security and intelligence analyst. “That is why he wouldn’t cooperate for the calls for peace talks. ” When Mullah Omar’s death was revealed last summer, Mullah Mansour was a strong, though not unanimous, candidate for the job. But even as the Taliban under his leadership remained a formidable and violent force, Mullah Mansour struggled to unite the ranks. He quashed breakaway groups and sought to buy the support of other skeptical commanders, all while maintaining a publicity campaign that portrayed him as the head of a united command. Much remains unclear about the succession if he is dead. One leading candidate would be Sirajuddin Haqqani, one of Mullah Mansour’s most feared deputies, who has largely been running battlefield operations in recent months. While closely linked to Pakistan’s spy agency, Mr. Haqqani would struggle to gain the support of the wider Taliban as his small but lethal network has only in recent months fully integrated into the larger insurgency. Whether or not Mullah Mansour resurfaces as he did the last time he was reported killed, the United States’ expansion of its drone campaign into Baluchistan suggests “that the U. S. is losing patience with the promises of Pakistan,” said Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to Washington. “The Taliban insurgency will probably continue, but Pakistan has another chance to dissociate itself from backing the greatest threat to Afghan stability,” Mr. Haqqani said.",0
18330,Graham: I Have a Reason to Believe a Conversation I Had with a Foreign Leader Was Unmasked - Breitbart,"Friday on Fox News Channel’s “America’s Newsroom,” Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) said he had reason to believe his conversations with foreign leaders were requested to be “unmasked. ”  Graham said, “I have reason to believe that a conversation I had was picked up with some foreign leader or some foreign person and somebody requested that my conversation be unmasked. I’ve been told that by people in the intelligence community. All I can say is there are 1, 950 collections on American citizens talking to people that were foreign agents being surveilled either by the CIA, FBI or the NSA. ” Watch: “Here is the concern: Did the people in the Obama administration listen in to these conversations?” He continued. “Was there a politicizing of the intelligence gathering processes? Here is what I want to know of the 1, 950 collections on American citizens. How many of them involved presidential candidates, members of Congress from either party and if these conversations were unmasked, who made the request? I want to know everything there is about unmasking, how it works and who requested unmasking of conversations between foreign people and American members of Congress. ” He added, “I’ve got information to suggest that I was incidentally collected. I don’t know if I was unmasked or not. I’ve sent a letter to the NSA, FBI and the CIA requesting any collection on Lindsey Graham. If you have reason to believe a member of Congress is committing a crime, you go get a warrant to follow us around like you would any other citizen. I meet with foreign leaders all the time. And I would be upset if any executive branch agency listened in on my conversations, because I’m in another branch of government. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
18331,Donald Trump Drops Threat of New Hillary Clinton Investigation - The New York Times,"  Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server or the financial operations of her family’s foundation, dropping the “lock her up” pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the White House. Mr. Trump, who branded his rival “Crooked Hillary” and said she would go to jail if he were president, said in an interview with reporters and editors at The New York Times that he was no longer interested in pursuing Mrs. Clinton, in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign. “I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” Mr. Trump said during the interview. “She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways, and I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. ” His reversal on prosecuting Mrs. Clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign, in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme, and one she has blamed for her loss to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump said he wanted to “move forward” from the subject. Without elaborating, he said that “we’ll have people that do things,” perhaps a reference to the F. B. I. or Republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases. But the   made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office. The decision angered some of his most fervent supporters, who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart. “Broken Promise,” blared the headline on Breitbart News, a conservative news site that has strongly backed Mr. Trump. “It’s not something that I feel very strongly about,” Mr. Trump said at The Times, unlike health care or immigration. “This has been a very painful period of time. ” Clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump’s remarks. During their second debate, Mr. Trump turned to Mrs. Clinton and vowed, “If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there’s never been so many lies, so much deception. ” After Mr. Trump’s turnaround on Tuesday, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign, suggested on Twitter that Mr. Trump was overstepping his role. “Whoa! I thought we elected @realDonaldTrump president,” she wrote. “Did we make him the FBI,  DOJ? His job is to pick those guys, not do their jobs. ” Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of Mrs. Clinton, said on Tuesday that it would be a mistake for Mr. Trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use. Mr. Fitton said that although the F. B. I. had already investigated the matter twice, that inquiry was flawed. His group has gained access to thousands of pages of Mrs. Clinton’s State Department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat. Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said last week on Fox News that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because “we’ve got to get to the truth. ” Mr. Chaffetz’s office said on Tuesday he was unavailable for comment about Mr. Trump’s statements. Although the F. B. I. ’s email investigation is closed, the agency still has an open inquiry into the Clinton Foundation. That inquiry began after the 2015 publication of “Clinton Cash,” a book by Peter Schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for State Department favors when Mrs. Clinton was there. The Clintons have denied the assertions. The F. B. I. and Justice Department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the White House, so Mr. Trump cannot tell agents to close their cases. A president ordering the F. B. I. to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal. “It does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision,” Glen A. Kopp, a former federal prosecutor in New York, said of the  . “I know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter. ” If, as president, Mr. Trump were to order the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, to close the foundation inquiry, Mr. Comey could choose to rebuff him. F. B. I. directors are given   terms to insulate them from political pressure, but the president still has the power to fire a director, as President Bill Clinton did with William S. Sessions in 1993 after a Justice Department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by Mr. Sessions. In an interview last week with CBS News’s “60 Minutes,” Mr. Trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss Mr. Comey over his handling of the Clinton email investigation, saying the director “may have had very good reasons for doing what he did. ” As a practical matter, though, Mr. Trump’s remarks will probably have little impact. The investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s emails is already closed and, while the one into her family’s foundation remains open, senior F. B. I. officials and career Justice Department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case. When the case comes up for review, senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down, but it will not be because of Mr. Trump’s remarks. While the  ’s decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the F. B. I. who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover, some legal experts applauded Mr. Trump’s decision to not pursue investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s emails or her family foundation. Rory K. Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said he was inclined to support both moves by Mr. Trump. A decision to shut down an investigation, he said, “is not out of step with constitutional constraints,” as the Constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes.",0
18332,Memo To Congress: Bring Back Earmarks!,"Written by Daniel McAdams Thursday November 17, 2016 One of the essential battles in the effort to move toward a more peaceful and prosperous United States is the effort to restore the proper balance among the three branches of our government. The rapid concentration of power in the Executive Branch has led to more wars with less Congressional oversight, trampling of our civil liberties with no resistance from our Representatives, and out of control military spending. Contrary to what many people believe, the Congressional ability to earmark spending to specific projects was an important function of the Legislative Branch. When earmarks were abolished, spending did not decrease. It was just hidden. We discuss the need for their return in today's Liberty Report: Copyright © 2016 by RonPaul Institute.

Levin called it “actually outstanding” and likened that leadership style to former President Dwight Eisenhower. “I thought the president’s comments today were actually outstanding,” Levin said. “And he showed enormous humility. And this guy doesn’t give up. I mean, he said OK, we’ll fight another day. In essence, he said that events will reach a point where this is going to have to be resolved. And when it reaches that point, I’m. ‘Mark, that’s not leadership.’ But it kind of is, actually. I’m not making a comparison. It is the sort of way that Dwight Eisenhower managed.

18336,The Cubs Confront the Curse: Is This the Year? - The New York Times,"CHICAGO  —   “There is no curse that’s crazy talk,” the chairman of the Chicago Cubs, Tom Ricketts, said the other day in his office. The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908, nor have they qualified for one since 1945. In Chicago and beyond, by the legions, people think the explanation must come from the supernatural. There is talk of a certain billy goat. You might have to live here to understand. Once again, the Cubs are in the playoffs. They had the best   record in the major leagues, which has made them the talk of the baseball world as well as the favorites to win this year’s World Series. This might make other teams and their fans ecstatic. Yet in Chicago, there is a thinly veiled, repressed gloom that comes with having had your heart broken so often. People cope with the postseason tension in different ways. Carol Haddon, a lifelong fan, offered perspective. “My basement has flooded way too often  —   that’s sad,” she said. “The Cubs failing to win the World Series when I sense an honest effort? No, I’m not going be overly dejected about that. ” Jon Lester, a Cubs pitcher, has sought to own the curse, insisting his teammates confront it and talk about it. “There is nothing for us to run from,” he said. A beer vendor at Chicago’s Wrigley Field looks around and notices some   no longer occupying their seats. “It’s heartbreaking,” the vendor, Rocco Caputo, said. “They passed away, and I know they never got to see a World Series win. ” Will this be the year? A sampling of the people caught up in the exhilaration and strain of the 2016 season: Carol Haddon, a Cubs   holder for 45 years, has a transistor radio affixed to the wall of the home dugout in front of her   seat. She keeps score of every game and lauds Cubs fans for weathering more than a century of postseason futility. “We are not loser fans,” she said. “We are optimistic fans. I choose not to carry the losses on my back. I choose to look at the bright side of things. That’s an attribute. ” Haddon first bought her season tickets when they cost $3. 50 a game, or roughly $285 for the season. That was in 1971, when the Cubs drew only about 10, 000 fans to most games. (This year, they have averaged nearly 40, 000 a game.) Haddon remembers the ballpark was sometimes so quiet that a fan could hear the infielders chatting in the middle of an inning. And fans would routinely join in on those conversations. Haddon, a former schoolteacher who said she is in her early 70s, has attended at least 2, 000 games at Wrigley Field and become so close to Cubs players that they have been houseguests and accompanied her to high school softball games to root for her daughter. “It was all so informal then  —   that was before the WGN effect,” Haddon said. WGN, a division of the Tribune Company, which owned the Cubs at the time, was one of cable television’s first superstations, making its debut in 1978 on fledgling cable systems nationwide. Cubs games  —   including 81 played in the daytime at Wrigley, which did not have lights until 1988  —   were beamed across the country, making the Cubs a kind of second home team for some. In places without major league teams, the Cubs were adopted as the home team. Nearly 40 years later, the Cubs can genuinely say they have a nation of fans. And hundreds of thousands of them make frequent pilgrimages to Wrigley Field, where tickets are in high demand. Haddon, who last week wore Cubs earrings, a Cubs pullover and white shoes decorated with the kind of red stitching used on a baseball, never puts her two tickets for sale on secondary ticket markets like StubHub. Her two children and various friends come to games with her. Saturday night games are always date nights with her husband, Jimmy. There has been plenty to despair, but the one time Haddon struggled to keep her sunny disposition was during the 1984 National League Championship Series, when the Cubs were one victory from making it to the World Series, then were eliminated with three consecutive defeats in San Diego. An error by the star Cubs first baseman Leon Durham  —   the ball trickled under his glove and through his legs  —   led to San Diego’s surprising comeback in the final game. As usual for a Cubs postseason defeat, there were shadowy circumstances that led to the last, crushing loss. Before the game, Durham’s first baseman’s mitt was accidentally doused with Gatorade, making it sticky and gluey. Flustered, he considered using another glove but decided against it, a decision Cubs fans have lamented ever since. Durham’s mitt may have, in essence, been stuck shut as he was trying to snare a crucial ground ball. Haddon was at the game in San Diego. “That’s the only time the Cubs really, really made me cry,” she said last week. “When I got off the plane coming home and saw my husband, I started crying. ” But Haddon has been confident approaching this year’s playoffs. Even if she feels the fear around her, especially because the Cubs have the best record in the majors. “Everyone is a little afraid to be so excited,” she said, sitting in her princely seats with her feet propped on the Cubs’ dugout during a   weekend day game. “We’re all afraid. Well, I’m not afraid, because I believe we will win. We should win. We’re the best team in baseball. ” Pitcher Jon Lester spent nine seasons with the Boston Red Sox, watching as a city and a region burdened by decades of dispiriting postseason losses had its championship renaissance. In his second season as a Cub, Lester cannot help seeing the similarities between Chicago and Boston. “In Boston, no matter how good the Patriots, Celtics or Bruins are, it’s sort of a Red Sox town,” he said. “I feel the same thing is true in Chicago. No matter how good any other team is, it always comes back to the Cubs. ” Lester has also assessed the two fan bases and sees considerable differences. “East Coast versus the Midwest,” he said. “It’s not the full,       type of city and fan as you get in Boston. Here, everybody is a little slower, a little more  . But the passion is still there. Both ballparks are packed every night, and everybody is yelling. ” While much of the Cubs’ roster was built with shrewd acquisitions of young talent, Lester was perhaps the final pivotal piece added when he spurned multiple other suitors, most notably the Red Sox, to sign a   contract before the 2015 season worth $155 million. He was rejoining the architects of Boston’s multiple championships: the Cubs’ president for baseball operations, Theo Epstein, and General Manager Jed Hoyer. Lester brought with him the gravitas of a   World Series pitching record and a 0. 43 earned run average in those games. There were other bonds to his Boston days. Lester is one of two cancer survivors in the Cubs’ clubhouse. In 2006, he was told he had a form of  ’s lymphoma, but returned to win the game that clinched the World Series for the Red Sox in 2007. Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo was told he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2008, when he was an    Red Sox minor leaguer. Lester and Rizzo first met in the Boston clubhouse shortly after Rizzo received the diagnosis, with Lester offering his counsel on how to approach the chemotherapy and the mental challenges of confronting the disease. Eight years later, they have been reunited as Cubs and have developed a     bond. Lester had a   record this season, the best winning percentage for a National League pitcher. Rizzo is a leading candidate for the league’s Most Valuable Player Award after slugging 31 home runs and driving in 101 runs. All around the Cubs’ clubhouse, Lester has become a seasoned, valued voice, perhaps because of his Boston experiences or maybe because Lester had to overcome so much more off the field. But he is not reluctant to discuss the subject that never goes away in Chicago: the Cubs’ curse. “I’ve told the guys we have to talk about it, because you can’t stick it in the back corner of a dark room and never acknowledge it,” Lester said, standing at his locker. “That’s how bad things creep in. This city has waited a long, long time. For whatever reason  —   a goat or a black cat  —   things haven’t worked out. “But we’ve talked about wanting to be the team that wins the World Series  —   a Cubs World Series. ” Lester looked across the team’s clubhouse, toward the long, serpentine footpath that leads to the home dugout and the cozy grounds of Wrigley Field, built six years after the Cubs’ last World Series victory. “There is a reality that we are facing,” Lester said. “It is the team’s history. But history gets updated all the time. ” A mime once came to lead the Cubs’ pregame stretching drills. A player rode his bike from his home to the ballpark like a Little Leaguer, in complete uniform. Another day, the team stepped onto the field to find live bear cubs frolicking in the grass. All the shenanigans came from the fertile, experimental mind of Cubs Manager Joe Maddon, a grizzled and usually   former scout, minor league hitting coach and manager and   coach who waited 31 years to be put at the helm of a   club. Before the 2015 season, when he was 60 years old, Maddon agreed to become the Cubs’ manager and shoulder the weight of history that came with the job. The new sheriff in town gave his team a set of nonmarching orders. As he described them last week: “I don’t have any rules or regulations other than I want you to run hard to first base and I want the pitchers to work on their defense. There are no dress codes I think they’re nonsensical. The concept of being late is overblown. You can’t really be late for anything. ” In less than two years, Maddon’s freethinking philosophy has elevated him to   status in Chicago, where his   preachings are emblazoned on   sold all over the city. John Baranowski, a    longtime Cubs fan, was wearing one of Maddon’s signature   that read “Do Simple Better” as he prepared to enter Wrigley Field last week. Baranowski likened Maddon to a baseball swami delivered to Wrigley by divine intervention to reverse the Cubs’ curse. “Is there anyone better to fix an insanely      situation than a guy who lives to defy what people say is supposed to happen?” Baranowski said. “This is the perfect guy. He doesn’t care about the stupid curse. ” Maddon, whose   record with the Cubs is   may have saved his most important, if atypical, managerial ploy when it comes to the famed curse. He refuses to shy from it. At Wrigley Field, he had a wall leading from the team’s clubhouse to the dugout inscribed with this Maddon maxim: “Don’t let the pressure exceed the pleasure. ” Maddon is not going to allow more than a century of postseason despair to ruin his good time. “For me, the word ‘pressure’ should be an absolute positive and not a negative, because if people are throwing that pressure out at you, that means there’s really something good attached to whatever you’re trying to accomplish,” he said. “Pressure lives in the future, not the present tense. If you can live in the moment, then you can enjoy the pleasure of it. ” Sitting at his office desk beneath the Wrigley Field grandstand, Maddon shook his head. “Listen, I’ve wanted to do this since I was 6 years old, and now I’m going to get here and be miserable?” he said. “No, man, I don’t get that way of thinking at all. ” Rocco Caputo has tramped up and down the stairs at Cubs games for 33 years, a smiling, wisecracking fixture at Wrigley Field, a place called “the friendly confines” for its cheery atmosphere. But there is a hidden melancholy, like a family secret never discussed. It reveals itself when the Cubs are in the postseason. “There’s a lot of crying that nobody likes to talk about,” Caputo said as he stood in a narrow aisle in Wrigley’s lower deck last week. “It’s there in the stands. ” Caputo was selling beer behind home plate in 2003 during what was probably the most tormenting bad break in a Cubs playoff run. In the eighth inning of Game 6 during that year’s National League Championship Series, the Cubs had a   lead and were five outs from a victory that would send them to the World Series when Steve Bartman, a longtime fan of the team sitting along the railing of the   stands, interfered with a foul fly ball that might have been caught by a Cubs outfielder. The incident set in motion a series of   misplays and quirky bounces that could only happen to the Cubs, who lost that game and Game 7 the next day. Caputo looked into the eyes of his customers that night. “I saw the hurt,” he said. With the Cubs eliminated, Caputo finished counting his beer sales cash and dashed from Wrigley Field to begin the   walk home. Instead, he walked for miles in the opposite direction. “I didn’t want to go home,” he said. “I didn’t know where I was going. I felt like jumping in Lake Michigan. I just walked for like an hour. ” Unlike some Cubs fans, he does not blame Bartman, but unlike some Cubs fans, he is willing to admit to some kind of Cubs hex. “We’ve got a curse and we’ve got to get rid of it,” Caputo said. “A lot of people have been coming here for years, and it’s getting hard. “Most of us have been waiting our whole lives. I’m 49. I’m helping all I can. I cheer my heart out. I sell the beer. ” In 2009, when the Ricketts family was getting ready to buy the Cubs, occasionally someone would ask Tom Ricketts: Aren’t you worried about aligning yourself with a franchise best known for not winning the World Series? Ricketts had a much bigger fear. He was nervous that the Cubs, who had decent teams back then, might win the World Series before he could buy the team. Ricketts, who was making the bid for the Cubs along with his two brothers, sister and parents, wondered if his family would want to own the Cubs without the World Series drought. “It’s much better to be part of the quest for a championship than to be coming in after the goal has been accomplished,” Ricketts said last week. “Our question was: If they win the World Series, do we care anymore?” The Ricketts family, whose fortune derives from TD Ameritrade, the brokerage founded by the patriarch Joseph Ricketts, need not have worried that the Cubs would shatter its hopes. As soon as the Rickettses took charge, the Cubs fell apart, losing an average of about 93 games during the next five seasons. Ricketts, the ownership’s public face, was nearly an everyday presence at Wrigley Field during those seasons, as he is now, making himself available to fans as he walks through the concourses at almost every home game. He often rides a commuter train to his downtown Chicago office, where he also runs an investment banking company he created in 1999. Raised in Nebraska and a Cubs fan since he went to college in Chicago  —   he and his brother once lived across the street from Wrigley Field  —   he is one of the most accessible team owners in American sports. “When we were losing 101 games one season, everyone assumes I walked through Wrigley and had everyone yelling at me,” he said. “That wasn’t the case at all. Every once in a while, there would be somebody who didn’t understand our plan, but we could buy them a beer and try to explain. ” The plan was to turn all the baseball decisions over to Epstein, the president for baseball operations, who gutted the Cubs, several times trading away most of the team’s older starting pitchers for young, undeveloped talent, to build a sustainable core for the future. With the Cubs now the favorites to win World Series, Ricketts hears fans saying they wished the Cubs were backing into the playoffs instead  —   there is less pressure that way. Ricketts snickered and said, “There are a lot of people here who have a lot of time to overthink all those angles. ” Never mind that no team has ever been so vexed by so many curious setbacks and omens, many with such rich, colorful names and narratives. A fan, Billy Sianis, and his pet goat were ejected from Wrigley Field during the 1945 World Series. Sianis vowed that the Cubs would never again win baseball’s championship because of the insult. The Cubs lost in seven games and have yet to return to the World Series. Hence, the celebrated curse of the billy goat. There was also a prancing black cat preceding a 1969   collapse. Ricketts would not hear any of it. He shook his head side to side when the Cubs’ many bizarre postseason outcomes were recounted to him. “We had a lot of bad teams, and when we had good teams, we had a lot of bad luck,” he said. “And we just have to accept that. That’s the truth. But there is no curse. ”",0
18337,HUNGRY VENEZUELANS STRIKE AGAINST MADURO REGIME,"Home › WORLD NEWS › HUNGRY VENEZUELANS STRIKE AGAINST MADURO REGIME HUNGRY VENEZUELANS STRIKE AGAINST MADURO REGIME 0 SHARES 
[10/30/16] Despite threats from the Nicolás Maduro ‘s administration, Venezuela started the day paralyzed by a strike organized by the country’s political opposition. 
“Nobody leave their homes!” was the call made by the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) this Friday, October 28. The general strike is supposed to last 12 hours — from six in the morning until six at night — as a way of protesting the government’s refusal to go through with the presidential recall referendum process. 
The call precedes the possibility for dialogue between the two sides this Sunday, October 30, but following threats from the government against businesses who choose to join in on the peaceful protest. Part of those threats involved the government “taking over” businesses by force. 
Faced with such threats, it isn’t clear which businesses would go through with the strike and if regular workers would clock in. The student movement, meanwhile, made it clear that they would be participating in the strike. 
A sector of the National Worker’s Union has joined in on the strike as well. 
In a statement titled “Democracy and the Rule of Law Are at Stake in Venezuela,” the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce said that the decision to participate is up to each and every individual business. 
Vice President Carlos Larrazábal reiterated that the agency is not taking a stance one way or another. Businesses have the freedom to strike if they want to. Post navigation",0

Gerasimov said the decision was approved by Syrian authorities and was meant to ""prevent senseless casualties"" by allowing civilians and armed combatants to quit rebel-held eastern Aleppo....Defence ministry Sergei Shoigu said Tuesday that Russia had ceased air strikes on eastern Aleppo for 16 days, following criticism over a Russian-backed Syrian government assault that has killed hundreds of civilians and destroyed infrastructure, including hospitals. 
This is probably the last ceasefire on offer before al-Qaeda and CIA proxy forces in east-Aleppo are attacked in full force. 
These head-chopping ""rebels"" rejected the Russian offer: Rebel groups in Aleppo dismissed Russia's latest offer, with one of the groups describing it as a media stunt for ""public consumption.""
Yasser al-Youssef, a spokesman for the Nour el-Din el-Zinki rebel group, said Russia ""is not serious"" and its latest initiatives ""don't concern us."" He added that the Russian leader's comments do not reflect the reality on the ground. 
The great ""rebel"" attack from Idleb in the west on Aleppo to open a corridor to the government besieged ""rebel"" area in east-Aleppo has failed. Local fighting is still ongoing but the main attack has stopped. Most of the major hardware of the attacking ""rebels"", tanks and multiple rocket launchers on trucks, have been destroyed by the Syrian and Russian artillery and air forces. 
The Syrian Army and Russia have assembled major fresh forces in Aleppo. Syrian special forces are preparing for a big attack and Iran supported groups as well as some Russian units are on the ground. On Friday the Russian aircraft-carrier Kuznetsov will arrive on the Syrian coast. It adds some 30 fighter planes and attack helicopters to the assembled land based air forces. The carrier is accompanied by several destroyers and frigates as well as submarines. These add to the air defenses but can also launch salvos of cruise missiles. 
But this whole build up may have a different purpose than an all out attack on east-Aleppo. bigger 
North-east-east of Aleppo is Al-Bab, a city held by ISIS (grey) and campaign aim of Turkish (green) as well as Kurdish (yellow) forces. The Kurdish YPG forces (named SDF to disguise them as mixed Kurdish-Arab group) want to connect their areas in northwest-Syria to those in north east-Syria. They need the line from north-Aleppo through Al-Bab to the city of Manbij further east which is already in their hands. They are generally capable and well equipped but their forces are stretched and they lack major artillery and reliable air-support. From the north Turkish proxy ""rebel"" forces, supported by Turkish artillery from north of the Turkish-Syrian border, have moved south to prevent a Kurdish west-east uniting of their areas and to keep supply lines for ISIS to Turkey open. They are now on the geographic limits of the Turkish artillery support. The Turkish army is reluctant to move its artillery south of the border into Syria. The army is based on conscript forces and the Turkish people would start to make trouble for Erdogan if their drafted sons get killed in Syria. There is also no legal base for an invasion by regular Turkish forces. 
The Turkish air force has been supporting the Turkish ""rebel"" proxies in central Syria. But after it recently bombed and killed about 100 Kurdish fighters northeast of Aleppo the Russian and Syrian air forces have warned it off. Any Turkish plane entering Syrian air space is a legitimate target. The Turks understood the warning and have since stayed out of Syrian airspace. 
Turkish supported forces taking Al-Bab could be in preparation of an attack on Aleppo from the east, endangering the Syrian progress in the city. Kurdish forces are known for their notorious unreliability as allies. They change sides for minor bribes or issues. They could probably be trusted to take Al-Bab now without bothering the government forces in Aleppo but that could change any day. 
The third possible power to take Al-Bab is the Syrian Arab Army (red on the map). Since it took the Qweiris airbase south of Al-Bab back from ISIS it is only some 10 kilometers away from the city. A second direction of attack could come from the eastern parts of Aleppo. Taking Al-Bab would consolidate the areas between Qweiris and Aleppo and would be a good position to prepare for a later attack on the ISIS ""capital"" Raqqa southeast of Al-Bab and east of Qweiris. Areas directly north of Al-Bab could be let open for the Kurds to bother with the Turkish supported forces. The Syrian government will not protest when those fight each other. 
Starting this weekend we will probably see two Syrian government campaigns. A major bombing campaign against ""rebel"" positions in east-Aleppo as well as a ground attack by Syrian government forces against Al-Bab. I find this more plausible than an imminent ground attack on ""rebels"" in east-Aleppo that was not prepared so far by a major campaign from air and artillery forces. 
Something big Syrian military ""election campaign"" will happen in Syria while the U.S. public, government and media are distracted by their election circus. Are the other forces fighting in Syria, the U.S. supported proxies, ISIS, Al-Qaeda, the Turks prepared for such a new Syrian government campaign? Do they have plausible counter moves in store?   2, 2016 at 03:49 PM | Permalink",0
18339,Alabama Republican Official: ‘Just Because You Turned 18 Doesn’t Give You The Right To Vote’ (VIDEO),"November 2, 2016 Alabama Republican Official: ‘Just Because You Turned 18 Doesn’t Give You The Right To Vote’ (VIDEO)   
Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill has a big problem with increasing the number of registered voters in his state. 
Slate reports that Merrill, like many Republicans, opposes recent reforms in voter registration policies that could significantly increase the number of registered voters. 
The proposal would automatically register eligible state residents “who interact with government agencies” to vote. According to the Brennan Center , this legislation would also guarantee that voter-registration information is moved on to election officials electronically, which will reduce errors in the voting process. 
However, Merrill says that he stands opposed to this initiative because it “cheapen[s] the work” of civil rights activists, adding that “just because you turned 18 doesn’t give you the right [to vote].” 
“These people fought, some of them were beaten, some of them were killed because of their desire to ensure that everybody that wanted to had the right to register to vote and participate in the process,” Merrill explained in an interview with the voting rights initiative, Answering the Call . 
He then went on to reference several civil rights leaders, like Georgia U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who Merrill claimed called him a friend. 
Merrill continued, “I’m not going to embarrass them by allowing someone that’s too sorry to get up off of their rear end to go register to vote … because they think they deserve the right because they turned 18.” 
The jackass then went on to say that automatically registering teen voters to be able to exercise their right to vote is “no different than giving them a trophy because they played on the ball team. You only get a trophy if you win!” 
“I think it’s a sorry, lazy way out and it shows no initiative.” 
Alabama joins 14 other states who have enacted new voting restrictions ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Brennan Center says that these actions are designed to “curtail voting rights.” 
The New York Times reported last year that the restrictions Alabama put in place included a photo ID law, which makes having a government issued ID mandatory to participate in the voting process. 
The biggest problem with these identification laws is that many older and poorer citizens are faced with hardships when it comes to obtaining the necessary paperwork needed to get a government I.D. Many states also structure the office hours of their DMV services and polling locations to discourage people further from voting. 
The bottom line is that Republicans love low voter turn out because they can’t convince the vast majority of Americans that their ideas are good for the country.

18340,This Season’s Best Books on Hollywood - The New York Times,"There are two types of show business star: matte and gloss. Matte stars deaden the light, their recesses best revealed in shadow. Creatures of chiaroscuro, they conquer and retreat, like Garbo, turn chameleonic in company, like Brando, alternating sullen disgruntlement with outright  . Beards may be involved. Gloss stars, by contrast, eat up the light like a cat sunbathing on a windowsill. They strut with the   ease of toddlers showing off to their parents. Think of the peacock thrill of being looked at that John Travolta evinces in “Grease” or Tom Hanks in “Big” or Jennifer Lawrence in anything besides “The Hunger Games. ” Theirs is an egoless egotism that, by dint of the generosity with which it is offered up, yields audiences the promise of transcended, liberated self. Here, have me. Alan Cumming is the latter. His new book, YOU GOTTA GET BIGGER DREAMS: My Life in Stories and Pictures (Rizzoli, $29. 95) is a scrapbook of photographs taken by the actor over the years, accompanied by biographical sketches of what he was up to at the time  —   prose selfies for a kind of   memoir. Here is a shot of Glenn Close’s “totally smoking ripped back” on the red carpet at the Tonys. Here is Eva Mendes’s cleavage at the Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles. Here is a blurry shot of Oprah snapped in the star’s tail winds at an Elie Wiesel Foundation dinner in her honor. “Very famous people create whirlwinds,” he notes, and kicks his book off with a Force 7 gale: Hurricane Liz, whom he runs into at Carrie Fisher’s birthday party and soon has cackling “like a trucker who’d just heard a good fart joke. ” The book ends, some 250 pages later, with the actor’s being barged out of the way by Diana Ross making a beeline for the dance floor at an Oscar party. “The song she was so desperate to dance to was one of her own!” he notes. “Talk about being in the middle of a chain reaction. ” There is a tradition of stars turning paparazzi  —   Jeff Bridges has taken beautiful photographs on and off the movie set. There’s a tradition, too, of British performers going to Hollywood and returning with their wits intact to write up the experience in   memoirs: David Niven set the bar with “The Moon’s a Balloon. ” Quentin Crisp turned his   humor into a cottage industry. Cumming has already proved himself a gifted writer with “Not My Father’s Son,” wringing humor from the hard facts of his upbringing in Scotland, not least his brute of a father, who used to shear him with clippers, like a sheep. Cumming Sr. makes a brief appearance at the start of this book, too, sneering at the little plastic Kodak camera that his son wins in a church raffle: “Get on with that grass”  —   an instruction to which the rest of the book might be said to raise a puckish middle finger. “I am a sensualist,” he writes. “I understand the need to let go. ” There is a curious innocence to his pictures of drag queens and   boys snapped on trawls through the dive bars and strip joints of Lower Manhattan, which he eats up “like a deprived child. ” What makes Cumming unusual is that the powers of observation that make him a good writer haven’t canceled out the instincts for pleasure that propel him out into the world. He has advanced and found a retreat within himself, as all artists must, throwing his own   to which we are all luckily invited. Think of this book as the goody bag you get to take home afterward. “I had never seen my name engraved on a dildo before,” Cumming writes of his haul from the Fleshbot Awards. “And I had never received an award that I could potentially penetrate myself with, safely at least. ” It’s that “safely” that sets you thinking. He never does get around to finishing his father’s lawn. If celebrity is the biggest party the ego can throw, then the example set by Bill Murray takes the principle a step further, asking: Can the ego crash its own party? In THE TAO OF BILL MURRAY:   Stories of Joy, Enlightenment, and Party Crashing (Random House, $26) the Rolling Stone contributing editor Gavin Edwards tracks the mysterious   sightings of the comedian made by the public for years. The Scandinavian exchange students’ party he crashed near St. Andrews Links in 2006, where he ended up washing the dishes. The   international conference on biodiversity and conservation Murray dropped in on to talk about sturgeon. The music festival in Austin where he popped up behind the bar in 2010, pouring people tequila regardless of their order. The list goes on: a game of kickball on Roosevelt Island, a snowball fight in upstate New York. Typically, festivities end when Murray slips away with the words “No one will ever believe you. ” Edwards has saved some of us a lot of work. Murray watchers have been keeping unofficial scrapbooks of this activity for years, and like many of us, the author suspects there is more going on here than the   irrepressibility that has long lightened his forays to the golf course  —   using spectators’ sweaters to polish his balls, for instance  —   although Edwards includes these, for good measure. “Our   trickster god,” he writes, “Bill isn’t just being a clown. He has a tao, a way of being, a philosophy of life. ” Murray’s deus ex machina   are an attempt, in Edwards’s formulation, “to make real life more like the movies. ” He takes careful note of the courses in French and philosophy Murray took at the Sorbonne in the years following his “Ghostbusters” success, where he was exposed to the teachings of the   thinker George Gurdjieff, who argued that most of us sleepwalk through our waking lives it is the task of the freethinker to wake us up. There’s no record of these   calls ever being unwelcome, although one Williamsburg hipster, disgruntled to find Murray at a Halloween party with the band MGMT, does accuse him of making “poor life choices. ” The bulk of the activity postdates the end of Murray’s second marriage in 2008, but as with his screen performances, the dusting of midlife melancholy adds rather than subtracts from the stories. My favorite has Murray driving a golf cart around the streets of Stockholm with two drunken Swedes singing Cat Stevens’s “Father and Son” until they are stopped by the police. “Bill’s explanation that he was a golfer proved insufficient,” Edwards writes, which may be one of my favorite sentences in any film book this year. There have been greater, weightier testaments to the art of cinema published in 2016  —   Edwards’s book is no more than a magazine article, really, padded out with a bio of the comedian and a slightly redundant filmography  —   but for sheer dopamine release, it’s hard to beat. Tippi Hedren puts gossips out of their misery early on in her memoir, TIPPI (  $28. 99): Barely 37 pages in and here is Alfred Hitchcock, “shorter and even rounder than I was expecting,” casting the    model in “The Birds” after seeing her in a Sego commercial. What follows has long been the subject of Hollywood rumor and inspired a 2012 TV film, “The Girl,” so Hedren’s decision to break her silence on her director’s “obsessive, often embarrassingly ardent, often cruel behavior” is a significant addition to our current   conversation on sexual assault. Fixing Hedren with an “unwavering stare” wherever she went on set, Hitchcock instructed her   “Do not touch The Girl,” had her followed and  —   creepiest of all  —   had a “life mask” of her face made for his own personal use. “I’m so sorry you have to go through this,” Hitchcock’s wife, Alma, confides in her at one point. Jay Presson Allen, the writer of her subsequent film with the director, “Marnie,” pleads, “Can’t you love him just a little?” Finally, after a series of “excruciating” encounters in her dressing room and a fumble in the back of his limo, he summons her to his office and assaults her. “It was sexual, it was perverse, and it was ugly,” she writes. “I’ll ruin your career,” Hitchcock threatens upon being rebuffed, and then proceeds to do just that, denying her opportunities to appear opposite David Niven and Marlon Brando in “Bedtime Story” and in François Truffaut’s “Fahrenheit 451. ” But the rest of the book (written with Lindsay Harrison) is not without incident. Hedren marries her manager the pair grow obsessed with lions, start a small animal sanctuary in their backyard and plow every penny into a film epic starring the beasts. A decade in the making, “Roar” has the scent of genuine insanity, involving multiple trips to the E. R. after the cats attack Hedren’s daughter, Melanie Griffith the cinematographer Jan de Bont (later to direct “Speed”) and Hedren herself, who is mauled by a leopard named Pepper. “I sat on the floor with my eyes tightly closed and held perfectly still while I felt his claws on my right thigh, followed by his sandpaper tongue licking honey off my cheek,” she recalls, in slightly more detail than her mauling by Hitchcock. At least Pepper didn’t block her from working with Truffaut. Bryan Cranston’s memoir, A LIFE IN PARTS (Scribner, $27) suffers from the lopsidedness that afflicts any account of   fame  —   Cranston was 51 when he took the role of Walter White in AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” which made him a global star. But Cranston is a   storyteller, practiced enough in his skills of   to make those five decades pull their weight. Determined not to repeat the path of his father, an actor who appeared on TV shows and in a movie about killer grasshoppers before succumbing to terminal resentment, young Cranston works as a farmhand, learning the correct way to kill a chicken he sees a cadaver split open while a trainee for the Los Angeles Police Department learns how to spot shoppers from thieves while working as a security guard (“Shoppers move quickly. Thieves have a slower pace”) and is motorcycling down the Eastern Seaboard when, seeking refuge from a storm, he reads “Hedda Gabler” in one sitting. As he drifts off to sleep that night, he knows what he wants to do with his life. “I knew how he carried himself. Burdened,” he writes of Walter White, upon being sent the script for “Breaking Bad” by the showrunner Vince Gilligan, who remembered Cranston from a small role he’d given him on “The  . ” He’d also, by that point, appeared in six episodes of “Seinfeld” and seven seasons of “Malcolm in the Middle,” and was up against Steve Zahn for the role. As intriguing as the Zahn idea is, it was Cranston’s less glitzy résumé  —   the years spent doing commercials for Excedrin and Preparation H  —   that was required for the    chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin Walter White: a pinpoint study in frustrated ambition and simmering megalomania, in White’s demented liberation a lusty Gloria in Excelsis Deo for jobbing actors everywhere. Jason Diamond’s SEARCHING FOR JOHN HUGHES: Or Everything I Thought I Needed To Know About Life I Learned From Watching ’80s Movies (  paper, $15. 99) is one of those pop culture bildungsromans in the vein of Nick Hornby’s “Fever Pitch,” wherein a writer enacts an obsessive battle with a pop culture phenomenon that fills his or her sky, before finally realizing the fixation is perilous and parachuting to safety. Growing up Jewish in the Chicago suburbs, beaten by his father, abandoned by his mother, Diamond is by 15 a   punk with a   carving a Dead Kennedys logo into his desk, seeking plaintive escape in films like “Pretty in Pink,” “Home Alone” and “The Breakfast Club. ” “I wanted to live in a John Hughes film. I wanted everything to turn out just right,” he says, but wonders, “How many more times could I tell myself there’d be a happy ending?” The reader suffers from a similar curiosity. Diamond, now the sports editor at Rollingstone. com, never gets far enough into his John Hughes obsession to explain it, or why his alienation doesn’t express itself in angrier   form  —   the music of Nine Inch Nails, say, rather than the quirky but   world of Hughes. But the sweetness is telling, a sign of the strain to his nature that will eventually win out. He moves to New York, takes a job as a barista, starts an unauthorized biography of Hughes, stalls on Chapter 1 (“He’s an artist just screaming to break out,” his notes read) before finally returning to old haunts in Chicago, where he succeeds in laying some of his ghosts to rest and opening a crack of daylight between himself and his idol. I’m not sure Diamond gets enough about Hughes into the book  —   for long swaths, the title rings literally true  —   but he has successfully negotiated the writer’s most important rite of passage: He makes himself matter, first to himself and then to us. A sequel to his previous book, “How to Read Literature Like a Professor,” Thomas C. Foster’s READING THE SILVER SCREEN: A Film Lover’s Guide to Decoding the Art Form That Moves (Harper Perennial, paper, $15. 99) aims to make you “a better reader of movies. More informed. More aware. More analytical. ” Despite this lofty aim, the book is written in the   style of someone anxious to reassure his readers that they will not be left behind at any point: “Films not only have to have chemistry they’re like chemistry. Now, relax, there won’t be any lab reports. ” Foster goes in for so many of these icebreakers, each an implicit expression of the author’s confident air of superiority, that you grow a little impatient for the fruits of the wisdom whose brilliance he is so thoughtfully shielding from us. What you get is this: “Movies are motion” “If you put enough” shots “together in the right order you get a movie” “Every character has a story” and “A filmmaker can jump from place to place,” but “jumping from time to time is problematic. ” This last observation is so off the mark you wonder if the author has ever seen a movie: “Citizen Kane”? Flashbacks?  ? Elliptical editing? Every now and again, one stumbles through the fog of generalities across a piece of analysis born of simple observation: the way John Ford uses Monument Valley to frame the landscape of the West, for example, or the   cocoon of alcoves, rooms, elevators and stairwells in Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel. ” “This is a world very much like the actual world between the wars,” Foster writes, citing Ionesco. “Personal freedom is a scarce and fragile commodity. ” It is telling that Foster is at his best when he forgets his readers entirely. Brian Jay Jones’s biography GEORGE LUCAS: A Life (Little, Brown, $32) tells an   tale: how a scrawny, easily bored nerd from Modesto, Calif. resisted the lure of his cooler, more flamboyant filmmaking contemporaries to stun the world with   cinema aimed at his inner    that reshaped Hollywood overnight. The collective double take over “Star Wars” never gets old, although if it’s a definitive reconstruction of the creative spaghetti that fed into the saga you want, then Chris Taylor’s masterly “How Star Wars Conquered the Universe” is your book. Jones, who comes to Lucas from a celebrated life of Jim Henson, tells a more straightforward story in definitive detail, although you have to wonder whether Lucas is a good fit for the biographical format: a cautious, withdrawn man, bland in his tastes, his resentment toward his father driving his   fight for autonomy from the studios. So much in Lucasland seems born of peeve and pedantry, it’s a miracle the films are as ebullient as they are, but then that is the Faustian sacrifice behind “Star Wars”: All the fun, humor and adventure in its maker’s life are instead up there on the screen. Crisper pleasures await in BRESSON ON BRESSON: Interviews   (New York Review Books, $24. 95) edited by Robert Bresson’s widow, Mylène, and translated by Anna Moschovakis. This collection of interviews reveals the great French filmmaker’s own interview technique to bear more than a passing resemblance to Roger Federer’s drop shot. In shuffles a nervous interviewer to take his or her seat, stealing the odd personal observation: The auteur’s eyes are   and he speaks softly. “What was it that drew you to this subject?” he is often asked. It seems innocent enough, but this is Bresson. He thinks, then gently deconstructs the implicit assumptions about cinema contained therein, and rolls the ball back to the interviewer’s feet with a smile. “I don’t choose my subjects. They choose me,” he says. “Films should not have subjects at all. . ’u2008. ’u2008. What I’m trying to do is to come up to the edge of saying too little, in order to try to express with silence what other films express with words  —   the almost imperceptible things that happen on a face, or in a look in someone’s eyes. ” He interviewed much as he made films: by saying very little, with great eloquence.",0
18341,How Much Is Donald Trump Hurting the G.O.P.? Here’s a Way to See - The New York Times,"There is no reason to speculate about whether nominating Donald J. Trump has cost the Republican Party support in this presidential election. There is plenty of data to demonstrate that it has. Dylan Matthews of Vox showed one way of measuring the toll of choosing Mr. Trump over a candidate who more resembles past nominees. He considered the predicted election outcome for 2016 based on fundamental conditions that have long been known to affect presidential outcomes. Doing this yields a very tight race, extremely close to the   mark. The Upshot’s election forecast and other forecasts give Hillary Clinton a substantial lead, suggesting how much Mr. Trump might be underperforming an average Republican nominee from the past several decades, given how close this election was supposed to be based on fundamentals like the economy and the president’s approval rating. Another way to see what is being called the Trump Tax is to look at polling’s generic ballot question: It asks people whether they would vote for the Democrat or the Republican, with no declaration of the identity of those people. This survey question often gets a different response than a question about specific candidates  —   especially if the candidates are not yet known. That’s because respondents are typically thinking of their favorite candidate as the winner of the nomination, regardless of what the likely outcome of the nomination process will be. In the winter and spring of 2016, Republicans who were fans of Ted Cruz or John Kasich might have conjured up thoughts of a general election in November with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Kasich on the ballot  —   not one in which Mr. Trump was the nominee. These voters would have answered the generic ballot question with their favorite candidate in mind. When it grew clear that Mr. Trump was likely to be the party’s candidate, it became harder for these voters to imagine someone other than him on the ballot when faced with the generic question. That’s why data on this question give us a different kind of glimpse at the tax Mr. Trump is levying on the G. O. P. The change in results on the generic ballot question for the 2016 race reveals an interesting pattern. Data from YouGov, an online polling organization, show that once Mr. Trump began to dominate the Republican primaries in March and a concerted effort by the other candidates began  —   and then failed  —   there was a significant shift in the generic ballot results. From autumn 2015 to spring 2016, the Republican was beating the Democrat in the generic ballot question. In January 2016, for example, the spread was seven points  —   39 percent for the Democrat and 46 percent for the Republican. As it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the nominee, the pattern changed and the Democratic candidate went ahead. By the end of July, the Democrat had 44 percent and the Republican 36 percent. One way to view this reversal is as the price for nominating Mr. Trump. Similar trends do not appear to be at work on the generic ballot for the House of Representatives, suggesting two things. First, Mr. Trump’s unpopularity has not affected   races to the same degree that it has his own race. Second, the trend among the presidential race is not a general   sentiment. It is actually something specific about his campaign and most likely about him. It’s also possible, but less likely, that the change in the generic vote question is less about Mr. Trump and more about Mrs. Clinton, or more specifically, her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders. Perhaps during the Democratic primaries some independent voters thought Mr. Sanders might be the nominee, leading them to hold back from supporting the Democratic candidate until they were sure it would be Mrs. Clinton. If this were the case, however, the switch in the generic vote matchup would probably have happened later in the year when the Democratic contest was winding down. What’s especially striking is that the negative reaction to Mr. Trump by many Republican voters comes largely from his strident language in separating people into “in” and “out” groups based on race and ethnicity. Although this discourse may have achieved his goal of gaining publicity and support among primary voters during the summer and fall of 2015, it is most likely the reason he is trailing in the polls now. A Quinnipiac poll released on Thursday revealed that 59 percent of likely voters thought the way Mr. Trump talks appeals to bigotry. Given that they want to win elections more than anything else, parties rarely make catastrophic mistakes in nominating candidates for president. Because of that, it is easy to believe that who the candidates are and what they say has little effect on presidential election outcomes, especially in this period of heightened partisanship and party sorting. But they do. Just because we rarely see it doesn’t mean it isn’t real.",0
18342,CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION HAS SHIFTED THE POLLS SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRUMP’S FAVOR,"Home › POLITICS › CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION HAS SHIFTED THE POLLS SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRUMP’S FAVOR CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION HAS SHIFTED THE POLLS SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRUMP’S FAVOR 4 SHARES 
[11/1/16] MICHAEL SNYDER -Donald Trump has all the momentum now. Will it be enough to propel him to victory on election day? Trump’s poll numbers were improving even before we learned that the FBI had renewed its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails, and the new survey results that came out over the weekend and on Monday make it clear that Clinton’s “certain victory” is not so certain after all. Unless something changes, Americans are going to go to the polls on November 8th with an FBI criminal investigation hanging over the Clinton campaign like an ominous cloud, and that is very good news for Trump. 
The Clinton campaign was hoping that this renewed investigation would not “move the needle”, but unfortunately for them that appears not to be the case. Hillary’s unfavorable rating just hit an all-time high , a whopping 45 percent of all Americans believe that this scandal is “worse than Watergate”, and a Rasmussen survey has found that 40 percent of all undecided voters that are leaning toward voting for Hillary Clinton are still open to changing their minds before election day. 
And even before this story broke on Friday, Clinton was having a difficult time getting her voters to the polls. According to the New York Times , early voting among young adults and African-American voters is significantly down compared to 2012, and those are demographic groups that Clinton desperately needs to turn out in large numbers. 
But of course the key to winning the election is getting to 270 electoral votes, and poll numbers appear to be shifting in the key swing states that Trump and Clinton both desperately need. For a moment, I would like to examine what the numbers currently look like in some of the most important states… 
Florida 
Without Florida, Donald Trump has absolutely no chance of winning. This is something that even the Trump campaign has admitted. That is why it was so alarming that most of the polls in October had Hillary Clinton leading in the state. 
Fortunately for Trump, a new survey that was conducted on Sunday shows him leading in Florida by four points . 
Georgia 
Georgia wasn’t supposed to be a problem. Georgia has traditionally been a deep red state, but polling throughout this election season had shown a very tight race. This had Republicans deeply concerned and the Clinton camp very happy. 
But now the momentum has seemingly shifted and the latest poll has Trump up by seven points . 
North Carolina 
Mitt Romney won North Carolina in 2012, and Donald Trump very much needs to win it if he hopes to be triumphant on November 8th. Hillary Clinton was shown to be leading in the eight most recent polls before the email story broke, but in the first major survey conducted afterwards she is now down by two points . 
Ohio 
No Republican has ever won the presidency without Ohio, and Trump knows how important it is to his chances. The three most recent polls conducted before the FBI renewed the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails all showed a tie, but now the very first survey conducted afterwards shows Trump up by five points . 
Colorado 
Hillary Clinton has consistently been in the lead in Colorado throughout this campaign, and most experts didn’t give Trump much of a chance in the state, but the latest survey shows that Clinton’s lead has been whittled down to just one point . 
Arizona 
A survey that was conducted in mid-October showed Clinton having a five point lead in John McCain’s home state, but now the latest major poll has Trump up by two points . 
Nevada 
One of the most important swing states out west is Nevada, and most surveys showed Hillary Clinton with a strong lead throughout the month of October. Unfortunately for her, a poll that was conducted on Sunday shows Donald Trump with a four point lead . 
Clearly Trump has the momentum at this point, and it will be very interesting to see how the numbers change over the next few days. 
And as we learn more about what is in these newly discovered emails, will her fellow Democrats stick with her? Already, some are publicly wavering. The following example comes from WND … 
Longtime Clinton confidante and former Democratic pollster Doug Schoen told Fox News the newly renewed FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server is forcing him to “reassess” his support for the Democratic nominee for president. 
Schoen, a Fox News contributor, made the comments to host Harris Faulkner during a live television appearance Sunday night on “Fox Report Weekend.” 
Public opinion is shifting quickly, but the bad news for Trump is that more than 23 million Americans have already voted. So millions upon millions of Americans cast their votes before they even learned of this new FBI investigation. If the race is very close, that could end up making the difference. 
And of course the race could dramatically change once again if the FBI comes to some sort of resolution about these new emails prior to November 8th. On Monday, CNN reported that a resolution before election day did not appear to be likely… 
FBI officials are unlikely to finish their review of new emails potentially related to its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private server before the November 8 election. 
The initial work of cataloging top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s emails found on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop could be done in the next few days, US law enforcement officials told CNN. 
But the investigators are expected to spend more time doing other work, including likely working with other federal agencies to determine what — if any — classified materials are in the emails. This makes it unlikely there will be a resolution prior to the election. 
However, late on Monday evening the Drudge Report reported that the L.A. Times has learned that investigators may have a “preliminary assessment” completed “in coming days”… 
LA TIMES TUESDAY: FBI Investigators had planned to conduct new email review over several weeks. It now hopes to complete ‘preliminary assessment’ in coming days, but agency officials have not decided how, or whether, they will disclose results publicly… Developing… 
Whether good or bad, I do believe that the American people deserve to hear something conclusive about these emails before November 8th. 
If nothing is found to implicate Clinton, the American people should be told that. 
And if evidence of very serious crimes is discovered, there is no way in the world that should be held back until after the election. 
Even if it throws the election into complete and utter chaos , the American people deserve to know the truth. 
But will we get it? 
Stay tuned, because I think that this is going to be a crazy week. Post navigation",0
18343,"News: A New Era: Donald Trump Just Whispered ‘Hope You Like To Make Ham, Motherfucker’ To A White House Chef","Email 
It looks like President-elect Donald Trump is wasting no time making his mark on Washington. He’s already gotten to work appointing his new Cabinet members and laying the groundwork for his new administration. And if it wasn’t already clear that things are going to be done Trump’s way for the next four years, Donald Trump just whispered “Hope you like to make ham, motherfucker” to a White House executive chef. 
Wow! It looks like Washington is going to be a very different place under President Trump! 
Those who witnessed the encounter say that, during a recent visit to the White House, Trump caught sight of a high-ranking member of the White House kitchen, waved him over, and said, “Come here, let me talk to you a minute,” in a voice that was somehow both cordial and threatening. When the chef got close to Trump, the president-elect shook his hand, pulled him close, and began whispering that once he got sworn in, the chef would be doing nothing but cooking him ham 24/7. 
Members of the White House staff overheard the phrases “Ham is your life now, idiot” and “I don’t care what else you can cook. I only want ham” as Trump whispered to the chef, whose eyes grew wide with silent fear as he listened to what our nation’s newest president was telling him. They also say that Trump briefly smiled to wave to photographers before turning back to the chef with a dark and menacing expression on his face to continue whispering about ham. 
Now that’s the sign of a president who isn’t afraid to shake things up! 
While many Americans are deeply troubled by the bigoted rhetoric of Trump’s presidential campaign, those who voted for him as a protest against the political establishment have got to be pretty happy about a story like this one! No other president would grab a White House chef by the hand and whisper, “You live in Ham World now, motherfucker!” 
And it seems as if President-elect Trump has a concrete plan in place, as well! Trump didn’t just tell the White House chef that he wanted ham in general; he had specific types of ham that he wanted, including “baked ham,” “smoked ham all the time,” and “ham with frosting.” Trump was also overheard telling the White House chef, “You’re also going to be making something called a Pork Jackhammer, which I just invented during the limo ride over here. It’s incredibly dangerous to make, and I want to eat it every day.” 
It definitely looks like this is going to be a new era in Washington! You just know it’s not going to be business as usual in D.C. anymore when Donald Trump isn’t afraid to look a White House chef right in the eye and say, “When I ask for Chinese food, that just means soy sauce on ham. When I ask for sushi, that’s raw ham. President Trump will be eating barges of ham for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The moment I take the oath of office is the moment that your world becomes a pork-fueled hellscape.” 
People who voted for Trump wanted a maverick, and it looks like they got one! 
After about two minutes of whispering ham-related threats, Trump stepped away from the chef and began smiling and waving at the surrounding press as if nothing had happened, but his message was clear: When Donald Trump becomes president, he’s going to play by his own rules, and he’s only going to eat ham! If President Trump has his way, life in the White House might become completely unrecognizable!",0

18345,Tuscany Travel Tips From Massimo Ferragamo - The New York Times,"As the chairman of Ferragamo USA, Massimo Ferragamo, 59, the youngest son of the founder of the fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo, has strong roots in fashion, but recently, he’s unexpectedly found a second career in the world of hospitality. In 2003, Mr. Ferragamo, prompted by his penchant for Tuscan wine, purchased Castiglion del Bosco  —   an      estate in Montalcino, Tuscany  —   and spent five years transforming the property into an upscale resort. Mr. Ferragamo spends several months a year in Tuscany and spoke to The New York Times recently about his love of the region. Below are edited excerpts from the interview. What gave you the idea you to turn Castiglion del Bosco into a resort? I wanted to get involved in producing wine in Tuscany because I have always loved Tuscan wines, especially Brunellos, and a friend of mine heard that the property was for sale and took me to see it. It was a massive estate that was somewhat   and the vineyards were only 150 acres out of 5, 000. The best use of the land was to turn it into a resort, so that’s what I ended up doing. Tuscany is a   destination. What are some hidden gems? Definitely Punta Ala, a town set on the Tyrrhenian Sea. I grew up going there in the summers with my family, and it has incredible sailing and a nice beach. Then, in the countryside, there are the most charming villages around Monte Amiata, which are untouched by time, like Abbadia San Salvatore and Piancastagnaio. And around the villages you have pristine pastureland that’s rich with chestnut trees. Summer and early fall are the region’s peak tourist seasons. When do you think is the best time of year to go? September is beautiful because it’s harvest time, and the weather is pleasant. April and May are also great when it comes to weather, and November is the time to go for white truffles  —   the town of San Miniato has a great truffle fair then. I’m also a fan of Tuscany in winter  —   it’s nice to sit in front of a fire with a delicious glass of red wine at night. During the day, you can go on long walks through the countryside and take scenic drives, but without any crowds. Visiting wineries tends to be a staple activity for tourists to Tuscany. How should they pick which wineries to visit?  They should visit ones that produce   wines and have scenic estates but stick to seeing two wineries a day  —   any more and you won’t appreciate anything you saw or tasted. Ask locals or your hotel concierge what wineries they like and think are the most beautiful, or ask your friends who’ve been to the area. I like going to Duemani, which is in the Riparbella area, and also am a fan of Sassicaia and Ornellaia. Can you come to Tuscany if you don’t drink alcohol?  Absolutely. It’s a great place for fitness fanatics there is both rigorous and gentle hiking and biking there. Also, you can go to olive oil estates to taste oils. It’s also possible to visit farms that produce cheese and have fabulous meals in little restaurants that have been around a long time. If you’re into history, we have historic towns and villages, such as Pisa and Siena, and   abbeys and convents. Is Tuscany a destination for families?  Many of the hotels welcome children, especially along the coast, and offer lots of activities for them. At del Bosco, we have kids’ cooking classes and archery lessons and even get them to crush grapes during the harvest. And kids are welcome at almost any restaurant in Tuscany. Most don’t have children’s menus, but the owners will make your kids anything they want, whether it’s a simple pasta or fried chicken.",0
18346,"Fake News: NYT, WaPo Executive Order ‘Draft’ Gets 9/11 Date Wrong - Breitbart","The White House has refuted any association with a copy of an executive order allegedly drafted by President Donald Trump’s administration that inaccurately cites the date of the   attacks as “September 11, 2011. ”[Various mainstream media outlets, including the Washington Post (WaPo) and the New York Times (NYT) leaked the draft order, titled “Detention and Interrogation of Enemy Combatants. ”  House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) also said on Wednesday that the Trump administration did not write the document. “My understanding is this was written by somebody who worked on the transition before who’s not in the Trump administration. This is not a product of the administration,” the Speaker told MSNBC. The draft order “is not a White House document,” added White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday, adding, “I have no idea where it came from. ” Despite the denials from the White House and Speaker Ryan, NYT, citing unnamed Trump administration officials, maintains that the debunked document is legit and suggests President Trump is poised to lift the Barack   ban on   “black site” prisons overseas used to hold terrorism suspects. The alleged draft order “raised the prospect of reviving C. I. A. “black site” prisons like those where terrorism suspects were once detained and tortured  —   has the potential to further fracture a national security team already divided over one of the most controversial policies of the    era,” reports the Times. NYT adds: The White House disclaimed the document, which was leaked to The New York Times and other news organizations, but three [Trump] administration officials said the White House had circulated it among National Security Council staff members for review on Tuesday morning. And many of its proposals  —   which also include halting transfers out of the Guantánamo Bay prison and sending new detainees there, which President Barack Obama refused to do  —   echo years of Republican national security policy and President Trump’s own speeches. But Mr. Trump’s most extreme campaign proposal for terrorism suspects  —   bringing back torture, which the draft order does not call for but hovers over in its direction to review reinstating a C. I. A. interrogation program  —   has been disavowed by senior members of his team  …     Although NYT implies that President Trump is trying to bring back torture, it acknowledges, “Mr. Trump’s order says no detainee should be tortured or otherwise subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment ‘as prescribed by U. S. law. ’” The debunked document is littered with edits, typos, and revisions, misstating that the   attacks occurred a decade later. “Our Nation remains engaged in a global armed conflict with ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other associated international jihadist Islamist terrorist groups,” states the document. “This conflict is not of our choosing, but was declared against us by the jihadist terrorist organizations groups that have plotted and carried out mass attacks against the United States, its citizens, and its allies beginning well before the atrocities of September 11, 2011, and continuing to this day. ” NYT eventually acknowledged the errors, reporting, “It contained   phrases and typos. It said that the Sept. 11 attacks occurred in 2011, rather than a decade earlier. It was clearly not meant for public consumption. ” Nevertheless, the Times, citing BuzzFeed, doubled down on its assertion that the debunked document suggests President Trump is trying to bring back   “black site” prisons. “A draft executive order reviving   detention and interrogation policies that circulated on Wednesday is a revised version of the ‘most comprehensive’ executive action on the topic proposed for the first 100 days of a Mitt Romney White House,” reports BuzzFeed, citing an unnamed source. “The original text of the document was prepared in September 2012 by   candidate Romney’s legal and policy advisers as a potential executive order, according to a source familiar with the document who provided it to BuzzFeed News and metadata accessible in the document,” it adds.",0

18350,Mar-a-Lago Doubles Its Initiation Fee as Membership Interest Swells - The New York Times,"■ The    resort doubles its initiation fee  —   to $200, 000  —   leading to charges that the Trump Organization is cashing in on its founder’s power. ■ By President Trump’s definition of voter fraud, his senior adviser, Steve Bannon, his Treasury secretary nominee and one of his daughters could be swept up in the investigation. ■ The Twitter rebellion seems to be spreading as the Defense Department weighs in on Muslim refugees. The initiation fee at Mr. Trump’s    club in Florida  —   which the president himself has called the Winter White House  —   has doubled to $200, 000, after membership applications surged in the wake of Mr. Trump’s election, the head of membership there said. Bernd Lembcke, the managing director at the Palm Beach, Fla. club, said the change in the initiation fee had been planned last fall, before the election, and that $200, 000 had been the fee before 2010, when it was cut in half because of the recession. But Mr. Lembcke, who has been at the club for 21 years, said that it also reflected the upswing in   ’s popularity. “We have had a sudden surge in requests,” he said, adding that new members must be recommended by someone who is already a member, as is the case at many private clubs. Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a nonprofit group that promotes government ethics, said the move showed that Mr. Trump and his family intended to profit from his status as president. “At the minimum, this creates the appearance of cashing in the presidency and selling direct personal access to the president,” he said. “It is unacceptable. And it demeans the office of the presidency. ” The new initiation fee went into effect on Jan. 1, although the annual dues remained the same  —   $14, 000 a year, he said. The club has 482 members, with a cap of 500. “It enhances it,” Mr. Lembcke said of Mr. Trump’s new job and its impact on the value of the membership. “His presidency does. ” “But we are very careful in vetting them,” he added. News about the change in the initiation fee was reported by CNBC. By President Trump’s definition, his senior White House adviser, Steve Bannon, is apparently committing voter fraud. So is his nominee to be the next Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. So, apparently, is one of his daughters, Tiffany Trump. Mr. Trump was pretty broad with his definition of voter fraud when he took to Twitter Wednesday morning to request an investigation of the nefarious conduct of the 2016 electorate  —   with no evidence to support it. There is, in fact, a difference between investigating actual voter fraud and cleaning up the voter rolls. If you move states, you aren’t usually required to tell the state you are leaving that you no longer want to be on the roster. And so it goes that Mr. Bannon is registered in Sarasota County, Fla. and New York City. Mr. Mnuchin appears on the rolls of New York and California. And Tiffany Trump, should she choose, could potentially vote in Pennsylvania and New York. If she did, of course, that would be fraud. Now Melania Trump is fielding her own foreign leader calls. Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, called Mrs. Trump on Wednesday to congratulate her on becoming the first lady, according to the prime minister’s office. “The two of them look forward to seeing each other soon in Washington and to working together to strengthen the ties between Israel and the United States,” Mr. Netanyahu’s office said. Their husbands spoke by telephone earlier in the week, and Mr. Trump invited Mr. Netanyahu to visit him in Washington next month. President Trump announced that he will nominate businessman and former military intelligence officer Philip Bilden as secretary of the Navy. Mr. Bilden, who ran a private equity firm in Hong Kong until retiring three years ago, has expertise in both maritime affairs and Asia  —   two areas that are of central importance to the Navy. He was picked over an early Trump campaign backer, former Rep. J. Randy Forbes of Virginia. Mr. Bilden received a Masters of Business Administration from Harvard in 1991. First came the reposting of photos by the National Park Service that clearly showed that President Trump’s inauguration crowd was smaller than former President Barack Obama’s in 2009. That was followed by a contrite apology and lots of pretty pictures. But the national parks took up the cause, with a Twitter storm on climate change from the Badlands that was quickly taken down. And lots more: Now, with word that Mr. Trump is moving to shut down the flow of refugees and halt immigration from   nations, is the Defense Department joining the fray? Incidentally, the National Park Service now says those Twitter posts from the Badlands came from a disgruntled former employee who had commandeered the account without permission. A National Park Service official said Tuesday: No official word on why so many other parks chimed in. Mr. Trump may have thought he was being constructive when he weighed in on Chicago’s terrible murder rate, but his offer (or threat) of federal support has not gone over well  —   either with Chicago Democrats or   Republicans. Rep. Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois was miffed. But Republicans weren’t too keen on the notion of the federal government swooping into to fight city crime. The Republican media consultant Rick Wilson noted the obvious: Perhaps Mr. Trump’s motivation isn’t much of a mystery. On Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago offered the president what he called “unsolicited advice. ” “You didn’t get elected to debate the crowd size at your inaugural,” Mr. Emanuel said. “Now, obviously, I wasn’t a supporter of   Trump. He got elected to make sure that people have a job, the economy continues to grow, people have security as it relates to their kids’ education, etc. And it wasn’t about your crowd size. It was about their lives and their jobs. ” “The speech missed an opportunity to speak to our better angels as a country,” he said of the president’s inaugural address. Or maybe Mr. Trump was just watching Bill O’Reilly on Fox News. Who says former (and supposedly bitter) rivals can’t join forces in the spirit of Washington’s most unifying party  —   the “green” party? (That’s money, get it?) No emoluments clause apparently can stop the former Clinton and Trump campaign managers Robby Mook and Corey Lewandowski from hitting the road for paid gigs on the speaking circuit, which is precisely what the two will do together. Leading Authorities, a speakers’ bureau, said it is organizing the events as “ ” assessments of Donald Trump’s White House. The two will also “debate the day’s hot issues,” including cyber attacks. Mr. Lewandowski just recently set up shop down the street from the White House in a consulting and lobbying firm he runs with another former Trump adviser, Barry Bennett. Update: The speaking agency has now deleted the material from its website. A representative for the firm told Buzzfeed that the listing was generated by them and not Mr. Mook and Mr. Lewandowski. Another update: Mr. Mook says no way, he never would have agreed to this buddy show. His press aides won’t say what exactly is bothering Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but something clearly has gotten his goat. It might be that the new administration has been slow to answer requests that date back to the Obama administration. Then again, his committee still hasn’t voted out the nomination of Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. With the Trump Organization under a very public microscope, the company said Tuesday that it has appointed two monitors  —   Bobby Burchfield and George Sorial  —   to keep tabs on any ethical issues that may arise. The former has strong ties to Republican politics and the latter to President Trump. Mr. Burchfield, a Washington lawyer who has represented George H. W. Bush and the Republican National Committee, was appointed as independent ethics adviser to the Trump Organization, meaning he will advise on avoiding conflicts of interest, with the power to sign off on certain transactions. A longtime Trump Organization executive, Mr. Sorial will now be chief compliance officer, giving him a lead role in ensuring that the company complies with ethics rules and standards, while also implementing new policies. The two will assume their roles at a time when Mr. Trump has said he is trying to remove himself from the activities of the business that carries his name. Mr. Trump said during a news conference on Jan. 11 that he would place his business in a trust controlled by his two adult sons  —   but some ethics experts have chided the plan for not going far enough to avoid conflicts.",0
18351,Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents,"Tweet Widget by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
Lead kills brain cells, but it took a federal judge to order that households in Flint, Michigan, be delivered four cases of bottled water to prevent further damage to their health. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of the mass poisoning “were rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State.” One wonders, “How different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint?” Federal Judge Orders Water Delivery to Flint Residents by BAR editor and columnist Dr. Marsha Adebayo 
“ The Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint.” 
For nearly one year, EPA and state officials (and presumably the president) knew, according to Congressional testimony, that residents of Flint, Michigan, were drinking, bathing, washing dishes in lead-poisoned water, and providing formula laced with poisoned water to infants. There is little hope for Flint’s predominantly black children who have ingested, and absorbed dangerous levels of lead. The poisoning of Flint’s water supply was simply the latest act of domestic terrorism towards Africans in America. 
But, the horror of the Flint water crisis has not stopped. What has stopped is the corporate media coverage of the carnage. This week, a federal judge, David Lawson, ruled that residents of Flint who continue to face lead contamination of their water supply are entitled to delivery of free bottled water to their homes. State officials must deliver each week four cases of bottled water to Flint households that don’t have “properly installed taps.” This ruling, while important, clearly falls short of the dignity and respect Flint residents deserve. In fact, the State of Michigan, without remorse or shame, has argued against such provisions. 
“If the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water?” 
Flint residents have complained that the approximate $234 million that has been committed by the state of Michigan is inadequate to replace lead service lines, provide additional healthcare, clean water and water filters. Victims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community. In addition, the State reduced service hours and eliminated service at water supply stations altogether on Sundays. One resident complained: 
“Most of the people who’ve called [the phone service] never had people come out. It’s just not staffed.” 
The State has argued that water delivery to qualifying households is an additional unnecessary expense costing $9 million. It was this same kind of argument that led the City Manager appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder in April, 2014, to switch the city’s water supply to the polluted Flint River and then failed to require the city, because of financial considerations, to use corrosion controls to prevent lead from leaching off water pipes to private homes. If the residents of Flint were considered fully human or valued citizens why should they have to fight for the provision of clean water? As humans and citizens this is their right! The State has shown, once again, that Black lives do not matter in Flint and that residents will have to fight for life-sustaining water. 
The poisoning of Flint water should be considered an act of terror and should have been prosecuted under US terrorism laws and all involved indicted for domestic terror. But not one senior EPA or state official was fired or indicted -- criminal blame was reserved for low-level technicians. The poisoning was never treated as an “emergency” situation. In fact, until residents of Flint started to protest, federal and state officials were content to allow the poisoning to continue. 
“Victims of this crisis have voiced concern that phone lines to arrange for water delivery and staffing at water stations have proved insufficient to meet the needs of the community.” 
What this crisis has clearly exposed is that Flint was a deliberate poisoning of a low-income Black community. The perpetrators of this terrorist act were rewarded with blanket immunity and protection by the State. The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being “good Germans” as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. 

It took President Obama nearly two years to travel to Flint for what was promoted as a “briefing.” How different the reaction of the Obama administration would have been had ISIS claimed responsibility for poisoning Flint. 
The EPA had the power to issue a cease and desist order against the State of Michigan under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA Section 1431) that allows the EPA to seize control of State’s water system: 
“… Upon receipt of information that a contaminant that is present in or likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water … that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, the EPA administrator may take any action she deems necessary to protect human health.” 
According to congressional testimony by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, the EPA’s paltry excuse for not invoking congressionally mandated emergency powers was that they wanted to allow Michigan State agencies enough time to settle this matter. In the interim, women suffered miscarriages, Flint residents suffered strokes, and children developed neuro-toxic levels of lead poisoning that impact their intellectual and cognitive function. 
“ The EPA Administrator and Governor of Michigan will soon reap the benefits of being ‘good Germans’ as they leave public service for lucrative private sector positions. ” 
Members of Congress called for the resignations of both the Michigan Governor and the EPA Administrator. While Obama did not have the power to unseat an elected Governor, he has the power to fire EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy who serves at the pleasure of the president. His decision was to leave McCarthy in place presumably because of the good job she performed in Flint. What is perhaps most revealing about the background story of the poisoning incident is that President Obama, by leaving McCarthy as head of the EPA, reaffirmed his faith in her abilities to carry out the mandate of his administration, including handling the more than over 300 additional water systems throughout the country, primarily in Black and low income communities, that indicate toxic levels of lead in the water. 
History will judge that the Flint water crisis is the pathway for future genocidal acts against Africans in America just as the Tuskegee experiment was the pathway to Flint. One should note that the Tuskegee experiment (1932-1972), conducted by the US Public Health Service, consisted initially of a sample size of 399 Black men. The Flint water poisoning “experiment” (starting in 2014) consisted of a city of nearly 100,000 residents. The escalation of organized violence, such as Tuskegee and Flint should trigger a mass movement to protect African life particularly as we contemplate policies of the Trump Administration.

18352,John Kirby and the US State Department Blatantly Support Terrorists - Henry Kamens,"John Kirby and the US State Department Blatantly Support Terrorists 
Kirby and the State Department serve as apologists and white-washers for barbarism Originally appeared at New Eastern Outlook 
The US government, together with the MSM, blatantly supports terrorists. The nexus between politicians, terrorism and the media is well known to the intelligence community. However these links and cozy connections are usually written off as mere coincidence. We are told that the arms and funding which they illegally receive are but an accidental by-product of supporting “freedom fighters,” and that no one planned for these groups to be transformed into terrorist organisations. 
This is but the tip of the iceberg as nowadays Radical Islamists are now just considered as rebels by the main stream media or described as “spoilers” by the US State Department, whose main spokesman, John Kirby just recently referred to Al-Nusra in East Aleppo as a spoiler to the ceasefire in Syria . 
The way the US government and the MSM support terrorists is nothing that should come as any surprise. And this is not accidental, because a specific spokesperson has been appointed to run this media spin operation. 
Meet John Kirby – the man who will call terrorism by anything other than what it is 
Retired Rear Admiral Kirby is the official US State Department Spokesperson. He is a graduate of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, rather than the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, and holds degrees in history, international relations, national security and strategic studies. He has worked in information-based roles throughout his armed forces career, though usually speaking to the goverment rather than the public, and the steady, year-on-year increases in US military spending show he has been very effective in this role. 
Kirby was once a Pentagon spokesman. He used to be a Pentagon spokesman, well positioned to present sensitive information in non-controversial packages for mass public consumption. The Pentagon is hardly likely to tell us the truth about the things the public should be interested in: rows between generals, unauthorised or illegal actions or what the generals really think about the politicians they serve. But it has a press service regardless, so has to turn all that into something benign and equally interesting, as far as security clearance will allow. 
This is why, under Kirby’s direction, radical Islamist groups which commit acts which meet any definition of terrorism, even if you agree with their cause, are now referred to simply as “rebels” by the mainstream media, or “spoilers” by the State Department. Listen to this example: Kirby referring to Al-Nusra as a “spoiler” to the ceasefire in East Aleppo . 
He also has a neat trick for minimising terrorism: he refers to Daesh by the silly name Dash, a word Americans are familiar with from athletics, which conjures up images of educated young people in running gear rather than hooded terrorists murdering, beheading and marauding. His statements about Dash are really questionable. 
People probably think they are funny, what about those families of the beheaded people and those killed by ISIS, would they find it funny? It is sick. Readers should be disgusted with Kirby. 
Perhaps these guys think they have the terrorists controlled and managed. However when you tell the public we are at war with radical Islamists, and Al Nusra and others are on the terrorist watch list, why are these “national security experts” allowed to give them the a pass as if allies? The key is that we have allies that are radical Islamists who have attacked us and lots of others. Those allies are supporting the conflict in Syria . 
Western governments are always telling their public that we are at war with radical Islamists, and that Al Nusra and other groups are designated terrorists and will be eliminated (they are on a kill list). All kinds of actions are taken in the name of fighting terrorism, and Western soldiers are sent to die in faraway places doing it. 
So why is Kirby, presented as a “national security expert”, allowed to talk about them as if they are cuddly allies, or so insignificant that they are hardly worth the billions being spent fighting them? 
Terratwitter army 
Wars are by definition controversial, and always attract comment. Everyone has an opinion about a given conflict, and an important point, as they see it, to make. So there is always an endless stream of people who could be called upon to comment in the media. The only way to give any credibility to the contributor chosen is to present them as having some particular qualification, and Kirby’s title unquestionably gives him one. 
There will also be those up close to the action who disagree with anything Kirby says, including many of the troops the State Department has sent to fight in these conflicts. However there is more than one way to skin a cat. 
If Homeland Security wants to track down some actual terrorists then they should look at the source of Twitter feeds, and you will find all shapes and forms, many are members of the Islamist Front. It is clear that even some very prominent main stream journalists are actually supporting “rebels” by engaging with them in these learned exchanges. 
Have you ever noticed how certain articles and statements attract a large number of comments saying the same thing? These are allegedly from members of the public, and therefore by inference “neutral”, the response of the man or woman in the street rather than an interested party. However this “vox pop” system is easy to manipulate, and there is plenty of evidence this is actually happening.. 
Many of the Twitter feeds and comments about conflicts involving terrorists, allegedly from “the general public”, are actually from members of the Islamic Front, and can be traced back to them. One example is the Twitter account Monther@amirramzi. Yet mainstream journalists do not call these individuals out as such. They engage with them as if they are impartial observers whose observations prove the points made in their articles, which the commenters just happen to have read, amongst the dozens available at any given time, when they have plenty of other things to do with their lives. 
A State Department Spokesman has a long reach. You have to have a lot of weapons in place to take on the Pentagon, even in a verbal battle. Are we to believe that all these journalists are working with the Islamic Front independently, without help from above? 
Too good for their own good 
No one wants to live under a repressive regime. Consequently it is very easy to convey the notion that a “rebel” is simply a decent person fighting against injustice, as every individual likes to think they themselves are. People tend to make this connection without looking any deeper, and it takes a lot more effort than most casual observers are willing to make to go into the details of any conflict, and build a counter-narrative to the one presented by the mainstream media. 
The term “rebel” is used to cover all kinds of combatants in Syria. It includes both the “moderate opposition” and self-avowed terrorists. In order to make this fiction stand up, a lot of claims need to be made and a lot of things not reported, as they would counter the picture of a homogenous group of decent people taking a stand which is so obvious it does not need to be explained. 
It is rarely reported that the moderate opposition was persuaded to reject a UN plan to kick out Al Nusra, who are as much a threat to the ambitions of the moderate opposition as the Syrian government is. The opposition to Assad is now forcibly led by the terrorists the West claims to be fighting, because the more moderate forces have been subjected to it by the same West. This is why Kirby refers to Daesh as Dash – he is implying that the moderate forces are fully in agreement with it, and this somehow makes it something other than a terrorist group, in the same way Al Qaeda has been partially rehabilitated by saying its name over and over again until it becomes as familiar as breakfast to the reading public. 
Similarly the word “Christian” is bandied about for an American audience which is increasingly influenced by the religious right which mushroomed as a backlash to failed liberalism. Kirby and his assistants claim that Christians are being persecuted by Assad the Muslim, without going into exactly who is meant by “Christians”, and what the ramifications of holding that faith are. 
Most Syrian Christians describe themselves as Orthodox, but they are split into two very different groups. One is under the Patriarchate of Antioch, based in Damascus, and the other is under either the Jacobite Syrian church or the Nestorian Assyrian church, which have been outside the mainstream Orthodox communion since the 5th century. Politically these are very different animals – the Church of Antioch uses Arabic in its services as part of a deal with the state for protection, whereas the Syrians generally use Syriac and the Nestorians Aramaic. Nor do they receive the same protection, being treated as suspicious minorities by the Syrian state. 
It is this which lies behind the kidnapping and ongoing detention of two bishops, the Syrian Church’s Archbishop John Ibrahim and the Church of Antioch’s Metropolitan Paul Yazigi, who have been held by ISIS since 2013. This is intended to convey the idea that all Christians are the same, and all must therefore hate Assad. We are told that the whereabouts of these two bishops are unknown, but we were told the same about Terry Waite, the Church of England peace envoy who was held captive in Beirut for five years by the Islamic Jihad Organisation. 
On that occasion, with all the sophisticated weapons targeting systems and intelligence at its disposal, the West couldn’t find one captive in a city its raids demonstrated it knew backwards. Bishop Paul is the Metropolitan of Aleppo, strangely enough. 
Too many friends to be true 
The radical Islamists presented as cuddly flies in the ointment by Kirby are sponsored by external governments. We are often told that these include those of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. Many questions have been raised in Western countries about having state sponsors of terrorism as allies, and what those states’ real attitude to terrorism therefore is . Minimising the actions of these groups is therefore a domestic political imperative, not merely a foreign relations or security one, for Western governments. 
This is why Channel 4 News published the report “Aleppo – Up Close With The Rebels” on October 5th. It was an attempt to promote known war criminals and child murderers and thus cleanse their actions, and those of the governments who support them and supply them with the means of committing them. When people started recognising certain faces in the video, and connecting them to actions which had caused journalists to question the US government’s support for this particular rebel group, Channel 4 removed its own report, most unusually . It has not however changed its editorial policy, and presents other groups with similar records in the same way in spite of this. 
There is also a connection with John Kerry’s recent discussions with Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir. It is known that the 28 classified pages of the US government’s official 9\11 report, kept from public view, deal with the role Saudi Arabia played in those attacks. Now Kerry and al-Jubeir are trying to prevent the new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act from having any effect. 
If it is actually enacted, JASTA will restrict sovereign immunity and make it easier for individuals to prosecute the Saudi state over 9\11, on the basis of the official report. It will also make it easier for other countries to pass parallel legislation which will result in the US being prosecuted for its own actions. This may explain why Obama vetoed the bill, and it was only passed over his veto. 
Now Kerry is trying to fix it so that the bill never comes into effect . If it was enacted, it could have a significant effect on future conflicts by enabling those who believe the actions of a sovereign nation, such as Syria, are criminal to pursue them through legal rather than military avenues. This is the option most “moderate” groups would doubtless prefer. This gives the US military-industrial complex, the only people to profit from any war, every motive for presenting radical terrorists as reasonable, sensible people doing a sensible thing. 
Everyone wins except the future 
Most terrorist groups would be equally radical in behaviour but not be able to achieve as much if just let to their own devices, as they would have neither the weaponry nor the intelligence support. The only reason terrorists who are happy to be martyred by the Western infidels accept their support is because it somehow legitimises them, and they can hope for future favours. 
Menachem Begin, former Israeli PM and Nobel Prize Winner for Peace, was still wanted in the UK for a Zionist bombing when he attended the Leeds Castle Middle East peace negotiations in 1978, but by then enjoyed the dignity of then being a Prime Minister rather than a terrorist, because the West said so . 
John Kirby is still serving the purposes of the Pentagon by presenting terrorists as reasonable, insignificant forces. Not only is he continuing the US sponsorship of terrorism by doing this, he is justifying the billions spent on fighting this apparently insignificant threat. Now the Pentagon can have unlimited funds to spend on anything it can sell to the public. 
Isn’t this a wonderful picture once you connect the dots? “US mainstream media — the playground of spooks and hacks. A propaganda arm of the regime indeed — but that’s not nearly all of it ….” 
Seems the terrorists have jokes of their own, and they are no laughing matter. Enemies are easy to manufacture, same as “manufacturing consent”, especially when you know your audience. It is also easy to turn them into friends in the same way. All you need to do is co-ordinate the effort like a military campaign. 
Who better than John Kirby to tell us what’s what before we have the time to work it out for ourselves?  ",0

18355,Proof God is on Duterte’s Side!,"Proof God is on Duterte’s Side! 
Azzmador October 29, 2016 God gave this man three missions: Kill drug dealers – stop cussing – gas kikes! 
These days it’s not very often a nation can say their leader has the approval of the Almighty God himself, but now, the Philippines can claim this distinction. 
The Washington Post : 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has made a solemn promise: no more swearing. 
Duterte, who famously cursed the pope and used a slang term that translates as â son of a whore ” while denouncing President Obama, said he was flying back from Japan late Thursday, looking at a vast expanse of sky, listening to his colleagues snore, when he heard a voice say, âIf you donât stop epithets, I will bring this plane down now.â 
I know many of you may be skeptical of his claim, but not me. I’ve heard people claim they spoke to God many times in my life, and until now, there was always some personal agenda involved. When I was a kid, I had relatives tell me God wanted me to have a crew cut. Then there were the more famous situations like Oral Roberts saying that if his flock didn’t send him ten million dollars by a specified date, God would kill him, personally. 
Then you had guys like Ted Haggard. I’m pretty sure God told him it wasn’t a good idea to be snorting meth off the units of male prostitutes while he was the pastor of an evangelical megachurch and spiritual advisor to the likes of George W. Bush, but if so, God’s words went unheeded. 
Not so with the infamous Flip shitlord. 
âAnd I said, âWho is this?â So, of course, âitâs God,ââ he told Filipino journalists late Thursday. 
âSo, I promise God,â he continued, âNot [to] express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because [a] promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.â God’s servant on Earth, Rodrigo Duterte, contemplating the sound of one hand killing all the drug lords. 
Now there’s a man with his priorities straight. He identifies the speaker, and makes his promise, publicly, to God and his people, that he will obey. Of course, all fascists believe in a natural hierarchy, so his obedience just makes sense. 
An important thing to note is, when God speaks, what he doesn’t say is just as important as what he said. He told Duterte, “stop cussing.” Nothing more. 
Thank goodness he did not say “stop killing criminals.” I was pretty sure he wouldn’t, but you never know. What a relief… 
Of course, not everyone is theologically adept, i.e. the author of the WaPo article. She took to Twitter to make some heretical and thoroughly unfair remarks. Err, to quote @astroehlein , ""Did God mention the death squads?"" https://t.co/QezjfCweEH 
— Emily Rauhala (@emilyrauhala) October 28, 2016 
No Emily, God did not mention the death squads, and any true believer knows this means he approves of them. 
Where in the Holy Bible does it say you’re supposed to allow savage drug kingpins to wage war in your streets, killing innocents by the thousands, just so they can decide who gets to sell poison to your people and in what location? I’ve never read that part. 
I cannot confirm whether or not Emily Rauhala is a Jew, but she’s WaPo’s “China Correspondent,” and her Twitter timeline reads like someone with a personal vendetta against the fantastic leader of The Philippines. 
Whatever her problem is, she’d better get a handle on it, because in ten days we’re electing a Great Christian here as well!",0
18356,"Donald Trump, Iran, Joe McKnight: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald J. Trump continues his victory tour with a rally in Fayetteville, N. C. (7 p. m. Eastern). Earlier in the day, he fired the son of his designated national security adviser for sharing a fake news story about Hillary Clinton that led to an armed confrontation in a pizza restaurant. And Mr. Trump, who has for years flown in a jet bearing his name, proposed canceling a pending order for a new Air Force One, criticizing Boeing in a tweet that said “costs are out of control. ” _____ 2. President Obama took Air Force One to Tampa, Fla. where he delivered his final planned address on national security. The venue, MacDill Air Force Base, is home to units crucial to Mr. Obama’s fight against terrorism as well as efforts to wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The diminishing United States presence in Afghanistan offers yet more room for Saudi Arabia, which has supported the American mission there while also turning a blind eye to wealthy residents privately funding the Taliban. _____ 3. Mr. Trump has stirred controversy with foreign governments. His unorthodox phone call with the leader of Taiwan appears to be the culmination of months of effort by Bob Dole, above, who acted as a foreign agent for the country’s government. His lobbying firm was paid $140, 000 for the work. In Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said that his country would not allow Mr. Trump to tear up last year’s nuclear agreement. “America is our enemy we have no doubt about this,” he said, taking a harsh tone that signaled the intense pressure he is under from  . _____ 4. The man who admitted to shooting the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight last Thursday has been arrested and charged with manslaughter. The authorities had been deluged with criticism and insults for releasing Ronald Gasser, above, after what appeared to be an episode of road rage. In a news conference, Sheriff Newell Normand angrily rejected the idea his officers had been slow to act because the victim was black and the shooter white. _____ 5. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in two cases. Justices handed Samsung a victory in a fight over smartphone patents that may mean the company won’t have to fork over $399 million to Apple. And the court upheld prosecutors’ right to pursue insider trading charges when executives pass along tips to relatives. _____ 6. Wells Fargo has been able to stop lawsuits from defrauded customers by moving the cases into private arbitration, a secretive legal process that often favors corporations. “It’s ridiculous,” said Jennifer Zeleny, above, who is suing the bank. “This is an issue of identity theft  —   my identity was used so employees could meet sales goals. This is something that needs to be litigated in a public forum. ” _____ 7. New York will investigate whether the state’s prison system is racially biased after an investigation by The Times found that black inmates were punished and denied parole at higher rates than white ones. The Times analyzed nearly 60, 000 disciplinary cases from 2015 and interviewed inmates at prisons around the state for the series. Here’s Part I and Part II. _____ 8. The United States fared poorly, as usual, in a worldwide ranking of students’ test scores. But the latest results did show significant gains among disadvantaged teenagers. Andreas Schleicher, who oversees the test, suggested the recently adopted learning goals known as the Common Core State Standards would further those gains in the long term. _____ 9. Beyoncé received more Grammy nominations than any other artist, getting nine nods for “Lemonade,” an album and film that explored issues of race and infidelity. She’ll compete against Adele  —   who received five nominations  —   in each of the top of three categories. Drake and Rihanna each received eight nominations, and Chance the Rapper had seven. _____ 10. The hot toy of the holiday season is an interactive, furry creature that hatches out of an egg and grows up before your eyes. They’re called Hatchimals, and they are in short supply. The Canadian company that introduced the toy in October, with a suggested retail price of $59. 99, said it “had no idea that it would be this big. ” Good luck, shoppers.

18357,"After Bringing Cholera to Haiti, U.N. Can’t Raise Money to Fight It - The New York Times","When the leader of the United Nations apologized to Haitians for the cholera epidemic that has ravaged their country for more than six years  —   caused by infected peacekeepers sent to protect them  —   he proclaimed a “moral responsibility” to make things right. The apology, announced in December along with a $400 million strategy to combat the epidemic and “provide material assistance and support” for victims, amounted to a rare public act of contrition by the United Nations. Under its secretary general at the time, Ban   the organization had resisted any acceptance of blame for the epidemic, one of the worst cholera outbreaks in modern times. Since then, however, the United Nations’ strategy to fight the epidemic, which it calls the “New Approach,” has failed to gain traction. A trust fund created to help finance the strategy has only about $2 million, according to the latest data on its website. Just six of the 193 member states  —   Britain, Chile, France, India, Liechtenstein and South Korea  —   have donated. Other countries have provided additional sources of   funding for Haiti outside the trust fund, most notably Canada, at about $4. 6 million, and Japan, at $2. 6 million, according to the United Nations. Nonetheless, the totals received are a fraction of what Mr. Ban envisioned. In a letter sent to member states last month, Mr. Ban’s successor, António Guterres, asked for financial commitments to the trust fund by March 6. He also appeared to raise the possibility of a mandatory dues assessment if there were no significant pledges. The deadline came and went without much response. Mr. Guterres has not stated publicly whether he intends to push for a mandatory assessment in the budget negotiations now underway at the United Nations. Privately, however, diplomats and United Nations officials said he had shelved the idea, partly because of strong resistance by some powerful members, including the United States. Diplomats said part of the problem could be traced to simple donor fatigue, as well as to many countries’ reluctance to make financial commitments without certainty that the money will be used effectively. The donor challenge was acknowledged by Dr. David Nabarro, a United Nations special adviser who rose to prominence running its mobilization to fight the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and who has been leading its   efforts for Haiti as he seeks to become the next director general of the World Health Organization. “Donors will respond, but they need to be convinced that they’re going to be given a good proposition for what’s done with their money,” he said in January at the World Economic Forum. “The Haiti cholera story is not actually a very good one, in that it’s taken us a rather long time to get on top of it, and still the problem is persisting. ” The   effort has been further complicated by the Trump administration’s intention to cut spending on foreign aid. The United States, historically a leading source of Haiti’s foreign aid, is also the biggest single financing source for the United Nations, which may now confront painful choices over how to allocate reduced revenue. Ross Mountain, a veteran United Nations aid official who is its senior adviser on cholera in Haiti, said that a number of ideas concerning the financing were under discussion. And, he said, while “$400 million is not a very large sum, considering the circumstances, we are all very aware about the competing demands. ” Mr. Mountain also conceded that “on the financial side, we have not moved further ahead. ” Mr. Trump’s new United Nations ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, who has called the cholera crisis “nothing short of devastating,” did not respond to requests for comment about the funding problem. But in her Senate confirmation testimony in January, Ms. Haley said, “We’re going to have to make this right with Haiti, without question, and the U. N. is going to have to take responsibility. ” Cholera, a waterborne bacterial scourge that can cause acute diarrhea and fatal dehydration if not treated quickly, has killed nearly 10, 000 people and sickened nearly 800, 000 in Haiti, the Western Hemisphere’s poorest country, since it was introduced there in 2010 by infected Nepalese members of a United Nations peacekeeping force. This year, as of late February, nearly 2, 000 new cases had been reported, amounting to hundreds a week. Studies have traced the highly contagious disease to sloppy sanitation that had leached fecal waste laced with cholera germs from latrines used by the Nepalese peacekeepers into the water supply. “We still have the biggest outbreak of cholera of any country anywhere,” said Dr. Louise Ivers, a senior policy adviser at Partners in Health, an international medical aid organization that has long worked in Haiti. “Here we are, nearly seven years later, and it’s still a big problem. ” Compared with other disasters confronting the United Nations, like the Syria refugee crisis and famines threatening 20 million people in Yemen and parts of Africa, the Haiti crisis may not loom as large. But unlike the others, the direct cause in Haiti was traced to the United Nations. This fact weighed on Mr. Ban until near the end of his tenure. He finally acted after the organization’s independent investigator on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, said in a scathing report that the United Nations’ failure to take responsibility for the cholera crisis was “morally unconscionable, legally indefensible and politically  . ” But Mr. Ban’s apology for Haiti’s cholera epidemic also clearly reflected an assumption that all members were responsible for the success of the new strategy to defeat it. “For the sake of the Haitian people, but also for the sake of the United Nations itself, we have a moral responsibility to act,” he told the General Assembly on Dec. 1. “And we have a collective responsibility to deliver. ” Advocacy groups that had been somewhat heartened by Mr. Ban’s words have grown increasingly anxious not only about the lack of money, but also about the lack of clarity in how the “material assistance and support” part of the plan, which represents half of the $400 million goal, will be used. Two leading advocacy groups for Haitian cholera victims, the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux and the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, sent a letter on Thursday to Mr. Guterres, requesting a meeting and expressing concern that “the current trajectory of   and elaboration of the New Approach is betraying the U. N.’s promises of a meaningful and accountable response in Haiti. ” Lawmakers in the United States critical of the United Nations’ response in Haiti have also put pressure on the organization. “While the U. N. has admitted to wrongdoing and promised to create a fund to provide restitution to the people of Haiti victimized by cholera,” Representative John Conyers Jr. Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement last week, “they have failed to make good on these promises. ”",0
18358,"WATCH: Cops Rob Every Penny from Family, Including Children For Legal Med. Marijuana Dispensary","Be Sociable, Share! Youtube screenshot 
San Diego, CA — James Slatic took every precaution possible to ensure his California medical marijuana business was in full compliance with local, state, and federal laws — and that appropriate taxes and fees, hundreds of thousands each year, were always paid on time. 
But despite conducting business professionally and legally, nearly 30 heavily armed San Diego police and DEA agents broke into and destroyed Med-West Distribution, stole all the legal products inside, confiscated his computers and servers — and proceeded to clean out his entire family’s life savings, including the accounts of his high school and college-aged daughters, and his 84-year-old mother’s safety deposit box. 
By obstinately refusing to acknowledge Med-West’s legal status, law enforcement used highly contentious federal civil asset forfeiture (CAF) law to rob the Slatics of everything they’d earned — including $324,000 in proceeds from the lucrative medical cannabis business, according to the Institute for Justice (IJ). 
“This case is not about crime fighting,” IJ attorney Wesley Hottot, who now represents the Slatics, explained. “This case is about policing for profit, and it illustrates the abusive power of civil forfeiture at its worst.” 
As countless families and individuals around the country have been shocked to learn, the State can rob you blind, taking everything of value — bank accounts, vehicles, electronics, and even houses, etc. — without proof any crime has been committed. 
James Slatic has never been convicted or charged with any wrongdoing in the matter — but the nightmare of civil asset forfeiture doesn’t end with a lack of charges or conviction. In fact, attempting to reclaim property and cash can be a nightmare of red tape, court appearances and legal fees — and, even then, isn’t always a successful venture. And like so many others, Slatic had not been familiar with this legal, policing-for-profit scheme prior to his firsthand encounter. 
“I’ve done nothing wrong,” he told the Institute for Justice. “It’s beyond frustrating that my family’s money was taken without any criminal charges being filed. My wife and teenage daughters had nothing to do with my business whatsoever, and the District Attorney took their college savings accounts. This is not just wrong; it is unconstitutional.” 
While he certainly might be right, CAF is federal law — a brief reprieve in January, when the Department of Justice suspended the program, only lasted through early April — because the ability of police to steal people’s stuff and either use it or the proceeds from its sale is just too damned profitable. 
Indeed, police and other agencies — particularly the Drug Enforcement Agency — make a killing in this legalized State robbery sham, and many departments have come to rely on CAF profiteering to bolster their funding. 
“Civil forfeiture is one of the greatest threats to property rights in the nation,” said IJ attorney Allison Daniel, also representing the Slatic family. “Civil forfeiture takes the American principle of innocent until proven guilty and flips it on its head, treating property owners worse than criminals by making them prove their innocence.” 
At 7:30 in the morning on January 28, 2016 — as surveillance cameras outside and inside Med-West captured on video — the San Diego Joint Narcotics Task Force used a sledgehammer to break down the door of Slatic’s legal business, and stormed in, pointing automatic weapons at the heads of innocent employees inside. 
Needlessly and recklessly, around 28 officers took everything of value inside, destroying and scattering property in the process. 
As Slatic told IJ, in addition to assets stolen from the business, the greedy cops cleared family bank accounts of over $100,000 — leaving his daughters scrambling to pay for school supplies, like college textbooks, while putting their tuition and fees in jeopardy. 
Annette Slatic, James’ wife, who works as a nurse at the Veterans Administration, found out about the raid and financial seizure when she tried to pay for groceries that morning and had her card declined. Then her daughter, Penny, a high-schooler, tried to pay using her ATM card — and was also declined. Without notice, the Slatics suddenly found themselves essentially penniless and unsure how to afford basic needs. 
Now they’re fighting to get everything back, since under California law, “probable cause” a crime has been committed must be established before officers can use civil asset forfeiture to seize property and cash. 
As the Institute for Justice explains, “Because police and prosecutors ignored Med-West’s status as a legal marijuana business, they did not have probable cause to seize the Slatics’ money. Even if Med-West had been an illegal operation (and it was not), the Slatics’ personal money is not connected to the business.” 
Perhaps the Slatics will have better luck in getting justice than innumerable others who have been unfortunate enough to be victims of legalized robbery. 
Despite massive controversy surrounding the program — and one of its creators now denouncing the policing-for-profit scheme it has become — civil asset forfeiture won’t be going anywhere soon. 
While some states have severely curtailed cops’ ability to take your stuff, by implementing strictures requiring a conviction and similar limits, others have taken CAF to new levels. Oklahoma Highway Patrol began using a device called an ERAD , which scans bank and prepaid cards — right from a person’s wallet — to seize all cash in an individual’s account during a traffic stop if an officer even suspects a person of committing a drug-related offense. 
“Three decades ago, I helped create our civil asset forfeiture system,” wrote Brad Cates in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal , “now it’s time to end it.” 
This is what it’s like to run a legal business, pay taxes, and follow the law in a Police State:

18359,AIDS epidemic in Russia: 'Crocodile' addicts of the 1990s to blame?,"Print version Font Size The authorities of the city of Ekaterinburg announced the outbreak of AIDS epidemic. According to physicians, as many as 26,693 cases of HIV infection have been officially reported in the city, which accounts for 1.8% of the city population.The Sverdlovsk region of Russia is the leader in terms of the number of HIV patients. In general, the human immunodeficiency virus has affected 20 regions of Russia. Billions of rubles are allocated to struggle against the deadly virus.Interestingly, however, Ekaterinburg officials subsequently rejected the information by saying that the ""the epidemic of HIV was declared in the city by mistake.""""In our region, there are many penal colonies, where the rate of HIV infection is high, - first deputy head of Ekaterinburg Health Department Tatyana Savinova said. - In addition, the population coverage for HIV tests in the Sverdlovsk region makes up 23%, while in other regions, at least 15% of the population are tested for HIV.""Ekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman believes that the epidemic has broken out because of heroin and ""crocodile"" addict s of the 1990s.Pravda.Ru asked Director of the Federal Methodological Center for Prevention and Control of AIDS, a leading Russian scientist who devoted 20 years of his scientific activity to HIV infection problems, Vadim Pokrovsky, to comment on the situation. ""Ekaterinburg is a million-strong city, but they talk about the AIDS epidemic in such a large city in the 21st century. How can it be possible?""""In fact, this is a common process in all of Russia. Ekaterinburg is not the only Russian city with a high level of HIV infection incidence. There are many other cities, such as Irkutsk, Samara, Chelyabinsk, and even St. Petersburg, where one percent of the population is infected.""The epidemic has affected the whole country, and one should say it out loud instead of putting it in a vague form. This is an epidemic .""""Most citizens contract the infection through the use of drugs. Yevgeny Roizman, the mayor of Ekaterinburg is known as the founder of ""City Without Drugs"" foundation. How can one solve the problem? ""The problem could be about Mr. Roizman or other narcologists, who do not recognize methods of effective prevention of HIV infection in these groups of the population. In Europe, the transmission of the HIV infection via syringe needles was stopped due to needle exchange programs and substitution therapy. This is the only method that makes it possible to stop the epidemic among drug users.""Yet, Russian specialists believe that one should at first cure drug addiction , before proceeding to the HIV infection. All Russian drug addicts will be infected by that time, if it ever happens. It is vital to curb the HIV infection before eradicating drug addiction."" Pravda.Ru",0
18360,"""Для Порошенко главные ветераны войны — бандеровцы""","0 комментариев 0 поделились Фото: АР 
Впервые эта дата в государственном календаре праздников появилась в 2009 году. Какое значение событие имеет сейчас для страны, рассказал Pravda.Ru украинский политолог Владимир Скачко. 
— Что этот день означает для нынешней украинской власти? 
— Означает то, что в головах нынешних украинских властей не поддающийся лечению когнитивный диссонанс. С одной стороны, они проводят декоммунизацию, обвиняют Советский Союз, в составе которого была Украинская Советская Социалистическая Республика, в развязывании войны. И прославляют ОУН-УПА, союзника гитлеровского вермахта. 
А с другой стороны, сегодня они, во главе с президентом и премьер-министром, возлагали цветы к монументам, поздравляли еще живущих ветеранов, вообще жителей страны, в том числе и тех же бандеровцев, с праздником освобождения от немецко-фашистских захватчиков. 
Украинская власть никак не может определиться — она потомок советских победителей, или все-таки гитлеровских прихвостней? Тут сложно что-то комментировать. Это чисто политически игра — гнусная, циничная, можно даже сказать, подлая. 
Таким образом, украинская власть пытается оправдаться перед теми людьми, которые действительно спасли Украину от фашизма, и которым последние 2,5 года усиленно плюют в душу. Даже не плюют, а вываливают целые составы нечистот. 
— То есть это такой ""черный день"" для администрации Порошенко? 
— Да почему ""черный"", эти люди абсолютно беспринципны. Они одной рукой поглаживают бюст Адольфа Гитлера, другой — поправляют усы на бюсте Иосифа Сталина. Если это приносит им дивиденды, позволяет удерживаться во власти и дальше грабить эту несчастную страну. 
Порошенко поздравлял ветеранов УПА и назначил День защитника Отечества на день создания УПА. У нас день рождения этой огромной зондеркоманды является Днем защитника — 14 октября. И буквально через две недели он поздравляет тех, кому стреляли в спину. Это политическая шизофрения — размером в целую страну. 
Напомним, ранее Pravda.Ru писала, что Верховная Рада Украины приняла Декларацию памяти и солидарности парламентов Украины, Польши и Литвы по событиям Второй мировой войны. Данный документ не только возлагает на СССР вину за начало Второй мировой войны, но и утверждает, что Ялтинские соглашения лидеров антигитлеровской коалиции, закрепившие победу над фашизмом, стали основой ""порабощения всей Восточной и Центральной Европы"". 
""Пакт Риббентропа-Молотова от 23 августа 1939 года, заключенный между двумя тоталитарными режимами — коммунистическим Советским Союзом и нацистской Германией, привел к взрыву 1 сентября Второй мировой войны, вызванной агрессией Германии, к которой 17 сентября присоединился Советский Союз. Следствием тех событий была оккупация Польши Германией и Советским Союзом, a в 1940 году — советская оккупация Литвы, Латвии и Эстонии. Следствием этого стали массовые репрессии против наших народов"", — цитирует документ украинское издание ""112"".

18363,Holiday Movies to See (or Skip) - The New York Times,"Make your movie list, check it twice and master your multiplex. Below, we’ve sifted through the many movie options this season to give you a few ideas on what to go see (and what to avoid) over the holidays. For Families With Young Kids This funny jukebox musical has elephants and porcupines belting out the latest pop songs in total “American Idol” style. It is likely to keep the young ones engaged. And that pig in the track suit singing Lady Gaga should make audiences of all ages giggle. In his New York Times review, Glenn Kenny called it “relentlessly amiable. ” For Families With Older Kids This one is not a tough sell. If they haven’t seen it yet, your kids are probably eager to check out the first   movie in this franchise. Since it opened last week, it has been pleasing longtime “Star Wars” fans and helping generate new ones (despite a highly unfavorable review from The Times’s A. O. Scott). It doesn’t shy away from intensity, yet delivers the action and thrills you’d expect to find in this galaxy far, far away. For an Evening With Friends You’ll probably not want to venture out with the family to this dark thriller, but if you’re looking for a movie that will appeal to you and your friends, this film  —   part pulpy thriller and part contemplative drama  —   will be of interest. Tom Ford directed, and Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal star. In her review, Manohla Dargis wrote that the film contains “moments of   pleasure. ” For an Afternoon With Grandma This uplifting historical drama focuses on the female   mathematicians in the NASA space program who were integral in helping John Glenn become the first American to orbit the Earth. Funny, rousing and poignant, it’s kind of film that multiple generations will value. In his review, A. O. Scott wrote, “There is something to be said for a   tale with a clear moral and a satisfying emotional payoff. ” For a Reminder of How Much Family Matters Bring the tissues. This harrowing drama is based on the true story of a boy who gets separated from his family and very, very lost. His emotional search years later for his family will make you want to cling a little more tightly to yours. “If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child  —   or a mother  —   this movie will wreck you,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review. For Couples It has Oscar buzz. It has critical love. (A. O. Scott said it “succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a   fable. ”) But at the end of the day, it’s just plain   entertainment: a  ’  ’ tale of romance that should make for a fine night out with the one you love. Movies to Watch at Your Own Risk Your heart may have been warmed in the past by Will Smith holiday films like “The Pursuit of Happyness. ” But based on what the critics are saying so far, this one is more like “Seven Pounds. ” With a Rotten Tomato certification currently in the teens, this drama about a man who can’t cope with a family tragedy had our reviewer Manohla Dargis calling it a “waste of talent and time. ” Jennifer Lawrence. Chris Pratt. What could go wrong? According to the critics who have been weighing in on this   space romance, a lot. If you’re drawn to the charisma of the leads, understandable, but be forewarned that much ink has been spilled on the problems with the film’s narrative. Our critic Stephen Holden writes that in the end, it “becomes a banal, formulaic pastiche of dozens of other   space operas. ”",0
18364,Regretful Brexiter realises he actually just really missed old Top Gear,"Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Thomas Gane Regretful Brexiter realises he actually just really missed old Top Gear 
A previously passionate and angry Brexiter has realised he never really wanted to leave the European Union, and actually just had a lot of pent-up feelings about Top Gear . 
Simon Williams, 32, stayed in on Friday evening to watch the first episode of Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond’s new series, The Grand Tour , on Amazon. 
Following the programme he was surprised to find himself horrified at the Brexit stories that he had up until this moment aggressively supported. 
“After I watched The Grand Tour I felt amazing,” he explained to reporters. 
“It was like reaching an itch I’d been desperately trying to scratch for a year and a half.” 
“Then I checked the news and it was awful. Leaving the EU is going to have some really horrible consequences for our country, and I think I supported it because I had a lot of unresolved feelings about Top Gear . 
“Looking back, I think I actually just wanted to hear Clarkson talk about political correctness, steak and Argies, and the Brexit rhetoric was a surrogate for that. 
“It’s a little embarrassing actually” he added. “My mates in the Whatsapp group are feeling the same. Is there anyway we can take it back?” 
Professor Scott Chegg from the University of Bristol said this conforms to the ‘safety-valve’ theory of politics. 
“In the same way a lefty might read The Guardian or watch a documentary about cetaceans with anxiety issues to feel better about themselves without changing anything, it seems Top Gear was a way for people to let their right-wing grievances out in manageable chunks,” he told us. 
“Without Top Gear , the pressure built to a dangerous level before exploding as Brexit. 
“It’s like a man who feels very angsty for an unknown reason, starts drinking, gets into a fight, sets his house on fire and steals a car before driving it off a cliff,” Professor Chegg explained. 
“If he’d just had a wank and gone to sleep everything would have been fine.” 
Reports from social media suggest a similar wave of stomach crushing realisation is happening in America as The Grand Tour gains traction there. 
At the time of writing, Mr Williams was ordering Article 50 For Dummies on Amazon Prime. 
“I spent £70 on it,” he said. “Best use it for something else.” ",0

18366,"France Lets Workers Turn Off, Tune Out and Live Life - The New York Times","PARIS  —   If the world does not envy the French enough already for their generous vacations, universal health care and fine food and wine, the arrival of 2017 brings this: a newly created “right to disconnect. ” Though ridiculed in some quarters as a ban on   email after hours, it is not quite that. But it is born of the enlightened view that it is actually beneficial for people not to work all the time, and that workers have the right to occasionally draw the line when their employer’s demands intrude on evenings at home, treasured vacations or Sundays with friends and family. “Employees are more and more connected during hours outside of the office,” Myriam El Khomri, the minister of labor, said last year in justifying the need for the law. “The boundary between professional and personal life has become tenuous,” and cases of burnout are becoming more prevalent, she said. The measure is one of a raft of new laws that took effect with the beginning of the new year and that exemplify the search for compromises between preserving French traditions and making concessions to the realities of the modern world. The new provision in the labor law does not ban   emails, but does require that companies with more than 50 employees negotiate a new protocol to ensure that work does not spill into days off or   hours. Some consultants have recommended that employees and managers avoid the “reply all” function on emails to groups so that only one person is being asked to read an email and respond, rather than half the office. Another approach recommends setting a time each evening after which employees are not expected to reply  —   several firms have designated the 10 hours between 9 p. m. and 7 a. m. others the 12 hours between 7 p. m. and 7 a. m. As a country with Catholic roots, but also a commitment to personal liberties, France has had an ambivalent approach to divorce. It has long been legal, but not necessarily speedy. A new nod to modernity in French laws eases the rules for people who want to divorce. While historically France has been far more flexible than Ireland or Italy, it still required a judge to rule on each divorce. The procedure routinely took as long as a year, and sometimes far longer, because cases were backed up awaiting the judicial signature. Now, if both members of the couple agree on the divorce, lawyers can draw up the divorce agreement, jointly sign the papers and have them notarized. No judges need be involved. Smoking is another area in which French habits have changed relatively little in recent years  —   27 to 28 percent of the population still lights up  —   but the country is now following many others in requiring “neutral packaging” for tobacco products: Instead of advertising a brand, cigarette packs sport only health warnings and photos of illnesses caused by smoking. At least two new laws demonstrate the country’s gradual move toward more sustainable products. Instead of thin plastic bags, French supermarkets and fruit vendors must substitute either bags made with a   synthetic called amidon that is mixed with plastic, a thicker type of plastic bag that could be reused, or paper bags. At Monoprix, a supermarket chain, paper bags have won out and stacks of them perch precariously on stands at the ends of fruit counters. More radical is the edict that went into effect on Sunday banning the use of pesticides in public gardens and along public highways. It promises to make public green spaces safer for birds and other small animals, which are especially vulnerable to the poisons used in pest killers. It will not be easy for the gardeners employed by cities to turn to more sustainable methods. When the city of Lyon abandoned pesticides voluntarily nine years ago, it took quite some time to change the culture, although Lyon is now considered a model. In 2019, the antipesticide law will expand to include amateur gardeners  —   a challenge not only for the French with backyard rows of dahlias and daisies, but also for those who nurse roses in their window boxes. A new   law is sure to please the French because it plays to their immense pride in local comestibles: It allows prepared foods, like frozen dinners, to be labeled “produit d’origine française” only if the item is made with 100 percent French meat or milk. Any product with more than 8 percent foreign meat must say where the animal was born, raised and butchered. A product with more than 50 percent foreign milk must say where it was collected and turned into the product being sold. It seems that the French version of “Made in America” is “Raised in France. ”",0

18368,Russia Is Quietly Winning the Middle East — and Nobody Is Talking About It - James Holbrooks,"Originally appeared at Anti Media 
As fighting resumes in Aleppo following a brief ceasefire — and as Russia’s largest naval fleet to sail since the Cold War steams down the English Channel on its way to the western coast of Syria — it’s important, in times when most of the focus is being drawn to one point, to step back and look at the whole board. 
Yes, what’s happening in Aleppo is a tragedy. Civilians, women, and children are being blasted out of existence as two superpowers back opposing sides in a proxy war for regional dominance. Yes, as the Russian fleet nears the Mediterranean Sea, tensions will undoubtedly escalate for a number of nations with ties to the Syrian conflict. 
But President Vladimir Putin’s moves regarding Aleppo are far from his only ones worth noting of late. 
Take Turkey, for instance. Last week, Underground Reporter posited the idea that Turkey, due to its deteriorating relations with the United States and its strengthening cooperation with Russia, has, in effect, become the military wild card in the Middle East. Cited as evidence of deepening Russian-Turkish ties was the fact that the two countries have just signed a deal to build a pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine, which would then supply natural gas to Europe. 
Turkey, which is north of Syria, shares much of its southern and all of its eastern border with the Mediterranean Sea. A good portion of Syria’s western border also runs into the Mediterranean, and it’s in those waters where Russian vessels, already hovering there, await the arrival of the aircraft carrier-led fleet now pushing through the English Channel. 
All this fits nicely into a narrative that only focuses on what’s happening in Aleppo. But one need only glance at a map to see, using nothing but the eyes and common sense, just how much more is actually taking place right now. 
In mid-October, it was reported that, for the first time ever, Russia and Egypt would conduct joint military drills. This followed news that Russia will sell attack helicopters to the North African nation and invest billions in Egyptian infrastructure. These items, along with the fact that Egypt is eager to be re-granted Russian tourism rights for its citizens after recent bad blood between the countries, lead one to the logical conclusion that Egypt has every incentive to cooperate with Russia going forward. 
Egypt, in case you’re not looking at that map, is directly across the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey. 
This means when the Russian fleet reaches the Mediterranean — whether the intent is to park in those waters and bombard Aleppo, as some believe, or merely to project Russian might to the world, as others suggest — it will be flanked by friendlies on three sides. Turkey to the north, Syrian to the east, and Egypt to the south. 
This is not a bad position to be in if you’re looking to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine. Turkey, incidentally, shares its northern border with the Black Sea, which in turn shares its southern border with Ukraine. And the Black Sea, as those who’ve followed the Ukrainian situation in recent years well know, is swarming with Russian warships. 
So, in the bigger picture — assuming Turkey will eventually fully embrace the Russian sphere and that Egypt, as it’s highly incentivized to do, embraces its new role as a Russian satellite — Putin has protected himself quite deftly from those in the West who’ll inevitably, no matter what the fleet does once it arrives, accuse Putin of aggression. 
Turkey and Egypt are both formerly staunch U.S. allies, after all, and there’s been no official severing of ties, or even hintsof such, with those nations. So Putin, thanks largely to the West’s own hegemonic maneuvering, has a lot of room to operate in terms of deals and cooperation — both militarily and economically. 
In any case, the facts present a narrative — albeit a theoretical one — that isn’t being discussed. Putin, as we speak, may be implementing the first phases of an effort to secure a nice straight shot from Turkey to Ukraine for the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline.

18369,Swedish Pensioner Prosecuted for ’Hate’ for Accusing Migrants of Arson,"A    Swedish woman in Dalarna is being prosecuted for hate speech after claiming on Facebook she saw migrants defecating in the streets and setting fire to cars. [According to the prosecution, the woman “expressed a disparaging view of refugees” on Facebook. She stands accused of having taken to the social media website in early July 2015 to make the “derogatory” post, alleging that migrants “set fire to cars, and urinate and defecate on the streets”.  Prosecutors in Sweden say the woman’s message violates the nation’s law on incitement to racial hatred (Hets mot folkgrupp, or HMF) a crime with carries a maximum penalty of four years. The accused admitted that she wrote the post but denied committing any criminal act. The evidence against her consists of a screenshot from Facebook, according to local media. People took to Flashback, the net’s largest Swedish language forum, to criticise the state’s decision to prosecute the pensioner, with one poster lamenting the accused “has fallen into the clutches of the politically correct”. A user with the screen name ‘Nospheratu’ pointed out that the original idea behind HMF was “to prevent   propaganda by political parties” against demographic groups, with lawmakers “having 1930s Germany in mind” whilst passing laws. The user slammed the law for being used to “prosecute old ladies on the bus” criticising immigrants. Another slammed Sweden for hypocrisy, accusing the nation’s media and politicians of condemning restrictions on freedom of speech and expression in other countries “while themselves engaging in the worst kinds of witch hunts of dissidents”. Sweden’s Justice Minister Morgan Johansson cited freedom of speech when he rejected Gothenburg police chief Erik Nord’s suggestion that the country deports Islamic   migrants, after the Islamist terror attack in Stockholm last month. “We have freedom of speech in Sweden. This means people have the right to hold repulsive opinions here,” said Johansson. “But there are always limits  …     For example when it comes to hate speech,” added the minister, who called Nord’s policy suggestion “problematic” and demanded the police chief “explain himself”.",0
18370,"[WATCH] Univ Of Alabama Students Try To Protest National Anthem, Then A Veteran Shows Up","0 comments Do you think that this Veteran’s actions were wrong? I think that #BAMASITS student protesters are a bunch of BLM Hippie whiners! Way to go, Colin Kaepernick! Your actions as a millionaire whiner in the National Football League have now influenced the young minds of young students at college football games. These kids are not even equipped with enough mental toughness to consider basic issues. You believe that your actions will help them to create a better life? Evidently, protesting the National Anthem is a fad that is not quite ready to die. One recent iteration can be found at the University of Alabama, where students use the hashtag #BAMASITS in an attempt to draw attention to their cause. These little babies have the right to protest, but like many who have a liberal mindset, they are only tolerant of others who share their views. If you stand up for your own views, as this Veteran did, you are behaving in ways that are “outside of your rights.” One representative of #BAMASITS, Emerald Vaughn, described the group like this: “#BAMASITS is a peaceful protest. We are protesting social injustice. We support underrepresented LGBTQ community and people of color against discrimination and we’re also protesting against police brutality.” Fine, Emerald. Have your protests. One question, though: What is wrong with a Veteran of the United States military standing during a game and sharing his own views? Teddi Badami, an Air Force Veteran, decided that he would do just that. Video has surfaced of the #BAMASITS crowd protesting the National Anthem at Bryant-Denny Stadium, prior to the Texas A&M game, when Badami stood in front of their protest with his hand over his heart. Badami simply stood and sang along with the words of the National Anthem. “I politely stood up to ask him, could you move and he said he was a veteran. I respect veterans, I don’t have anything against veterans but I felt like you shouldn’t try to invade and bully your way. That was total disrespect and disregard of our protest,” said Vaughn. Clearly, Badami does not feel that way. Take a look at video footage of the event, below: #bamasits says a veteran interrupted their peaceful protest, the vet says otherwise.

“I stood there with my hand over my heart and sang the national anthem loud and proud. I made no comments to any of the individuals other than I stand for the national anthem and that I served our country,” Badami said. 
“I felt that it was disrespectful, he can have his own, whatever his points that he wanted to make, he could have did that on his own. People fight over, they fight our wars with veterans for us to have the right to sit or stand for the national anthem,” Vaughn said. 
Badami says he and his friend returned to their seats after the anthem but were temporarily detained by campus police. 
Detained by campus police? Give me a break!",0
18371,Corporate Army smashes Dakota barbarians near lucrative pipeline,"Corporate Army smashes Dakota barbarians near lucrative pipeline By hatesec , on October 28th, 2016 Faceless marauders crushed a Native Rebellion on Friday that threatened to impede construction of a sweet new oil pipeline across the Northern US. 
Citing unfounded claims that oil pipelines leak into water supplies , opposition forces escalated their protest into a mounted assault that led to the injury of at least a few of their horses. 
The sheriff’s department participated in the defense, having pledged allegiance to the neoliberal javelin of law, and vowed to smash savagery at its root, even if it means cleansing. 
“Ethnic cleansing is not a word I like to use, because it evokes images of holocaust and genocide,” he said. “But we must leave all options on the table.” 
Dakota Access Pipeline is projected to be profitable as FUCK and totally keep oil prices low as shit, y’all, so chill. Get those bad thoughts out of your heads. It’s gonna be DANK once that fucker gets built. I’m talking $1.99 per gallon until something like 2020! 93 octane!

18372,Russophobia is intellectually imploding,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 29, 2016 We witnessed the collapse of Iraq and Libya. Syria was supposed to be next, but the process was clearly stopped by Russia. Vladimir Golstein …by Jonas E. Alexis and Vladimir Golstein 
Vladimir Golstein holds his M.S. in computer science from the Moscow Institute of Management, his B.A. in Philosophy from Columbia University, and his Ph.D. in Slavic Languages and Literatures from Yale University. His scholarly interests embrace Russian culture, religion, philosophy, and poetry of the past two centuries, as well as the current foreign policy issues. He is currently Professor of Slavic Studies at Brown University. 
Golstein is putting together two scholarly monographs: one on the conflict of generations in Russia and another on the use of musical communication in a literary text. His recent study is Lermontov’s Narratives of Heroism (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2012). He is well-known in the scholarly world. [1] His articles have been featured on Forbes , The Nation , the Kyiv Post , Al Jazeera , and other news outlets. [2] 
JEA : In your recent article, you write that the mass media and its “ newspaper titles sound like a commercial for the upcoming Invasion of the Body Snatchers sequel. The Washington Post announces: ‘Russia Is Now a Threat. The US Should Treat It Like One.’ Time magazine raises the stakes: “Russia Wants to Undermine Faith in the U.S. Election.” 
Why all this propaganda? Is it because Putin is obliterating ISIS in Syria? If the United States made a deal with the famous mass murderer in the twentieth century (Joseph Stalin), how is it that United States cannot come up with a reasonable solution with Russia? Unpack those issues for us. 
VG : Unfortunately, the old and necessarily skills of diplomacy, along with the concrete knowledge of Russia and its capabilities, have been thrown out of the window during the last twenty years or so. The US, happy with its dominant position, has decided to deal with other countries in the form of dictates, orders, and directives. It was presumed that other countries, like Russia, were simply not in the position to resist or negotiate, so why bother. 
Consequently, we have a bunch of rather ignorant ideologues in the State Department, and equally ignorant scriveners in the mass media, who simply act upon the latest policy paper received from the top floor and then spin it to the public. 
When this policies encounter a setback, like in the situations with Georgia in 2008, or Ukraine in 2014, and now Syria, the only thing this crowd does is to throw a fit, in the manner of the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power . 
What drives these histrionics is the real failure to access the situation properly and negotiate with Russia. There is a strong conviction among the policy makers in Washington that Russia lost the Cold War, and therefore should know its place. 
Russia’s refusal to play along clearly throws a monkey wrench into the schemes cooked up by the State Department and its think-tanks. Yet, they cannot come up with any new viable policy, resorting to the same strategies and the same accusations that has already failed them. 
So the frustration associated with failure appears to be the main reason for the recent wave of Russophobia. However, one should add that once this wave has been raised, a lot of people want to ride it. 
Hillary wants to ride it into the White House, blaming her opponent on being on cozy terms with Russia; Pentagon and NATO want to ride it, in order to justify its expansion; newspapers want to ride it, because having enemy and decrying its faults is good for business; economists and politicians want to ride it, because it serves as a distraction from the failing economy. 
JEA: You cite flaming Neocon Max Boot saying that “Our democracy is under attack by Russia, but almost no one is treating the situation with the gravity it deserves.” Boot is the Neocon hoodlum who admitted that the United States has been supporting the Syrian rebels/terrorists through Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan. [3] 
Elliott Abrams, another Neocon, conceded the point that the Jihadists in Syria have committed serious terrorist crimes. [4] But that again does not bother Boot at all. Why is that? Why do these people always want to spread bloodshed all over the Middle East? Haven’t enough people died already? 
It appears to me that what drives these people is the desire to weaken the Middle East, or at least, these parts of it, that don’t want to play along with Washington. Whatever it takes to weaken a government of such resisting country is fine for these policy makers: it might be terrorists, or religious fanatics, as long as they create tensions within the country, it is fine for these neocons. Consequently, we witnessed the collapse of Iraq and Libya. Syria was supposed to be next, but the process was clearly stopped by Russia. 
Russia recognized what was in store for Syria, because it has already witnessed the same scenario being unfolded during the so-called Arab Spring. During the Arab Spring the legitimate grievances of an educated pro-western group of people were harnessed to the militancy of the religious zealots in order to overthrow the government and produce civil strife. 
Furthermore, Russia witnessed the neocons’ modus operandi succeeding in Ukraine, when the fanatical nationalists from the Western Ukraine joined the naïve, English speaking youth, and orchestrated the putsch in Kiev, ousting the legally elected president, and installing the power willing to follow western “recommendations.” 
Frustrated and insulted by this radical regime change on its own border, the regime change that resulted in thousands deaths and more than a million refugees from the Eastern Ukraine who refused to follow the orders from Kiev, Russia has decided that enough is enough. It just simply can’t afford to let US and its coalition to dismantle all Russia’s former allies and friends. 
Neocons, it should be stressed, did not invent this strategy; they seem to follow the old maxim of Zbigniew Brzezinski, that any ally is good as long as it helps in weakening and defeating Russia. Thus, the ally was found: Osama Bin Laden and his group of radicals, ready to take on the Russians in Afghanistan. 
What also is rather curious is that the US finds it difficult to deal with the civic governments, be it in Afghanistan, or Lybia, or Iraq. They prefer to enter into the contact with the religious fanatics, allowing them to pursue their religious dreams, while US companies introduce their materialist policies and controls over the natural resources. 
The division of labor so to speak: fanatics pray or chop heads, while US companies count their profits. The civilian government, on the other hand, might want to take control over resources, as they tried to do in Iran in 1953 , [5] or might try to have their independent foreign policy; both of these aspects seem to be unacceptable to the neocon policy makers. 
JEA: Israel’s Defense Ministry Amos Gilad once made the claim in 2013 that there is a growing presence of al-Qaeda elements among the so-called Syrian rebels, and those jihadists are “waiting for the opportunity to take over the state.” 
But Gilad absolved himself from any moral responsibility by saying that this element is a very small price to pay, particularly “with the menace posed by the Iran-Syrian-Hezbollah axis before the Syrian civil war…” 
Gilad unapologetically said, “with all due respect to that threat, [the al-Qaeda element] is not the same threat as one posed by Iran, Syria and Hezbollah together, which is much more difficult.” [6] 
Why would these people prefer to sleep and commune with terrorists in the region as opposed to making a reasonable deal with Russia? Doesn’t that mean that these people are completely mad and are not acting on a rational point of view? And doesn’t it suggest that that Russophobia has no moral and political ground and is therefore imploding? 
VG: I find Israel to be as obsessed with Iran as much as the US does. Frankly, I cannot understand this obsession and paranoid fear. Consequently, Israelis appear to be more afraid of Iran than of the violent and murderous fanatics that have already destroyed two countries and continue to terrorize several more. Israel’s rivalry with Syria is also dictated by this fear of “hostile” Iran taking over Syria, thus threatening Israel through the Golan Heights. 
Iran, historically, have been very friendly with the Jews, [7] so I don’t see any reasons for Israel not to try to negotiate with both Iran and Russia (and Turkey) for the lasting peace in the Middle East. 
Furthermore, I am sure that there are a lot of people in Israel who understand that. But they also understand that the powerful alliance between Saudis and United States does not want that. These two countries, Saudis in particular, don’t want to see Iran succeed anywhere. And Israel, since it depends on the US for its giant military aid, is not in the position to challenge Washington. 
So to keep its military aid from the US flowing, Israel is forced to play the role of the attack dog against Iran. Consequently, I believe that the tensions and violence in Middle East will continue until Saudis and the US continue to treat Iran in the same manner as the EU and the US continue to treat Russia – as some sort of a rogue state, rather than a legitimate powerful country with its own proud history, culture, political system, and international interests. 
JEA: Great assessment. With respect to Iran and the Jews, the entire Zionist media and the propaganda industry have it completely wrong. For example, Ciamak Morsadegh, a newly elected Iranian and Jewish parliamentarian in the country, debunked Benjamin Netanyahu and the Zionist Mafia by saying: 
“Benjamin Netanyahu and the anti-Semites need each other: they supply each other with what they need – intolerance and hatred. It is an unspoken alliance which suits them, but it causes great harm to the rest of us.” [8] 
Netanyahu himself has capitalized on this “unspoken alliance,” otherwise he would not have said the following right after the 9/11 attack: 
“We are benefiting from one thing, and that is the attack on the Twin Towers and Pentagon, and the American struggle in Iraq.” [9] 
All those wars in the Middle East, added Netanyahu, “swung American public opinion in our favor.” [10] Back in 2001, the New York Times itself reported: “Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister, replied, ‘It’s very good.’ Then he edited himself: ‘’Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.’” [11] 
If that is not diabolical, then nothing is. As we have reported elsewhere, the war in Iraq alone will cost America at least six trillion dollars, [12] and that doesn’t even include innocent civilians and decent people who have lost their precious lives in the process. [13] 
Like John Milton’s Satan in Paradise Lost , Netanyahu and indeed the entire New World Order system have adopted an essentially diabolical ideology which basically says, “Evil, be thou my good.” [14] What we are seeing again and again is that the Ayatollah Khomeini was right on target when he launched the “Great Satan” to describe the covert activities of the Zionist Mafia.

18373,"The Most Important Primary Is ... Wait, Indiana? - The New York Times","Join us for New York primary live updates. It may be Indiana or bust for Donald Trump. If the polls are right, he will dominate in New York on Tuesday and in the coming races across the Eastern Seaboard. He could win nearly all of the delegates at stake  —   keeping him on a narrow path toward the Republican nomination. That would set him up for what will probably be the most important test of the race: Indiana on May 3. It may sound strange, but when you start gaming out the rest of the primary contest, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that his quest to reach a majority of delegates before the convention could all turn on Indiana. If you divvy up the states by expected results, Mr. Trump wins big in the East and West Virginia, loses the    rural Western states, and earns his expected share of proportional delegates in Washington, Oregon and New Mexico. That puts him about 175 delegates short of the required 1, 237. Only two real tossup states remain: California (172 delegates) and Indiana (57). You can see the basic issue: If he doesn’t win Indiana, he has to sweep California and get some lucky breaks elsewhere, which isn’t realistic. He would need an upset in a state like Montana, in a region that has been hostile to him. But even though Indiana may be pivotal  —   it awards its delegates on a    basis by congressional district and statewide  —   the state is a big mystery because there hasn’t been a single poll there. That’s not just because of East Coast media bias (although it may be part of it) it’s a tough state to poll. Indiana law prohibits automated polling, the   method for many   pollsters. The state does not have party registration, which makes it modestly more challenging and costly for pollsters to conduct surveys of the voter registration file. Many of the prolific public pollsters employ the   dialing method, like Quinnipiac, and have no history in the state. I suspect that a few pollsters will ultimately field surveys, but there won’t be many. At first glance, the state looks as if it should be a good one for Mr. Trump. It’s a mostly   state with   educational attainment among white voters, which has been a strong correlate for Trump support. He has run well in states along or near the Ohio River, including Illinois, Missouri and Kentucky. He lost Ohio, but it was John Kasich’s home state. Mr. Trump also won Michigan, which borders Indiana to the north. According to an Upshot demographic model of Mr. Trump’s support, Indiana is perhaps a tick beneath his national average  —   he’s estimated to win around 40 percent of the vote, compared with the 43 percent support he holds nationwide. It’s not a state like Wisconsin, where Mr. Trump was in obvious danger. That state is better educated than Indiana, it has higher marriage rates, and it has more voters with an ancestry rooted in predominantly Protestant countries in northwest Europe, all factors that have hurt Mr. Trump in prior contests. The problem for Mr. Trump is not that Indiana’s a tough state for him it’s that it’s a better state for Ted Cruz than many of the more liberal states in the Midwest. And it’s a worse state for Mr. Kasich. A more consolidated   vote would give Mr. Cruz a far better chance of victory here than in Illinois or Michigan. The split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich is always tough to predict. But in general, the   vote breaks along the lines of cultural liberalism and conservatism. Mr. Cruz does better (and Mr. Kasich does worse) in areas with more evangelical Christians, more white Republicans and fewer people with postgraduate educations. Mr. Cruz also does better in areas that look more like the “traditional” Republican Party  —   conservative areas with more families and married couples and people whose heritage is Protestant northwest Europe. Many of these factors have hurt Mr. Cruz in the blue states of the Midwest. He has often finished third in more liberal places like the Detroit or Chicago metropolitan areas. It’s also why he’s poised to fare poorly in the Northeast. But Mr. Cruz has not had this problem in less liberal metropolitan areas in the Midwest, like Milwaukee Grand Rapids, Mich. Kansas City, Mo. and St. Louis, or in   cities in central Illinois like Springfield, Peoria, Bloomington or  . Mr. Kasich was no threat to Mr. Cruz in these areas, and indeed Mr. Cruz wound up beating Mr. Trump in most. The Indianapolis area is somewhat more like Milwaukee, St. Louis, Kansas City and Grand Rapids than Detroit or Chicago. Most obviously, the Indianapolis area  —   and the state of Indiana  —   is conservative and tends to vote Republican. That’s underpinned by the demographic characteristics of the state: It’s more evangelical, less educated and, in particular, has fewer people with postgraduate degrees. The tilt toward evangelicals and conservatism should allow Mr. Cruz to do better in Indiana than he did in Illinois or Michigan. It could be more like Missouri, which was almost a tie, or North Carolina, where Mr. Trump won by a slight margin. Mr. Trump also won by a slight margin in Illinois outside of the core of the Chicago metropolitan area. That might still seem like a bleak precedent for Mr. Cruz. But the upside for him is that all of those contests occurred before Marco Rubio left the race. The results in Utah and Wisconsin suggest that many of Mr. Rubio’s remaining voters broke to Mr. Cruz. In Wisconsin, it was probably most of them. If the same story plays out in Indiana, Mr. Cruz will probably win the state. The Upshot’s   model estimated after the March 15 primaries that Mr. Trump would win Indiana, 41 percent to 37 percent, over Mr. Cruz, with Mr. Kasich at 14 percent and Mr. Rubio at 8 percent. Mr. Cruz would then become a clear favorite there  —   similar to what happened in Wisconsin  —   if he won the preponderance of Mr. Rubio’s voters or benefited from a slide in Mr. Kasich’s support. And indeed Mr. Cruz now has a slight edge in the same demographic model, 43 percent for Mr. Cruz to 40 percent for Mr. Trump, with 16 percent to Mr. Kasich, after adding the results from Arizona, Wisconsin and Utah and adding a variable to account for the absence of Mr. Rubio. But the split between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich in Indiana should be considered nothing more than a rough guess. The same approach estimated that Mr. Kasich would win 21 percent of the vote in Wisconsin in the end, he won just 14 percent and Mr. Cruz ran up the score. Mr. Cruz could easily gain at Mr. Kasich’s expense again  —   especially if he receives   endorsements from trusted conservative figures, the way he did in Wisconsin. But there’s downside for Mr. Cruz. Mr. Kasich seems set to post a series of relatively strong showings in the Northeast, which could give him new strength heading into Indiana. Indiana also abuts Mr. Kasich’s home state, Ohio, and that could help him as well. Mr. Kasich did a bit better in the southern part of Michigan and in the northern part of Kentucky, areas bordering Ohio, than one would have guessed from demographics alone. Even if Mr. Kasich proves as weak as Mr. Cruz hopes, Mr. Trump could still win. Mr. Trump figures to be around 40 percent of the vote  —   and if it’s a few points on the higher side of that, which is certainly possible, it will probably be enough for him to beat even a relatively strong Mr. Cruz. The bottom line is that it’s very hard to be confident about Indiana forecasts. My guess is that we still wouldn’t be confident even if there were polls because it’s hard to see a large advantage for any candidate. What’s clear is that if Mr. Trump wins Indiana, the drama continues on to California if he doesn’t, even California almost certainly won’t be enough for him to secure the nomination by primary season’s end.",0
18374,"‘Lula,’ Brazil’s Ex-President, Is Charged With Corruption - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Federal prosecutors in Brazil filed corruption charges Wednesday against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the former president who has wielded influence across Latin America for decades, portraying him as the mastermind of a sprawling graft scheme intended to maintain his party’s grip on the presidency. Deltan Dallagnol, a prosecutor, called Mr. da Silva the “ultimate commander” of bribery and kickback schemes that allowed his leftist Workers’ Party to build coalitions in Congress, describing him as “the general” at the helm. The actual charges against Mr. da Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010, focus on a much narrower claim: Prosecutors accuse Mr. da Silva and his wife of illegally receiving about $1. 1 million in improvements and expenses for a beachfront apartment paid for by a large construction company seeking public contracts. But beyond the specific charges, which must still be accepted by a judge, the prosecutors said Mr. da Silva had been instrumental in a bigger corruption scheme that has thrown Brazil’s political system into turmoil for more than two years. In their complaint on Wednesday, prosecutors contended that Mr. da Silva had overseen a   system of illicit payments, kickbacks and campaign donations in which the construction company O. A. S. paid as much as $26 million to obtain contracts from Brazil’s oil giant, Petrobras. The prosecutors did not claim that Mr. da Silva personally pocketed that money. Instead, they asserted that it went to oil executives, Workers’ Party leaders and lawmakers in the governing coalition to help maintain the party’s grip on power. The prosecutors are now demanding that Mr. da Silva return that amount of money to public coffers. The charges and broader allegations are a major blow to Mr. da Silva, adding to a mounting list of legal problems that have complicated his ambitions of returning to the presidency. Just a few years ago, Mr. da Silva, a former labor leader who never finished elementary school, ranked among Brazil’s most powerful politicians. His party held the president’s office for 13 years, overseeing a period of brisk economic growth during which millions were lifted out of poverty. But bribery scandals and a severe economic crisis have tarnished his legacy, ending with the ouster of his handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was removed by the Senate in August in a contentious impeachment trial. Prosecutors in São Paulo had already filed corruption charges against Mr. da Silva at the state level in March, arguing that he had sought to conceal his ownership of the apartment. Mr. da Silva will also stand trial on charges of obstructing the investigation into the bribery scheme surrounding the national oil company, Petrobras, a federal judge ruled last month. Nearly 40 politicians and business leaders have been jailed since prosecutors discovered the Petrobras scheme in 2014. In all, investigators say that contractors paid nearly $3 billion in bribes to executives at the oil giant, who pocketed some of the gains while also channeling funds to politicians in the governing coalition led by the Workers’ Party. Mr. da Silva and his lawyers have repeatedly said that he did nothing illegal in relation to the apartment in Guarujá, a seaside city near São Paulo. But investigators said O. A. S. a large Brazilian construction company, had illegally paid for a series of improvements at the property. Prosecutors also filed corruption charges against the former chief executive of O. A. S. Mr. da Silva’s lawyers, Cristiano Zanin Martins and Roberto Teixeira, said in a statement that the charges and the broader allegations “attack the democratic rule of law and the intelligence of Brazilian citizens,” and that their client was innocent. The charges were filed after months of simmering tension related to Mr. da Silva’s legal battles. Federal Police agents raided his home in March and briefly held him for questioning. After that, Ms. Rousseff, the president at the time, offered him a cabinet post that would have given him broad legal protections from being jailed. But Brazil’s Supreme Court blocked the nomination. Rui Falcão, the president of the Workers’ Party, described the latest charges as an effort to hamper Mr. da Silva’s involvement in politics. Mr. da Silva has signaled that he plans to run for president again in 2018, and polls have placed him among the leading contenders. “These charges were expected as part of an effort to criminalize Lula,” Mr. Falcão said. The amount of money that Mr. da Silva is accused of receiving in the form of an apartment upgrade pales in comparison with what others have been accused of pocketing in recent years. Eduardo Cunha, the conservative former speaker of the lower house of Congress, who orchestrated the effort to oust Ms. Rousseff, is charged with taking as much as $40 million in bribes and laundering them through an evangelical megachurch. And Sérgio Machado, a former chief executive of a Petrobras unit who was a member of the centrist party of Brazil’s new president, Michel Temer, has agreed to return more than $20 million in bribes. Brazil’s entire political system is struggling to react to the steady drip of charges and revelations from various bribery scandals. The new administration of Mr. Temer, the former vice president who engaged in a bitter power struggle with Ms. Rousseff, is facing dismal approval ratings and doubts about its legitimacy after various cabinet ministers were forced out of their posts over reports that they were seeking to stymie corruption inquiries. Mr. Temer’s former attorney general, Fábio Medina Osório, claimed over the weekend that he had been fired after seeking damages from construction companies involved in the Petrobras scheme. Mr. Medina Osório told the magazine Veja that Mr. Temer’s government was seeking to “smother” the inquiry, which is popularly known as Car Wash, after a gas station in Brasília that a   money dealer used to launder bribes and kickbacks. Heightening the sense of distrust, some figures involved in the scheme have been secretly recording one another, with the idea of using the information to reach plea deals with prosecutors.",0
18375,"Duke: Bannon, Flynn, Sessions: the 1st Steps in Taking America Back!","Editorial by Dr. David Duke – 
Trump appoints men who will take America back! 
President-elect Donald Trump’s appointment of Bannon Flynn, and Sessions are the first steps in the long and arduous project of taking America back. 
Trump Chief Strategist Bannon has repeatedly exposed the vicious war on White people on his Breitbart website. 
National Security Head Flynn realizes that America’s foreign policy has been downright traitorous with the support of the radical Jihadists of Saudi Arabia, over our natural allies the Christian, Muslim and moderate secularists of Syria. He also understands that Putin of “Christian Russia” should not be our enemy but our ally. He is an avowed enemy of the Jewish warmonger traitors called “Neocons” and they in turn intensely hate this U.S. Army General who truly puts America First. 
Attorney General Sessions has been hated for years by the Jewish-dominated media for his opposition to massive immigration into America and for the fact that he has dared to publicly oppose the massive, institutionalized racial discrimination against white people called affirmative action. 
During his U.S. Senate confirmation hearings Senators should demand that he expose the blatant media and political blather of “equal rights and opportunity” when white people face massive racial discrimination as well as a media hate campaign against the people whose ancestors created America! 
We must demand the protection of the civil rights of all Americans including white people! Everyone must be judged on their merit and not the unfair and destructive anti-white affirmative action racist policies that dominate major corporations, Federal, State, and city governments, colleges and educational institutions.

18376,The US May Soon Face an Apocalyptic Seismic Event,"Today, an ever increasing number of earthquakes in the United States may soon bring the country to ruin, as geologists, journalists and politicians say. 
Via UsualRoutine 

The University of Washington has already presented seismological charts showing a gigantic geological rift that stretches across the central states of the US from north to south, and marks the region of a possible split of the North America continent in two. As it has been reported by geologists, for the first time this anomaly was discovered in 1960’s, when scientists found a strange underground rupture along the Lake Superior that would run south. The discovery surprised American scientists back then since there were no mountains in that area. Following studies showed that this anomaly was stretching across the whole continent, resembling in its form and shape the giant cracks in the east of Africa.
It’s been reported that the tectonic plate beneath the southeastern regions of the United States is being fragmented by the layers of earth above it, which may be the cause of future earthquakes in the Washington area and other cities on the east coast, where basically no preconditions for the emergence of aftershocks, according to Live Science.
According to Berk Biryol from the University of North Carolina, in recent years the Washington area and the areas around other large cities in the east of the country faced a pretty intense seismic activity, which at first puzzled seismologists since the east of the country is residing on a stable continental crust that must prevent any earthquake from occurring.
In recent years, the relationship between fracturing and the mounting number of earthquakes has been brought to light by the US Geological Survey (USGS), that would note that the number of earthquakes in the US has increased drastically over the last six years. In fact, it expects an abrupt increase in the number of seismic events in some regions of the country where fracturing is being used including Oklahoma, California, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, Ohio, Alabama and New Mexico.
But the split in the United States is not being predicted by the USGS alone, since the recent seismic political events aggravated the growing discord within the US society in the wake of the US presidential campaign.
Western journalists are sounding the alarm – America’s youth is now fascinated with the concepts of socialism and communism. According to the poll conducted by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC), a half of all Americans under 35 years would love to be represented by a socialist president. Politicians who profess capitalist views doonly receive the support of 42% of the younger American generation. This explains the spectacular rise of DNC’s Bernie Sanders which would most certainly become the next president, if Hillary didn’t use her wealth and connections to replace him as the sole Democratic candidate.
The German newspaper Tagesspiegel points out that this election campaign “undermines the belief that most Americans share the idea about living in a democratic and constitutional state.” The newspaper notes that there’s been a lot of speculations about the possible armed resistance to the “US corrupt government system” lately, no matter how unlikely the future post-election violence may look now.
The latest poll conducted by USA Today and Suffolk University shows that only 40% of potential voters strongly believe in the peaceful transfer of power after the US presidential elections. With six in ten viewing the candidates unfavorably, Clinton andTrump are the two most unpopular presidential candidates in ABC/Post polls dating to the 1984 election. This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,165 likely voters.
The level of antipathy towards the two main presidential candidates in terms of party affiliation has also been at staggering level, with 97% of Trump supporters despising Hillary Clinton and 95% of Hillary’s loathing the Republican presidential candidate.
It’s no wonder that there’s been a rapidly increasing number of petitions on the separation of various states, which refer to the Declaration of Independence, where the Founding Fathers explicitly stated that “any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it” To date, the petitions on the separation from the US have been filled by a total of 40 states. Texas that is viewed as the last bastion of conservatism has already gathered more than 100 thousand signatures under its petition for obtaining the status of an independent state. Behind it are Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee.
Therefore, aside from the major geological rift that may soon hit the US, there’s a deep social and political rift to be observed, which may, in case of loss of all confidence in the existing political system result in a major outbreak of violence.
Earth has already witnessed the existence of two supercontinent – Rodinia and Pangaea. First, the former continent formed about 800 million years ago, until the latter one appeared some 600 million years later. Scientists expect that in the future a new supercontinent will be formed that has it own name already – Amasia. This continent will be formed out of the modern North America and Asia, notes the Nature.
Who knows, maybe before Amasia even emerges we will witness a new state or even two that would replace the US?

18377,An Open Letter to the Woman Who Told My Family to Go Back to China - The New York Times,"Dear Madam: Maybe I should have let it go. Turned the other cheek. We had just gotten out of church, and I was with my family and some friends on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. We were going to lunch, trying to see if there was room in the Korean restaurant down the street. You were in a rush. It was raining. Our stroller and a gaggle of Asians were in your way. But I was, honestly, stunned when you yelled at us from down the block, “Go back to China!” I hesitated for a second and then sprinted to confront you. That must have startled you. You pulled out your iPhone in front of the Equinox and threatened to call the cops. It was comical, in retrospect. You might have been charged instead, especially after I walked away and you screamed, “Go back to your fucking country. ” “I was born in this country!” I yelled back. It felt silly. But how else to prove I belonged? This was not my first encounter, of course, with racist insults. Ask any   and they’ll readily summon memories of schoolyard taunts, or disturbing encounters on the street or at the grocery store. When I posted on Twitter about what happened, an avalanche of people replied back to me with their own experiences. But for some reason  —   and, yes, it probably has to do with the political climate right now  —   this time felt different. Walking home later, a pang of sadness welled up inside me. You had on a nice rain coat. Your iPhone was a 6 Plus. You could have been a fellow parent in one of my daughters’ schools. You seemed, well, normal. But you had these feelings in you, and, the reality is, so do a lot of people in this country right now. Maybe you don’t know this, but the insults you hurled at my family get to the heart of the   experience. It’s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day. That no matter what we do, how successful we are, what friends we make, we don’t belong. We’re foreign. We’re not American. It’s one of the reasons that Fox News segment the other day on Chinatown by Jesse Watters, with the karate and nunchucks and broken English, generated so much outrage. My parents fled mainland China for Taiwan ahead of the Communist takeover. They came to the United States for graduate school. They raised two children, both of whom went to Harvard. I work at The New York Times. Model minority, indeed. Yet somehow I still often feel like an outsider. And I wonder if that feeling will ever go away. Perhaps, more important, I wonder whether my two daughters who were with me today will always feel that way too. Yes, the outpouring of support online was gratifying. But, afterward, my    who witnessed the whole thing, kept asking my wife, “Why did she say, ‘Go back to China?’ We’re not from China. ” No, we’re not, my wife said, and she tried to explain why you might have said that and why people shouldn’t judge others. We’re from America, she told my daughter. But sometimes people don’t understand that. I hope you do now. Sincerely, Michael Luo",0
18378,"Stepping Out on Faith, a Blind Man Counts His Blessings - The New York Times","His routine is the same every day. Before going outside, Leroy Bracey recites Psalms 121, a daily reassurance that God is   protecting him wherever he goes. Mr. Bracey has myopic degeneration, a congenital retinal condition that has worsened his vision with age, especially in recent years. Navigating New York City’s streets has become increasingly treacherous. “People and locations are like a fog, a blur,” Mr. Bracey, 49, said. “I don’t see faces, unless I’m really close and I can smell your breath. ” He has had close calls with cars, even more with bicycles, only to be saved by the blaring of horns or screeching of tires. A few times, he said, a sixth sense has halted him. As a way to preserve his freedom, Mr. Bracey carries around three tools: a small telescope worn around his neck, used to spot street signs and locate bus stops a magnifying glass kept in his pocket for reading and in his hand, a folding cane. “These three things I carry with me just like my wallet,” he said. “I want to sustain as much independence as I can. ” Blindness is not his only limitation. Mr. Bracey has been homeless since March. He has a temporary home at the St. Anthony Shelter for Renewal in the Bronx, an affiliate of Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. Before that, he lived with his mother. But their relationship grew too turbulent for Mr. Bracey to stay with her. His steadfast companion is his Bible, a   edition he keeps in his knapsack. The Gospel is his source of boundless solace and solutions. It reminds him that God will always make a way, and, he says, he is a recipient of God’s grace. After arriving at St. Anthony, Mr. Bracey was connected with multiple social services, including programs for the blind and the homeless. Catholic Charities Guild for the Blind has provided him with a caseworker and enrolled him in employment training classes. Mr. Bracey has worked several jobs, including in telemarketing and sales, but he has been out of work for several years. Of   adults who are blind, only 40 percent are employed, according to the National Federation for the Blind. The Bible tells him he deserves the chance to contribute in some way, recalling 2 Thessalonians 3:10: “For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: Anyone unwilling to work should not eat. ” “I would love to work,” Mr. Bracey said. Unable to find employment, Mr. Bracey’s monthly income comes in the form of assistance: $235 from Supplemental Security Income, $518 from Social Security, $87 from New York State disability and $189 in food stamps. His top priority is to secure permanent public housing for people with disabilities. His name is on waiting lists. In August, Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York used $324 in Neediest Cases funds to pay for a MetroCard and three months of phone and laundry bills. Not one to sit idle, Mr. Bracey takes to the streets daily, though he tends to stay in areas he knows, usually around 14th Street near his eye doctor, whom he takes the bus to visit every other month. “I never liked to be told I couldn’t do certain things,” he said. “I know my heart, I know my mind and I know my faith. ” During the past few months, his vision has continued to deteriorate as objects now appear even more blurry, but Mr. Bracey said he had never felt safer about town, thanks to a cane the Guild for the Blind gave him a few months ago. “I thought it might slow me down or make me feel, in my mind, less than what I am,” he said. “But it’s given me more confidence. ” It also serves as a warning to drivers and bicyclists who he may not notice. The change in seasons brings new constraints. As the days get shorter during fall and winter, the lack of sunlight limits his independence. He does not stay out after dark and avoids the dimly lit subway system, venturing underground only to refill his MetroCard to use on the bus. “I prefer having stronger faith than stronger vision,” Mr. Bracey said. The Bible reminds him to remain hopeful, despite his setbacks. He often turns to the plight of Job, who suffered greatly only to be blessed by God in the end. “I know God has something great in store for me,” Mr. Bracey said.",0

18381,When Fake News Was Funny - The New York Times,"THE DAILY SHOW (THE BOOK) An Oral HistoryBy Chris SmithIllustrated. 459 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $30. After an election in which facts could be oh so elusive, it’s instructive to look back to 2003. That’s when several “Daily Show” staff members heard a speech from President George W. Bush that directly contradicted things the presidential candidate George W. Bush had said about foreign policy. It dawned on them to pull old tape and set up a mock debate in a split screen: Bush versus Bush. It was a breakthrough for Jon Stewart’s show. “If we, as basically stoner comedy people, could remember it, how was it possible that the actual media couldn’t remember it, or didn’t care, or didn’t think it was important?” Ben Karlin, a former producer of the show, says. That’s one valuable anecdote in this exhaustive oral history, which traces the   sprint that turned “The Daily Show” from a   cable presentation into a vital institution in American politics and the media. The book, compiled by the New York magazine contributing editor Chris Smith, rides through moments of history like the 2000 recount, Sept. 11, the 2004 election and the Obama years, explaining how all of it altered and refined “The Daily Show” with Stewart at the helm. As in other   show tales, the best stories here involve contract talks. And the book breaks plenty of news. It reveals that in 2012, negotiations for Stewart and Stephen Colbert  —   whose show “The Colbert Report” followed “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central  —   became so tense, both stars temporarily quit. The appointed villain is Philippe Dauman, former chairman of Comedy Central’s parent company, Viacom. Colbert was ready to stay through the 2016 election, but Dauman refused. (That worked out well for Colbert, who in 2014 was hired to replace David Letterman on CBS. “Thank God they said no,” he says.) Stewart also blames Viacom for botching the chance to sign John Oliver as his replacement before Oliver left for his successful HBO show. But delicious stories like these  —   the lifeblood of any oral history  —   can also be fleeting. When the journalists James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales paired up to compile oral histories of “Saturday Night Live” and ESPN, there were tales of sex and drugs. But “The Daily Show” was a different animal. “The drug stories are pretty lame,” Elliott Kalan, a writer on the show, tells Smith. “The sex stories are pretty lame. ” The “Daily Show” staff was, instead, mostly  . There are allusions to unhappiness in the writers’ room because of Stewart’s autocratic rule, with one producer saying “plenty of people” would describe Stewart as a tyrant. But the producer in question wasn’t one of them, and only rarely does any actual bitterness spill onto the page. Instead, there’s space dedicated to grindingly banal details like how morning and afternoon meetings were crucial to the show’s success. One producer is quoted discussing the pride she took in organizing a staff clambake and wine tasting. The book’s tone can be a bit   too. After “The Daily Show” wins one of its first Emmy Awards, Smith writes that despite their commercial and critical success, “Stewart and the staff, to a remarkable degree, stayed focused on the task of creating 160 or so shows each year. ” Still, the book is a valuable reminder of the show’s role in introducing an era of     in American politics. Producers recount seeing a politician lie on CNN, only to have the reporter respond, “Well, we’ll have to leave it there”  —   a   occurrence. “The Daily Show” ran a segment holding both the politician and the network accountable. “I think Jon’s joke was, ‘Don’t leave it there. There is a terrible place to leave it! ’’u200a” the producer Ramin Hedayati tells Smith. “Now when something crazy happens on CNN, there are five blogs that flag it. Back then, it was either us or no one. ”",0
18382,College Lecturer Punched In The Face And Knocked Into Freezing Canal For ’Being White’,"A media lecturer at Stratford College was set upon by a group of Muslim males and sent tumbling into a freezing canal while out jogging in Birmingham for, he believes, “being white” on January 15th. [The Stratford Observer reports that Lee Skinner was running along the canal side near Yardley Road, Acocks Green in the middle of the afternoon when one of the   group suddenly struck him full force in the face, knocking him into the icy waters.  The Daily Mirror records how Skinner was “able to identify them as Pakistani as I’ve worked in Muslim communities and have a detailed knowledge of Islam and speak Arabic to a certain level”. The   lecturer described how the blow sent him “up into the air and into the water. I sank and was completely submerged, my feet were not touching the bottom. ” Skinner was not knocked completely unconscious and drowned, fortunately, but a police spokesman said he was “prevented from getting out by his assailant”. Only after the   linguist cried out “There is no God but Allah” in Arabic did his attackers panic and flee the scene, possibly suspecting they may have assaulted a fellow Muslim. He was then able to heave himself out of the frigid waters, but cut his legs badly while doing so. Skinner caught up to four of the group, though not his principal aggressor, who told him “the attack happened because I was white”. The 38   then warned group “that in the current political climate, such actions could have a negative effect on the Muslim Pakistani community” and lectured them on “the positive aspects of Mohammed and Islam”. Skinner lost his phone, keys, glasses and a memory stick where his college lessons were saved, and had to be treated in hospital for damage to his cheekbone, teeth and neck muscles.  ",0
18383,Creeping Progress in Pledge to Cut Calories in Sugary Soda - The New York Times,"It hasn’t been a good year for the troika that dominates soft drink sales,   PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple. The public’s attention on the health effects of sugary sodas has continued to increase, slowing growth and increasing political pressure. This year, soft drink companies and their lobbying group, the American Beverage Association, spent $38 million to defeat   proposals to impose taxes on sugary drinks in four cities: San Francisco, Oakland and Albany in California, and Boulder, Colo. The companies lost all of those fights. Now, seven cities around the country have a soda tax. One way the companies have tried to get ahead of the tax efforts is by vowing to reduce the calories in their products. In September 2014, they committed to reducing calories 20 percent nationwide by 2025 and focus on 10 communities where rates of obesity, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes are among the highest. The effort has been underway for about a year now, and as the beverage association prepared to release research about the efforts, it invited a handful of reporters to see what had been done to encourage consumption of healthier beverages in three stores in the   neighborhood in Brooklyn, one of the 10 sites the companies promised to focus on. Here are the findings and observations, which suggest that the companies have a long way to go to meet their goal. The average American consumed an estimated 199 calories a day from beverages in 2014, when beverage companies made their pledge, and that fell to 198. 7 calories a day the next year, according to research by Keybridge Public Policy Economics, an independent firm paid by the beverage association to conduct the study. That is a decline of less than 1 percent, far off the pace need to reach a 20 percent drop over a decade. To achieve their 2025 goal, the companies must reduce calories to 159. 2 calories per person per day. Americans actually increased the volume of beverages they consumed by 2. 2 percent from 2014 to 2015, largely because they drank more water. Consumers drank less soda, but substituted bottled coffee and tea, sports drinks and energy drinks, according to Robert F. Wescott, president of Keybridge. “The increase in water  —   it’s not replacing something else,” he said. The companies are offering several alternatives to traditional soda, and have retooled older products to reduce calories. This has often been done quietly, with subtle changes to the drinks. “Consumers won’t buy something if you tell them you’ve changed it,” said Michael Morel, sales director for Brooklyn at the   Bottling Company of New York. Pepsi, for instance, reformulated nine varieties of Brisk, an iced tea and juice line it owns together with Unilever. Using a combination of caloric and noncaloric sweeteners, PepsiCo lowered calories in the drinks by as much as 44 percent. “There was a dramatic decrease in calories in Brisk  —   but not in sales,” Mr. Wescott said. “Calorie decreases like that need to accelerate to meet the 2025 target. ” More additions are coming. The Dr Pepper Snapple Group has nearly doubled sales of seltzers over the last several years as part of its effort to encourage greater consumption of   drinks. On Tuesday, the company announced it was paying $1. 7 billion for Bai Brands, a maker of   enhanced waters with just five calories, thus expanding its portfolio of   drinks. The companies have also renegotiated their agreements with grocery chains and bodegas in   to give better placement to   drinks. For instance, Coke Zero and other   drinks from   are now standing cheek by jowl with traditional   Powerade and other beverages on   shelves at the Ideal Food Basket in  . “We didn’t sell any of those products here before,” said Kamau Brown,  ’s director of sales and operations for the New York City metro region.   and the other beverage companies have also persuaded retailers to let them to add racks and cardboard display cases, which effectively create additional shelf space for the   products. This ensures that stores don’t lose revenue from    sweetened products until   products demonstrate solid sales, Mr. Brown said. For instance, 33.  bottles of Smart Water, which has no calories, were displayed on a wire rack at a price of four for $5. A cardboard display of different flavors of Aloe Gloe, a new   enhanced water line from Coke, offered two small cardboard “bottles” for $4. But the   products are not far away. Separating the Smart Water and Aloe Gloe displays were two shopping carts filled with   bottles of ginger ale and Pepsi Wild Cherry, on sale for $2. 99. The companies are using a variety of promotions designed to encourage greater sales of   and   drinks. At the deli, for instance, PepsiCo’s   drinks are sold for 99 cents.   had a variety of “buy one, get one free” offers on displays that encouraged consumers to get an   of small 7.  cans of Coke Zero if they bought the same size pack of classic Coke. All three big beverage companies have signs that read, “Balance what you eat, drink and do” and show images of some   products. Pepsi’s, for instance, shows bottles of Gatorade and Aquafina, its water brand. But a small bottle of classic Pepsi is also featured front and center. Moussad Elghandour, a Yemeni immigrant who owns the Utica Express Deli in   said that the promotions were driving sales  —   but that sugary drinks were also selling well. Changing demographics in the neighborhood, he said, noting specifically a higher number of white residents, were also responsible for the changing mix of drinks he’s selling. “Some people care about themselves, their health. Some people don’t,” Mr. Elghandour said.",0

To the public, Mr. Albee, who died on Friday at the age of 88, was known primarily through his dramatic work  —   some 30 plays written over a career that spanned nearly six decades. For many colleagues and fans, his death was an opportunity to reflect on the man behind the curtain. Playwrights expressed a particular debt to Mr. Albee, who won Tony Awards for ”Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? ,” as well as for lifetime achievement, in addition to three Pulitzer Prizes. Tony Taccone, artistic director of Berkeley Repertory Theater, a prominent theater in California, interviewed Mr. Albee in San Francisco a few years ago. “He was a giant,” Mr. Taccone said. ”He was able to navigate a wide range of styles, from hyperrealism to more expressionistic.” Mr. Taccone described Mr. Albee as an absolutist and a   and said that “he would have his characters talking in his head for three months, and if he could have them talk in his head for three months, then they’d stay as viable characters to be written on the page. ” Actors also spoke about the influence of Mr. Albee’s work.

Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Peña Nieto of Mexico discussed a border wall when they met, but not who would pay. But Mr. Peña Nieto said on Twitter later that, “I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall. ” Many Mexicans expressed anger over the meeting.

18387,Flashback: Obama Stranded Legal Cuban Travelers in Airports on Last Week in Office - Breitbart,"As the radical left organizes obstructions of airport terminals to protest President Donald Trump’s executive order enacting new security measures for travelers visiting from turbulent countries, few appear equally outraged that his predecessor, Barack Obama, issued a similar directive specifically targeting Cubans. [During his last week in office, President Obama repealed a   executive order known as “Wet   Foot,” which allowed all Cubans legally touching U. S. soil to stay here illegally. The objective of the executive order was to give sanctuary to Cubans risking their lives on makeshift vessels trying to sail to the United States and escape the oppressive communist regime that has governed there for over half a century.  The move did not trigger widespread national protests in defense of the Cubans affected, even as U. S. immigration officials  —   confused by the lack of direction in Obama’s order  —   detained and interrogated countless travelers possessing legal visas to enter the United States. Many of these were elderly individuals, traveling to visit their children with no intention of stay. The only activists who spoke up for them were members of the Cuban exile community, who told their stories to local press. Democracy Movement leader Ramón Saúl Sánchez  —   who the Obama administration threatened with deportation after 49 years in the United States  —   told Miami’s El Nuevo Herald that the individuals he was advocating for were stuck in airport interrogation rooms, their families panicked and receiving few updates. “These Cuban travelers have tourism visas. They are being detained or deported,” Sánchez said on January 15. “Those being detained within the airport include people of advanced age, including one blind man, many of them ill. ” He added that many elderly Cubans with whom he spoke after being released from interrogation were threatened with being detained in an immigration center, leaving them thinking, “if you’re going to throw me in jail just send me back. ” Relatives of those detained told their stories to the media.    Justina Barroso Rodríguez, who suffers from hypertension, was placed in a jail awaiting deportation upon arriving in the United States on January 13. Her son, Danilo Alemán, told the Diario Las Americas that he had received little information on the matter, only that the repeal of “wet   foot” led to her detention. “I would like to know, how would President Obama feel if it was his mother in the conditions my mother is currently in?” Alemán asked. A    Cuban woman who was fortunate enough to be released told Miami’s América TeVe that she was kept in isolation an entire day without food. She refused to give the network her name and said she did not know when she had been initially detained, though she estimated it had occurred around 10AM local time and she had been released long after the sun had set. She possessed a legal visa, and said her crime was to mention the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act to an immigration official. Those flying into Miami were among the luckiest Cubans following President Obama’s directive, even as their legal U. S. visas were not enough to prevent them from being detained. Cubans who had begun their journey to the United States through Central America and Mexico  —   who would have been able to enter the United States and legally stay there before President Obama’s last week in office, are now stranded throughout the region, held in dilapidated detention centers and threatened with deportation back into a communist autocracy. In Panama, 18 Cuban refugees declared themselves on hunger strike this week, protesting the government’s refusal to grant them access to an attorney and forcing them into conditions with little food or basic hygienic necessities. The protest triggered another hunger strike at a detention center in Panama by   activists who fled Cuba to avoid becoming prisoners of conscience. “We are taking this measure for our freedom, because we cannot return to Cuba,” one of the individuals said in a statement. The protesters alleged that Panamanian authorities had confiscated their passports and abandoned many in the dense forestry near the Colombian border. “They are putting us on trucks and letting us loose in the middle of the jungle,” one protester said, while another noted that those abandoned in such a way are left “without food, without water, they do not care if we are sick or injured. ” In Mexico, a country with a record of treating migrants inhumanely, Cubans seeking to cross the northern border into the United States are also stranded. “Many of us will die if we were to go to Cuba,” refugee Rodolfo Muñoz told local outlet KVUE this week. He and his wife, like many Cubans, are stranded in Nuevo Laredo, where the U. S. government has refused to let them pass. U. S. Customs and Border Protection declined an interview on the subject with the broadcast station. In a widely distributed statement, the agency said that Cubans have the option of filing a petition the enter the country based on a political asylum claim, but they risk months in a “detention facility” if they express their fear of political persecution to authorities. Mexico has already begun to deport dozens of refugees back to Cuba, where the government executes thousands of   arrests annually. Mexican authorities deported 70 Cuban refugees last Wednesday, with many more expected to be repatriated soon. This appears to have been the Obama administration’s intended result. “We will have to get involved with the Central American and Mexican governments to promote the idea of a secure, orderly, legal migration or restricting or repatriating irregular immigrants,” an unnamed State Department official told El Nuevo Herald in July 2016, referring to the refugees as “immigrants. ” Some of those stranded in Mexico and Central America have protested that the treatment of Cubans under the Obama administration, which differed significantly from the welcoming attitude the administration had towards other Latin American immigrants, was a result of  ’ embrace of conservative values. A result of a combination of factors  —   from the massacre of Cuban patriots under Democrat John F. Kennedy at Bay of Pigs to the   Congressional Black Caucus’ embrace of Fidel Castro  —     voters are largely conservative on foreign policy issues and lean Republican. The final tally of November election results showed Cubans more likely to support Republican candidate Donald Trump than even   white Americans. These facts were not lost on some refugees traveling north. “Obama, because he is leaving, suddenly takes up the idea of repealing a law that has been enforced for many years and has favored many Cubans. I think he got angry with the Cubans,” Cuban refugee Jose Enrique Manresa said, shortly after President Obama’s move prevented him from entering the country. “It is a reprisal. ” Adding insult to injury, the Obama administration presided over an unprecedented surge in recent years in Cuban refugee flows into the United States, a direct result of his policy of appeasement towards the Castro regime. In his last days in office, President Obama also signed an agreement emboldening the Cuban Coast Guard to conduct joint “rescue” operations in international waters, despite Havana’s multiple mass murders of refugees and   activists at sea.",0
18388,"American fascist really, really likes British fascist","Tuesday 22 November 2016 by Neil Tollfree American fascist really, really likes British fascist 
America’s top fascist and President Elect Donald Trump has announced that he really, really likes British fascist Nigel Farage. 
“I don’t think we should be surprised,” said Professor of History Simon Williams, with tears in his eyes. 
“We saw this in the 30s and 40s; German fascist Adolf Hitler really, really liked Mussolini, and then went on to really, really like other leading fascists in the world. 
“In much the same way that if, say, you support Chelsea, you will probably really, really like other Chelsea supporters, so will fascists really, really like other fascists. 
“Not that I’m suggesting that all Chelsea supporters are fascists, some of them definitely aren’t.” 
Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would really, really like a fascist, in the form of Nigel Farage, to be British ambassador to the United States. 
It is believed that Mr Farage has been fully tumescent since meeting Donald Trump in a big gold lift several days ago, and the suggestion that he should be Britain’s first fascist ambassador is expected to continue this state of affairs for the foreseeable future. 
Although it is understood that what Mr Trump would really, really like is a fascist Prime Minister of Great Britain, he has stopped short of suggesting a fascist coup in the country because he isn’t President yet, as it could be considered a little rude. ",0
18389,"Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060","Last Majority White Election, Minorities to Give Democrats White House Through 2060 Paul Bedard, Washington Examiner, November 6, 2016 
This may be the last year that a Republican will be elected president, as the growth of liberal-leaning minorities all but guarantees that Democrats will hold the majority at least for the next four decades. 
That’s according to an unusual survey on the impact of minorities, mostly Latin American, done for WalletHub and provided to Secrets . 
The study used two models based on population projections and matched to the overwhelming 65 percent minority turnout for President Obama in 2012 and the underwhelming 50 percent response for George W. Bush in 2004. 
The bottom line: In no presidential election from 2020-60 do the Republicans win. {snip}

18390,Katie Ledecky ... and Everyone Else - The New York Times,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   At her second Olympics, Katie Ledecky experienced what was for her a Games first: She touched the wall not knowing if she had won. The   freestyle was her third career individual final, and Ledecky’s margin of victory was   of a second, a microfraction of time virtually imperceptible to the untrained eye. When she finishes her last individual event on Friday, viewers might wonder if there was anyone else in the pool. If recent form holds, the gap between Ledecky and the silver medalist in the   freestyle will reflect her dominance more powerfully than the gold medal she receives afterward. All Olympic winners get one of those. Ledecky, 19 and soon to be a freshman at Stanford, deserves Advanced Placement credits for her elevated margins of victory. In a sport where races often are settled by tenths of a second, Ledecky won the   freestyle in 2012 by 4. 13 seconds and the 400 freestyle on Sunday by 4. 77 seconds. On Thursday, she qualified first in the   freestyle, finishing 6. 57 seconds ahead of her nearest competitor. Most expect an even larger margin of victory in the final on Friday night. It is not often that a rival says, “I knew she was going to win,” as the American Leah Smith did while talking about Ledecky after the 400 freestyle final. But then, it has been nearly a   since the swimming world has seen a female swimmer as dominant as Ledecky. With a victory in the 800, she will join Debbie Meyer as the only swimmers to win the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles in a single Games. But the talent level was   deep in Meyer’s day. The eight women she beat in the 800 final in Mexico City came from four countries.   years later, it is   deep, with seven nations set to be represented in Friday’s   final. Still, at the last two major international events preceding the Rio Games, Ledecky won the   freestyle easily: by 6. 52 seconds at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships in Australia and by 10. 26 seconds at the 2015 world championships in Kazan, Russia. Her competition on Friday will include many of the same women she vanquished at those meets, with the notable exception of New Zealand’s Lauren Boyle, the   both times, who fell one spot short of the final in qualifying. For the past three years, Ledecky has geared her training toward swimming fast here. Already, she has broken her world record in the 400 freestyle. And there is no reason to believe that her 800 record of 8:06. 68, which is nearly nine seconds faster than the personal best of the   finalist, is safe. Sure, Ledecky has raced 2, 600 meters, including relays, since the meet got underway Saturday. But having watched her set a world record in bad weather in an outdoor pool at the Pan Pacific Championships, her coach, Bruce Gemmell, said he did not believe the long, late nights of racing here would slow her. “I saw how focused she was there, she has a unique gift to do that,” he said. “She did it in wind and sleet and rain. Now she can do it in dorms and buses and late nights. ” Ledecky owns the 12   fastest performances in the 800. She has lowered the world record four times since 2013, most recently at a meet in Austin, Tex. in January, when she finished 21. 63 seconds ahead of the  . Smith, the other American entrant in Friday’s 800 final, finished fourth in that race. “I literally heard the guy go, ‘New world record! ’” Smith said, referring to the meet announcer. “And I had just flipped for my last 50. ” She added, “I was kind of like, ‘Well, this is probably not a good race for me. ’” Ledecky’s preliminary swim Thursday broke the    Olympic record but was a relatively tight race by her standards. Following Gemmell’s instructions “not to take a hard stroke,” Ledecky coasted to an 8:12. 86. She dragged her legs, not bothering to kick, over the last 600 meters  —   fully   of the race  —   and still finished 6. 57 seconds ahead of Hungary’s Boglarka Kapas. Smith was 8. 57 seconds back, in fourth. A lot can happen, and has happened, at the Olympics in the 10. 26 seconds that Ledecky spent waiting for the   to finish at last summer’s world championships: Justin Gatlin running the 100 meters Serena Williams winning a point off her serve Tom Daley falling to earth from the   platform Simone Biles nailing a vault the skeet shooter Vincent Hancock hitting a target. Some athletes would relish having so much time to have the applause to themselves. They might preen and poke the air with their index finger. Ledecky is not one of them. After checking her time on the scoreboard, peeling off her caps, removing her goggles and glancing at the Team U. S. A. cheering section, Ledecky typically hangs from the wall or treads water until there is a   finisher to congratulate. “I don’t really think about much in between,” she said. Ledecky cannot leave her lane until the other swimmers finish. It is perhaps the only time she knows the feeling of being a prisoner of her success. Gemmell was asked if Ledecky was recognized often in the athletes’ village. “No, not truthfully,” he said, adding, “It’s great. ”",0
18391,"Alison Wright, Exiled From ‘The Americans’ (Perhaps), Hits Broadway - The New York Times","It took Alison Wright 34 years to land her first big role, as poor Martha Hanson, the   F. B. I. secretary on FX’s “The Americans. ” And another four  —   after Martha made the shattering discovery that her marriage to Clark Westerfeld, an alias of the K. G. B. agent Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys) was mostly a sham  —   to break viewers’ hearts and be jettisoned off the series (maybe to Moscow). But Ms. Wright’s career was just starting to soar. After roles in “The Accountant,” the Ben Affleck feature, and “Sneaky Pete,” the Bryan Cranston series for Amazon, she will make her Broadway debut in Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat,” beginning performances at Studio 54 on Saturday, March 4, which is transferring from the Public Theater. Ms. Wright plays Jessie, a factory worker in Reading, Pa. who finds herself pitted against her friends as jobs become scarce and society crumbles. “These are the people who maybe voted for Trump, or chose not to vote at all today,” Ms. Wright said of the play, set in 2000 and 2008. “Lynn has put real people behind the numbers of whole cities evaporating, in a way. ” Ms. Wright, a subversively witty native of England’s Lake District who lives in Harlem with her maltipoo, Luigi, talked about blooming late. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Will Martha be back this season? No comment. They’ve told me that I can say something they’ve said many times themselves: She’s alive  —   and if you’re alive on “The Americans,” there’s always hope for you. Which is fair enough, but it’s certainly something that everybody is dying to know. I’m asked on a daily basis. Are you sick of the questions? No, it’s  . I’ve noticed just this real tenderness when they talk to me about her, their genuine concern and sympathy and empathy. It’s quite lovely, because it didn’t start out like that. Does a part like Jessie in “Sweat” give you empathy for people whose politics may not reflect your own? With these people’s stories, you can’t help but see how they just did what they needed to do to survive, because nobody was listening to them. Nobody was going to help them. O. K. I now can understand and have empathy for this part of society. That’s tremendous, right? That’s what theater is supposed to do. And now you’re making your Broadway debut at 40. [Sings] Yesss! I set the benchmark for myself about a year ago, actually, at the end of Season 4 of “The Americans. ” “OK, when I’m in a real part  —   not a bit part  —   on Broadway, that’s when I can feel that I’ve made it as an actor. ” It has been a long time coming. And some  —   in fact, most  —   never get to Broadway. This is true. That’s a good attitude. Or on a Ryan Murphy show. You have another timely role, as Pauline Jameson, playing opposite Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon in his FX series, “Feud: Bette and Joan,” which begins Sunday. I am perhaps the single composite regular  —   a little bit of all the women in the studio systems who were girl Fridays and very competent and able. She can hold her own with Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and she wants to have a future in the business. But it’s 1962, so she’s not in control of that for herself. I’m not sure how far we’ve come in 2017. It’s funny  —   I have a very big fourth episode, and the first part of it we filmed before the election, and there was a lot of this stuff that was very tongue in cheek at the time: “You know, some guys don’t like the idea of a woman in charge. ” Then we went back [the day after the election] to shoot the rest, and it had a whole different gravitas to it. You’ve described the show as a very   examination of aging in Hollywood. Susan Sarandon said that when she started, 40 was the cutoff, the hard line. That’s it  —   roll over and die. And that’s certainly been pushed, specifically by people like Ryan Murphy. He’s a real champion of women. I think there were 15 roles in this show for women over the age of 40. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys of “The Americans” got awards love this year, though they didn’t win. Whatever the competition is, it’s not always the best person or the best work that wins. Meryl’s only got three Oscars. It’s clearly a flawed system. But I don’t want to say anything here that’s going to make sure I never get an award  —   because I really want one! How do you get those amazing eyebrows? They’ve had this much attitude since I was 5 years old.",0
18392,"The Baton Rouge Shooter, Gavin Long, Saw World ‘Run by Devils’ - The New York Times","Recent posts on social media by Gavin Long, the Marine veteran who fatally shot three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, La. on Sunday morning, show a man with a paranoid and political message, describing a world “run by devils,” imagining himself as their feared enemy and talking of a need for revolution. In this YouTube video posted from Dallas on July 10, just three days after five police officers there were murdered, Mr. Long says, “When an African fights back, it’s wrong, but every time a European fights back against his oppressor, he’s right. ” In the above video, Mr. Long is apparently wearing a body camera as he tries to give copies of one of his books to customers in a Dallas barbershop. He delivers a sermonlike speech from near the front door. “It’s real out here, man. I’m here for y’all,” Mr. Long tells the group of mostly black patrons. “Be great, have knowledge,” he says as he walks out the door. Mr. Long filed a form last year in Jackson County, Mo. to change his name to Cosmo Ausar Setepenra, a name freighted with ancient Egyptian references. Ausar, often rendered as Osiris, was the Egyptian god of the underworld. A group called the Ausar Auset Society, founded in the 1970s, describes itself on its website as being dedicated to reviving the ancient Egyptian religion among Africans and people of African descent. Setepenra, sometimes rendered as Setepenre, or    among other variations, meant “chosen by Ra,” the Egyptian sun god. The name has been used in modern times by some people affiliated with occult groups that use Egyptian symbols. In his application, Mr. Long also made many references to a small, obscure group called the United Washitaw de Dugdahmoundyah Mu’ur Nation, and attached a declaration from the organization. It is a group of   based in Louisiana, who say they are a sovereign Native American tribe  —   a claim that courts have repeatedly rejected. In a  podcast posted in late June on his website Convos With Cosmo, Mr. Long draws parallels between his own   and success, including his weight loss, to that of the rapper Gucci Mane, who was released from prison that week. Mr. Long’s opinion is that the rapper “came out a better person than when he went in,” despite external forces, including “the system,” that exert pressure on individuals to stay “trapped. ” “That’s why they gotta watch people like me,” he says. “I wake people up. ” Mr. Long posted frequently on the Twitter account ConvosWithCosmo, where he made his first post on Oct. 22. The feed was dominated by   style musings, paeans to entrepreneurship, the promotion of his books and his love of vegan food. Another theme is racial injustice. On April 5, he posted two tweets suggesting he had been racially profiled during a traffic stop in Los Angeles. In a video, a police officer tells him that he is being let off with a warning, but that it would be in his best interest “not to have an attitude with a police officer. ” “O. K. I’m a black man,” he replies. “And somebody pulling me over saying I didn’t stop beyond a line or something. That’s a reason to cop an attitude as a black man because you get harassed multiple times. ” His final tweet, early Sunday, foreshadowed his fate that day. Mr. Long was killed in a shootout with Baton Rouge officers that left three of them dead, and three others wounded. Police officials said on Monday that Mr. Long had “ambushed” them.",0

I had three meetings this afternoon   …     you know, I think the odds are still better than 80 percent that we still have a vote this week and I’m optimistic that we’re going to get it done for the president and the American people.

18394,Hasan Minhaj to Perform at White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner - The New York Times,"A comedian has agreed to speak at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. Finally. Hasan Minhaj, a senior correspondent at “The Daily Show,” will be the featured performer at the dinner on April 29, the association said on Tuesday. He will join the ranks of Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, Conan O’Brien and other stars who have skewered Washington at the annual gathering. But Mr. Minhaj, an   and Muslim who regularly roasts President Trump in his day job, will ascend the dais at a dinner that is shaping up to be far more tense than in previous years. Mr. Trump is skipping the festivities, the first president to do so since the 1970s, and his staff will boycott them, too. Vanity Fair and Bloomberg canceled their famed,    . And the event is playing out against the backdrop of a historically strained period of relations between the administration and the news media. Comedians for the dinner are typically announced months in advance, and some   names, including the   host James Corden, reportedly declined invitations this year. Without Mr. Trump on hand to punch back, some journalists in Washington were concerned that a   monologue attacking the president would give an impression of bias. “I was not looking for somebody who is going to roast the president in absentia that’s not fair and that’s not the message we want to get across,” Jeff Mason, the president of the correspondents’ association, said Tuesday morning on MSNBC. “I was looking for somebody who is funny and who is entertaining, because I want the dinner to be entertaining, but who can also speak to the message that the whole dinner is going to speak to: the importance of the free press,” Mr. Mason added. Mr. Minhaj, 31, joined “The Daily Show” in 2014 and has become popular among viewers with his cheerfully acerbic takes on current events. A   immigrant, Mr. Minhaj wrote and performed “Hasan Minhaj: Homecoming King,” an Off Broadway show in 2015 recalling his youth in California and his struggles with ethnic identity. Some of his “Daily Show” commentary about the president has been scathing, and personal. The day after the election, Mr. Minhaj described his anxieties about Mr. Trump’s policies toward Muslims, saying that his mother had asked if she would be allowed back into the United States after a foreign trip to visit relatives. “The fact that I can’t tell her ‘yes’ with 100 percent certainty is heartbreaking,” Mr. Minhaj said. “That is my mom, and I need her back home. Because I love her  —   and she owes me $300. ” In a statement on Tuesday, Mr. Minhaj called it “a tremendous honor to be a part of such a historic event even though the president has chosen not to attend this year. SAD!” ”Now more than ever, it is vital that we honor the First Amendment and the freedom of the press,” Mr. Minhaj added. Officials at the correspondents’ group say the dinner will be focused on promoting journalism, with the famed writers Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward to present awards for White House reporting. Scholarships funded by the association will also be at the forefront. Alec Baldwin, who caricatures Mr. Trump on “Saturday Night Live,” called Mr. Mason at one point to talk about the possibility of an appearance, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The actor would likely have appeared as himself, and not in his Trump guise, the people said, in part because “Saturday Night Live” would have to give permission for Mr. Baldwin to reprise the impression outside of the show. But some journalists in the Correspondents’ Association felt that awarding a featured spot to Mr. Baldwin could inject a blunt partisanship into the proceedings. Would network news anchors, for instance, feel comfortable laughing along with Mr. Baldwin  —   live on camera  —   if no one from the White House administration was there to reciprocate? A representative for Mr. Baldwin said that the actor planned to be in Los Angeles during the weekend of the dinner. Regardless of Mr. Trump’s participation, there has been little question that this year’s event would have a different feel. “It’s a new president, it’s a new administration, and we’ve faced new challenges,” Mr. Mason said in an interview on Tuesday, “and the dinner reflects those things. ”",0
18395,Fake Hate Crime Blames Trump-Supporting ’White America’ for Arson - Breitbart,"Curtis Flournoy dislikes white people almost as much as the Oxford comma. [Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, arrested the      for allegedly setting fire to a market owned by an immigrant from Bhutan. The arsonist left a note, which began: “Our newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for white America. ”  The culprit in the   and fire not only attempted to depict white supporters of the president as violent racists, but as   as well. “You all know that, we want our country back on the right track,” he informed. “We need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and all immigrants. Specially, we don’t want business by refugees and immigrant any more. ” The staged hate crime mirrors several other faux attacks on religious and ethnic minorities in the wake of Donald Trump’s political emergence. In Manhattan in December, a Muslim woman claimed a trio of white drunks assaulted her on a crowded subway train and pulled on her hijab while chanting   slogans and issuing   taunts. Earlier in Mississippi, news reports indicated a hate crime when “Vote Trump” appeared   on a   black church. Police later arrested an   parishioner for the crime. Whereas the Muslim college   allegedly made up the story to avoid the wrath of her father after breaking curfew, the culprit in the Charlotte attack appears to have harbored no motive save for embarrassing white Trump supporters. He broke a window and set fire to the establishment. He did not steal anything, save for a sentence’s right to   agreement. “We are ready to wake up some of our great state including North Carolina and we will take care of the country he typed. “Immigrants and refugee are taking our job, doing business and leaving us standard.

18396,BREAKING: Police Raid Democratic Office – Hillary is SCREWED!,"0 comments 
On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania State Police raided a Delaware County political field office for the Democratic Party in search of “templates utilized to construct fraudulent voter registration forms,” and “completed voter registration forms containing same or similar identifying information of individuals on multiple forms.” 
A warrant was filed last week in County Court seeking the documents tied to voter fraud. Investigators said they were looking for the documents, financial information, and lists of employees at the Norwood office of FieldWorks LLC, a national organization that often does street work for Democrats. 
Matt Dorf, a spokesman for FieldWorks’ national headquarters in Washington, released the following statement: 
“FieldWorks is now working with county officials to provide them with information on our program and applications they are investigating. In keeping with our regular practice, we will work aggressively with authorities to seek the prosecution of anyone involved in wrongdoing.” 
Founded in 2001, according to promotional material online, FieldWorks describes itself as “a nationally recognized grassroots organizing firm founded to help progressive organizations, advocacy groups, and members of the Democratic family take their public engagement and electoral strategies to the next level.” 
In 2012, FieldWorks’ voter registration efforts in Ohio sparked some controversy when the organization’s employees filed thousands of new voter registration cards in the final week before the registration deadline and some of them were found to be fraudulent.",0
18397,Poll Finds Americans' Support For Police Highest In Nearly 50 Years," 
In the past year, Americans have seen police officers ambushed and assassinated, and they have watched as the thin line protecting citizens from criminals has been reviled by groups such as Black Lives Matter.
And now America is taking its stand.
A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.

“Obviously, this violent rhetoric we have seen from BLM has backfired ,” wrote Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.
“People respect the cops more than ever and they clearly see what a difficult job they have,” he added.
 
Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.
“And don’t give me this nonsense about how BLM isn’t anti-police,” he wrote. “In fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .”
Miller said the bottom line is clear.
“This poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement. No getting around it,” he wrote.

Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.
The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.
“The increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,” Gallup reported in analyzing its results.
“The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive — both politically and for their lives while they are on duty — amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,” it added.
Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
“It’s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,” it wrote.

18398,Theresa May Is Grilled Over U.K. Missile Test Failure - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain refused to comment on Sunday about the reported failure of an unarmed British Trident missile that was   from a submarine off the coast of Florida in June. Mrs. May said in a television interview with the BBC that she had “absolute faith in our Trident missiles. ” But she would not say whether she had known about the failure or whether, as The Sunday Times of London reported, it had been covered up by Downing Street under her predecessor, David Cameron, shortly before the referendum on Britain’s exit from the European Union. Mrs. May did not mention any missile failure in her first major speech to Parliament on July 18, when she persuaded Parliament to spend up to 40 billion pounds, or about $53 billion then, on four new submarines to keep Britain’s nuclear deterrent up to date. “There are tests that take place all the time, regularly, for our nuclear deterrence,” she said on Sunday. “What we were talking about in that debate that took place was about the future. ” The Sunday Times reported that the Trident II D5 missile, which was designed to carry a nuclear warhead but was unarmed for the test, had veered off course after being fired from HMS Vengeance, one of Britain’s four aging   submarines. The British Navy had not performed such a test for four years because of the expense of the missile, but had carried out tests in 2000, 2005, 2009 and 2012, all of which had been successful and publicized by the Ministry of Defense. The current test took place after the submarine had been refitted with new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems. Replacing Trident has been controversial because of the cost and because the current leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, long an antinuclear campaigner, is opposed to retaining Britain’s nuclear deterrent, while his party’s official position has been to retain and renew it. “It’s a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction, and while it wasn’t armed, goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been,” Mr. Corbyn said on Sunday. Speaking to Sky News, he said, “We understand the prime minister chose not to inform Parliament, and instead it came out through the media. ” He repeated his belief that Britain should commit to nuclear disarmament. Kevan Jones, a Labour member of Parliament and a former defense minister, called for an inquiry into the failed missile test. “The U. K.’s independent nuclear deterrent is a vital cornerstone for the nation’s defense,” he said. Parliament is likely to ask Defense Secretary Michael Fallon to answer questions about the report. Separately, Mrs. May confirmed that she would meet with President Trump in Washington on Friday in the first visit of a foreign leader to the new president, a traditional prize that Britain has been seeking avidly. She said she would emphasize to Mr. Trump the importance of the NATO military alliance, calling it a “bulwark” of the West, and would say that Britain favors the progress and cohesion of the European Union, even though the country plans to leave the bloc. Trade will be an important topic, she said, with Britain wanting new   agreements with key countries, including the United States, after it leaves the European Union. Mr. Trump, a supporter of “Brexit,” as Britain’s departure from the bloc is known, has said that he is open to early talks on such a deal with Britain. Legally, no new deal can be made until Britain formally leaves the European Union, which is unlikely for at least two years. Mr. Trump’s slogan of “America First” and his protectionist comments may mean that a trade deal will be difficult to negotiate despite the good will expressed by both sides. Mrs. May was asked about Mr. Trump’s attitudes toward women. “I’ve already said that some of the comments that Donald Trump has made in relation to women are unacceptable, some of those he himself has apologized for,” she said. When she meets Mr. Trump, she said, “I think the biggest statement that will be made about the role of women is the fact that I will be there as a female prime minister. ”",0
18399,"Clinton Camp Claims Media Was Pro-Trump, Blames Them For ‘Devastating’ Loss | EndingFed News Network","Email Print A top member of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign told Clinton’s top supporters Thursday her defeat was “the most devastating loss in the history of American politics,” while campaign chairman John Podesta said the defeat was due to a pro-Donald Trump bias in the media. The remarks were made during a conference call between Clinton’s shell-shocked campaign team and several backers of Clinton’s campaign, such as donor J.B. Pritzker, Ready PAC co-founder Allida Black, and political strategist Maria Cardona. The contents of the private call were reported by The Hill , which spoke to one of the Clinton backers on the call. Clinton campaign spokesman Jennifer Palmieri didn’t mince words in describing how brutal Clinton’s upset defeat was, according to The Hill. “Thirty-six hours after the most devastating loss in the history of American politics, we’re looking at a white board right now with lots of ideas,” said Palmieri said. “We’re sort of figuring out what we need to do this week, and what we need Democrats to do in the next two months ahead of the inaugural.” Other aides, meanwhile, tried to shift blame for the shocking defeat away from the campaign and onto the media. “The media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election, but covered Trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass,” said Podesta. “We need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward.” Podesta also pointed a finger at FBI Director James Comey, who resurrected the matter of Clinton’s private email server in the final weekend. Podesta said the “dominance of the way [the media] covered the emails” caused them to drown out issues like Trump’s income taxes or his alleged links to Russia. The campaign’s explanations apparently didn’t do much to remedy the agony of defeat. Black began crying during the call, according to The Hill.

18400,The Pathologization of Dissent,"Photo by Jamelle Bouie | CC BY 2.0 

According to the mainstream media, in a recent speech in West Palm Beach, Donald Trump finally completely lost it. Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner, he spat out a series of undeniably hateful anti-Semitic code words … like “political establishment,” “global elites” and, yes, “international banks.” He even went so far as to claim that “corporations” and their (ahem) “lobbyists” have millions of dollars at stake in this election, and are trying to pass the TTP, not to benefit the American people, but simply to enrich themselves. He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with “the Clinton machine,” presumably to benefit these “global elites” and “international banks” and “lobbyists.” 
Now, a lot of folks didn’t immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words, and so mistakenly assumed that “global elites” referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes, and that “lobbyists” referred to actual lobbyists, and that “banks” meant … well … you know, banks. As it turned out, this was completely wrong. None of these words actually meant what they meant, not in anti-Semitic CodeSpeak. So the mainstream media translated for us. “Political establishment” meant “the Jews.” “Global elites” also meant “the Jews.” “Banks” meant “Jews.” “Lobbyists” meant “Jews.” Even “corporate…",0
18401,Donald Trump Would Have Trouble Winning a Suit Over The Times’s Tax Article - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   More than 20 years ago, a surreptitious recording of a cellphone conversation arrived at a Pennsylvania radio station. A federal law made it illegal to broadcast such recordings, but the radio station aired it anyway. The case reached the United States Supreme Court, which in 2001 ruled for the radio station. Legal experts say the decision, Bartnicki v. Vopper, powerfully undermines Donald J. Trump’s claim that The New York Times can be held liable for publishing parts of his tax returns. Any effort to punish “publication of truthful information of public concern,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority, “implicates the core purposes of the First Amendment. ” That is so even if someone broke the law in providing information to a news organization, he wrote. “A stranger’s illegal conduct does not suffice to remove the First Amendment shield from speech about a matter of public concern. ” Not long before The Times posted its article on Mr. Trump’s taxes, one of his lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz, sent a letter to The Times threatening legal action. Mr. Kasowitz said that “an individual taxpayer’s income tax returns are confidential and statutorily protected from public disclosure. ” That is true so far as it goes. In an email a few hours later, but before publication, Mr. Kasowitz wrote that “any unauthorized disclosure, which publication by The New York Times would be, is illegal. ” He cited a federal law that makes it a crime “willfully to print or publish” federal tax return information. It was the only law he cited. Here, though, things grow more complicated. The Times published parts of state tax returns only, from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The federal law Mr. Kasowitz cited does not appear to apply to state returns. In any event, the federal law is a criminal one that does not appear to authorize private civil suits. Mr. Kasowitz did not respond to a request for comment, and it may be that there is a statute or legal theory in one of the four jurisdictions in question that allows the lawsuit he described. Even if that is so, the First Amendment poses a very high barrier to any such litigation. That was the consistent opinion of 11 First Amendment experts consulted by Ronald K. L. Collins for the Concurring Opinions law blog. Here are two representative opinions: “There is no conceivable basis for an action against The New York Times for publishing the income tax returns of a candidate for president,” said Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University. “That’s why we have a First Amendment. ” “This is  ” said Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago. This view was not limited to people who might be expected to be friendly to The Times. Consider Gabriel Schoenfeld, who has called for the prosecution of The Times for publishing information about a program of warrantless wiretapping. “I strongly hope,” he said in an interview, “that Donald Trump sues The New York Times for publishing his tax returns, just as I strongly hope that in the two debates to come, Donald Trump once again attacks Rosie O’Donnell and utters more gibberish. Any such lawsuit  —   which in all likelihood would be shot down by the courts on First Amendment grounds  —   is likely to help further unravel the candidacy of a man who is, among other disqualifying flaws, an enemy of a free press. ” The decision that first springs to mind in discussions of what the First Amendment has to say about the publication of confidential or classified information is New York Times Co. v. United States, usually called the Pentagon Papers case. But it does not answer the central question in the current dispute. True, the decision refused to block publication by The Times and The Washington Post of the classified history of the Vietnam War, establishing an    prohibition against prior restraint on publication. But two of the justices in the    majority indicated that they did not rule out    prosecution of the newspapers under espionage laws. The Bartnicki decision, concerning the cellphone call, largely answered the question left open in the Pentagon Papers case. Lee Levine, who argued on the winning side in Bartnicki, said the decision would doom any lawsuit from Mr. Trump. “The Bartnicki case, both in its holding and reasoning, covers this case precisely,” said Mr. Levine, who has on occasion represented The Times. “If anything, the claim of First Amendment protection is stronger here because of Mr. Trump’s diminished reasonable expectation of privacy and because of the heightened newsworthiness of the information compared to what was before the court in Bartnicki. ” (As a lawyer in The New York Times Company’s legal department, I helped Mr. Levine prepare for the Bartnicki argument and helped draft a     brief supporting his side in the case.) The tape at issue in that case concerned a labor negotiation. A union official said a school board’s intransigence could require a violent response. “We’re gonna have to go to their homes,” the official said of board members, and “blow off their front porches. ” The recording, like Mr. Trump’s tax returns, arrived over the transom: It was delivered to an official of a local taxpayers’ association that opposed the union’s wage demands. As with the tax returns, the recording’s source was unknown. The association official passed it along to the radio station. The people whose call was recorded sued under a federal law that banned such disclosures. That law’s structure is very similar to the one invoked by Mr. Trump. Even though the source had obtained and disclosed the information unlawfully, Justice Stevens wrote, the radio station was free to broadcast it because it was “a matter of public concern. ” “If the statements about the labor negotiations had been made in a public arena  —   during a bargaining session, for example  —   they would have been newsworthy. ” Some kinds of information  —   “disclosures of trade secrets or domestic gossip or other information of purely private concern”  —   may not warrant First Amendment protection, he wrote. However, the tax returns of a presidential candidate whose campaign is based in large part on his business acumen would seem to be well on the other side of the line. Another part of the statute Mr. Trump’s lawyer cited makes it a crime to solicit federal tax return information, defining solicitation to mean “willfully to offer any item of material value in exchange for any return or return information. ” Some commentators have argued that a statement by the executive editor of The Times, Dean Baquet, may have amounted to such solicitation. In September, before the tax documents arrived at The Times, Mr. Baquet participated in a public discussion at Harvard with Bob Woodward of The Washington Post and Laura Poitras, a documentary filmmaker. Mr. Baquet said he would fight hard to publish Mr. Trump’s taxes if The Times obtained them, were the paper’s lawyers to object. (They did not.) Mr. Baquet added that he would, if need be, make the case in court that publishing the documents was valuable and lawful. He suggested but did not say that he would be willing to go to jail over the matter. This is not the sort of solicitation contemplated by the statute. Even a more direct request for information  —   of the sort journalists make all day  —   is not unlawful conduct, courts have said. In a concurring opinion in the Bartnicki case, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, not always a friend of the news media, said that it mattered that the union officials were public figures, if only to a limited extent. “They thereby subjected themselves to somewhat greater public scrutiny,” he wrote, “and had a lesser interest in privacy than an individual engaged in purely private affairs. ” A presidential candidate, it would follow, invites much more searching public scrutiny.",0

It traveled to the legitimizing megaphone of   cable news. And it ended, after an agonizing journey through the new realities of the campaign media, with a single phone call that debunked its entire existence. There was no syringe. Along the way, the syringe that wasn’t revealed everything there is to know about the truth, the media and this   presidential campaign. On the latest episode of The   we explore what happened to truth in this campaign and who’s to blame for the new world of   and outright falsehoods. Our guides: Jim Rutenberg, The Times’s media columnist, who figured out what the syringe really was and exposed the hidden connections that fanned the original, inaccurate reporting Charlie Sykes, an influential conservative radio show host who has sounded the alarm about the partisan warfare that has left us with no referees who can separate fact from fiction and Sarah Ellison, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, who has presciently reported on the possibility that Donald J. Trump’s campaign may be evolving into a media empire. Mr. Sykes, who says he stands by much of his critique of the mainstream media, now concedes that years of relentlessly bashing it have left the country without any trusted sources of information. “As a conservative talk show host, one of our themes has always been to bash the mainstream media, to point out the bias,” he said. “But this is the moment you wake up and you go, O. K. have we done such an effective job that when I say, for example, ‘What Donald Trump said here is demonstrably false and here is the   from The New York Times or The Washington Post’  —   we now have an audience that is conditioned to say, ‘Well, you know, that’s the mainstream media, that is the liberal media, I’m not going to take that seriously.’ ” The result, he said, is a country in which there are no final arbiters of truth. “You begin to realize you’ve basically cut down all of these guideposts to be able to say, ‘Look this is what is reliable, this is what is not reliable,’ ” Mr. Sykes said.

18404,Obama Expands War With Al Qaeda to Include Shabab in Somalia - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The escalating American military engagement in Somalia has led the Obama administration to expand the legal scope of the war against Al Qaeda, a move that will strengthen   Donald J. Trump’s authority to combat thousands of Islamist fighters in the chaotic Horn of Africa nation. The administration has decided to deem the Shabab, the Islamist militant group in Somalia, to be part of the armed conflict that Congress authorized against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to senior American officials. The move is intended to shore up the legal basis for an intensifying campaign of airstrikes and other counterterrorism operations, carried out largely in support of African Union and Somali government forces. The executive branch’s stretching of the 2001 war authorization against the original Al Qaeda to cover other Islamist groups in countries far from Afghanistan  —   even ones, like the Shabab, that did not exist at the time  —   has prompted recurring objections from some legal and foreign policy experts. The Shabab decision is expected to be publicly disclosed next month in a letter to Congress listing global deployments. It is part of the Obama administration’s pattern of relaxing various   rules for airstrikes against Islamist militants as it tries to help its partner forces in several conflicts. In June, the administration quietly broadened the military’s authority to carry out airstrikes in Afghanistan to encompass operations intended “to achieve strategic effects,” meaning targeting people impeding the work of Afghan government forces, officials said. Previously, strikes in Afghanistan were permitted only in   for counterterrorism operations targeting Qaeda or Islamic State forces, or to “prevent a strategic defeat” of Afghan forces. Later in the summer, the administration deemed Surt, Libya, an “area of active hostilities,” after the Libyan prime minister asked for assistance in dislodging Islamic State militants from that city. The move exempted the area from 2013 rules that restrict drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations away from battlefield zones, which President Obama had announced in a major speech that year that sought to turn a page in the   war against Al Qaeda. As of last week, the Pentagon had carried out 420 airstrikes against militants in Surt since August. In Somalia, the 2013 rules limiting airstrikes away from “areas of active hostilities” still apply for now. But in practice, restrictions are being eased there in another way: Over the past year, the military has routinely invoked a   exception to those rules for airstrikes taken in “” which can include strikes to help foreign partners even when Americans are not at direct risk. The Shabab grew up as an Islamist insurgency after 2007, when Ethiopia, with American support, invaded Somalia to overthrow an Islamist council that had briefly taken control of much of the   country. The officials familiar with the internal deliberations spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a statement, Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, emphasized that the terrorist threat “is constantly evolving and requires an adaptable response. ” The administration’s strategy, Ms. Monaco said, “recognizes that we must more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks take hold, enabling and empowering these partners to share the burden of combating these threats to our mutual interests. ” “Because the threats and enemies we face evolve and adapt,” she continued, “we must be flexible in confronting them where they are  —   always doing so consistent with our laws and our values. ” But some experts criticized the administration for using a    congressional authorization as a justification to go to war with the Shabab. “It’s crazy that a piece of legislation that was grounded specifically in the experience of   is now being repurposed for close air support for regional security forces in Somalia,” said Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Under the 2001 authorization, the United States is engaged in an armed conflict with a specific organization, not every Islamist militant in the world. But that authority has proved elastic. In 2014, for example, Mr. Obama declared that the 2001 law authorized him to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. An Army captain rejected that claim and argued that the Islamic State war was illegal because Congress had never explicitly approved it. Last week, a judge dismissed that lawsuit, without ruling on its merits. In Somalia, the United States had long taken the position that a handful of Shabab leaders, as individuals, had sufficient ties to Al Qaeda to make them wartime targets. But it has debated internally for years whether the Shabab as a whole, including their thousands of foot soldiers, can or should be declared part of the enemy. To qualify as an “associated force,” a group must be an organized armed body that has aligned with Al Qaeda and entered the fight against the United States or its partners. Officials declined to discuss whether there were specific new reasons to justify declaring that the Shabab could meet that standard. For now, the administration intends to continue its strategy in Somalia of primarily helping partner forces battle the Shabab  —   including carrying out airstrikes to defend them when they get into trouble during missions. It is not declaring Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” which would free up the American military to carry out airstrikes targeting   militants more expansively. In particular, officials said, Somalia  —   unlike Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Surt  —   will continue to be subject to the Presidential Policy Guidance, the set of 2013 rules for drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations outside conventional war zones. The 2013 rules apply restraints on the use of lethal force outside areas of active hostilities. They include   interagency review of proposed strikes and requirements that the target pose a threat to Americans  —   not just to American interests  —   and near certainty that no civilians would be killed. But the military always retains an inherent right to carry out strikes in its own defense, officials said, and it has conducted “collective  ” strikes to aid partners in Somalia with growing frequency over the past year. On March 5, the military carried out a huge airstrike in Somalia that killed over 150 people said to be Shabab fighters planning to attack an African Union base where American advisers were stationed. The military undertook the strike without consulting Washington policy makers, calling it a matter of  . The enormous death toll raised internal questions, officials said, about whether the   exception in the 2013 rules had become a loophole permitting more unconstrained warfare. The dilemma sharpened in the following months as   Somali government forces got into trouble and required “collective  ” airstrikes to bail them out, even though no American advisers faced direct threat. The emerging pattern, officials said, brought to the surface an inherent conflict between two principles of Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism strategy: his effort to impose constraints on airstrikes outside war zones, as reflected in the 2013 rules, and his “light footprint” approach of building up and working with partner forces rather than using American forces to occupy countries. One problem, the officials said, is that the 2013 rules were written against the backdrop of operations at the time in Yemen, in which drones based abroad flew over the country, took planned shots and flew out again. But when American advisers are on the ground working with partners, as they are in Somalia, both the Americans and their partners attract fire or get into combat situations and need to be defended. “I think it’s a real tension,” said Luke Hartig, who was the senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council until this year. “We ask countries to go into the fight against our counterterrorism adversaries, but we have a stated policy of not using force against groups unless they pose a continuing and imminent threat to Americans. ” “At the same time, we don’t want to just be everyone’s air force,” said Mr. Hartig, who is now a fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. The administration decided against exempting Somalia from the 2013 rules because its adherence to limits intended to avoid civilian casualties was seen as helping to maintain partner support for American operations. Another aspect of the dilemma the administration faces, the officials said, centers in part on the War Powers Resolution, a   War law that limits combat deployments that Congress has not authorized to 60 days. After the March 5 airstrike, the administration argued that the War Powers Resolution limits did not apply to strikes made both to aid African Union forces battling the Shabab and to defend American advisers. The idea was that Americans had been deployed to Somalia in part to counter   Shabab elements, so the 2001 authorization covered their presence and strikes to defend them from any threat. But as American partners have been going after the Shabab in general more often without any particular focus on individuals linked to Al Qaeda, it has been harder to point to any congressional authorization for such airstrikes that would satisfy the War Powers Resolution. As the election neared, the administration decided it would be irresponsible to hand off Somali counterterrorism operations to Mr. Obama’s successor with that growing tension unresolved. Now, as Mr. Zenko pointed out, “this administration leaves the Trump administration with tremendously expanded capabilities and authorities. ”",0
18405,Obama May Jump Into Fray as Democrats Counter Trump - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Obama is rethinking his plans to withdraw from the political arena after he leaves office next year, hinting to friends and supporters that he wants to add his voice to the shellshocked Democratic activists and elected officials who are now angrily vowing to oppose Donald J. Trump’s presidency. White House aides say they expect the president to try to refrain from criticism during the transition because of his belief in the importance of a courteous and dignified transfer of power. But while the president holds out hope that he might influence Mr. Trump, he has made it clear that once out of office he will not remain silent if Mr. Trump goes too far in undoing his legacy. “I’m going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen,” Mr. Obama, who will be living a few miles from the White House next year, told a meeting this past week of Organizing for Action, the group that maintains his political movement. “But that’s not so far off. ” Dozens of liberal advocacy groups, which have received a flood of donations and new members in the chaotic days since Mr. Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton, are gearing up for years of clashes with Mr. Trump. After eight years of advocacy on behalf of the Obama agenda, they are racing to recast themselves as bulwarks against Mr. Trump’s expected assault on an array of Democratic policies. The mobilization against Mr. Trump began even before his victory was official. At just after midnight on Election Day, panicked immigration rights activists gathered for a conference call to strategize. A few days later, more than 80 representatives of 57 progressive groups convened in the offices of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights in Washington. The mood was intense, angry and unforgiving, according to people who attended the confidential organizing session, which included representatives from labor, environmental groups, immigration activists, gay rights and civil rights organizations. Jim Messina, who managed Mr. Obama’s   campaign, offered brief remarks at the meeting, cautioning against any attempts to compromise and work with Mr. Trump. “Push back at every level,” Mr. Messina urged. No one in the room objected, one attendee said. Nan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, started calling law firms in Washington the day after the election, beginning the process of opposition research on Mr. Trump’s likely Supreme Court nominees. Dozens of lawyers eagerly signed up for what is sure to be a heated battle over the direction of the court for a generation. “They want to get involved,” she said. “They are worried about the new administration. ” Neera Tanden, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton and the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said her organization had begun hosting daily meetings and conference calls as it plots the best way to resist Mr. Trump. She called Mr. Trump’s first appointments extreme and said they had helped to “stiffen the spines” of Democrats. And she said the election had sparked a   awakening, with largely peaceful protests across the country. Two planned rallies in Washington  —   one for immigration and civil rights on Jan. 14, and another focused on women the day after the inauguration  —   were devised mostly by social media campaigns. Activists in Washington expect hundreds of thousands of people to gather for the second rally. But Ms. Tanden warned of dangers posed by the Trump administration, and warned against treating them “in normal Washington political terms. ” “I think the issue is, we do have the makings of an administration that could do more damage to democratic norms than any presidency in my lifetime,” she said. Some Democrats say they are eager for Mrs. Clinton to   after a period of recovery interrupted so far only by a speech to the Children’s Defense Fund on Wednesday. It is unclear when, or if, she might return to politics, though many Democrats said they would welcome it. “She’s one tough lady, and public service is in her blood,” said Representative Adam Schiff of California. “Don’t expect her to go quietly into that good night. ” But the immediate task of confronting Mr. Trump will fall to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Democratic leader. Mr. Schumer has already alarmed some progressives in Washington with his talk of trying to cut deals with the new president on issues where their interests align. But he said on Friday that Democrats in the Senate would not hesitate to confront Mr. Trump. “When he takes a divisive, nasty turn, when he just sides with special interests and gets   by the Republican right, we will oppose him tooth and nail,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview. That is not nearly enough for some liberal activists, who view Mr. Trump not as a traditional policy adversary to be challenged but a fundamental threat to democracy who must be confronted and destroyed. “This is a crisis of unparalleled dimension,” said Wade Henderson, the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of liberal groups in Washington. A disagreement over strategy threatens to sow division among Democrats, some of whom advocate finding ways to work with Mr. Trump. That approach could help senators who face   in 2018, especially in states where Mr. Trump trounced Mrs. Clinton. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia announced on Friday that he would support Mr. Trump’s nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Others, like Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, say Democrats should work with Mr. Trump in areas where they have similar goals (though Mr. Blumenthal also warned against ceding ground on issues like civil rights). By contrast, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whose fierce criticisms of Mr. Trump on the campaign trail often verged on the apocalyptic, rejects compromise with Mr. Trump. She says he is mounting an effort “to turn this country into something very different than it is. ” “On basic issues of humanity, we don’t give an inch,” she insisted in an interview on Friday. “Be very, very clear about what we won’t compromise on and very clear about what we’re fighting for. If we have clarity, the American people are with us. ” Senator Christopher Murphy of Connecticut reflected the uncertainty among Democrats, who are still trying to assess the implications of a Trump administration and how to respond. “We don’t know yet if it is a threat to democratic norms,” he said, “or to policy. ” For Mr. Obama, a return to the partisan fray was never the intention. His library and foundation will serve as a platform for him to travel around the world, confront systemic issues of race relations, and push for technological change aimed at improving society. But that vision assumed that his presidential legacy would be protected and nurtured by Mrs. Clinton in the Oval Office. In his remarks to activists, Mr. Obama urged them to stop moping and to ratchet up their opposition to Mr. Trump by Thanksgiving. He promised to join their cause soon after, telling them: “You’re going to see me early next year, and we’re going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff to do. ” He has echoed that message in private conversations, making it clear that he may not completely pattern himself after George W. Bush, who almost never criticized his successor. One friend of Mr. Obama’s, who requested anonymity to discuss private discussions with the president, said the election results seemed to have made him more willing to remain part of the political debate. “Everyone he talks to walks away with this impression,” the friend said. In an interview with The New Yorker this week, Mr. Obama said that if Mrs. Clinton had won the election, he might have just turned over the keys and walked away on Inauguration Day. With Mr. Trump’s victory, he said he felt “some responsibility to at least offer my counsel” to the Democratic Party’s political warriors he leaves behind in Washington. Exactly how  —   and when  —   Mr. Obama would once again engage in direct and public opposition to Mr. Trump’s agenda is unclear. “I don’t know what President Obama will do,” Ms. Tanden said. “But I know that he loves the foundations of democracy. If he thinks that’s threatened, I imagine he might speak out. ”",0
18406,Survival Pharmacy: 9 Ways To Use Ginger For Your Health,"Theresa Crouse November 13, 2016 Survival Pharmacy: 9 Ways To Use Ginger For Your Health 
Ginger has been used for centuries for medicinal and culinary purposes. Though we don’t use it commonly in much American cooking, you’re likely familiar with pickled ginger when you eat sushi and it’s also becoming a popular dried and candied product. 
The medicinal properties and ease of growth make ginger a plant that you should definitely be growing for your survival garden! 
I’ve been growing ginger in a potted plant inside, which is the best way to grow it if you live in a small space or a region that gets cold. It doesn’t like the cold, so if you live in a cooler area, you need to grow it indoors or outdoors in pots so that you can bring it inside before the frost. 
The actual growing part is easy but first, let’s clarify something. Ginger isn’t a root; it’s a rhizome. It does have roots, which are the long, hairy-looking parts that draw in moisture just like roots do for any other plant. Rhizomes are actually underground parts of the stem. They grow horizontally under the ground, with roots on the bottom. New stems grow from the top to the surface. 
It’s the rhizome part that we eat, but most people refer to it as ginger root, so we’ll still do the same. Ginger rhizomes grow buds, or eyes, similar to potatoes. Those are the parts that will grow. 
What Part do you Plant? 
Planting ginger is similar to planting potatoes; you plant the buds that grow off of the rhizome. On a potato, we call them eyes. You can buy the rhizome at your local garden store or order from a seed store. Another option is to just allow a ginger root that you buy from the grocery store to bud, then plant it. 
One problem with using one from a grocery store is that they’re often sprayed with growth inhibitors to keep them from budding while they’re on the shelf. You can soak the ginger to get as much of this off as possible, but you still may have problems getting it to bud. If you can, then go for it! 
Another problem with using a store-bought one is that it may have pesticides or herbicides on it. To resolve both problems you could buy organic. It’s a bit more expensive but if you can’t find anything at your local stores, then this is a good option. 
Perfect Growing Conditions 
Ginger likes rich, moist soil, partial or full shade, humidity, and warm weather. The soil needs to drain well in order for the rhizomes to develop. They grow horizontally, so they’re one of the few plants that flourish in shallow containers. I live in Florida, so my soil is sandy and the weather is, of course, temperate so I could plant outside if I wanted to. 
I just scoop soil right out of the ground for my dirt, then mix it half and half with compost . Since I use a pot (actually a rectangular box) and rich soil I don’t add any type of fertilizer. The plant will only grow 2-3 feet tall and it smells great. 
If you plant it outside in soil that’s less than ideal, or if you get a lot of rain, give it a drink of the fertilizer or compost tea of your choice every couple of weeks or so. The reason for this is that when it rains, the water washes all the nutrients out of the soil. 
Put mulch around it too. That helps keep the moisture in and it nourishes the plant as the mulch decomposes. It also helps keep out weeds because ginger is pretty delicate and other plants will plow it right over. It doesn’t like wind, either. 
So … to recount, no wind, no cold, no full sun, and not too much water. Instead, it likes rich, well-draining soil, moderate moisture, and partial sun or shade. 
Preparing and Planting 
If your rhizome has more than one bud, you can cut it into pieces, leaving a bud on each piece, then plant them. You can also just plant the entire thing. Let the rhizomes soak overnight, then bury them 3-6 inches deep and water sparingly, just enough to moisten the soil. Some people prefer to let them sit in water until the grow roots before they plant them, but I haven’t found that to be necessary. 
Best time to plant is late winter/early spring as long as you’re not planting outside in a cold zone. If you live in a tropical zone, plant it at the end of the dry season/beginning of rainy season. 
You don’t need much space to plant enough ginger to get you through the year. Each rhizome will only produce a few leaves the first year and they don’t mind living in close quarters. Plant them 6-8 inches apart and they’ll be fine. Video first seen on DIY Home and Garden . 
Harvesting Ginger 
This is the best part! Once your ginger has been growing for three or four months, you can trim pieces of the rhizome off of it simply by digging through the soil to the side of the plant and just nipping a piece off the end, then covering it back up. This green ginger won’t be quite as flavorful as ripe ginger, but it’s still good. 
You can also wait until the end of the season and harvest the ginger when the plant starts to die off. This takes about ten months to happen. If the temperature allows (or if you’re growing inside), you can replant right away. Harvest all of the ginger, break the rhizomes apart, and separate out a few that have good buds. 
Toss those back in the ground or pot and use the rest. Ginger freezes well. You can also store it for several months in a root cellar, slice it thinly and dehydrate it, candy it, or pickle it. If you dry it, you can grind it into ginger powder that is great for baking or medicinal use. 
Medicinal Uses for Ginger 
Now we’re down the heart of the matter – why growing ginger is a good thing for a prepper to do. The active ingredient in ginger – gingerol – is an antibiotic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant. It’s also an anti-coagulant. There’s a reason ginger is considered a superfood! 
1. Heart Disease and Stroke 
Since it’s an anti-coagulant, which means it prevents your blood from clotting, it can help you avoid heart attacks and strokes. Its antioxidant properties also help fight free radicals that cause heart disease, so it’s a double whammy. 
2. Stomach Upset, Heartburn, and other GI problems 
Ginger has been used in holistic medicine for centuries to treat all sorts of upper gastrointestinal problems. It’s good for stomach upset, heartburn, constipation, bloating, and even morning sickness during pregnancy. That’s because it helps induce the stomach to release its contents into the small intestine. 
It’s also effective at treating ulcers. 
This is now officially backed by science. I actually use it to get rid of heartburn by eating a slice or two of candied ginger. You can also drink it in a tea for quick relief. 
3. Motion Sickness 
Though this is going to be a short section, it’s well warranted because ginger has actually been shown in at least one study to treat motion sickness, especially seasickness, more effectively than Dramamine! Ginger doesn’t just ease the nausea; it treats ALL of the symptoms: nausea, cold sweats, and dizziness. 
4. Strengthens Immune System 
Interestingly enough, ginger’s beneficial effect on digestion also helps your immune system because, in addition to the antioxidants, a healthy digestive tract is required for proper nutrient absorption. 
Not only that, gingerol has the effect of boosting your body temperature – maybe that’s why gingerbread is so great in the winter! –which may help remove toxins that prevent your immune system from functioning properly. 
5. Arthritis, Muscle Soreness, and Joint Pain 
Since gingerol is an anti-inflammatory, it’s extremely effective at relieving the pain and swelling of arthritis. People with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis report noticeable relief of pain as well as increased mobility when they consume ginger regularly. 
Have you had a rough workout? Eat some ginger or drink ginger tea. You’ll feel better shortly! 
This isn’t just something that “people say”. It’s been quantitatively measured in studies where arthritic inflammation was measurably decreased. In other words – it works!! 
6. Fight Staph and Strep 
Again, science prevails. Recent studies have shown that ginger essential oil was more effective than traditional antibiotics at treating staph and strep infections. If nothing else, it won’t hurt to take it if you’re going to be in a hospital or round somebody who’s sick. 
And if you’re sick, ginger doesn’t interact with other medications so you can’t do any harm! Oh, and other studies have shown that it’s just as effective on other types of bacteria. 
7. Diabetes 
This is extremely new research, but it’s big, especially since we, as preppers, don’t have any way to prepare for life without access to many life-saving medications. Insulin is one of those drugs that are absolutely critical for survival but doesn’t have an effective natural alternative – at least until (hopefully) now. 
Two grams of ginger powder per day was shown to decrease resting blood sugar by 12 percent. Instead of getting really scientific here, I’m just going to give you a link to the research findings so that you can see the details and additional results. 
8. Menstrual Pain 
One gram of ginger powder per day works as well for many women to relieve menstrual cramps and pain as ibuprofen. 
9. Enhance Brain Function and Prevent Alzheimer’s 
Because of the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger, studies have shown that it can help prevent cognitive decline. It can also help prevent disorders such as Alzheimer’s, which wasn’t’ actually a surprise to me once I read the results of the diabetes study – Alzheimer’s has actually been commonly referred to in many circles in recent years as Type 3 diabetes. 
You can reap any of these benefits by eating ginger raw, candied, or by making a tea with it. You can also juice it, but I’ve found that to be ineffective in a manual juicer. Even in an electric juicer, you don’t get much juice from ginger and it requires a high-power juicer because it’s so hard. 
There’s also the option of making an essential oil, which isn’t as difficult as you may think. 
Ginger is an amazing food that’s easy to grow, doesn’t take up much space, and has medicinal properties that could very well save lives if SHTF. 
I hope that this information has helped. I seriously drink this particular Kool-Aid so I know for a fact that it works, at least for stomach problems and joint pain, so I’m happy to vouch for it from a personal standpoint. There are many other benefits – I just touched on a few of the most important ones here. 
I’ve discussed the health benefits of garlic and other plants for the same reason – grow them, too!

18407,"Former DOJ Spokesman SLAMS ‘Inappropriate’ FBI Statement On Hillary Emails (TWEETS, VIDEOS)","Former DOJ Spokesman SLAMS ‘Inappropriate’ FBI Statement On Hillary Emails (TWEETS, VIDEOS) By Darrell Lucus   FBI director James Comey giving a briefing on the Orlando massacre ( image courtesy FBI’s Flickr feed, part of public domain) 
On Friday afternoon, FBI director James Comey sent the political world into a tailspin when he announced his agency had discovered emails that could potentially be related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private email server. However, the manner in which he did it has the Department of Justice’s former chief spokesman up in arms . 
Read part of the letter here, via NBC News’ Bradd Jaffy. FBI Director Comey, in letter to members of Congress, says FBI is investigating additional emails in Clinton private server case pic.twitter.com/Ue0qlhqT5w 
— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 
When Matthew Miller, the head of the DOJ’s office of public affairs from 2008 to 2011, learned about this letter, he hit the ceiling. In an epic tweetstorm, Miller slammed Comey’s decision to make this disclosure in the manner that he did. This is such an inappropriate public disclosure by Comey. And sadly the latest in a long string of them. https://t.co/8MgrH9UKlR 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Comey refused to even tell Congress if FBI was investigating Trump camp for Russia hack, but regular updates on Clinton are apparently A-ok. 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 
Earlier this summer, Miller had criticized the tone of Comey’s press conference announcing that there was no basis for criminal charges against Hillary. In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Miller said that Comey’s decision to “editorialize” Hillary’s behavior was “not grounded in any position in law.” In his Friday tweetstorm, Miller blasted the FBI for sending details of the investigation to Congress. He flagrantly violated DOJ rules with his press conference. Then went on to break new ground discussing details of the case to Congress…2/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Followed by quickly releasing FBI 302's, something they rarely do, and which I doubt they will do for future high-profile cases. 3/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 
To Miller’s mind, this paled in comparison to the decision to publicly disclose this latest discovery, given that we are less than two weeks from Election Day. But today's disclosure might be worst abuse yet. DOJ goes out of its way to avoid publicly discussing investigations close to election. 5/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Not just public discussion either. Often won't send subpoenas or take other steps that might leak until after an election is over…6/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Why? Because voters have no way to interpret FBI/DOJ activity in a neutral way. Who is the target of an investigation? What conduct? 7/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 This might be totally benign & not even involve Clinton. But no way for press or voters to know that. Easy for opponent to make hay over. 8/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 Which takes us back to the original rule: you don't comment on ongoing investigations. Then multiply that times ten close to an election. 9/ 
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) October 28, 2016 

Miller’s hunch was confirmed later in the day as more details dribbled out. It turns out that the FBI discovered these emails while investigating former Congressman Anthony Weiner for inappropriate texts with a minor. The emails were found on a device Weiner shared with his estranged wife, longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin. 
According to NBC News’ Pete Williams, however, there doesn’t appear to be anything that even comes close to a smoking gun–at least for now. Williams discussed his findings on MSNBC on Friday afternoon; watch here, via Jaffy’s Twitter. NBC’s Pete Williams: Sr. officials say—During separate investigation “a device” led to add'l emails–not from Clinton https://t.co/QmmNoxXhOx 
— Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 28, 2016 
Williams went further in another MSNBC interview later in the afternoon; watch here. 
Williams believes that there are two questions–whether the number of emails changed, and whether anyone withheld evidence. His FBI sources tell him that those emails were not withheld by Hillary or her campaign. Moreover, the emails are not from Hillary. That raises the obvious question–was there any defensible reason to make such a disclosure? 
Miller thinks there wasn’t, and told CNN’s Jake Tapper so later that afternoon. Watch here. 
Miller said that longstanding DOJ practice calls for the department and its various agencies to avoid doing anything that could potentially influence the results of an election within 60 days of Election Day. When Tapper asked Miller if the FBI could have been accused of bias toward Hillary had Comey remained silent, Miller said he didn’t think so in this case because “there’s no information to be released.” That letter never disclosed what triggered this new review, and thus forces Hillary to “defend against a negative.” 
Understandably, Hillary’s campaign wants to know that justified this disclosure from the FBI. Campaign chairman John Podesta issued a burning statement demanding answers from the FBI. Statement from @johnpodesta in response to Comey letter to GOP chairmen pic.twitter.com/egyUMl68ZC 
— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) October 28, 2016 
Hillary herself called for an explanation as well while on the stump in Iowa. 
Unless Comey is willing to give an explanation, I can only agree with Miller–this disclosure was grossly inappropriate. About Darrell Lucus

18409,Michael Oliver – Another Look At The Big Picture For Gold After Brutal Takedown,"68   King World News 
On the heels of a continued takedown in the gold and silver markets and chaos in bond markets, today King World News is pleased to present an extremely important update on the war in the gold market from Michael Oliver at MSA. Oliver allowed KWN exclusively to share this key report with our global audience after today’s takedown in the gold market. 
A more complete report is available to MSA subscribers, but here are a few key portions of today’s major update on the gold market: 
By Michael Oliver, MSA (Momentum Structural Analysis) November 23 ( King World New s) – Gold futures (the nearest active contract) in a price point-and-figure format chart. $20×3 block reversal since the 2011 peak (see chart below). 
Around $1240 in February of this year (black arrow) price broke through a 45° downtrending resistance line that traced back to the 2011 peak above $1900. 
What Does It All Mean? Action has since worked upward and to the right of the breakout (annual momentum, shown in the next chart, broke out at $1140 to $1160 in February, about $100 before price broke out). Note the flat floor of price readings at $1200, now there for a third time. If one references price only, then a litmus test is to take out the prior flat lows at $1200 with an $1180 print (December gold). $1180 has not yet been traded, with the low so far on Wednesday just above there. Any three upticks following that will likely generate a turn that “takes.” Meaning if we see $1180, then $1240 is an escape to the upside signal. If price halts at $1200, never touching $1180, then $1260 provides those upticks… IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world – CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
If $1200 does come out with an $1180 downtick, then look across the chart and you’ll see that $1180 has twice been a pivotal balance point. During the crash gold low of June 2013, and the rally high just before the drive to the late 2015 low (low then was a set of downticks to $1060). So dropping back to $1180 will touch that pivotal horizontal level again, as noted by the red line. 
If one wanted to use this price point and figure tool exclusively, then while $1180 is acceptable, especially if we get three upticks after that (back up to $1240), $1160 is not so good looking. Let’s look at a totally different type of chart now. MSA’s long-term annual momentum chart of gold. 
A Look Back At How We Got Here Looking back: 3-yr. avg. momentum was the prime indicator that shifted MSA to major bear in January 2012 (either side of $1700). At that point a very clear 3-point momentum uptrend structure was broken below. And subsequent action never was able to get back above that level, particularly not on a monthly closing basis. Noted with the red line (see charts below). 
Then in February 2016 the same indicator broke out upside through a flat multi-year base as price moved through $1140- $1160 zone, which caused annual momentum to again move through its new key structural red line. Current pullback is the sharpest one since the bull emerged and is somewhat reminiscent of the sharp rally in late 2012 which reached to the upper $1700s (from prior lows in mid-$1500s). That rally tested our bearish resolve then. While that rally was impressive on price, on momentum it was not so impressive. It simply was not altering to the damage already done earlier in 2012. 
Now we have a decline that did not reach clear resistance (around 20% over the zero line/3-yr. avg., black horizontal arrow), meaning that it is basically turning down from the middle of nowhere, technically speaking. And at the present time is only nearing the levels on momentum that generated the upside breakout. And so far it’s the first pullback that involves double-digit percent drop for momentum (about a 15% downswing when measured from its percentage peak above the 3-yr. avg. which is $1244 this year, to its current percentage low below that average). 
THE BIG PICTURE: MSA Remains Bullish On Gold! Does the drop negate anything? No. At what level would MSA say that the integrity of the positive momentum uptrend is in jeopardy or at least in serious doubt? Close out a month back below the red horizontal. That’s 8.5% or more below the 3-yr. avg. which for this year means don’t close a month out at $1138 or lower. 
This is the BIG PICTURE of gold from MSA’s vantage point. (Greater specifics and more detailed shorter-term analysis are available to our institutional subscribers). Whether you find it useful depends upon your time-scale of measurement and what’s significant to you. If you are a trader then maybe getting within a few percent of that annual momentum support level (prior upside breakout level) presents you with a risk control level and therefore can buy with low risk. But otherwise this particular trend indicator (annual momentum) only changes major trend every several or handful of years, and while it might provide some intra-trend points of reference (such as that +20% level on the oscillator which was resistance, though not reached) often is only a broad guide to which side has the upper hand. And unless we see a close back inside that momentum chart base, MSA assumes this is simply a sharp corrective pullback. 
Keep A Close Eye On Silver Many watch the gold/silver relationship as an indicator of the net trend of the precious metals. If silver is in a positive trend vs. gold it is deemed to be a positive factor for ongoing bull trend in these metals. Or, for the spread chart shown here, if the trend of these readings turns down that indicates positive performance by silver vs. gold, as it requires fewer ozs. of silver to buy 1 oz. of gold. 
Current upticks on this chart are not negating in the least the major multi-year trend shift that occurred earlier this year. The silver/gold relationship still bodes well for higher silver and gold prices.

18411,Watch George Michael Perform Live: 5 Memorable Videos - The New York Times,"George Michael, the English songwriter and pop star who died at 53 on Sunday, was a reliably outstanding live performer, though after a world tour promoting his album “Faith” in 1988 and 1989, he turned away from the road. He never gave his 1990 album “Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1” a proper tour, instead performing a set of cover songs in 1991 before he took a lengthy break from the road. He returned to the stage in 2006, and reached the United States two years later with a show that demonstrated he had no intention of becoming an oldies act, as The New York Times’s chief pop, critic Jon Pareles, wrote at the time. Here are five performances from 1985 to 2008 that showcase Mr. Michael’s range as a live artist: [ Why George Michael mattered | Read the obituary ] “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me,” George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley with Elton John at Live Aid, 1985 In 1991, a live version of George Michael and Elton John’s duet, written by Mr. John and Bernie Taupin, reached No. 1 in the United States and Britain. But the duo had performed it live for the first time six years earlier during Mr. John’s set at Live Aid, where he introduced Mr. Michael as someone he admired “very much for his musical talent, more than anything else. ” In his trademark sunglasses and leather jacket, Mr. Michael commanded the stage  —   so much so that at the 4:30 mark, Mr. John starts grinning and pointing at Mr. Michael with approval and pride. “Somebody to Love,” George Michael and Queen at Wembley Stadium, 1992 An array of artists appeared alongside Queen to honor the band’s frontman at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, including Axl Rose, Liza Minnelli, David Bowie and Seal. But Mr. Michael’s performances at the event were particularly inspired  —   in 1993, he released an EP of live tracks from the show, including “Somebody to Love,” the 1976 Queen song with a swooping vocal line that beautifully displayed Mr. Michael’s silky range. “Freedom! ’90” at the MTV Europe Awards, 1994 George Michael performed twice at the MTV Europe Awards in 1994. He opened the show with this exuberant rendition of “Freedom! ’90,” and then returned to debut the far more somber “Jesus to a Child,” a tribute to his partner, Anselmo Feleppa, who had died of an   illness. The first performance put the spotlight on Mr. Michael’s energetic showmanship. The arrangement accentuated the song’s soulfulness, with a chorus of backup singers approximating an ecstatic choir, especially as Mr. Michael moved into the song’s bridge around the   mark. “Everything She Wants” on “MTV Unplugged,” 1996 Mr. Michael was always as comfortable stripping his songs down to their bare elements as he was gliding across a stage shaking his hips (an acoustic guitar was perhaps the most memorable weapon in his arsenal, thanks to “Faith”). In his “MTV Unplugged” performance, he gave this Wham! hit a remake with eight powerhouse backup singers. “Careless Whisper” at Earl’s Court, 2008 Mr. Michael returned to live performance in 2006 for his first extensive run of live shows in 15 years. The tour, which stretched into 2008, was billed as a sort of 25th anniversary concert, and it featured songs from across his career, including “Too Funky,” “Father Figure” and “Kissing a Fool. ” Each leg of the tour, however, included “Careless Whisper,” one of Mr. Michael’s biggest hits. The only crime here is that the crowd shouts the majority of the     bridge: At the 2:36 mark, Mr. Michael generously lets the audience take the lead with “you know you want to!”",0
18412,Muslim Women in Hijab Break Barriers: ‘Take the Good With the Bad’ - The New York Times,"When Ginella Massa, a   TV reporter, recently accepted a request to host an evening newscast, she was not planning or expecting to make history for wearing a hijab. She was just covering for a colleague who wanted to go to a hockey game. And that’s how Ms. Massa, who works at CityNews in Toronto, became the first Canadian woman to host a newscast from a large media company while wearing the head scarf. Her newscast, broadcast on Nov. 17, became the subject of social media celebration, and news sites around the world heralded her. “It’s been a little insane the last two weeks,” Ms. Massa, 29, said in an interview. “My phone hasn’t stopped ringing. I’m still working, so I’m trying to field calls and messages and everything in between. ” Ms. Massa’s newscast was one of a string of recent stories about young   women, or hijabis, who have pushed boundaries by strolling into spaces where the standards of appearance tend to be restrictive. Nura Afia, a    from Colorado, was hired as a CoverGirl makeup ambassador. And Halima Aden, a    from Minnesota, was a contestant in a beauty pageant. Ms. Aden sported a hijab and, during the swimwear portion of the competition, a burkini. “All my relatives in Somalia are like, ‘We don’t know what pageants are,’ ” Ms. Aden told NPR, “ ‘but congratulations.’ ” This new trend of inclusion occurs amid a more sinister one, as reported hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise in the United States and Canada. The F. B. I. says that a surge in hate crimes against Muslims has led to an overall increase in hate crimes in the United States Muslims have borne the brunt of the increase with 257 recorded attacks. A spike in bias attacks has been reported since the election of Donald J. Trump, with episodes ranging from an attack against a Muslim police officer in New York City to vandalism of a mosque in Massachusetts. (The crimes, which include   and racist attacks, are so frequent The Times is tracking them weekly.) In Canada, where Ms. Massa has lived since she was a year old, the number of reported hate crimes has dropped slightly overall, but the number of recorded attacks against Muslims has grown: 99 attacks were reported in 2014, according to an analysis by the news site Global News of data from Statistics Canada, a government agency. That number doubled from the 45 reported in 2012. On Twitter, Ms. Massa has been flooded with compliments for her work on CityNews, but with the good comes an influx of hateful messaging. “The more exposure I get,” Ms. Massa said, “the more hate I get. Which I guess comes with the territory. ” She added: “You take the good with the bad. ” Her colleagues, who have also received hate mail, have spoken out publicly in Ms. Massa’s defense. When it comes to her detractors, Ms. Massa has adopted the following credo: “That negative reaction comes from reading a headline and seeing a photo and deciding they don’t like the way I look. That’s not my problem. That’s theirs. ” In that vein,   instances of inclusion will continue. Companies are responding to a demand that is clear in commerce and expansive on social media: The Muslim cosmetics and care market is projected to reach $80 billion by 2020. Last year, HM hired a hijabi model who was discovered on Instagram. Elsewhere on the platform, an account featuring a   Barbie, Hijarbie, has more than 76, 000 followers. A Muslim teenager has created a plan to bring hijabi emojis to phone keyboards everywhere. And Ms. Afia was discovered after amassing a following on YouTube. Not everyone wants to see a woman in a head scarf represented in popular culture, and that even includes some Muslim women, who believe that a hijab represents only one side of a large and diverse religion. Even the word “hijab” belies how complex the uses of the scarf can be: It’s a catchall term for scarves that differ by type and trend. Not all Muslim women wear head coverings. Some believe the hijab is not a religious requirement, while others view it as a symbol of oppression. The reasons a woman chooses to wear a hijab can be highly personal, with some seeing modesty as its own form of empowerment. “We live in a strange society where walking around half naked is acceptable but being modest and covering up is frowned upon,” a   reader named Safiya told The Times in 2015. Celene Ibrahim, a Muslim chaplain at Tufts University, said that these examples of Muslim women wearing the hijab were encouraging but that they also highlighted obstacles to come. In particular, the visible symbol suggests a uniformity in the Muslim community that is not accurate. The community looks very different “depending on who you ask,” Ms. Ibrahim said in an interview. “And I think that diversity is something that people are really struggling to get their minds around. ” She added: “There’s also the sense that Muslims would just like to be able to participate in American culture without necessarily feeling the stigma of always having to represent Muslims. ”",0
18413,How Should Hillary Clinton Choose a Running Mate? Start With Chemistry - The New York Times,"In a college gymnasium this month in Newark, Senator Cory A. Booker introduced Hillary Clinton to the crowd. It took him nearly 13 minutes. He piled praise on her and bashed her Republican rival, quoting Thomas Jefferson, Maya Angelou, Abraham Lincoln and even a 1980s song by Jon Bon Jovi, a New Jersey native. “I hate to contradict Bon Jovi,” Mr. Booker said. “But dear God, Hillary Clinton, you give love a good name. ” Mrs. Clinton waved her arms in the air, as if marking the end of a tent revival that lasted a touch too long. She patted Mr. Booker on the back, a much less effusive embrace than the one she had given to Mr. Bon Jovi, who was standing nearby. Ambitious Democrats like Mr. Booker have started to audition as their presumptive presidential nominee considers who should join her on the national ticket. There is much for Mrs. Clinton to consider, including competence, agreement on policy and geography. Yet Mrs. Clinton’s advisers and those who have gone through the process emphasize an equally important, if more elusive, quality: chemistry. Mrs. Clinton needs a No. 2 who can ease into the insular and often distrusting Clinton orbit. And a running mate whose company Mrs. Clinton genuinely enjoys could help present a joyful picture to voters, after a primary season that was sometimes dreary. “When the chemistry works, it communicates enthusiasm and a team and the likelihood of success and progress,” said Michael Feldman, who was an aide to former Vice President Al Gore. “But it can’t be an arranged marriage with someone she meshes well with on paper,” he added. “It very much has to be real. ” Mrs. Clinton’s aides began collecting information last week on as many as 10 candidates. James Hamilton, a Washington lawyer who is overseeing the vetting, will begin meeting with candidates as early as this week. Senior Democrats, thinking about both the fall election and a potential   in four years, said the right choice would stir up enthusiasm on the campaign trail, enhancing Mrs. Clinton’s strengths while not outshining her or overtaking events. Mrs. Clinton is warm and personable one on one, the Democrats said, which creates an easy camaraderie when she teams up with people she likes. In San Antonio, Mrs. Clinton seemed to light up in the presence of Julián Castro, the city’s former mayor and now the secretary of housing in the Obama administration. She grabbed his hand and thrust it skyward at an outdoor rally, and the two glided naturally on the rope line, snapping selfies. The photos from the event, with Mrs. Clinton, 68, beaming next to Mr. Castro, 41, turned out so well that cable networks often show the campaign’s images of the two together on screen when Mrs. Clinton calls in for phone interviews. On a Saturday night in Youngstown, Ohio, Representative Tim Ryan and Mrs. Clinton made a surprise visit to O’Donold’s Irish Pub and Grill for a couple pints of Guinness. Mrs. Clinton leaned comfortably on the bar next to Mr. Ryan and smiled widely as “Born in the U. S. A. ” blared from the jukebox. Mr. Ryan, holding his pint in the air, as the packed bar followed suit, said, “To Hillary! The next president of the United States. ” Mrs. Clinton threw her head back and laughed, then took a long swig of beer. Last month, at a stop at the Court Street Diner in Athens, Ohio, Mrs. Clinton warmly embraced Senator Sherrod Brown, whose policy expertise Mrs. Clinton has said she admires. They made their way, practically arm in arm, through the narrow   diner, talking to voters and meeting a developmentally disabled man, Noah, whom Mr. Brown introduced to Mrs. Clinton as “my friend. ” “How can you not love Athens?” Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. Brown nodded. Dr. Lillian Glass, a body language expert, was struck by Mrs. Clinton’s ease with Mr. Brown. “Her body is leaning into his, and she never leans into anybody. She adores that guy,” she said in a telephone interview. “And you can tell that he knows his place. You don’t see him trying to take over. ” In many ways, Mrs. Clinton’s search mirrors that of George Bush, who already had deep relationships with major players in Washington by the time he captured the Republican nomination in 1988, Dan Quayle, his running mate, said in an interview. The contenders most frequently mentioned by her advisers and senior Democrats close to the campaign include Senator Michael Bennet, from the key state of Colorado Thomas E. Perez, President Obama’s secretary of labor and a Hispanic civil rights lawyer Representative Xavier Becerra of California and Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both former governors from Virginia. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a favorite of liberal Democrats, though an   ticket is unlikely. All of these candidates have relationships with Mrs. Clinton, and several have appeared with her at campaign events. “This isn’t a   thing,” Mr. Quayle said in a phone interview. “It’s much more the feeling of the two principals, and someone she’s going to feel comfortable with every day. ” Still, a connection can take hold between two candidates on a presidential ticket who are just getting to know each other. In 1992, Bill Clinton selected Mr. Gore, another youthful Southern Democrat, to reinforce his message that a new kind of Democratic Party was emerging. The two men and their young families proved an electric combination on the campaign trail. In a telephone interview, Walter Mondale recalled when he and his wife, Joan, first met with Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter in Georgia in 1976. “Joan said, ‘He’s going to pick you,’” Mr. Mondale said. “I said, ‘Why?’ and she said, ‘Because we all get along perfectly.’ And we still do today. ” Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not know each other well when the Obama campaign decided the first   nominee of a major party needed a scrappy and experienced running mate who could appeal to white   voters. Mrs. Clinton has made clear she wants a partner who shares her granular knowledge of policy and who she will enjoy working closely with in the West Wing. Although she is at ease with younger hopefuls like Mr. Castro, Mrs. Clinton has also relished policy conversations with Mr. Perez, a favorite of labor unions, her advisers said. (Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has expressed concern that selecting Mr. Brown would leave a vacancy in the Senate that a Republican would probably be appointed to fill.) Mrs. Clinton may be forced to ignore such factors, Democrats said, and think about whom she most prefers to spend the next four to eight years working with. “It’s like getting married without any divorce proceedings possible,” Mr. Mondale said. The partnership extends to the running mates’ spouses, who will spend ample time together, and in Mrs. Clinton’s case includes an opinionated former president. Nancy Reagan famously did not like Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, but Mr. Bush was determined to “show his skills in figuring out how to make Reagan his friend,” said Joel K. Goldstein, a professor and   expert at Saint Louis University School of Law. Michael S. Dukakis said that he had not spent much time with Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas before he picked him as his running mate in 1988, but that they ended up getting along well, adding, “Our wives had a great relationship. ” Of course, Mr. Dukakis ran years before social media and a hyperkinetic press corps dissected every aspect of the most critical partnership in politics. That means the comfort level has to be real, or the internet will pick up on any hint of tension and turn it viral. In fact, interest in how the first female presidential nominee at the top of a major ticket would interact with a   nominee is such a source of speculation and intrigue, it has inspired Hollywood writers. In HBO’s comedy “Veep,” Selina Meyer, the foulmouthed title character portrayed by Julia   who stumbled her way into the presidency, is hilariously overshadowed by her charming and more competent running mate. “You never want a vice president that makes people start to think, ‘Boy, it’s a shame he or she isn’t at the top of the ticket,’” said David H. Mandel, an executive producer of the show. “It’s that magical balance. ”",0
18414,U.N. Human Rights Office Has ’Concern’ over Burundi Youth Militia ’Rape Song’ - Breitbart,"The United Nations Human Rights Commission has expressed concerns about a video that captures members of a   youth militia in Burundi singing about raping their adversaries. [“Impregnate those opponents, so that they give birth to Imbonerakure,” says the troubling verse in the song.  The Imbonerakure are the youth wing of President Pierre Nkurunziza’s party (“youth” defined as “any party member age 35 or younger,” according to an NPR report on the group). Their name means “those who see far” in the Kurundi language. The opposition in Burundi has accused the Imbonerakure of militant violence, including dressing up as policemen to attack opposition demonstrators. Some of this violence has resulted in fatalities, as the militia has been known to use machetes and grenades in its attacks. The military has allegedly provided guns and explosives to the Imbonerakure. In rural Burundi, they are said to have more power than the military or police. Nkurunziza’s   party denies the most damaging allegations against the Imbonerakure or distances itself from the youth militia when it becomes politically inconvenient. The latter course seems to have been pursued here. At first, the   claimed the video showing the “rape song” was a fake filmed outside Burundi, but later it admitted the footage was authentic and said the song “does not conform to the morals or ideology” of the party. A spokesman for the U. N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told Voice of America the Imbonerakure are waging a campaign of terror across Burundi that includes “horrendous” acts of torture such as “people being burnt with hot knives, acid being poured over parts of their body, teeth broken with rifle butts,” and “attacks on sexual organs. ” “These grotesque rape chants by the young men of the Imbonerakure across several provinces across Burundi are deeply alarming  —   particularly because they confirm what we have been hearing from those who have fled Burundi about a campaign of fear and terror by this organized militia,” said spokesman Rupert Colville. He added that his office has received reports of at least eight large rallies that included songs and slogans promoting rape and violence, and that senior government officials were present at some of them. Burundi has been teetering on the edge of civil war for years. The previous civil war ended in 2005, after killing some 300, 000 people, with a peace plan that limited Nkurunziza to two terms in office. However, he ran for and won a third term, claiming that his first term in office was ordained by parliament instead of the popular vote, so it should not count against the constitutional term limit. Burundi’s constitutional court accepted this argument, but many citizens did not. His government has become increasingly repressive, especially after a failed coup attempt against him in 2015. Burundi is one of those nations where “insulting the president” is a crime punishable by jail time, even if the perpetrators are high school children. Much of the political violence in Burundi has an ethnic component, as the   is a party of the Hutu tribe, while many victims of oppression are members of the Tutsi minority, the same tribal conflict that turned Rwanda into a bloodbath. The U. N. High Commission for Human Rights chronicles numerous complaints of violence and the incitement to violence by   officials and the Imbonerakure militia, noting that “coded language” about raping adversaries or making them disappear is all too easy to decode in a nation only a few years removed from bloody civil war. “The Government needs to stop pretending that the Imbonerakure are nothing but a community development group,” said High Commissioner Zeid Ra’ad  . “Such blatant and brazen hate speech and incitement to violence must not be tolerated, nor encouraged. In a region which has suffered so many massive outbreaks of violence and atrocities, this type of organized incitement rings very loud alarm bells. ”",0
18415,"Part 6, Democratic Network Money: Commons Money that Works for Us, Instead of Us Working for It","License DMCA "" If we regard money as a thing, it becomes a given, and we lose our ability to change it in any way. . . . When we understand that money is created by a set of understandings and practices, we can begin examining the terms of these agreements to see whether they actually serve our collective aspirations and objectives. Currencies can be redesigned to better meet our needs."" Bernard Lietaer In the first article of this series, following Lietaer, we defined money for what it is; an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange. We noted that money is not stuff in the normal sense. Instead, it is numbers in a system of accounting. Sometimes something physical is used to represent the numbers in this accounting system, but it is just that, a symbol, not the money itself. Our current money has no physical representation. We then discussed how money works in its simplest form; a mutual accounting system. We noted that money involves commitments and claims on commitment. Commitments relate to debits, and claims on commitment relate to credits in the accounting system. In this analysis we intentionally did not use the commonly recited functions of money; medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, and standard of deferred payment. The reason is that the latter two functions replace and obscure the fact that money is the measure of commitment and claims on commitment, which underlie store and standard. In the second article , we discussed the social implications of money, and the concept of capital. We introduced the rights/responsibility equation; how in a democracy, with every right there is a corresponding responsibility, commitments and claims on commitment being an example of the more general concept. We went on to define money capital;money capital is a large claim on commitment, and it relies on the commitment of its users to get this claim; again an example of fact that for every credit, there is a corresponding debit, following the rights/responsibility equation. In the third article , we described our present private-for-profit money system, and noted that in the present system, the rights/responsibility equation is ignored. Money is created by fiat, without acknowledging that the money created represents a commitment on the part of all of its users to the operation and stability of the money issue. The fact that this commitment is not acknowledged gives the managers of the money system great power over its users. They decide what money is to be created for, and what actions it will support. Money is created for its creator's profit. In support of this argument, we disaggregated profit, demonstrating its two functions; providing compensation for time and effort exerted, and an unearned portion that is a private tax on the market. This private tax goes to the owners of the banking system and for profit businesses. - Advertisement - In the fourth article , we discussed alternatives that are currently being considered. We found that Central Government created fiat money has many of the characteristics of private-for-profit money. It is a top down, authority managed form of money that again ignores the commitment of its users to its operation and stability. A second weakness is that it leaves in place the private-for-profit banks as the interface between the users of the money and its creators. Thus the issue of the unearned private tax on its users is not properly dealt with. It is noted that historically, government created money has, over time been corrupted and taken over by the bankers, because of this weakness. In the fifth article we discussed natural and human capital. We noted that natural capital was here before humans came on the scene, and that it was treated as a commons by early man. We noted that the concept of private ownership depends on violence and power, not democratic decision making; that those who promoted private property promoted it to gain power, not to promote democracy. We pointed out that the drive for profit as the primary directive of the present money system is a major motivation for militarism, bullying, and the promotion of fear and anger. This contrasts with the values underlying simple money; to value its users and manage their mutual provisioning. The work of Henry George and Elinor Ostrom was shown to support the concepts of simple money. In this final article of the series we discuss a method for moving from our present money system to the use of simple money. Following the edict that we don't concentrate on what is wrong, but on creating something that serves those of us who use it, and exhibits values that are consistent with what we need and want, we create a new system, and let the old one go its own way, as it doesn't serve our use. - Advertisement - Unlike government issued money, simple money requires no legislation for its introduction; it can be introduced by its users. It will initially not be coin of the realm; useful in payment of taxes, but it will be useful to its users, and will demonstrate this usefulness to them, and those they deal with. Acceptance can be gradual, as approval is gained. It can support alternative businesses and institutions in their development and operation. In time, simple money can be acknowledged as official coin in local jurisdictions, and then larger ones. Open source blockchain accounting systems are the natural form for mutual money to be organized with our present technology. However in setting up democratic blockchain platforms, it is important that all the values built into the simple democratic system are implemented. It is important that systems be limited to a community scale, and that users know who each other are, so trust can be informally as well as formally supported. Structures need to be put into place so that users set limits on positive and negative balances, to prevent abuse. Crowd funding can be structurally facilitated, as well as community funding. Instead of 'mining' for money, money would be created as a commitment to other members of the community. Balances will revolve around zero instead of always being positive to maintain the zero sum game. With these provisions, the money supply is automatically regulated.",0
18416,"Andrew Puzder, Trump’s Labor Pick, Admits to Hiring Undocumented Maid - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Andrew F. Puzder, who as President Trump’s pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder’s views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a   chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings. “My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S.,” Mr. Puzder said in a statement. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. ” Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s chains. Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation. Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. “It’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration,” Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday. Mr. Puzder remains “all in” for the confirmation process, a spokesman said on Monday. He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers. Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Commerce Department, Wilbur Ross, said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years. And Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and the nominee for White House budget director, said that he failed to pay taxes on a nanny that he and his wife employed after their children were born. They had to pay more than $15, 000 in taxes and penalties to the I. R. S.",0

18421,"Obama, in Major National Security Speech, Defends Counterterrorism Legacy - The New York Times","TAMPA, Fla.  —   In his final planned address on national security as commander in chief, President Obama said on Tuesday that for eight years, his administration protected the nation against major terrorist attacks from abroad while adhering to American values and the rule of law. “No foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland,” Mr. Obama said to loud applause in a large military hangar here. “And it’s not because they didn’t try. Plots have been disrupted. Terrorists have been taken off the battlefield. And we’ve done this even as we’ve drawn down nearly 180, 000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. ” The speech was intended as a valedictory answer to years of criticism from conservatives that Mr. Obama’s break with many of President George W. Bush’s policies  —   ending the torture of terrorism suspects and withdrawing most American ground forces from Afghanistan and Iraq  —   had left the country vulnerable. And many liberals have complained that Mr. Obama had betrayed his 2008 campaign supporters by acting too much like Mr. Bush in continuing and even expanding some policies, such as targeted killings using drones. Mr. Obama gave the speech at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. home to the military’s Central Command and Special Operations Command, both of which have been crucial to his fight against terrorism and efforts to wind down the wars fought since Sept. 11, 2001. He stood before a crowd of about 2, 500 men and women mostly in uniform and presented himself as the most   president in the country’s history. “On January 20th, I will become the first president of the United States to serve two full terms during a time of war,” he said. He defended an approach to fighting wars that did not bankrupt the Treasury or cause thousands of deaths. He noted, for instance, that he has spent $10 billion over the last two years fighting the Islamic State  —   the same amount of money President George W. Bush spent in just one month fighting the Iraq War. And he laid out a series of principles: keep the terrorist threat in perspective, avoid military overreach, adhere to the rule of law, use restraint when carrying out strikes to minimize repercussions, be open with the public, use diplomacy and protect civil liberties. While Mr. Obama had been planning the speech for months, Donald J. Trump’s election victory made the address all the more vital for him. The president sought to defend his legacy and provide a road map for a successor with no experience in national security  —   and warn Mr. Trump away from some of his more controversial positions and advisers. Mr. Trump has, on occasion, advocated the use of torture and questioned the value of NATO and other alliances, although he has since modulated those positions. “First of all, a sustainable counterterrorism strategy depends on keeping the threat in perspective,” Mr. Obama said. The fighters of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda are not the worry some claim they are, he said. “They are thugs and they are murderers and they should be treated that way,” Mr. Obama said. And while defending the use of wartime powers to fight terrorists  —   something many liberals reject  —   he also emphasized the importance of sometimes relying on law enforcement powers that the Bush administration explicitly rejected as a response to a threat. For example, Mr. Obama argued that it had proved more effective to prosecute terrorism suspects in civilian courts than military commissions. For a historic comparison, Mr. Obama pointed out that fascism threatened to overrun the globe during World War II, and the Soviet Union threatened a nuclear holocaust during the Cold War. “Today’s terrorists can kill innocent people, but they don’t pose an existential threat to our nation and we cannot make the mistake of elevating them as if they do,” he said, because exaggerating their powers helps bring them enhanced credibility among their followers and potential followers. “These terrorists can never directly destroy our way of life but we can do it for them if we lose track of who we are and the values that this nation was founded on,” he said. Mr. Trump has proposed banning immigration from Muslim countries, and some Republicans have proposed scrutiny of Muslim communities in the United States. Mr. Obama criticized such proposals. Michael T. Flynn, a retired general who is Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, has emphasized the threat represented by Islamic extremism, which he said is spreading. “Protecting liberty? That’s something we do for all Americans, not just some,” Mr. Obama said. And while the Islamic State and Al Qaeda claim to be fighting on behalf of Islam, he said they do not speak for Muslims everywhere, including the United States. “If we act like this is a war between the United States and Islam, we’re not just going to lose more Americans to terrorist attacks, but we’re also going lose the very principles we claim to defend,” he said. Mr. Obama also expressed frustrations with Congress, reiterating his criticism that lawmakers did not act on his request to enact a new and limited war authorization to battle the Islamic State. He also complained that Congress did not lift legal restrictions that prevented him from closing the Guantánamo Bay prison, which he called “a blot on our national honor. ” Mr. Obama’s speech drew criticism from Republicans, including his 2008 presidential campaign opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona. “President Obama’s speech was nothing more than a feeble attempt to evade the harsh judgment of history,” Mr. McCain said. “But to the American people, our emboldened enemies, and our dispirited allies, his legacy on counterterrorism is unmistakably clear: a disastrous withdrawal from Iraq, the terrorist rampage of ISIL, an indecisive approach to the war in Afghanistan that has empowered the Taliban, and an indifferent approach to the carnage in Syria on which our terrorist enemies have thrived. No rhetorical conceit will alter history’s verdict. ” His speech was interrupted by raucous applause on several occasions, including when he said that one of his core convictions as commander in chief was “that we are and must remain the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. ” Mr. Obama acknowledged that the situation in Afghanistan is not perfect, but that the fight is now almost entirely being waged by Afghan forces, not by Americans. He also acknowledged that there have been a series of domestic terrorist attacks during his presidency that were “carried out by homegrown and largely isolated individuals who were radicalized online. ” But while such   attacks  —   he cited the Boston Marathon bombing and shooting sprees at Fort Hood, Tex.

[Trump addressed the leaders of 55 Muslim countries in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and said they must take the lead in combating radicalization. “The true toll of ISIS,   Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams,” the American president said in his speech.  “The statement describing Hamas as a terror group is rejected and is a distortion of our image and shows a complete bias to the Zionist occupation (Israel),” Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said in a statement.

18423,Report: George Soros Tied to More Than 50 ‘Partners’ of Anti-Trump Women’s March,"Billionaire George Soros has provided financing to or has close relationships with at least 56 “partners” of Saturday’s “Women’s March on Washington,” according to a report at a website affiliated with the New York Times. [Writing the website for Women in the World, a summit in a joint venture with The New York Times, former Wall Street Journal reporter Asra Q. Nomani relates her findings on the Soros ties to the march.  The Women in the World site is hosted by the Times.  By my draft research, which I’m opening up for   on GoogleDocs, Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s “partners,” including “key partners” Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s   policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies. The other Soros ties with “Women’s March” organizations include the partisan MoveOn. org (which was fiercely  ) the National Action Network (which has a former executive director lauded by Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett as “a leader of tomorrow” as a march   and another official as “the head of logistics”). Other Soros grantees who are “partners” in the march are the American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Constitutional Rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. March organizers and the organizations identified here haven’t yet returned queries for comment. In response to the report, a spokeswoman for Soros’s Open Society Foundations released a statement  —   included in an update to Nomani’s article  —   denying the group was “funding protests” in the wake of the presidential election.  Nomani, however, did not charge that Soros was funding protests she documented the numerous   groups that were “partners” to the protest march. The Open Society statement reads: “There have been many false reports about George Soros and the Open Society Foundations funding protests in the wake of the U. S. presidential elections. There is no truth to these reports. We support a wide range of organizations  —   including those that support women and minorities who have historically been denied equal rights. Many of whom are concerned about what policy changes may lie ahead. We are proud of their work. We of course support the right of all Americans to peaceably assemble and petition their government —  a vital, and constitutionally safeguarded, pillar of a functioning democracy. ” Last week, Breitbart News reported the march is backed by a who’s who of   organizations, including scores of groups financed by Soros. Activists Gloria Steinem and Harry Belafonte are serving as honorary  . In 2005, Belafonte founded the Gathering for Justice group, which has since been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Open Society also supported the New York production of a play starring Belafonte titled “The Exonerated” about wrongly convicted death row inmates. Soros’ foundation sponsored a series of “talk back” conversions after the play “where justice advocates and death penalty experts from across the country will speak and field questions from the theater audience. ” Belafonte serves on the board of the Advancement Project, which was one of four primary recipients of money from a group created in 2008 called the Election Administration Fund. The Fund reportedly raised between $5. 1 million —  $1 million from Soros’ Open Society Institute. Meanwhile, the official partner’s list for the Women’s March on Washington reads like a who’s who of the   including groups such as CODEPINK, the Southern Poverty Law Center and 350. org. Many of the march “partners” are financed by Soros, including: Sierra Club, Amnesty International, MoveOn. org, NAACP, Green For All, Center for Constitutional Rights, Human Rights Watch, MoveOn. org, NARAL   People for the American Way and Planned Parenthood.

18424,Philadelphia Transit Strike Strands Thousands - The New York Times,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Transit workers here went on strike Tuesday, halting bus, trolley and subway service, and forcing hundreds of thousands of people onto packed commuter trains and roads to get to and from work or school. The strike by about 4, 700 workers of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority shut down transit lines that normally provide nearly a million rides each weekday. As arduous as the morning rush was, the evening commute became even more challenging as pickets blocked employees’ access to their work assignments for Regional Rail service. That service, which extends from the city into the suburbs and was not part of the work stoppage, caused a “significant” number of trains to be canceled or disrupted, said the authority, which urged people who had been counting on the Regional Rail system to find other ways of getting home. Around 6 p. m. Septa said it had secured an injunction allowing train crews and other employees to report to their work assignments without interference from striking workers. “Septa hopes this will ensure that incidents like those that disrupted service today will not happen again,” it said. Thousands of people stood in long lines at Regional Rail stations in Center City, unsure how long they would have to wait to catch trains home. Employees held most commuters on the concourse levels of the stations to prevent dangerous overcrowding on the platforms below. Commuters were packed shoulder to shoulder on the trains that did run, some of them an hour behind schedule or more. The commuter trains accepted transit passes, and express trains made local stops to take on and discharge more passengers. John Agovino, 36, was among a group of commuters corralled into a holding area at Suburban Station around 7:30 p. m. Mr. Agovino, a foreign currency exchange trader, had been waiting 30 minutes for a train on the   Line to get home. The wait was better than the “atrocious” queue he had seen after he left work at 4:30 p. m. he said, adding, “That’s why I went to dinner instead. ” A display listed the train as being 99 minutes late. Even without the cancellations, the regional rail service, which normally provides 130, 000 rides a weekday, could absorb only a fraction of the overflow. Members of Transport Workers Union Local 234 had voted to go on strike at 12:01 a. m. when their contract expired, if a new contract settlement was not reached, and negotiations on Monday failed to produce an agreement. The union last walked out in 2009, in a strike lasting six days. “Despite months of constructive and innovative proposals from our side of the table, management has refused to budge on key issues, including safety issues that would save lives and not cost Septa a dime,” said Willie Brown, the local president. He said the two sides remained far apart on pension and health care issues, as well as scheduling and driver fatigue. Andrew Busch, a spokesman for the authority, released a statement saying, “Mr. Brown walked away from a contract offer that would have provided his members pay raises, enhanced pension benefits, maintained health care coverage levels and continued job security, while also remaining fair and affordable for the taxpayers and riders who fund Septa. ” Transit officials said they were hopeful that a tentative agreement would be reached before Election Day, next Tuesday, and urged the union to return to negotiations. If not, the agency said in a statement, it will seek an injunction ordering employees back to work for that day, “to ensure that the strike does not prevent any voters from getting to the polls and exercising their right to vote. ” Mike Locasale, a commuter who usually takes the   subway line, took a regional train on Tuesday morning, and said he was half an hour late for work. Rushing through the Art Deco Suburban Station in Center City, he said he planned to start out 30 minutes early on Wednesday and call for an Uber driver “to beat some of the traffic. ” Craig Chaney, 68, usually walks half a block to catch a bus to go to his medical checkups. Instead, “I had to walk about 10 blocks” to get to a Regional Rail station, he said, “which is bad, because I’ve had about three heart operations and I have to see doctors. ” He left himself plenty of time, arriving at Suburban Station two hours early. Brianna   stood in   weather at the Tulpehocken Regional Rail station of the Chestnut Hill West Line, waiting for a train that was running late. Asked if she would be late for work, she laughed and said, “Probably. ” Mayor Jim Kenney urged “both Septa and the Transport Workers Union to maintain communication despite the work stoppage. ” “Tens of thousands of Philadelphians rely on the buses, trolleys and subways,” Mr. Kenney said, “so it is vital for everyone that this situation be resolved as quickly as possible. ”",0
18425,"Amid New Airstrikes in Syria, an Aid Convoy Arrives - The New York Times","The United Nations resumed aid convoys to besieged communities in Syria on Thursday for the first time since a deadly attack on trucks loaded with supplies on Monday. But that accomplishment seemed fragile as talks in New York between the United States and Russia failed to produce agreement on how to restore a   in Syria, and as the Syrian military announced that it had begun a new offensive in eastern Aleppo and warned residents to stay away from rebel positions. That announcement was made after two days of intensive bombing of eastern Aleppo by the   Syrian forces. A   aid convoy left Damascus on Thursday with supplies for 40, 000 people in Moadamiya, a suburb of the capital, according to Jan Egeland, a United Nations special adviser for humanitarian affairs. Officials said later that the convoy had arrived in the afternoon, after delays but without incident. “We seem to be getting the permits and support we need,” Mr. Egeland said, while cautioning that the attack on the convoy on Monday, the deadliest in Syria’s   civil war, had cast doubt on the safety and reliability of procedures that have provided the basis for aid deliveries to millions of Syrians. The Syrian government prohibited United Nations staff members from accompanying the convoy earlier in the week, Mr. Egeland said. “We were not there,” he told reporters Thursday in Geneva. “As U. N. we were not allowed in. ” The presence of United Nations officials can shield local relief workers in dangerous areas. Monday’s mission by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent had no such cover. “We need a reboot, a restart for security assurances and guarantees for the humanitarian lifeline,” Mr. Egeland said, adding that the United Nations had trucks loaded and ready to leave for other besieged towns, including Madaya, Kfarya, Fouaa and Zabadani, before the end of the week. Hours later, Secretary of State John Kerry said that he had exchanged ideas to restore the   with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. He suggested that the onus was now on Russia to uphold the previous agreement and to respond to Mr. Kerry’s proposals with credible ideas of its own. “If the Russians come back to us with constructive proposals, we will listen,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement he read to reporters. “The key is to restore credibility where there is none. ” Mr. Kerry declined to take questions and did not provide more details. It was not immediately clear what ideas were being discussed or why the Obama administration believes its diplomatic efforts with the Russians might yet succeed after days of frustrating exchanges. Hopes had been raised earlier this week that the International Syria Support Group, the multinational body that has been trying to maintain the   would agree to urgent measures to revive it. Chief among the proposals on the table was Mr. Kerry’s call for a ban on military flights in “key areas,” which he put forward on Wednesday before the United Nations Security Council. A senior Foreign Ministry official in Moscow rejected that idea. “This plan is unworkable,” said Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, according to the RIA news agency. The United States and other supporters of rebel groups trying to topple Mr. Assad must ensure that they lay down their arms, he added. Mr. Kerry’s proposal would prevent another aid convoy from being struck by banning planes from flying over areas where the assistance is to be delivered, and American officials have cast the proposal as a test of Russia’s intentions. American officials have said intelligence information indicates that it was a Russian aircraft that bombed the convoy headed to the besieged city of Aleppo on Monday. The Russians have denied the allegation and questioned whether an airstrike even occurred. At this stage, Mr. Kerry said in his statement, only “major gestures,” like banning warplanes over areas, would be sufficient to revive the rapidly vanishing hopes that a   agreement can be reinstated and endure. A senior Obama administration official told reporters on Thursday evening that the meeting of the International Syria Support Group had been “pretty contentious” and that he was unsure whether an agreement was still possible. While the administration is not closing the door to new ideas from Moscow, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with diplomatic protocol, any Russian proposals need to include major steps to stop the violence. The death toll in Monday’s attack remains uncertain. In an interview with The Associated Press published on Thursday, President Bashar   of Syria denied involvement and sought to shift the blame to opposition groups. “Those convoys were in the area of the militants, the area under the control of the terrorists,” he said. “We don’t have any idea about what happened. ”   areas of Aleppo endured heavy airstrikes overnight, including with incendiary weapons, leaving a breakthrough in peace talks looking like a distant prospect. Strikes on Thursday destroyed one of the city’s two water treatment stations, serving both   and   areas, according to activists and medical workers in Aleppo. The Syrian military’s declaration of its new offensive was reported by   websites and by RT, the satellite network financed by the Russian government. As violence reignited, trucks carrying food and medicine for Aleppo remained on the border with Turkey, unable to move from the customs zone where they have been stuck for a week until government forces and armed groups pull back from the road leading into the city, Mr. Egeland said. Mr. Assad, in his interview with The A. P. denied that Aleppo was under siege, but Mr. Egeland told reporters that it was encircled by military forces and that “it’s impossible to get in. ”",0
18426,"With Senate Control at Stake, Koch Groups Start Endorsing by Name - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The vast and   Koch political network is intensifying efforts behind preferred Republican candidates in the few crucial races that could decide Senate control. For the first time, some political groups under the umbrella of the billionaire conservative donors Charles G. and David H. Koch are embracing direct endorsement of Senate candidates  —   a marked shift from the more generic,   ads and outreach such nonprofit organizations typically employ to steer voters to chosen candidates. The push will be a major test of strength for the Koch network, an effort that has been building over the past decade, born of the brothers’ disenchantment with the performance of the Republican Party. The groups have already spent tens of millions of dollars on Senate campaigns. One group, Concerned Veterans for America, began significant voter contact efforts this week on behalf of two Republicans in tough   fights: Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Marco Rubio of Florida. Libre, another group funded by the   Freedom Partners in hopes of making inroads among Hispanic voters, is explicitly backing Mr. Rubio and Representative Joe Heck, the Republican running against Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, in the critical Nevada Senate race. “We as an organization are worried about losing those champions in the Senate,” said Dan Caldwell, the vice president for policy at the veterans group, about why it is taking the “extraordinary step” of advocating expressly on behalf of Mr. Toomey and Mr. Rubio. The shift to   appeals by   organizations in   Senate races comes as the groups on Wednesday ended a monthslong, multistate television advertising campaign, which along with other initiatives cost an estimated $42 million. The influx of support from outside groups that do not have to disclose the identity of their donors helps explain why Republicans, who have been on defense this election cycle, still have a good chance of retaining control of the Senate. The new attempt to make direct personal appeals to voters is far less visible than the ads saturating the airwaves in battleground states but potentially more effective at this stage. Officials from the Koch groups see it as the best way to leverage the volunteer networks and advocacy infrastructure the organizations have been creating in three dozen states over the past decade. “This has been a   effort in building up this   force, and this is where we believe we can have the most impact,” said Mr. Caldwell, who estimated that the new   program will cost in the “high six figures. ” The switch in strategy also shows races are close enough that the officially nonpartisan organizations are willing to take heat and scrutiny for acting in a partisan manner if they can influence the outcome of the races. Such activity is legal for the nonprofit groups as long as they make sure it is not the majority of their spending, a fairly easy standard for such   groups to meet. Spokespeople say the express advocacy campaigns constitute a small portion of their individual budgets. Still, campaign finance watchdogs say such activity distorts what tax laws intended those “social welfare” groups to do, while allowing their backers to remain anonymous. “The idea that these are social welfare organizations is somewhat odd since they are really political organizations involved in politics,” said Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center. Leaders of the organizations say they have based their decisions on the merits and records of the candidates, not on their partisan affiliation. They say backing candidates who share their views is their objective, not keeping control of the Senate. They note that they are not working on behalf of another endangered Republican, Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, because of some disagreements with her policy stances. In Pennsylvania and Florida, Concerned Veterans for America plans to distribute 150, 000 doorknob hangers to the homes of voters shown through research to be susceptible to the appeal. The Pennsylvania literature calls Mr. Toomey “the clear choice for Pennsylvania’s veterans” and lists some of his legislative work on their behalf. The door knocking is to be followed up with phone calls, a direct mail campaign and digital advertising. Mr. Caldwell said the organization’s personnel in Florida include 14 paid staff members and 400 active volunteers, while six staff members and more than 100 volunteers are working in Pennsylvania. Another   group, Americans for Prosperity, has a significant presence in those states as well and has been engaged in direct advocacy since last year. Besides Florida and Pennsylvania, the group is now active in Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin. Americans for Prosperity recently sent voters in Indiana, Missouri and Pennsylvania   pieces of mail urging them to reject Evan Bayh, Jason Kander and Katie McGinty, the Democratic Senate candidates in those states. “We have found that in instances where there is a real clear policy divide, we can drive a clearer message with our volunteers into the public with express advocacy,” said Levi Russell, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity. The tactical shift by the Koch network, which has steered clear of the presidential race, came after a recognition by strategists that trying to persuade voters to split their tickets might not be worthwhile. Instead, the groups are now focused on five million voters they believe share the values of conservative Senate candidates but may not be enthusiastic about the presidential choices or the election over all. “We feel like that is where we can have an outsized impact,” said James Davis, a spokesman for Freedom Partners, which funds the Koch network. How pivotal Senate races turn out could reflect whether the groups made the right calculation.",0

The book is also expected to include Clinton’s mother, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The title of the book comes from a quote by Sen. Mitch McConnell ( ) after the Senate silenced Elizabeth Warren ( ) as she attempted to protest Jeff Sessions’ nomination as U. S. Attorney General. “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,” McConnell said in February. The quote has since become a rallying cry for the Left, and has since made its way into Grammys performances and onto Reebok  . In a statement, Clinton said she wrote the book “for everyone who’s ever wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who’s ever been made to feel less than. ” “The 13 women in She Persisted all overcame adversity to help shape our country —  sometimes through speaking out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience,” she told EW. “With this book, I want to send a message to young readers around the country —  and the world —  that persistence is power. ” The announcement of the book comes amid rumors that Clinton is preparing for her own entrance into politics, perhaps as a candidate for a New York Senate seat.

At the July summit in Warsaw, NATO member countries agreed to build up military forces in Eastern Europe. Four multinational battalions are to be deployed in the Baltic States and Poland in 2017. To crown it all, NATO officials intend to strengthen the presence of the alliance in the Black Sea region. All these actions are being made in response to Russia's alleged threat, NATO officials say. However, Russian officials, including President Putin, have repeatedly stated that Russia would never attack any NATO country. At the same time, they added, Russia would not simply sit and watch NATO increasing its military presence near Russia's borders. Print version Font Size ""On western borders of the Unified State (Russia and Belarus - ed.), the United States and other NATO members have been building up their offensive potential by opening new bases and developing military infrastructure. There are continued attempts to impose the will of NATO members on other countries by economic and political dictatorship, as well as by military force. The information warfare is being conducted openly,"" Shoygu said.These actions, the Defense Minister said, undermine the strategic stability and force Russia to take retaliatory measures. The high level of cooperation with Belarus makes it possible to successfully address issues of strengthening the defense capacity of the Unified State, he added.

18432,NFL Warns Clenbuterol Level So High in Beef that Players Fail Drug Tests,"The National Football League (NFL) in the United States has issued a warning to players , asking them to avoid eating beef because of the high levels of Clenbuterol . These high levels have been said to cause players to fail drug tests. Clenbuterol is a muscle-building and weight-loss stimulant. It is a substance banned by the league, and considered a performance enhancing drug. However, recently, many players in the NFL have failed drug tests linked to Clenbuterol. If a player fails this drug test then he is banned for 10 matches.
The majority of beef consumed in the United States is imported from China and Mexico. The NFL said beef from China and Mexico is particularly dangerous to the players.
Clenbuterol has the ability to build muscle, which is why farmers use it, increasing the size of their cattle to increase profits. In Mexico, cattle ranchers are banned from using Clenbuterol as a growth enhancer. However, it is said farmers are not complying with the regulation, leading to widespread abuse of the substance within the nation’s cattle industry.
The Free Thought Project reports that the NFL’s independent drug-testing administrator has officially sent a memo to all players in the league, telling them that consuming large quantities of beef while visiting China and Mexico may result in a positive Clenbuterol test. The memo further stated that if players refused to heed the warning and do otherwise, they do so at their own risk.
“Players are warned to be aware of this issue when traveling to Mexico and China. Please take caution if you decide to consume meat, and understand that you do so at your own risk. Players are responsible for what is in their bodies,” the memo said.
In 2015, the Texan’s left tackle, Duane Brown, tested positive for Clenbuterol after a trip to Mexico, during which he ate Mexican beef, sources told ESPN . After a months-long process, Brown was finally cleared in April this year, permitting him to avoid what would have been a 10-match ban.
When the memo was issued, several players in the NFL, including the Arizona Cardinals defensive back, Patrick Peterson, took to Twitter to express his disappointment in the issue.

18433,Будущее внутренней политики РК. Война за кресло спикера и не только | Новое восточное обозрение,"Страна: Южная Корея Хотя главной новостью внутренней политики Южной Кореи является очередной римейк слуха о том, что Пан Ги Мун все таки решился принять участие в президентской гонке, обратим внимание на иные детали. Начнем с итогов выборов лидера правящей партии Сэнури. Ли Чжон Хён, бывший пресс-секретарь Пак Кын Хе, известен двумя вещами. Во-первых, он относится к фракции, поддерживающей нынешнего президента, что говорит о некотором упрочении ее позиций внутри партии. Ли на 12 тысяч голосов опередил своего основного соперника Чу Хо Ёна, противника президента Пак Кын Хе, и будет руководить партией два последующих года, в ходе которых предстоит определить кандидатов для участия в президентских выборах. Во-вторых, впервые главой Сэнури становится представитель провинции Чолла – традиционной базы левой оппозиции. Для правящей партии это хороший ход – выйти за рамки традиционного для РК регионализма; так же в свое время сделал Ким Дэ Чжун, назначив своим преемником Но Му Хена, представлявшего в целом выступающую на стороне консерваторов провинцию Кёнсан. Немудрено, что в своей речи Ли заявил, что правящая Сэнури декларирует отсутствие в своих рядах разделения на сторонников и противников президента Пак Кын Хе, а также пораженческих настроений и регионализма; партия, работая как единое целое в интересах народа, вернёт доверие граждан страны и одержит победу на предстоящих президентских выборах, которые состоятся в следующем году. Тем не менее противники президента из консервативного лагеря уже заговорили о том, что так партия потеряет независимость и дело может дойти до раскола, в котором иные фракции могут попытаться отделиться, а потому задача нового лидера не проводить свою линию, а беречь единство. Новый лидер Сэнури немедленно включился в политическую борьбу, связанную с ситуацией вокруг отстранения от своего поста министра продовольствия, сельского, лесного хозяйства Ким Чжэ Су. Это было сделано в ходе парламентской проверки учреждений, и, по мнению консерваторов, оппозиция просто воспользовалась своим преимуществом по количеству мандатов, сделав это при поддержке спикера Национального собрания Чон Сэ Гюна. Внезапное отстранение от должности члена кабинета министров происходит только в случае серьёзных проблем, и Ли Чжон Хён даже объявил голодовку, требуя отставки Чона. Формально случившееся 24 сентября 2016 г. голосование прошло как должно: решение о снятии с должности членов кабинета министров, представленное на рассмотрение на пленарном заседании Национального собрания, принимается на основе мнения большинства присутствующих депутатов – минимум 151 голос. За отставку Ким Чжэ Су проголосовали 160 депутатов, против 7, однако 122 депутата от правящей партии Сэнури не приняли участия в голосовании, так как спикер Чон Сэ Гюн провел заседание после 12 часов ночи, не согласовав это решение с депутатами от правящей Сэнури. Консерваторы заявляют, что изменение расписания должно проводиться на основе соглашения оппозиционных и правящих сил, Чон Сэ Гюн в свою очередь заявляет, что правил не нарушал, поскольку в них прописана возможность решения спикером таких вопросов и без договоренности между политическими силами. А лидер парламентской фракции от оппозиционной Демократической партии Тобуро У Сан Хо потребовал от Ли прекратить голодовку и вернуться к диалогу. Да, парламент снял министра, но Пак Кын Хе отказалась принимать предложение о его увольнении, и вообще-то ситуация должна больше возмущать оппозицию, нежели правящие силы. Что же до Пан Ги Муна, то экс-генсек вернется в РК во второй декаде января следующего года, после чего намерен подумать над тем, что он может сделать для своей страны. Об этом Пан Ги Мун заявил 21 октября в интервью агентству Reuters. По его словам, многие граждане РК хотят, чтобы он активно использовал свой богатый опыт, накопленный за время пребывания на посту генерального секретаря ООН. Подобные надежды выказывают и консерваторы, для которых его кандидатура означает «региональное единение сил правящей партии». Другая деталь – новая волна стачек. 27 сентября южнокорейские железнодорожники и сотрудники метрополитенов Сеула и Пусана объявили забастовку, выступая против введения новой системы оплаты труда, а также излишне жестких требований к профессиональным характеристикам и качеству работы сотрудников. Хотя курсирование скоростных поездов KTX, метро и другого железнодорожного пассажирского транспорта осуществляется в относительно штатном режиме (интенсивность движения поездов метро в дневное время снижена до 80-85% от штатного расписания), грузовой транспорт будет работать только на 30% от обычных объемов. К забастовке присоединились Национальная корпорация медицинского страхования и Государственная пенсионная корпорация. На данный момент забастовка продолжается более 20 дней, и в ней принимают участие 7387 рабочих – 40,2% от численности членов профсоюзов. Объявил забастовку впервые с 2004 года и профсоюз компании Hyundai Motor, отвергнув достигнутый ранее компромисс с руководством о незначительном повышении заработной платы. Это не первый звонок – в июле частичные забастовки составили в общей сложности 19 дней и привели к убыткам на общую сумму 2,02 млрд долларов и 101400 невыпущенных автомобилей, после чего представители профсоюза и администрации провели 26 раундов переговоров и 24 августа достигли компромисса. Администрация обещала повысить ежемесячную зарплату на 58 тыс. вон (53 доллара), увеличить бонусные выплаты и произвести единовременную выплату каждому рабочему в размере 3,3 млн вон (3 тыс. долларов). Кроме того, на неопределённый срок отложен ввод в действие системы поэтапного уменьшения заработной платы до достижения пенсионного возраста. Однако 78% членов профсоюза выразили недовольство достигнутыми договорённостями и потребовали начать забастовку, которая затронет уже все предприятия данной отрасли. Довершает ситуацию и скандал со смертью фермера Пэк Нам Ги, который в конце прошлого года во время демонстрации попал в струю водомета, был сбит с ног и потерял сознание, впоследствии впав в кому. 25 сентября он скончался, так и не придя в себя, после чего общественные организации подали иск против начальника Главного полицейского управления и ещё шести должностных лиц, обвиняя их в непреднамеренном убийстве в результате халатности. От главы Управления полиции потребовали возмещения ущерба в размере 217 тыс. долларов. Полиция, однако, указывает на недостаток подтверждений того, что слишком сильный напор воды напрямую повлиял на состояние пострадавшего и мог стать причиной смерти. Как бы то ни было, по данным агентства Gallup Korea, опубликованным 14 октября, уровень поддержки президента РК Пак Кын Хе упал до минимальной отметки. Главу государства поддерживают 26% жителей страны – самый низкий показатель с февраля 2013 года. 59% респондентов считают, что президент Пак Кын Хе недостаточно хорошо выполняет свои обязанности. Среди причин отрицательной оценки 15% указали на недостаток диалога, 14% на неэффективность экономической политики, 7% на односторонность политики. Что касается политических партий, то работу правящей Сэнури положительно оценили 64% респондентов. Однако уровень поддержки Демократической партии Тобуро составил 90%, а Народной партии – 81%. Начинаются и традиционные для предвыборной гонки коррупционные скандалы, задевающие руководство страны, но о том, как идет очередной раунд борьбы с этим социальным злом – в следующих текстах.

18434,What Kids Wish Their Teachers Knew - The New York Times,"When Kyle Schwartz started teaching third grade at Doull Elementary School in Denver, she wanted to get to know her students better. She asked them to finish the sentence “I wish my teacher knew. ” The responses were   for Ms. Schwartz. Some children were struggling with poverty (“I wish my teacher knew I don’t have pencils at home to do my homework”) an absent parent (“I wish my teacher knew that sometimes my reading log is not signed because my mom isn’t around a lot”) and a parent taken away (“I wish my teacher knew how much I miss my dad because he got deported to Mexico when I was 3 years old and I haven’t seen him in six years”). The lesson spurred Ms. Schwartz, now entering her fifth teaching year, to really understand what her students were facing outside the classroom to help them succeed at school. When she shared the lesson last year with others, it became a sensation, with the Twitter hashtag “#iwishmyteacherknew” going viral. Other teachers tried the exercise and had similar insights. Many sent her their students’ responses. In her recently published book, “I Wish My Teacher Knew: How One Question Can Change Everything For Our Kids,” Ms. Schwartz details how essential it is for teachers and families to be partners. “I really want families to know how intentional teachers are about creating a sense of community and creating relationships with kids,” Ms. Schwartz said. “Kids don’t learn when they don’t feel safe or valued. ” Melody Molinoff of Washington, D. C. who has two sons, ages 9 and 11, in the public school system, agreed. “Parents see the teacher as their partner in bringing up their child, and that’s a huge responsibility that we are putting on our teachers and our schools,” Ms. Molinoff said. “I always want my sons’ teachers to know what their challenges are, what they like, just more about them. ” Mary Clayman, a   teacher in the Washington public schools, said she has noticed the same thing from the other side of the desk. “I’ve taught over 500 kids so far in my career and parents in every grade want to know how their child is doing socially and emotionally, often times more so than whether they can multiply or divide quite yet,” Mrs. Clayman said. In her book, Ms. Schwartz writes about mistakes that might have been prevented if she had known her students better. She had a student named Chris who was obsessed with science. Ms. Schwartz thought she had done Chris a huge favor by securing a spot for him in a   summer camp. But she was unaware of the family’s financial struggles and it turned out that his parents could not afford to take time off from work to get Chris to camp. Ms. Schwartz said classrooms can become a supportive environment for students coping with grief. She suggests that schools have “grief and loss” inventories for students who have gone through a crisis, with input from families so that the child’s future teachers know what that student is dealing with. “As teachers, we know parents are the first and best teachers for their children and we want them to work with us,” she said.",0
18435,When Is It My Turn to Talk?! - The New York Times,"My    lives far away. She calls to check in every week or so and runs through a laundry list of topics: her husband, their kids, their dog. She has a million stories. Trouble is, by the time she’s finished, her time is up: “Gotta go!” This leaves no room for me to share my news. So while I know her son’s ACT scores, she wouldn’t be able to tell you the first thing about my family. This has been going on for over a year. Is there a way to point out the imbalance that won’t make me sound needy or her  ? VALERIE, CONN. I have a newish therapist, and I’m going away for a spell this summer. So I asked if he would consider phone sessions. “Absolutely not!” he said, with a look that verged on repulsion. In his experience, patients on the phone often interpret silence as a signal to keep talking, leading to 50 minutes of blather. Perhaps this notion, combined with the fact that your    seems to be initiating all these calls, explains her conversational dominance. (Or maybe she’s a narcissistic witch.) One idea: Try dialing the phone yourself. It’s conceivable that your    will back off a little, and you will become “Charles in Charge” for the length of the calls that you place. If not, here’s another: Though I have preached for years that we should pick up the phone at the first sign of trouble in our   do the opposite here. After your next   call, send her an email: “Your story about Charlie’s ACT’s made me think of a funny one from when Sarah took them. Remind me to tell you when we next speak. ” Then do so at the beginning of your next call. She may get the hang of taking turns. Now, this advice is predicated on the assumption that your    is a good person with an annoying phone tic, and that normal attempts to jostle your way into the conversation have failed. But we may have different definitions of jostling. There’s no crime in saying: “Hang on! You won’t believe what your brother did,” after she tells you a story about her husband. Not every conversationalist will lay out the red carpet for us. Sometimes we have to make our own breaks. My husband and I married last September. We have a surprising number of friends who attended the wedding but have not yet sent gifts. We had a small registry that sold out quickly, so some folks probably saw that it was sold out, made a mental note to buy something else, then forgot. It’s not a big deal to us. But we’re worried that some friends got us gifts that may have been lost at the wedding or in the mail, and they are now wondering why we haven’t sent them   notes. What should we do? DAVID, NEW YORK I applaud the mental gymnastics of trying to turn your “surprising number” of    friends into victims of the United States Postal Service. (You and your hubby should head to Rio for spots on the Olympic tumbling squad.) For every package that is not delivered, millions are. And absent some catastrophic event at your wedding reception, I suspect you are in possession of all of the presents left for you there, too. Don’t obsess over tiny risks. The trick here is turning your friends’ attendance at your wedding into the big prize. Because that’s all you’re getting. Sorry. If you want to send them   notes for being part of your big day, knock yourself out. But it seems over the top to me. For what it’s worth, your assessment of the situation  —     registry leading to giftlessness  —   seems about right. Next time, register for everything in sight. (Books, anyone?) I came across a travel package to Japan that sounded perfect for my husband and me. He mentioned it to his running buddy, who immediately said that he and his wife were in: “We’d love to join you. ” Philip, they weren’t invited! It’s a   trip, and we’ve never traveled together before. More important, they are not adventurous eaters, and I don’t want to spend my limited travel time scouting for Americanized food in Asia. Fortunately, the trip was sold out. Now, another has come up, but I’m afraid that Japan is off the table if we want to travel alone. Isn’t it too risky to book the trip and try to keep it top secret? C. S. NEW JERSEY Has anyone else noticed that it seems to be masochist week at Social Q’s? Don’t let impromptu statements by your husband’s running buddies dictate your travel schedule. Book your vacation and hold your head high. No need for secrecy. When your husband (inevitably) mentions the trip to his friend, coach him to say, “We decided to make it a second honeymoon and go alone. ” Your objections to   travels with this couple sound sensible, but no reason is required. Propose a long weekend to the Berkshires instead. (But only if you want to go with them.)",0

18437,Letters From Jacqueline Kennedy to the Man She Didn’t Marry - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   In November 1967, four years after her husband’s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy traveled to the temples of Angkor Wat in Cambodia on a   trip with David Ormsby Gore, a friend of her husband and himself a recent widower. There was much speculation of a romantic attachment. A few months later, Mr. Ormsby Gore, a former British ambassador to Washington, proposed marriage. She turned him down. In a handwritten letter, filled with anguish and a touch of cruelty, she explained her decision to marry Aristotle Onassis instead. “If ever I can find some healing and some comfort  —   it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain,” she wrote. “I can find that now  —   if the world will let us. ” The letter was part of a set of papers found in locked   cases discovered only last month in Wales at the family home of Mr. Ormsby Gore, who died in 1985. They are being auctioned in London next month by his grandson to help restore the house. The letters point to the depth of feeling behind the public mask of one of the most celebrated women of her time. Among them is the letter to Mr. Ormsby Gore, also known as Lord Harlech, dated Nov. 13, 1968, a month after her marriage to Mr. Onassis and five months after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. In it, Mrs. Kennedy spoke of the love and bond she felt for Mr. Ormsby Gore, whose wife had died in a car crash in May 1967. “We have known so much  shared  lost so much together  —   Even if it isn’t the way you wish now  —   I hope that bond of love and pain will never be cut. ” Writing from Mr. Onassis’ yacht in Greece, on stationery with the ship’s crest, a clear if cold message, Mrs. Kennedy told Mr. Ormsby Gore: “You are like my beloved beloved brother  —   and mentor  —   and the only original spirit I know  —   as you were to Jack. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore had expressed incredulity at her choice of Mr. Onassis, and she tried to respond. “Please know  —   you of all people must know it  —   that we can never really see into the heart of another,” she wrote. “You know me. And you must know that the man you write of in your letter is not a man that I could marry. ” Mr. Onassis, she wrote, is “lonely and wants to protect me from being lonely. And he is wise and kind. Only I can decide if he can, and I decided. “I know it comes as a surprise to so many people,” she continued. “But they see things for me that I never wanted for myself. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was an old friend of John F. Kennedy, whose younger sister Kathleen, or Kick, married Mr. Ormsby Gore’s first cousin. After the election of the young president in 1960, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan sent Mr. Ormsby Gore to Washington as Britain’s ambassador. The two men, a year apart in age, were extremely close, and President Kennedy consulted with him on every key issue of foreign policy, especially during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and in discussions of Vietnam and nuclear disarmament. Robert Kennedy said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “almost a part of the government,” adding that the president “would rather have his judgment than that of anybody else. ” Among the letters is one in which President Kennedy praised the ambassador: “I appreciate as you know, in all these critical matters your judgment  —   which I have found to be uniformly good and true. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore inherited the noble title, Lord Harlech, when his father died in 1964. His grandson Jasset, who inherited the title a year ago, is the one selling the papers, along with other possessions, at Bonhams, London, in an auction scheduled for March 29. Some of the letters will be on view on March 2 in New York at the Bonhams showroom, at 580 Madison Avenue. In total, there are 18 handwritten letters and one typed letter from Mrs. Kennedy to Mr. Ormsby Gore, as well as other papers. Those include a pass admitting him to the White House on Nov. 23, 1963, one day after the assassination a jocular 1963 letter from Robert Kennedy, signed “Bobby” and instructions for pallbearers for Robert Kennedy’s funeral. The papers also include a letter Mrs. Kennedy wrote to Mr. Ormsby Gore after the death of his wife, Sylvia, known as Sissie, which seemed to foreshadow his desire to marry her. “Your last letter was such a cri de coeur of loneliness  —   I would do anything to take that anguish from you,” she wrote. “You want to patch the wounds  match the loose pairs  —   but you can’t because your life won’t turn out that way. ” One of the most moving documents is a draft letter Mr. Ormsby Gore wrote to Mrs. Kennedy after she turned down his proposal. “All the pathetic plans I had brought with me for visits to Cyrenaica, holidays near one another and a whole variety of solutions to our marriage problem, including one for a secret marriage this summer  —   plans which I saw us eagerly discussing, calmly and with complete frankness as we did at the Cape and in Cambodia for the next wonderful ten days  —   all had become irrelevant trash to be thrown away within a few hours of my landing in New York,” he wrote. “As for your photograph I weep when I look at it. Why do such agonizing things have to happen? Where was the need for it?” The Kennedys and the Ormsby Gores socialized frequently, even stirring resentment among other diplomats and members of the administration. There were small dinners at the White House and shared vacations. One   “incoherent letter as written on Martini” from Mrs. Kennedy, in the spring of 1962, discusses their coming vacation at the America’s Cup races. Others mention her love of dance. Matthew Haley, the head of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams, said that “you just don’t get this quantity of insight into Jackie’s personal life and that level of intimacy. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore was her husband’s great friend, but “the fact that they developed such an intimate friendship in such a short space of time is important,” he said, even if built on shared sadness. Contacted about the letters on Friday, a representative of the Kennedy family said that they had decided not to comment. Barbara Leaming, who has written biographies of President and Mrs. Kennedy, said that Mr. Ormsby Gore was “the pivotal relationship Jack had in the presidency,” a man he trusted almost as much as Robert Kennedy. “Jackie loved in Jack the man he wanted to be, and David was the man helping him, in her eyes, to be the man Jack wanted to be,” she said. The distress that followed Robert Kennedy’s assassination in June 1968 was one reason she turned to the security of Mr. Onassis, Ms. Leaming said. “It was the second great trauma for her,” Ms. Leaming said. “She was very clear it was not a marriage of love, as she said to Joe Alsop in a letter. She was seeking safety. ” As for Mr. Ormsby Gore, “of course he fell in love with her  —   she understood him so well,” Ms. Leaming said. “But I have no idea if it was consummated or not. ” Mr. Ormsby Gore did marry again, in December 1969, to Pamela Colin, an American who bore more than a passing resemblance to Mrs. Onassis. He died in 1985, at 66, after a car crash. Mrs. Onassis attended his funeral.",0
18438,Iran Races to Clinch Oil Deals Before Donald Trump Takes Office - The New York Times,"TEHRAN  —   President Hassan Rouhani of Iran is racing to sign as many oil deals with Western companies as he can before   at home and   Donald J. Trump have a chance to return the Mideast country to cultural and economic isolation. At the same time, Iran is in a battle with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers to reclaim its position as one of the world’s leading oil exporters, a spot it lost during the years of international sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear program. Iran’s oil industry, the lifeblood of its economy, was devastated by the cumulative impact of the nuclear sanctions, which halved petroleum exports and left the country ostracized economically. The international nuclear agreement that lifted those sanctions nearly a year ago, one of the Obama administration’s signature foreign policy initiatives, has enabled Iran to partly recover. But Mr. Trump has warned that he may dismantle the deal, a threat that has injected new urgency into Iran’s push to build up its oil industry before Mr. Trump takes power next month. A provisional agreement this week with Royal Dutch Shell to develop two of the country’s largest oil fields is the latest sign of interest in Iran from international energy companies. Over the last four weeks, Tehran has negotiated similar agreements with the oil field services giant Schlumberger and companies from China, Norway, Thailand and Poland. The deals, if completed, would bring   expertise and foreign investment. Just as important, though, the agreements could provide a lifeline to the rest of the world, experts say, cementing relations with a number of European and Asian countries. That, they say, could provide an insurance policy of sorts against any punitive actions taken next year by the Trump administration and the   Congress. Few Iranian officials like to acknowledge their country’s vulnerability, insisting it is immune to outside pressures. But the election of Mr. Trump and his selection of a national security team that views Iran as a  major threat in the Middle East seems at the least certain to usher in a new period of tensions, and could ultimately threaten Iran’s efforts to rejoin the global economy. “Our officials are in a rush to sign contracts with big oil companies in order to have leverage when Trump enters the White House,” said Saeed Laylaz, an economist with close ties to the government of Mr. Rouhani. The Iranian president came to power promising to end Iran’s isolation and revive its economy, so the advent of a Trump presidency poses a dire threat to his political future. Mr. Laylaz pointed out that most European energy giants had been present in Iran for decades and had left only after sanctions, now lifted, were imposed during the Obama administration. “Just as in the past, we need them back here, also to make sure we are not isolated,” he said of the Europeans. Analysts noted that the deals were only memorandums of understanding, not hard contracts. But they stressed that the agreements also indicated a strong desire by Western and Asian energy companies to send a message to Washington as they return to Iran, once the world’s   exporter of oil. “It seems the big oil and gas companies in Europe are determined to show Mr. Trump that they are going to make deals with Iran anyway,” said Reza Zandi, an Iranian journalist and analyst who specializes in the oil and gas industries. “These are important signals to America,” he added. Mr. Zandi said it was not hard to see why the oil companies were so eager to return to Iran. “We need $40 billion in investment in the oil and gas sector each year,” he said, “and we don’t have such resources inside the country. ” Mr. Rouhani and his government of technocrats are fighting their oil battle on two fronts. Domestically, they face pressure from   who have been closely scrutinizing the oil contracts, seeking anything that could undermine Iran’s independence and trying to steer them to companies under their control. But Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, told the semiofficial news agency Fars in November that only foreign companies had the ability and capital to modernize Iran’s crumbling oil and gas sector. “We need technology, including the management technology that allows a project to come into operation in four years rather than in 12 years,” he said. “And above all, we need the money. ” Iran also faces a struggle to rebuild its oil exports. Growing production has allowed Iran in recent months to recover many of the Asian and European markets that it lost to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers during the years when sanctions were in effect. And as Iran effectively flexes its muscles in OPEC for the first time since the sanctions were lifted in January, its goal is not only to protect its newfound gains but also to expand its markets, pitting it directly against its bitter sectarian rival, Saudi Arabia. Further production and export expansion, however, will require more foreign investment. The new wave of agreements with Iran, most of which remain provisional, began on Nov. 8, the day of Mr. Trump’s victory, when Total, a French company, became the first Western energy company to negotiate a deal to develop and produce natural gas from a section of a giant Persian Gulf gas field. Total leads a consortium that includes the China National Petroleum Corporation and Petropars, a subsidiary of the Iranian   oil company, in the $4. 8 billion project. The provisional agreement is expected to be completed early next year. “They are signing before Trump does something,” said Dragan Vuckovic, president of Mediterranean International, a   oil services company that works in North Africa and the Middle East. “The Iranians will give the Europeans favorable terms because of Trump. They want to send a message to Trump that if you try to cancel this agreement, we will just go to the Europeans. ” Iran needs foreign capital and technical expertise to reach its immediate goal of returning to its 2011 oil production level of 4. 3 million barrels a day, reversing a drop that began even before sanctions were imposed. Many Iranian fields are old and in decline, requiring sophisticated and expensive redrilling of wells and injections of water and carbon dioxide to coax more oil from the ground. Since oil export sanctions were lifted, Iran’s production has risen almost a third, to about 3. 7 million barrels a day, with minimal foreign help. By reaching agreements with Total and Shell, Tehran now has the ambitious goal of reaching production levels of 4. 8 million barrels a day by 2021, which would give it added clout in OPEC and the ability to go    with Saudi Arabia in competing for growing Asian markets, particularly in India. In past decades, Iran has been aggressive in urging other OPEC members to use their position to manipulate the market for higher prices, while Saudi Arabia has often argued for caution. Saudi Arabia has held the upper hand in recent years, but Iran was a major player at the latest OPEC meeting, as the cartel decided to cut production for the first time in eight years. Iran wants to ramp up production at the very moment that Saudi Arabia wants to cut output to lift prices. Using its recovered production leverage, Iran agreed to go along with the decision to collectively cut 1. 2 million barrels a day of production only when the other members conceded to its demands that it be allowed to increase production by about 90, 000 barrels a day next year. It remains to be seen whether the agreement to scale back production, not slated to take effect until January, will hold up. Similar agreements among OPEC members in the past have crumbled in the face of widespread cheating and a lack of an enforcement mechanism. The agreement is also contingent on cooperation from a handful of   producers, particularly Russia, which is notoriously unreliable in such matters, said Philip K. Verleger Jr. an energy economist who served in the Ford and Carter administrations. “There is no one who will concede market share, and so there is no way to come to an enforceable agreement,” Mr. Verleger said. But just the fact that Iran was able to play a leading role at the OPEC meeting is a sign that its leaders are determined to return to world markets  —   as long as they are not stymied once again by geopolitical developments.",0
18439,Private Equity Pursues Profits in Keeping the Elderly at Home - The New York Times,"DENVER  —   Inside a senior center here, nestled along a bustling commercial strip, Vivian Malveaux scans her bingo card for a winning number. Her    eyes are warm, lively and occasionally set adrift by the dementia plundering her mind. Dozens of elderly men and women  —   some in wheelchairs, others whose hands tremble involuntarily  —   gather excitedly around the game tables. After bingo, there is more entertainment and activities: Yahtzee,   beading. But this is no   community center reeking of bleach. Instead, it’s one of eight vanguard centers owned by InnovAge, a company based in Denver with ambitious plans. With the support of private equity money, InnovAge aims to aggressively expand a   Medicare program that will pay to keep older and disabled Americans out of nursing homes. Until recently, only nonprofits were allowed to run programs like these. But a year ago, the government flipped the switch, opening the program to   companies as well, ending one of the last remaining holdouts to commercialism in health care. The hope is that the profit motive will expand the services faster. Hanging over all the promise, though, is the question of whether   companies are   to this line of work, long the province of nonprofit  . Critics point out that the business of caring for poor and frail people is marred with abuse. Already, new ideas for lowering the cost of the program have started circulating. In Silicon Valley, for example, some eager entrepreneurs are pushing plans that call for a higher reliance on video calls instead of   doctor visits. The business appeal is simple: A baby   surge in government health care spending is coming. Medicare enrollment is expected to grow by 30 million people in the next two decades, and many of those people are potential future clients. Adding to the allure are hefty profit margins for programs like these  —   as high as 15 percent, compared with an average of 2 percent among nursing homes  —   and geographic monopolies that are all but guaranteed by state Medicaid agencies to ensure the solvency of providers. The goal of the program, known as PACE, or the Program of   Care for the Elderly, is to help frail, older Americans live longer and more happily in their own homes, by providing comprehensive medical care and intensive social support. It also promises to save Medicare and Medicaid millions of dollars by keeping those people out of nursing homes. For decades, though, the program has failed to catch on, with only 40, 000 people enrolled as of January of this year. “PACE is still a secret in the minds of the public,” Andy Slavitt, Medicare’s acting administrator, said at the National PACE Association meeting in April. The challenge, he said, was to make PACE “a clear part of the solution. ” Several private equity firms, venture capitalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have jumped into the niche.   Capital Partners, a former Fidelity Biosciences group, provided seed funding for a     as have   angel investors like Amir Dan Rubin, the former Stanford Health Care president, and Michael Zubkoff, a Dartmouth health care economist. And no company has moved with more tenacity than InnovAge. Last year, the company overcame protests from watchdog groups to convert from a nonprofit organization to a   business in Colorado. And in May, InnovAge received $196 million in backing  —   the largest investment in a PACE business since the rule change was made  —   from Welsh, Carson, Anderson  Stowe, a private equity firm with $10 billion in assets under management. “For years we were pariahs, and no one wanted anything to do with us,” said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado   Coalition, a nonprofit group that advocates for people with disabilities, many of whom are eligible for PACE. “Now that there’s money involved,” Ms. Reiskin said, “everyone is all interested. ” Even the program’s supporters acknowledge that the movement needs fresh momentum. But they worry that commercial operators will tarnish their image in the same way many   eroded trust in hospice care and nursing homes. Three decades ago, after Congress authorized Medicare to pay for hospice care, commercial operators displaced the religious and community groups that had championed the movement. As recently as 2014, government inspectors found that   hospice companies   patients and stinted on care. In addition, elderly patients with dementia and chronic ailments have frequently been targets of abuse and neglect at nursing homes, something advocates for the elderly say is correlated with the increased commercialization of that industry. “I’m not wild about every knucklehead running around trying to do PACE,” said Thomas Scully, former Medicare administrator under President George W. Bush. “I would rather keep it below the radar. ” Early last year, Ms. Malveaux was drowning. She lived alone in a tidy   home in a leafy Denver neighborhood that she paid for by working shifts at a Samsonite luggage factory, now closed. Laundry piled up. Bills went unpaid. Doors were left unlocked. Pans sometimes burned on the stove as her memory failed. “I had lost my mind,” she recalled, sitting on her couch in a pink velour robe. “I couldn’t keep up my house. ” For Americans who find themselves in this situation, the next stop is often a traditional nursing home. Ms. Malveaux’s son took her instead to visit an InnovAge day center. The $9 million building south of downtown Denver is designed to calm people with dementia. It has subdued lighting and winding hallways that encircle the first floor like a running track and discourage “  behaviors,” where patients search for ways out of a building. For the frightened Ms. Malveaux, it seemed like paradise: a flower garden, a beauty salon and day trips to casinos and candy factories. And, most importantly, it had a team of doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, dentists, physical therapists, nutritionists, home health aides and social workers whose purpose was to help her live safely in her beloved brick home. After joining the center last June 2015, Ms. Malveaux began seeing a psychiatrist and went on medication for depression. A social worker coached her grandson, Jermaine Malveaux, on how to care for someone with dementia. Three days a week, an InnovAge van picks up Ms. Malveaux at home and takes her to the center to share lunch with other older adults and try her luck at bingo and ceramics. “I make friends easily,” she said with a smile. “And the guys flirt with me. ” The InnovAge center, like other PACE facilities, is inspired by Britain’s   Day Hospitals, outpatient health care facilities that arose in the 1950s that became a hub of daily life for many older people. In the United States, the earliest incarnation of PACE was started in San Francisco in 1971 by a group of Asian and Italian immigrant families seeking alternatives to the American nursing home. Federal health officials allowed the group, called On Lok  —   Cantonese for “peaceful, happy abode”  —   to test what was then a novel and prophetic approach to health care financing. Instead of physicians billing Medicare each time they treated a patient, the government would pay a fixed amount to the center for each member. On Lok would assume the financial risk, similar to an insurance company. In 1990, Medicare officially sanctioned the model. In exchange for a capped monthly payment from Medicare and Medicaid, PACE staff members arrange and pay for all of a patient’s doctors’ visits, medications, rehabilitation and hospitalizations. At the same time, they are supposed to pay attention to the patient’s daily needs  —   meals, bathing, housekeeping and transportation to day centers, where older people can ward off isolation and cognitive decline by socializing. (Studies have found that the intensive caretaking reduces costly hospital stays.) Comparing the cost effectiveness of PACE against nursing homes is difficult, partly because state Medicaid agencies pay a variety of rates. But all the states are required to keep their rates below what they would pay for nursing home care. In Colorado, for example, that amounts to 7 percent less per patient. On average, Medicare and Medicaid pay PACE providers $76, 728 a person a year, about $5, 500 less than the average cost of a nursing home. And the money going to PACE covers all of the person’s health and social needs, unlike nursing home care, which doesn’t include hospitalizations and other expensive medical care. The flat government payment pushes the organizations to invest in maintaining a patient’s health and safety to avoid big hospital bills. Dentistry  —   excluded from traditional Medicare coverage  —   is a crucial focus: Programs invest heavily to fix broken teeth and dentures to avoid costly infections or poor nutrition that can cause cascading health problems. Providers are also generous with rehabilitation, setting few limits on training sessions that strengthen injured muscles and sturdy patients against falls. “If you’re neglecting these patients, the odds they’ll call an ambulance and go to the hospital and spend a week there because they’re really sick is pretty high, and that all comes out of the payment,” said Bob Kocher, a former senior health care adviser to President Obama. Profits are in no way guaranteed, though. The centers still face major financial risk  —   it just takes a few patients with serious medical conditions to upend the books. Dan Gray, a PACE financing consultant at Continuum Development Services, said too many trips to the emergency room or an expensive hospital stay can flip fortunes. One organization he advises had $300, 000 in hospital medical claims in a month that he refers to as “Black August. ” “I had a nervous twitch,” he said. In January, at the health care industry’s leading matchmaking event, the J. P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, word quickly spread that PACE programs could save states and the federal government up to 20 percent a patient. And suddenly, the program became one of the hottest topics of discussion. “Every other conversation was, ‘What do you think we should do with PACE? ’” said Bill Pomeranz, a managing director at Cain Brothers, who helped finance the nation’s first PACE program in the 1970s. The message appeared to travel down Highway 101 as well, to the heart of the technology industry. At least eight   have circulated   pitches to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, hoping to tap into new capital and create   versions of the program. The interest of the tech industry is so far only nascent. But the possibility that Silicon Valley, notoriously aggressive and extremely   could play a significant role in PACE underscores the changes that may lie ahead. Building a center requires medical offices, rehabilitation equipment, food service and fleets of   vans. On average, it takes up to $12 million just to get it off the ground. That is a lot of money for most nonprofits but relatively little in the technology world. Opening new centers may become less of a hurdle. The tech industry and nonprofit world are driven by different impulses. The early centers were closely tied to local cultures, making them difficult to replicate. An aversion to aggressive marketing among the center’s leaders didn’t help, either. Tech likes to move as fast as possible. “PACE reminds me of religious orthodoxy,” said Mr. Pomeranz, who said he had affection for the program. The movement’s leaders come from the world of public health and have a “social work mentality,” he added. The pitches circulating among investors envision   programs that would rely, in part, on video visits and sensors. Some studies have found that telemedicine can help patients better control certain chronic conditions and reduce health care spending. But those technologies are largely untested in geriatric care. “The entrepreneurs coming into this space all believe there are much   ways to check on patients every day than driving them all to one building,” said Mr. Kocher, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Venrock, which invests in health care companies. These sorts of pitches, while promising, have not been universally welcomed. They have even been used as evidence that opening PACE up to   companies might lead to unwanted consequences. Veteran PACE providers, for example, are skeptical of virtual medicine’s benefits to seniors, especially those with dementia. “Socialization goes a long way to improve the health of the participants we serve,” said Kelly Hopkins, president of Trinity Health PACE, a nonprofit health system that operates PACE centers in eight states. “It’s naïve to think you can do it virtually. ” Supporters of the change say the necessary safeguards are in place. The   centers were approved, to little fanfare, after the Department of Health and Human Services submitted the results of a pilot study to Congress in June 2015. The demonstration project, in Pennsylvania, showed no difference in quality of care and costs between nonprofit PACE providers and a   allowed to operate there. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has vowed to closely track the performance of all PACE operators by measuring emergency room use, falls and vaccination rates, among other metrics. The National PACE Association, a policy and lobbying group, is also considering   accreditation to help safeguard the program. Oversight is now largely left to state Medicaid agencies. Maureen Hewitt, InnovAge’s chief executive, said, “At the end of the day, we’re held to the same quality and care standards. ” Dr. Si France, a founder of WelbeHealth, an   company based in Menlo Park, Calif. says   can use technology to improve clinical communication, help caregivers make treatment decisions and monitor patients at home or in a hospital. But he insists even a   PACE program cannot veer from its origins. “It’s not a way to get rich or generate outsize returns,” said Dr. France, the former chief executive of GoHealth, a chain of urgent care centers acquired by TPG Capital, a private equity firm. “We think this is an arena for missionaries, not mercenaries. ” Families enrolled in InnovAge’s PACE program in Denver appeared to be unaware of its conversion into a   enterprise. The company did not announce the change directly to its participants, but notified a patient advisory group. Kathy Baron, 68, who lives in subsidized senior housing, was left disabled by breast cancer and debilitating nerve pain. Her daughter, Leah van Zelm, struggled to take care of her. So Ms. Baron, fearful she would be deemed unfit to stay in her apartment, signed up for InnovAge’s program. “I would rather be dead than go into a nursing home,” Ms. Baron said. She says InnovAge has been generous with services, echoing interviews with other patients. Each week, an InnovAge housekeeper changes the sheets on her bed, launders her clothes and cleans her apartment, a service provided to those unable to tidy their own homes. The few times her requests for special equipment or services were denied, Ms. Baron appealed and won. But she worries new investors will skimp on what outsiders might view as unwarranted services. The company’s commercials, promising “Life on Your Terms” and voiced by the actress Susan Sarandon, have reinforced those concerns. It’s a concern echoed by Ms. Malveaux’s family. “Anytime you involve money,” said Jermaine Malveaux, Ms. Malveaux’s grandson, “there’s always the concern for greed, especially with the elderly. ” At least in the near future, the number of companies getting into PACE programs will be limited. Most states cap enrollment in PACE centers. And each state  —   as Colorado did, opening the window for InnovAge  —   likely needs to amend its law to allow the   companies. So far, it appears only California has done so. Yet there is a growing realization among longtime PACE providers that new competition looms. In a newsletter to the generally placid PACE community, one adviser warned that providers who failed to become bigger would face new entrants who “will find a way to meet the needs of persons in your community. ” Those needs will only grow as the adult children of baby boomers face difficult decisions about how to care for their parents. In the meantime, for people like Ms. Van Zelm, the anxiety that once pervaded her daily life has diminished. “When she’s stable,” Ms. Van Zelm said of her mother, “my daily life stress is reduced. ”",0

Lesley Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: Youre president-elect.
Donald Trump: Thank you.
Lesley Stahl: How surprised were you?
Donald Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--
Lesley Stahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.
Donald Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, How are we gonna lose? We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, This doesnt look like second place. So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.
Lesley Stahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?
 Donald Trump: I think so, its enormous. Ive done a lotta big things, Ive never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- its so enormous, its so amazing.
 Lesley Stahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldnt talk?
Donald Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.
Lesley Stahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.
Donald Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldnt have been nicer. She just said, Congratulations, Donald, well done. And I said, I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor. She is very strong and very smart.
Lesley Stahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?
Donald Trump: He did, he called the next day.
Lesley Stahl: Really? What did he say?
Donald Trump: He actually called last night.
Lesley Stahl: What did he say?
Donald Trump: And he-- he couldnt have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing hes ever seen.
Lesley Stahl: He said that.
Donald Trump: He was very, very-- really, very nice.
Lesley Stahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?
Donald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.
Donald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, Im sitting here with you now and were gonna do a great job for the country. Were going to make America great again, I mean, thats what-- it-- it began with that and thats where we are right now. There are so many--
Lesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--
Donald Trump: I cant regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that Im very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.
Lesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?
Donald Trump: Sure.
Lesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?
Donald Trump: 15 max.
[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]
Donald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--
Lesley Stahl: Like what?
Donald Trump: Well
Lesley Stahl: Give us some meat.
Donald Trump: Well, look I dont want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, thats tough. Its a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.
Lesley Stahl: Uh-huh.
Donald Trump: And I like having that because Im going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.
Donald Trump:and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--
Lesley Stahl: Like--
Donald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.
Lesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.
Donald Trump: Well, he didnt ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.
Lesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--
Donald Trump: No, I think Im a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. Im not. Im actually not. Im a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really foundit might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.
[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]
Lesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what youve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said youre-- unqualified--
Donald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?
Lesley Stahl: Yeah.
Donald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other
Lesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?
Donald Trump: Ill be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And thats strange. Im actually surprised to tell you that. Its-- you know, a little bit strange.
[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]
Lesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?
Donald Trump: No, I think its a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. Theyve let em down on the job front. Theyve even let em down in terms of the war front. You know, weve been fighting this war for 15 years--
Lesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.
Donald Trump: Weve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of whats been taking place over a longer period of time than that.
Lesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?
Donald Trump: You know, Ill conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, its going to be America first. Its not going to be what were doingwe, weve lost-- were losing this country. Were losing this country. Thats why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?
 Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I dont want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.
Lesley Stahl: Can you be?
Donald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, thats easier. Honestly to do that, its easier.
Lesley Stahl: So lets go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if youre going to do what you said or youre going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: Theyre talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?
Donald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. Im very good at this, its called construction.
Lesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?
Donald Trump: Yeah, it could be  it could be some fencing.
Lesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?
Donald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But were getting them out of our country, theyre here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, were going to make a determination on the people that youre talking about who are terrific people, theyre terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, its very important, we want to secure our border.
[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]
Lesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?
Donald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. Were going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--
Lesley Stahl: And youve got both Houses?
Donald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--
Lesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.
Donald Trump: Its been a long time since its happened.
Donald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Dont forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.
Lesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team
Donald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.
 Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?
 Donald Trump: I dont like it, no.
 Lesley Stahl: You dont like it, but your own transition team, its filled with lobbyists.
 Donald Trump: Thats the only people you have down there.
 Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.
Donald Trump: Sure. Everybodys a lobbyist down there--
 Lesley Stahl: Well, wait
 Donald Trump: Thats what they are. Theyre lobbyists or special interests
Lesley Stahl: On your own transition team.
 Donald Trump:we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--
 Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--
 Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- thats the problem with the system, the system. Right now, were going to clean it up. Were having restrictions on foreign money coming in, were going to put on term limits, which a lot of people arent happy about, but were putting on term limits. Were doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.
Lesley Stahl: But youre, but youre basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?
Donald Trump: Im saying that they know the system right now, but were going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.
 Lesley Stahl: Lets talk about your cabinet.
 Donald Trump: OK.
 Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?
 Donald Trump: Yes.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us.
Donald Trump: Well, I cant tell you that, but I have made--
Lesley Stahl: Oh, come on
Donald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, Ive spoken to many of them and Ill call the rest of them, but and I said, Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is. France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asiaand very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.
Lesley Stahl: One of the things youre going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume youll do that quickly?
Donald Trump: Yes. Very important.
Lesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?
Donald Trump: So look, heres whats going to happen-- Im going to-- Im pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. Theyll be very
Lesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--
Donald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. Theyll be pro-life, theyll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybodys talking about the Second Amendment and theyre trying to dice it up and change it, theyre going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--
 Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women wont be able to get an abortion?
 Donald Trump: No, itll go back to the states.
Lesley Stahl: By stateno some --
 Donald Trump: Yeah.
 Donald Trump: Yeah, well, theyll perhaps have to go, theyll have to go to another state.
 Lesley Stahl: And thats OK?
Donald Trump: Well, well see what happens. Its got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.
 Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what youre taking on?
 Donald Trump: No.
 Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
 Donald Trump: I respect it. But Im not scared by it.
Lesley Stahl: Now youre not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--
Donald Trump: Thats only because they dont know me. I really believe thats only because--
Lesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and thats--
Donald Trump: I just dont think they know me.
 Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think theyre demonstrating against?
Donald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--
 Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are
 Donald Trump: Well Lesley
 Lesley Stahl: are professional?
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--
Lesley Stahl: OK, but what about  theyre in every city.
Lesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, dont you say to yourself, I guess you dont, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? Theyre afraid.
 Donald Trump: I would tell them dont be afraid, absolutely.
Lesley Stahl: But thats not what youre saying, I said it-
 Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, Ive been saying it.
 Lesley Stahl: OK.
Donald Trump: Dont be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, dont be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, Oh, thats a terrible thing. And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.
It has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clintons edge in the popular vote, have been significant.
When we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.
Nor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.
Donald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--
Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it?
Donald Trump: I dont hear itI saw, I saw one or two instances
Lesley Stahl: On social media?
Donald Trump: But I think its a very small amount. Again, I think its--
Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?
Donald Trump: I would say dont do it, thats terrible, cause Im gonna bring this country together.
 Lesley Stahl: Theyre harassing Latinos, Muslims--
Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, Stop it. If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.
During the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clintons email issue.
So we asked him if he plans to carry that out.
That part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.
On Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.
Between now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. Thats 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.
When we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.
Donald Trump: Yeah.
Lesley Stahl: You said that they were professionalsand you said it was unfair.
Donald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --
Lesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever youre upset about just put out there when youre president?
Donald Trump: So its a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--
Lesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?
Donald Trump: Its a great form of communication. Now, do I say Ill give it up entirely and throw out, thats a tremendous form-- I pick up-- Im picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. Im not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. Thats very tough--
Lesley Stahl: But youre going to do that as president?
Donald Trump: Im going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, Im going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. Its a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. Its-- its where its at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where theyre spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
Donald Trump: Well, Ill tell you what Im going to do, Im going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that weve been talking about.
Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--
Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away.
Lesley Stahl: You called her crooked Hillary, said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, Lock em up.
Donald Trump: Yeah. She did--
Lesley Stahl: Do you
Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--
Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might
Donald Trump: I dont want to hurt them. I dont want to hurt them. Theyre, theyre good people. I dont want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.
With that
[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]
We were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. Shell be only the second foreign-born first lady. Shes from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams wife Louisa was the first.
Lesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. Youre about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--
Melania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And its-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- its-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. Im very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.
Lesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think shes going to be?
Donald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but shes very warm. And I think shell have a platform where shell really be able to do a lot of good. And thats what she wants to do.
Lesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And youve already said youre interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.
Melania Trump: I think its very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.
Its an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What about your husbands tweeting?
Melania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.
Lesley Stahl: So you never say to him, Come on?
Melania Trump: I did.
Donald Trump: She does--
Melania Trump: I--
Melania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But
Lesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?
Melania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesnt--
Donald Trump: Im not a big tweeter. I mean, I dont do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.
Lesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?
Melania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.
Lesley Stahl: All the time?
Melania Trump: All the time.
Lesley Stahl: And does--
Melania Trump: And--
Lesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--
Melania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. Hes an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.
Lesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?
Donald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way hes affected every bit as much. Maybe more.
Lesley Stahl: Maybe more.
Donald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job. And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.
Lesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?
Melania Trump: 10.
Lesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?
Melania Trump: He knows. He knows--
Lesley Stahl: He knows?
Melania Trump: --whats going on. And, hes very proud of his dad.
Lesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?
Melania Trump: No. I didnt feel it.
Lesley Stahl: Not at all?
Melania Trump: No.
Lesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.
Melania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.
Lesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. Thats an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?
Melania Trump: Theyre here.
Lesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?
Melania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.
Lesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hairs out of place. Are you both prepared for this?
Melania Trump: We are used to it.
Donald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, cause Ive had a lot. But Ive never had anything like this.
Lesley Stahl: You wont be able to walk down the street--
Melania Trump: I didnt do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. Its another level, but it will continue.
At that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.
Lesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?
Donald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I dont-- I havent made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --
Lesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?
Donald Trump: Well, theres been a lotta leaking, theres no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before Id answer a question like that.
Lesley Stahl: Sounds like youre not sure.
Donald Trump: Well, sure, Im not sure. Id wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?
Donald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now Im under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didnt care because I won the election very easily. So they dont care. I never thought they did care.
Lesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.
Donald Trump: I do.
Lesley Stahl: So do you still think its rigged?
Donald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.
Lesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--
Donald Trump: You know, its--
Lesley Stahl: --its rigged?
Donald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--
Lesley Stahl: Even though you won youre saying that--
Donald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, Im not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. Theres a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and theres something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.
Lesley Stahl: What about vacations? Youre not going to take any vacations? Youve said that.
Donald Trump: We have so much work. Theres so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. Were lowering taxes, were taking care of health care. I mean, theres just so much to be done. So I dont think well be very big on vacations, no.
Lesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the presidents salary?
Donald Trump: Well, Ive never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so Ill take $1 a year. But its a -- I dont even know what it is.
Donald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?
Lesley Stahl: $400,000 youre giving up.
Donald Trump: No, Im not gonna take the salary. Im not taking it.
In a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.
On Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into Americas ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasnt been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.
But Mr. Trumps appeal wasnt just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.
Hillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didnt come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trumps new and energized coalition.
On Friday Mr. Trumps four older children  Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their fathers surprising victory.
Lesley Stahl: Set the scene. Its election night. Your father-- no ones expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.
Eric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states  theyre all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--
Lesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --its-- its--
Lesley Stahl: --is what I heard.
Eric Trump: --its a moment Ill never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybodys cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.
Ivanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. Its incredibly exciting. And were very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.
Lesley Stahl: Tiffany?
Tiffany Trump: I mean I dont think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone thats worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And its just  its really awe-inspiring.
At some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in  including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.
Lesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?
Donald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign. And then I got a call from George and he said-- Congratulations. It was great. And, you know, look, its-- its a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jebs a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, Im disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I dont know how you sign a pledge and then you dont honor it. It was a rough primary. Its a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.
Lesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your fathers changed in the campaign. How has he changed?
Ivanka Trump: I think its impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet-- and in my fathers case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.
Lesley Stahl: Do you think your fathers changed?
Eric Trump: I think as a family, weve changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, its fighting by our fathers side every single day as youve gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.
Lesley Stahl: Don, did you discover something about your father that you didnt know before?
Donald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And weve got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that hes always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, Well, it wasnt triage. Which state are we gonna do today, its, Were just gonna do em all. Were gonna speak to all of these people. And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew.
Lesley Stahl: I want to ask you all about something thats going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. Theyre really afraid. African Americans think theres a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.
Donald Trump: I think its horrible if thats happening. I think its built up by the press because, frankly, theyll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which couldve been there before. If I werent even around doing this, and theyll make into an event because thats the way the press is.
Lesley Stahl: Do any of you want to say anything about this fear thats out there?
Donald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.
Lesley Stahl: One of the groups thats expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You--
Donald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And--
Lesley Stahl: You did.
Donald Trump: Everybody said, That was so great. I have been, you know, Ive been-a supporter.
Lesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?
Donald Trump: It-- its irrelevant because it was already settled. Its law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean its done.
Lesley Stahl: So even if you appoint a judge that--
Donald Trump: Its done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. Theyve been settled. And, Im fine with that.
Lesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your fathers temperament. And he has himself has said, If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, Im gonna strike back. And now people are saying, Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little. What-- how do you think hes going to comport himself as president?
Eric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think thats what this country elected.
Donald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word Temperament. It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didnt work because were here and theyre not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and were going to start winning again. Were going to win on trade, were going to win at the borders, were going to knock out ISIS.
Lesley Stahl: You have said that youre gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to?
Donald Trump: I dont tell you that. I dont tell you that.
Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can --
Donald Trump: Im not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- its a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that?
Lesley Stahl: Troops on the ground?
Donald Trump: Im not gonna say anything. I dont want to tell them anything. I dont want to tell anybody anything.
Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but what aboutthe American people.
Donald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.
Lesley Stahl: You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS
Donald Trump: Well, Ill be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job theyve done. OK, look at the job theyve done. They havent done the job. Now, maybe its leadership, maybe its something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is were going to get rid of ISIS.
Lesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say youre going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
Donald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.
Lesley Stahl: Youre going to keep that?
Donald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, were gonna--
Lesley Stahl: Youre gonna keep that--
Donald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but its very much something were going to try and keep.
Lesley Stahl: And theres going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose - no?
Donald Trump: No, were going to do it simultaneously. Itll be just fine. Were not going to have, like, a two-day period and were not going to have a two-year period where theres nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And well know. And itll be great health care for much less money. So itll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.
Lesley Stahl: Roles during the administration. Any of you want a job in your fathers administration? Eric Trump: So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think hes going to rely on us more than ever. And--
Lesley Stahl: So youll stay up here?
Eric Trump: So well-- well-- well be in New York and well take care of the business. I think were going to have a lot of fun doing it. And were going to make him very proud.
Lesley Stahl: People think that youre going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.
Ivanka Trump: Im-- no. Im going to be a daughter. But Ive-- Ive said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.
Lesley Stahl: But you wont be inside--
Ivanka Trump: Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. Im very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, therere a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.
Lesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.
Ivanka Trump: I dont think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, thats the focus.
Donald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, Who cares? Who cares? This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. Were going to save our country. I dont care about hotel occupancy. Its peanuts compared to what were doing. Health care, making people better. Its unfair whats happened to the people of our country and were going to change it. As simple as that.

18441,Michael Moore: People Voting Trump As “Ultimate F–– You… A Human Molotov Cocktail”,"
A tidal wave is coming.
Michael Moore, a liberal’s liberal who holds die-hard loyalty to Hillary Clinton, is acknowledging what everyone with a clear head recognizes: that she doesn’t even remotely connect with the average voter, doesn’t understand their problems – and above all, doesn’t care about them.
Although Moore can’t support Donald Trump, he seems to admire his ability to resonate with the actual problems that the people who formerly made up the middle class are going through – economic and otherwise. Moore, like Trump, understands the pulse of the people, though they differ in just about every other way.
This election represents a pivotal point, and an end of the line for the deal that people once held with their leaders. After decades of broken promises and deals to sell them short and sell them out, people have had enough.
THAT’S what this election is about.
Right or wrong, Trump represents a rebuke of the system – as Moore calls it, the ultimate “F––– You” ever directed at the system.
If you make this go viral, Trump will win. It’s 4 minutes that makes the choice in this election crystal clear. #EarlyVoting pic.twitter.com/UOgqSfet6a 
— Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) October 25, 2016 

Here’s some of what he said in an epic rant (reportedly excerpted from his rush-election film Trumpland) that is strangely validating of Trump’s entire campaign:
Whether Trump means it or not, it’s kind of irrelevant because he’s saying the things that people who are hurting. And it’s why every beaten down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle-class loves Trump. 
“They’re not racists or rednecks, they’re actually pretty decent people. So, after talking to a number of them, I sort of wanted to sort of write this.”
[…]
Donald Trump came to the Detroit Economic Club and stood there in front of the Ford Motor executives and said: if you close these factories, as you are planning to do in Detroit, and rebuild them in Mexico, I am going to put a 35% tariff on those cars when you send them back and nobody’s going to buy them. 
It was an amazing thing to see. No politician — Republican or Democrat — had ever said anything like that to these executives. It was music to the ears of people in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Brexit states. You live here in Ohio. You know what I am talking about.
He is the human Molotov cocktail that they have been waiting for. The human hand grenade that they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them. And on November 8th — Election Day — although they have lost their jobs. Although they’ve been foreclosed on by the bank. Next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone. The car’s been repossessed. They haven’t had a real vacation in years. They’re stuck with the shitty Obamacare bronze plan. They can’t even get a f**king percocet.
They have essentially lost everything they had…except one thing. The one thing that doesn’t cost them a cent and is guaranteed to them by the American Constitution: the right to vote.
[…] So, on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain, take that lever — or felt pen or touchscreen — and put a big f**king X in the box by the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives: Donald J. Trump. 
[…]
They see that the elites who have ruined their lives hate Trump.
Corporate America hates Trump. Wall Street hates Trump. The career politicians hate Trump. The Media hates Trump…
The enemy of my enemy is who I am voting for on November 8th.
Trump’s election is going to be the biggest F**K YOU ever recorded in human history. 
And it will feel good.
What red-blooded American, working stiff or laid off schmo wouldn’t want to stick it to the establishment and rebuke the very system that brought them to this point? After all, it is their fault.
People have been hurting and in decline for eight long years – and for all his smiles and posturing, Obama hasn’t done a damned thing. And Hillary can’t even pretend.
The people who will be deciding the popular vote in this election want to take down that system and put someone in who will – once and for all – stand up for them. Basically, Americans want revenge.
What the electoral college decides is another matter altogether, of course.

18442,Saudis Foil ISIS Terror Attacks on Packed Stadium,"Saudi Arabia says it has thwarted two ISIS terrorism plots concerning a bomb attack on a football stadium and killing police officers. 2 Shares
1 0 0 1
The Saudi Interior Ministry on Sunday announced that four men were arrested over plans to detonate a bomb at the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium during or after an October 11 World Cup qualifier match against United Arab Emirates in the city of Jeddah. The suspects were arrested one day before the match which gathered over 60,000 fans.
“ISIS wants any operation that could result in the highest number of victims,” said interior ministry spokesman Major General Mansour al-Turki.
A security official, General Bassam Attiyah, said a vehicle carrying around 400 kilograms of explosives was found near the stadium. He added that the suspects had planned to either target people in the stadium’s parking lot or fans watching the match.
“Another equally horrifying scenario would have occurred,” he added, “had the device exploded whilst the spectators were exiting the stadium.”
He noted that the blast radius would have been something around 1,100 meters which would have covered an area of almost 800,000 square meters.

“Tighter security measures were taken and more troops were deployed to ensure prompt and decisive action against any suspect or suspicious activity. Greater field work resulted in the identification and arrest of the suspects one day before the match,” he added.

18444,The Big Question for the U.S. Economy: How Much Room Is There to Grow? - The New York Times,"The most important issue for the United States economy in 2017 and beyond is whether it’s near its speed limit. It has taken eight years of glacial expansion, but the nation is closing in on what economists believe to be its full productive capacity. It’s nearing that level of activity in which nearly everybody who wants a job has one, and factories and offices are cranking at full speed. If the economy grows just 2. 5 percent this year, gross domestic product will reach the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the nation’s economic potential by the end of the year. If the Trump administration succeeds at achieving the 4 percent growth the president has said he seeks, we’ll be there by the Fourth of July. If there is in fact more room to grow beyond the budget office’s estimate of “potential G. D. P. ,” an economic boom remains possible. If there isn’t, higher growth will translate into inflation, not higher output and incomes. The question for the Trump administration, the Federal Reserve and every American who wants a higher paycheck is how much slack there really is in the economy. Economic slack takes the form of empty warehouses and office parks of machines that run eight hours a day when they were built to run for 12 and, most important, millions of Americans who might be coaxed to work in a booming economy but who aren’t even looking for a job now. If there is a lot of slack, then the Trump administration’s ambitious growth targets look more plausible, and the Fed should move slowly on raising interest rates so as not to choke off the expansion just as it’s getting going. If there’s not very much  —   if this is about the best the nation can expect to do  —   then either the Fed will raise rates more quickly to choke off growth or inflation will burst higher, or both. Astronomers can’t observe a black hole directly they can determine where one is only by measuring how it affects nearby matter. Potential output is similar. For all the apparent precision of reports from government agencies, potential G. D. P. isn’t something that can be directly measured. It’s a judgment based on other evidence. How big is the population of prime   people, and how many of them would be expected to seek work? How low in the past has unemployment gone before inflation became a problem? What is the recent record of productivity growth? In assessing how close we are (or aren’t) to full capacity, it helps to look at America’s industrial parks and office complexes. The Federal Reserve watches the industrial sector by measuring what is called factory capacity utilization. American companies were operating factories at 75. 7 percent of their potential in January. That’s roughly the rate they’ve been at for the last five years. Experience suggests it could go higher. In the spring of 2007, the rate was 79. 5 percent. It was above 80 percent for the better part of the 1990s. In other words, the manufacturing sector would seem to have room to produce more stuff even without expanding factory floors or adding equipment. At Caterpillar, the giant maker of heavy equipment based in Peoria, Ill. Jim Umpleby, the chief executive, told analysts last month that, even as it closely managed costs, “we’re also preserving capacity for a potential increase in business whenever that comes. ” Economic slack is trickier to measure in the service sector good luck judging whether, say, an insurance company is operating below or at its full potential. But one window into it is the office vacancy rate. Nationwide, 15. 8 percent of office space was vacant in the final months of 2016, according to the real estate information firm Reis. That was down from a recent high of 17. 6 percent in 2011  —   but could still have room to fall. In the last expansion, it fell as low as 12. 5 percent, implying that millions of square feet of offices are sitting idle, ready for   workers to fill them. “Vacancy has fallen, but there are still some large blocks of space out there,” said John Ferguson, president of the Southeast division of the commercial real estate firm CBRE. “A tenant can typically find a   solution if they need to, even if it’s not perfect for the long term. ” One thing to keep an eye on: Development of new office space has been relatively depressed since the 2008 recession, which raises the possibility that the remaining vacant space could be filled up quickly with little new supply arriving to fulfill the demand. Mr. Ferguson sees it in Atlanta, where he is based, and in other Southern cities like Nashville and Charlotte, N. C. “In the last cycle 10 years ago, there were six new office towers added in Buckhead,” Mr. Ferguson said, referring to an affluent Atlanta neighborhood. “In this cycle, there’s one. ” The biggest factor that will determine how much room the United States economy has to grow is the supply of workers. The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: The 4. 8 percent unemployment rate is roughly what Fed officials believe is the   rate that won’t provoke inflation, and not far from the 4. 4 percent low in the last expansion. But there are important wrinkles. Millions of Americans left the labor force entirely in the aftermath of the last recession. And there are “missing” workers, people who do not count as unemployed because they are not looking for a job but might be available to work  —   and contribute to G. D. P.  —   if things were rosier. To people who work on employment issues, there is both good news and bad. “A third to a half of the people on the sidelines, it wouldn’t take much to employ tomorrow,” said Stefani Pashman, chief executive of Partner4Work, a work force development group in the Pittsburgh area. “The other half are much tougher to employ,” often facing challenges from drug use, criminal records and transience. That would seem to support the idea that there are meaningful numbers of   workers out there  —   but not an unlimited number. The Economic Policy Institute calculates that there are 1. 85 million missing workers. In all these areas, the evidence points to an economy not being quite on the verge of overheating, but also not offering huge potential for growth. Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don’t know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years. Here’s a weighty fact: In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office published   projections of potential G. D. P. that assumed the United States would grow around 2. 7 percent a year for the ensuing decade. It didn’t. Growth in both the labor force and worker productivity underperformed those projections. So the reality we’re living in underperforms that theoretical potential by $2. 2 trillion, or 14 percent. One possibility of what went wrong is that the damage of the deep 2008 recession had lasting effects, both pulling some Americans out of the work force and causing businesses to underinvest in innovations. Weak demand for goods and services damaged the capacity of the economy, producing a vicious cycle. If officials at the Fed and in the Trump administration try to run the economy a little hot  —   to keep pursuing faster growth even as the economy gets close to or above potential G. D. P.  —   it would be a chance to do the reverse, to create a virtuous cycle. Trying it carries risks of its own  —   of inflation, and perhaps new financial bubbles. The alternative is to take the   world we’ve been living in as an immutable fact of life, and get used to it.",0

18446,"7 Reasons Why Obamacare 2.0 Is All But Guaranteed to Impose Crushing Costs on Voters, Hurt Trump’s Base, And Hand Power Back to the Democrats - Breitbart","If passed in its current form, the GOP’s Obamacare 2. 0 bill will impose brutal costs Americans still struggling to make it through a great recession —  particularly President Donald Trump’s base —  and risk handing Congress and the presidency back to Democrats. [1) The bill’s provisions increase healthcare costs for Trump voters in critical states. As an analysis conducted by the Washington Post shows, voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin will see their tax credits decrease under Obamacare 2. 0. “If you’re a    making $75, 000 a year, you’re going to get a 75 percent or higher increase to your tax credits —  a beneficial situation for you,” the Post explains. “If, however, you’re a    making $30, 000 a year, you’re going to see a reduction in those tax credits (unless you live in Upstate New York or Massachusetts or parts of central Texas). ”  In other words, senior citizens —  who vote regularly in   elections —  will see their healthcare costs increase under the Republicans’ bill. Plus, Obamacare 2. 0 phases out credits for people who start earning more than $75, 000. Why? Because screw the voters and they’re on their own? What a great message to send to the middle class! Not only are Republicans hurting people struggling to make ends meet, they also punish you if you make too much money. Everyone loses, except perhaps insurance companies. 2) Meanwhile, the bill is “a gift to illegal aliens,” as conservative author Daniel Horowitz writes. Illegals can get health care through identity theft and fraud, because Obamacare 2. 0 makes it impossible to check enrollees’ immigration status. The bill incentivizes further illegal immigration by encouraging illegals to come to the U. S. to cut into   programs meant for citizens. Poll after poll shows Trump’s immigration policies prioritizing Americans and their problems over foreigners and their wants are hugely popular with voters. Giving away health care to illegals, while ramping up the price for Trump’s core voters, is a slap in the face. 3) Obamacare 2. 0 will be labeled as “Trumpcare,” and Democrats and their media allies will highlight every hard case to attack Republicans for hurting the poor and elderly. Remember when a progressive group put out an ad showing Paul Ryan pushing a grandma in a wheelchair off a cliff? Obamacare 2. 0 gives the media and the Democrats a golden opportunity to walk away from their healthcare mess and blame Republicans, and amplify that message endlessly. 4) Republicans kicked things off with horrific messaging. In a condescending statement, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz told Americans they’ll have to “invest” in their health care instead of getting a new iPhone. “Americans have choices,” he said on CNN. “And they’ve got to make a choice. And so, maybe rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They’ve got to make those decisions for themselves. ” Being forced to buy a product that doesn’t deliver adequate care and keeps increasing in price year after year isn’t an “investment,” for one.   pointed out that Chaffetz was mocking poor people who get blindsided by a health crisis: “If   families make the wrong series of choices, forcing them to choose between their health and their finances, that’s on them. How’s that for a winning message?” The Huffington Post immediately splashed a photo of Chaffetz pointing his finger at the viewer: Chaffetz later walked back his comments, but the damage was done. They sound especially bad in light of Obamacare 2. 0’s “continuous coverage” provision. 5) The arbitrary and crushing penalty for not enrolling during the   period will hurt financially struggling voters already fighting to stay afloat. As Avik Roy writes in Forbes, the “continuous coverage” part inflicts a massive cost increase on those who go without paying for a plan for more than 63 days. “Worse still, the bill contains an arbitrary ‘continuous coverage’ provision, in which those who sign up for coverage outside of the normal open enrollment period would pay a 30 percent surcharge to the normal insurance premium,” Roy writes. And you have to pay this for an entire year —  which will not go over well with people struggling to pay for rent, for childcare, for student loans. In other words, it’s not enough to pay a   penalty if you forget to sign up for your Obamacare 2. 0 in time or choose to forgo insurance altogether. No, you have to pay 30 percent more, on top of rising costs, for a whole year. How is this supposed to help, say, parents with three kids paying a large monthly premium (not counting eye and dental, of course) with a high deductible? 6) This bill is going to unleash the kind of political fury on Republicans that will elect Elizabeth Warren in 2020. Part of what killed Hillary Clinton’s campaign was voters getting their massive Obamacare premium increases in the mail in October. Republicans seem eager to inflict that kind of fatal damage on themselves. The explosive reaction to Obamacare launched the Tea Party in 2010 and swept Republicans into Congress during the   elections of 2014. The Left is furious and energetic under Trump. The 2018 midterm elections are right around the corner, and Democrats are going to launch a holy war against Trump during the 2020 election. The Left will rally around Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other progressives and portray the Democrats as the party of the forgotten man. The white, working class gave Trump a chance in 2016. They could easily begin voting Democratic again or drop out of the political process altogether after a healthcare betrayal. 7) It destroys political capital desperately needed for the rest of Trump’s first term, particularly   immigration reform. Trump’s election victory wasn’t a     election. It was     or   . Republicans have one, brief chance to correct the course the U. S. is heading down and bind up all of the wounds inflicted on Americans over the decades. There is a small window to end the era of cheap labor, low wages, mass immigration,   communities, family disintegration, drug addiction, and suicide. Will Republicans take it and secure their party’s dominance for the next 50 years? Or will they throw it away? Sixty percent of adults are “hopeful and optimistic” about America’s future. That’s a precious opportunity, one that shouldn’t be wasted. “The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f —  ed over. If we deliver, we’ll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we’ll govern for 50 years,” White House Chief strategist Steve Bannon said during a November interview. “That’s what the Democrats missed  …     They lost sight of what the world is about. ” Will Trump continue to support Obamacare 2. 0 despite conservative and populist dissent?

18449,"As Democrats Nudge Bernie Sanders, G.O.P. Tries to Rein In Donald Trump - The New York Times","Democratic and Republican leaders on Wednesday renewed their fitful efforts to impose greater order on a freewheeling presidential race and to bring to heel a pair of political renegades, Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump, whose upstart campaigns have roiled the political establishment. For Democrats impatient to rally around Hillary Clinton as their presumptive nominee, Mr. Sanders has lingered as an obstacle so stubborn and frustrating that only President Obama’s intervention might dislodge him soon. Mr. Obama is expected to meet with Mr. Sanders in Washington on Thursday and increase the pressure on the irascible Vermonter to defer to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama, White House aides said, intends to nudge Mr. Sanders toward embracing her, stressing that Mr. Sanders can further his policy agenda while unifying the party to defeat Mr. Trump in November. The White House strategy will culminate with the president’s formal endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in the coming days, followed by an appearance with her on the campaign trail soon after. But leaders in both parties are approaching Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump gingerly, fearful that   tactics might foster resentment. Each man is essentially being asked to shed part of his core political persona in the interest of party unity. For Mr. Sanders to step away from the roaring crowd, or for Mr. Trump to back away from a televised brawl, would represent a wrenching departure from form. Mindful of that, Democrats want to ease Mr. Sanders from the race without alienating his supporters. In a taped appearance for “The Tonight Show” that will air Thursday night, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Sanders, saying he brought “enormous energy” and “new ideas” to the campaign, making Mrs. Clinton better. “My hope is over the next couple weeks we’re able to pull things together,” the president said. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said, “We should be a little graceful and give him the opportunity to decide on his own. ” Republicans face a thornier challenge in grappling with Mr. Trump, whose inflammatory comments and slapdash campaign style have alarmed party leaders throughout the race. Since securing his spot as the presumptive Republican nominee, he has made only transient efforts to impose discipline on his campaign and turn toward courting mainstream general election voters. Mr. Trump appeared briefly chastened on Tuesday night, delivering a prepared victory speech free of vulgarity or racial attacks. But he quickly reverted to a more improvisational style, complaining in multiple interviews that Republicans had been wrong to criticize him for denouncing a federal judge because of  his Hispanic heritage. Still, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan assured colleagues in a conference on Wednesday that he remained supportive of Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Mr. Ryan had  criticized him this week for using “racist” language in criticizing Gonzalo P. Curiel, a United States District Court judge overseeing litigation involving Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan told lawmakers that he continued to believe Mr. Trump represented the party’s best chance to enact its agenda, said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Ryan. But Mr. Ryan, he said in an email, “also told them he’ll continue to speak out   necessary to protect our identity as a party. ” Steering carefully between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump is Mrs. Clinton, who praised Mr. Sanders and his supporters with her victory speech on Tuesday night, while delivering an aggressive denunciation of Mr. Trump that doubled as a sales pitch for the general election. Allies of Mrs. Clinton said on Wednesday that they were confident Mr. Sanders would come around in time, and that the broad message she had outlined for the fall campaign would suffice to win over doubters on the left. Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, a Democrat who campaigned for Mrs. Clinton in California, predicted that the urgency of fighting Mr. Trump would bring the party together and ease the hurt feelings from the nominating contest. “This is definitely a crisis moment,” Mr. Garcetti said. “People come together in crises, and Donald Trump is that crisis. ” Mr. Sanders has given no indication that he will end his campaign before the July convention in Philadelphia, though he collected far too few delegates to threaten Mrs. Clinton’s nomination in a floor fight. Facing a stinging defeat in the California primary on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders responded with defiance. He declined to acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton had won enough delegates to capture the nomination and vowed to keep campaigning in the District of Columbia, which votes next week. There have been a few early attempts at   diplomacy: Their campaign managers, Robby Mook and Jeff Weaver, spoke on Tuesday, and the Clinton campaign has been in direct contact with elected officials backing Mr. Sanders. Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the lone senator to back Mr. Sanders, said he was in close contact with Mrs. Clinton’s advisers and declared it time to close ranks for the general election. “I will absolutely support our Democratic nominee, and that nominee is Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Merkley said in a telephone interview, “and I’ll keep working with her and her team in support of the ideas that Bernie Sanders put forward. ” Liberal activists aligned with the Sanders campaign have begun to inch away from his tenacious bid. Several members of Congress and two prominent advocacy groups on the left, MoveOn. org and Democracy for America, said on Wednesday that they would line up behind Mrs. Clinton as the candidate who has won the most pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders offered no immediate response to the signs that his core liberal coalition might be faltering. Activists on the right have had even less success at applying pressure to Mr. Trump. Republicans have repeatedly pleaded and cajoled Mr. Trump to run a more professional campaign, reflecting greater attentiveness to rules of political and social decorum. Mr. Trump has essentially disregarded those demands and charted his own course as an insurgent candidate with a skeleton crew of campaign staff. A new test of Mr. Trump’s campaign begins on Thursday as the candidate and his top aides embark on their most concerted push yet to win over big Republican donors. On Thursday, 70 donors are to meet at Trump Tower in New York, followed by lunch at the Four Seasons hotel. Mr. Trump is expected to attend both the meeting and the lunch, and to proceed to a   event in Richmond, Va. on Friday. It is unclear which version of Mr. Trump is likely to show up. After delivering a conventionally   victory speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump returned to Twitter the next morning to attack the hosts of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for covering him unfavorably. Hours later, an aide to Mr. Trump called for barring a conservative radio host, Hugh Hewitt, from the Republican convention because of his criticism of Mr. Trump. And even as his   efforts have intensified, Mr. Trump has resisted making phone calls to donors to solicit funds. Edward F. Cox, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said the party was grappling with unprecedented circumstances, brought about by the elevation of an untrained outsider unlike any presidential nominee in memory. Mr. Trump, he said, faced unusual pressure to build up his political operation and coordinate a message with Mr. Ryan. Mr. Cox noted major opportunities coming up for Mr. Trump to reintroduce himself to voters and move on from his attacks on Mr. Curiel. “You’re going to be looking to the naming of a   candidate, you’re going to have an acceptance speech,” Mr. Cox said, “and this issue is going to be a very minor one. ”",0
18450,Shared Mission to Pardon U.S. Soldiers Who Killed Civilians - The New York Times,"KERNERSVILLE, N. C.  —   An unusual coalition of largely older and conservative former military men and younger,   law students are waging a joint campaign for one of the most unlikely causes: clemency for troops convicted of killing civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan. They want to push President Obama to reduce sentences and grant pardons for seven convicted war criminals, ranging from a private who followed an order to shoot unarmed detainees, to the more   case of Robert Bales, an Army staff sergeant sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder of 16 Afghan civilians in 2012. The campaign started with Herbert Donahue, a retired Marine Corps major, and his tiny organization called United American Patriots, tucked in a quiet office park here. Mr. Donahue says he was called to his work by his own war experience. In 44 months in Vietnam as a Marine rifleman, he was shot twice, bloodied by a mortar shell and had most of his teeth smashed out in a helicopter crash. But he declined three Purple Hearts because anyone formally recognized for being wounded that often was sent home from the war zone. “I know what combat is, I’ve seen the beast a thousand times,” Mr. Donahue, 72, said as he looked at the Silver Star, Bronze Star and other military honors on his office wall. “It can be real murky. Sometimes, you don’t have the luxury of making a moral decision. ” Recently, he gained an unexpected ally. A team of University of Chicago Law School students formed a group focused on helping convicted troops, called the Combat Clemency Project. “I don’t pretend to know anything about the military for me it is about mercy,” said Eamonn Hart, 29, a   law student who was raised by what he called “lefty, ‘60s activist parents” who took him to protests of the invasion of Iraq. The students are focusing on the mental health conditions of those convicted and other mitigating circumstances. For 10 years, Mr. Donahue had become accustomed to working largely alone. United American Patriots has paid for lawyers, family visits and other support, arguing that troops under intense pressure in combat zones are often unfairly judged and given harsh sentences because the public has sanitized and unrealistic expectations of war. Few military colleagues have backed Mr. Donahue and some have openly called him a traitor. The public response to donation requests had been so cool that at one point Mr. Donahue mortgaged his house to keep the operation going. But in 2015 the lawyer of one of the soldiers contacted the University of Chicago, and sparked the interest of students in the legal aid clinic, who then reached out to Mr. Donahue. “I didn’t think much of it when they first called me, because they are just a bunch of damn liberals,” he said. “But I have to commend the students, they have gone above and beyond. ” This spring, one of the students, Mr. Hart, submitted a clemency petition for Corey Clagett, a former Army private who pleaded guilty to shooting two unarmed detainees in Iraq in 2006  —   killings that an Army investigation found were ordered by Mr. Clagett’s staff sergeant. The staff sergeant, Raymond Girouard, was also convicted in the killings, but his case was dismissed on appeal. He was given back pay and discharged under honorable conditions after serving three and a half years in prison. Mr. Clagett was sentenced to 18 years. As part of the project, United American Patriots paid for Mr. Hart and other students to fly to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. to interview the prisoners. “Before that, I didn’t understand how confusing things were on the ground in Iraq, how arbitrary the brutality was,” Mr. Hart said. The students and United American Patriots approach the issue differently. United American Patriots says troops sometimes are held to unfair standards by senior officers who know little about combat. “In Vietnam I was supposed to radio in to ask permission every time I opened fire, but there wasn’t time,” Mr. Donahue said. “So after my second patrol, I never called back to request permission until I was sitting on a mountain of bodies. Today, you couldn’t do that. It’s gotten so a guy has to have a lawyer in the foxhole next to him. If I had it the way guys do today, I’d have been   a thousand times. ” The law school group, led by Mark Heyrman of the school’s legal aid clinic, is reluctant to embrace that argument and is looking instead toward issues like mental health. “We agree on the bottom line, that soldiers are being excessively punished,” Mr. Heyrman said. “The concern is that United American Patriots are trying to say we should go back to the way we did it in Vietnam. I don’t know if that is a winning public message. ” Mr. Heyrman, who worked with Mr. Obama when he was a law professor at the University of Chicago, said he doubted that argument would work with the president. For both groups mercy has its limits. They chose not to be advocates of troops convicted of premeditated crimes that combined rape and murder. But after some debate they decided to urge leniency for Mr. Bales despite his guilty plea to 16 killings in a small village. “Friends of mine pushed back saying, ‘How can you represent this guy when there are innocent people who could use your help?’ I have honestly questioned my own involvement,” said Michael Lockman, 31, a law student who wrote the clemency petition for Mr. Bales. “But when you really start to learn about some of these cases, there is a clear case for mercy. The man had clear mental health issues the Army knew about but chose to ignore. There is shared responsibility for his crime. ” The Army determined the sergeant had   stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury after his third combat deployment in 2010, then deployed him to Afghanistan where his symptoms worsened and he massacred villagers he suspected of harboring insurgents. Mr. Lockman is asking the president to reduce Mr. Bales’s sentence to 100 years, which would make him eligible for parole in 2023. Both Mr. Donahue and the students admit the push is a long shot. Few in the public appear to support revisiting cases in which troops killed unarmed civilians. A Whitehouse. gov petition the students created seeking 100, 000 signatures has so far garnered only about 2, 100. And Mr. Obama has given no indication he considers the sentences unjust. Even so, there is some precedent for reducing military sentences. After World War II, the War Department set up a clemency board that commuted sentences in 85 percent of thousands of serious cases it reviewed from the war. During Vietnam, a number of young men sentenced to life in prison for killings later had their sentences reduced to only a few years by similar boards. Even the most notorious massacre of Vietnam, in the village of My Lai, prompted calls for forgiveness from the American public for Lt. William Calley, the    who was sentenced to life in prison for ordering the killings (the only one of the 26 soldiers and officers charged who was convicted). Telegrams sent to the White House urging clemency outnumbered those opposing it by a ratio of 100 to 1, and supporters on both sides of the debate over the war staged  sympathy marches and other protests across the country. “It’s too bad that one man is being made to pay for the brutality of the whole war,” Benjamin Spock, the famous pediatrician turned war protester, said at the time. In response, President Richard M. Nixon moved the lieutenant from prison to house arrest pending a review of the case. The secretary of the Army reduced Lieutenant Calley’s sentence to 10 years, and he was paroled after three. In all, he spent only a few weeks behind bars. That there is not the same broad outcry for the release of troops convicted of murder today is in part a mark of progress, said Gary Solis, a former Marine Corps prosecutor who teaches the law of military conflict at George Washington University. “The public doesn’t see it as an issue because we don’t have the number of crimes we did in Vietnam, and the crimes aren’t as bad,” he said. “We have much better training and a much better force. ” Though the Pentagon does not keep count of cases that could be considered war crimes, he said, Iraq and Afghanistan produced only a few dozen cases that might qualify, while Vietnam led to hundreds. Even so, the vexing nature of a war in which the enemy is hard to identify can turn snap misjudgments of   troops into harsh sentences, the students said. Sgt. Derrick Miller, a National Guard soldier with exemplary performance reviews, has served four years of a life sentence for shooting an Afghan civilian he believed was an insurgent. During his third combat deployment, Sergeant Miller became suspicious of a civilian who entered his base saying he was there to do repairs. Fearing an attack, he interrogated the man. Sergeant Miller was convicted of putting a gun to the man’s head when he considered his story to be inconsistent, telling him to tell the truth, then shooting him. “He killed someone. I don’t want to minimize that what he did was wrong,” said Kayla Gamin, 29, a   law student who wrote a clemency petition asking that the soldier’s premeditated murder conviction be reduced to voluntary manslaughter, which would make him eligible for parole. “But given the confusion, maybe his actions were understandable. I think he was sincerely trying to protect his men. Should that kind of person spend his life in prison?” In March, Mr. Clagett, the former Army private, was released on parole after 10 years, in large part because United American Patriots paid for a private lawyer. The day he got out of prison, United American Patriots offered him a job. “I do mostly outreach, tell my story,” Mr. Clagett said on a recent afternoon as he moved into his new office. “I let people know these things aren’t always   and often it’s the   guy who gets blamed. ”",0
18451,FBI Director Comey Ignored DOJ’s Warning Against Releasing Info On Hillary Email (TWEETS),"Subscribe 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that his agency had discovered emails that could potentially be related to the flap over Hillary Clinton’s email server. In the 24 hours since then, most of the discussion hasn’t been over the emails, but over whether Comey acted appropriately when he made this disclosure. Well, a front page story in Sunday morning’s edition of The New York Times reveals that Comey’s bosses at the Justice Department believed this letter was manifestly improper . 
The reason? Comey’s letter risked running afoul of a longstanding DOJ policy that strongly discourages commenting on politically sensitive investigations within 60 days of an election. It is a policy that has been maintained by both Democratic and Republican administrations in order to avoid even the appearance of partisanship. We can all agree, however, that if there is any case for an exception, it would be if there was a potentially earth-shaking development in a politically-charged investigation. 
But based on what has emerged since Friday, Comey’s letter didn’t even begin to meet that standard. According to The Times, the FBI is in the process of getting court permission to review emails it seized from the laptop of longtime Hillary aide Huma Abedin while investigating her estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner, for sexting with a North Carolina teenager. Investigators don’t know as of yet whether those emails contain classified information, or whether it even potentially rose to the level of criminal misconduct. Additionally, there is virtually no chance that such a review will be complete before the election. 
That explains why Comey’s draft letter, which was prepared on Thursday, sent eyebrows into hairlines at the DOJ. According to CNN, department staffers told Comey that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates opposed sending the letter . They told Comey in no uncertain terms that under the circumstances, the letter ran counter to the longstanding policy about politically sensitive investigations. However, according to The Times, Comey believed that the emails would almost certainly be leaked–and the FBI would be accused of misleading Congress. 
However, a number of former DOJ officials think Comey made an egregious blunder. I already told you that Matthew Miller, the former chief spokesman for the DOJ under Lynch’s predecessor, Eric Holder, condemned the letter in the strongest terms on Friday. But Comey has been condemned by veterans of Republican administrations as well. One of them, George Terwilliger III, the deputy attorney general for the last two years of the George H. W. Bush administration, was particularly baffled by Comey’s move. Terwilliger said that while the guidelines on politically sensitive investigations can make for “hard decisions” at times, there was “a difference between flying independent and flying solo.” 
Kurt Eichenwald of Vanity Fair and Newsweek revealed on Twitter that a number of FBI agents are up in arms over this letter as well. Word from inside @FBI . FURIOUS at Comey, think he's mishandled public revelations from get go. ""Outrageous incompetence"" one agent told me. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey doesn't get ahead of this, going to have a mutiny at @FBI . ""This is why u say 'We dont talk about investigations'"" one told me…. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 …his original decision to lay out info on clinton case, then opine on what it meant outside of criminal findings, infuriated these folks.. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 Re: anger within @FBI at Comey. I am getting this at the Special Agent, ASAC and SAC level. Those are the troops. (Most of em GOPrs)…. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 …for Comey to have so angered ppl at the field office level is really, really bad. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 If Comey's improper comment on ongoing investigation changes polls, @FBI reputation as apolitical will never recover cause of his screwup. 
— Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) October 29, 2016 
Based on what we now know, this anger is easy to understand. Apparently Comey was so worried about the potential fallout that he felt compelled to brief Congress before his people even knew whether there was any there there, let alone before getting a court to allow them to find out what was in those emails. If that’s the case, then Comey’s judgment appears curious at best. You would think the FBI would be able to keep a lid on an investigation this explosive. 
Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, suggested that the Donald forced Comey’s hand . If Comey was so afraid of being the victim of a Twitter attack from Trump and his alt-right army that it felt the need to throw fundamental fairness and time-honored precedent out the window, as well as leave his own agents on an island, then there is something fundamentally wrong.

By Comment 
Manny Pacquiao caused quite a stir following his stirring win over Jesse Vargas earlier this month. It was, however, the presence of Floyd Mayweather Jr. at ringside that all the more ramped up rematch rumors. Is it actually possible? 
As most know, the ghost of the first Pacquiao vs. Mayweather encounter is still in the air and most believe it will remain the same. For the benefit of those who have forgotten, Mayweather will defend and run while Pacquiao will try to pin down the undefeated American boxer. Profit is the only reason for a rematch. 
Many are aware that the first encounter between Pacquiao and Mayweather was pretty lucrative. Unfortunately most feel that they didn’t get their money’s worth. A rematch will still be the same though the earnings may dip slightly. 
Also read: Manny Pacquiao Wanted To Show Floyd Mayweather He Deserves A Rematch 
Such is shared by Jim Lampley, a prominent blow-by-blow announced. He believes that it will be nothing more than to rip-off patrons once again and urged most to push for a Gennady Golovkin vs. Canelo Alvarez showdown instead. 
“There’s a decent chance Triple G-Canelo can take place in [2017]. So, it would be a shame, and another loss for boxing, if casual fans and the general public were distracted by a for-profit-only replay of a considerably less interesting fight,” Lampley said via Forbes.com . Rematch means more to Pacquiao than Mayweather’s record chase. 
Money aside, Pacquiao is looking to avenge his loss and prove that Mayweather is not that invincible. For Mayweather, it is the perfect chance to become the only undefeated boxer with 50 wins. 
Also read: Fantasy Boxing Match Happening Soon? 
Right now, Mayweather is content being a promoter even as Pacquiao has added more responsibility as a senator. Compared to Golovkin and Alvarez, that too may be another point worth taking, Boxing News 24 reported. 
It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out but unless Mayweather says so, a Pacquiao sequel will be nothing more than a rumor at least for now.

18454,Kelly Ripa’s Absence From ‘Live’ Points to Rancor at ABC - The New York Times,"It seemed like an innocent enough announcement: Michael Strahan, the former football player turned television personality, was shifting assignments on ABC’s morning lineup, the network said Tuesday. He would leave “Live With Kelly and Michael” in September to become a   on “Good Morning America. ” But there was rancor behind the scenes. Mr. Strahan’s   Kelly Ripa, was told of the move just minutes before the announcement, and felt blindsided, said a person who has spoken to her about ABC’s decision. And she made little attempt to conceal her displeasure, skipping Wednesday’s edition on “Live. ” ABC said she would not appear on the show for the rest of the week and would be replaced by Erin Andrews. Ms. Ripa’s absence Wednesday forced Mr. Strahan into the awkward position of addressing the news of his departure with a guest host, Ana Gasteyer, a former “Saturday Night Live” cast member. After Mr. Strahan and Ms. Gasteyer danced their way to the hosts’ desk on the “Live” set, Mr. Strahan said, “I’ve been in the news lately,” before formally announcing that he was leaving. For ABC, what was supposed to be a boost to its morning lineup is instead developing into a giant headache with one of its most prominent stars. Ms. Ripa, who joined the show in 2001, replacing Kathy Lee Gifford, has developed a loyal following of her own. In addition to Ms. Ripa’s apparent displeasure, “Good Morning America” is also presenting the network with cause for concern. Though it remains the   morning show, it’s down 10 percent in total viewers and 18 percent in the      demographic important to advertisers. It is second in that age bracket to NBC’s “Today,” a show that experienced its own ratings difficulties four years ago when it botched Ann Curry’s departure. When Mr. Strahan does join “Good Morning America” in a   role in September, he will be accustomed to the surroundings. He began as an   correspondent for “Good Morning America” two years ago, a decision that Ms. Ripa expressed concerns about at the time, according to the person. Ms. Ripa was worried it would distract him from “Live” but was reassured it would only be a temporary position. Mr. Strahan continued to appear on the morning show, and ABC executives recently decided that bringing him into the “Good Morning America” lineup could help stem the ratings drop. After “Live” ended on Tuesday morning, Ms. Ripa was called to a meeting along with the show’s longtime producer, Michael Gelman, and the WABC general manager, Dave Davis (the show is produced by WABC, and it is distributed by ABC and Disney’s syndication group). She did not know the purpose of the meeting. After a   wait, Mr. Strahan entered the room and broke the news that he was leaving. It wasn’t long before tensions flared. “Didn’t I tell you this was going to happen?” Ms. Ripa said to Mr. Davis at the meeting, according to the person. “I told you two years ago this was going to happen. ” A few minutes after the meeting ended, ABC publicly announced Mr. Strahan’s departure. Ms. Ripa later let the network know she would not appear on Wednesday. Ms. Ripa was angry, this person said, because she perceived that “Good Morning America” was being given priority over “Live. ” Ms. Ripa declined to comment. Ms. Ripa was similarly caught off guard in 2011 when Regis Philbin informed her 20 minutes before show time that he was going to announce his departure on that edition of “Live. ” After Mr. Philbin left the show, “Live” began an open casting call to replace him, cycling in more than a dozen potential   to sit beside Ms. Ripa. After 10 months, ABC selected Mr. Strahan, who is also a commentator on Fox’s N. F. L. pregame show. In a statement, an ABC spokeswoman said: “‘Live’ continues to be a vibrant and enduring franchise under our lead host, the extraordinarily talented Kelly Ripa. ‘Live’ has successfully transitioned   twice before and will do so again. Together with Kelly, ABC and the ‘Live’ team will begin a new search to find a replacement for Michael. ” It appears that Ms. Ripa’s absence will be an extended one: “Live” is not scheduled to shoot on Friday and she had already arranged to take Monday off for a long weekend to celebrate her 20thwedding anniversary, the person said. Friday’s show will be taped on Thursday, so Ms. Andrews will appear for the next two editions of “Live. ” Ms. Ripa will be replaced by the “Pretty Little Liars” actress Shay Mitchell on Monday, an ABC spokeswoman said.",0
18455,ALEPPO OFFENSIVE: Syrian troops close to liberating Eastern Aleppo (VIDEO),"November 25, 2016 - Fort Russ News -  RusVesna - translated by J. Arnoldski -  



The Syrian Army is breaking through the defenses of terrorist gangs in eastern Aleppo and new neighborhoods have been liberated.  
Following several days of fierce firefights with jihadist bandits, Syrian troops have occupied new neighborhoods in the Hananu district, which since 2012 has been a stronghold of armed gangs in eastern Aleppo. In addition, the Syrian Arab Army has taken control of the Jabal-Badro district.  



On Thursday, government troops liberated more than half of the Hananu district as a result of a rapid offensive in northeastern Aleppo. Active support was provided by the air force and artillery. 



Led by the elite Tiger Forces, the SAA took full control of the Hananu fire station, post office, an orphanage, the Farooq and Omar Ibn al-Khattab mosques, the industrial zone, marriage registration department, and also a number of residential buildings.  
The SAA forces assaulting the area are facing down terrorists from the Jebhat al Fath ash-Sham grouping, formerly known as Jebhat al-Nusra. 
Earlier, Syrian troops occupied the important Tell Zuhur hill, which gave them a decisive advantage. Control over the top of the hill east of the Hananu district has allowed government forces to observe enemy activity and direct shelling deep into the district.  
After dark on Thursday evening, fierce clashes continued in the area as the gangs attempted to strengthen their new line of defense.  
The SAA, Tiger Force, and Palestinian militia brigades from Al-Quds are continuing their offensive on militant positions. 
The seizure of the Hananu district will open the road to the neighboring districts of eastern Aleppo held by the Islamists for government and allied forces. 

According to reports from frontline sources, the Syrian army and Palestinian Al-Quds militia have successfully managed to clear a large part of the Jabal and Badro districts of terrorists and seize the Muslim cemetery district.

18457,Unprecedented Surge In Election Fraud Incidents From Around The Country,"Unprecedented Surge In Election Fraud Incidents From Around The Country   Zero Hedge 
Mounting evidence would suggest it's getting more and more difficult for the left to claim that there are ""no signs"" of fraud in the 2016 election cycle...though we're sure they will continue to try. Just this morning the Miami Herald noted that two arrests were made in Miami-Dade county on election fraud charges including efforts by one woman to illegally register voters (some of whom were dead...a recurring theme this election cycle) while another 74-year-old election worker was charged with actually "" illegally marking ballots"" . 
A 74-year-old woman tasked with opening envelopes sent by Miami-Dade County voters with their completed mail ballots was arrested Friday after co-workers caught her illegally marking ballots, resulting in an unknown — but small — number of fraudulent votes being cast for mayoral candidate Raquel Regalado. 

Investigators linked Gladys Coego, a temporary worker for the county elections department, to two fraudulent votes, but they suspect from witness testimony that she submitted several more. 

In a separate election-fraud case, authorities also arrested a second woman for unlawfully filling out voter-registration forms on behalf of United for Care, the campaign to legalize medical marijuana in Florida. 

The Miami-Dade state attorney’s office plans to accuse Tomika Curgil, 33, of filling out forms for five people without their consent. She also submitted at least 17 forms for people who apparently don’t exist — and several forms for people who are dead. 

Police officers arrested Curgil at her Liberty City home Friday morning and intend to charge her with five felony counts of submitting false voter-registration information. 
Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle was quick to praise the ""swift arrest of the wrongdoers"" and ensure voters of the "" integrity of the electoral process."" That said, we, like many others, wonder just how many similar cases of election fraud will go unnoticed between now and election day. 
“Our law enforcement effort against these election law violators was swift and resulted in an immediate arrest of the wrongdoers,” Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernández Rundle, a Democrat, said in a statement. “The elections department was quick to detect and report these violations to our task force. 

“Anyone who attempts to undermine the democratic process should recognize that there is an enforcement partnership between the elections department and our prosecution task force in place to thwart such efforts and arrest those involved. Now we need to move forward with the election.” 

“I want to ensure the voters of Miami-Dade County that the integrity of the electoral process is intact because our procedures work,” White said in a statement. “While disappointed by these incidents, I am very proud of the safeguards the Elections Department has in place to prevent these fraudulent attempts, and I commend the employees who remained vigilant just as they were trained to do.” 
Meanwhile, Florida isn't the only state with fraud problems as an NBC affiliate in Virginia is reporting that a former resident of Alexandia was also arrested after being caught creating fictitious voter registrations and faces up to 40 years in prison. Of course, Virginia, run by long-time Clinton confidant Terry McAuliffe, is no stranger to election fraud as one democratic organization was already caught earlier this month re-registering dead voters . 
A former resident of Alexandria, Virginia, is facing up to 40 years in prison after he allegedly used fake names to fill out voter registration applications. 

Vafalay Massaquoi, 30, is facing four felony charges related to allegations of voter registration fraud , the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office said. Each charge carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. 

In the spring of 2016, Massaquoi was registering new voters as an employee of a local advocacy group. According to the Commonwealth's Attorney, Massaquoi fabricated applications and used fake names to fill out the registration forms. 

The fake applications were filed with the Alexandria Office of the General Registrar, who reported the issue to Commonwealth's Attorney Bryan Porter. 
All of these reports simply add fuel to the fire of Trump who has been relentlessly attacking the ""rigged"" elections for the past several weeks. The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2016 

Of course, these are just a few of the people who have actually been caught for their election ""rigging"" efforts. Meanwhile, there have seemingly been an unlimited number of other fraud cases pop up around the country involving everything from illegal voter registrations to dead people voting. In fact, a recent report from CBS Chicago found that over 100 dead Chicagoans had voted 229 times over the past decade. 
Susie Sallee was buried in 1998. Yet records show she voted in Chicago 12 years later. 

Victor Crosswell died in 1994, but records show he’s voted six times since then. 

And then there’s Floyd Stevens. Records show he’s voted 11 times since his death in 1993. 

“It’s crazy,” Sharon Stevens Anderson, Stevens’ daughter, tells CBS 2’s Pam Zekman. “I don’t see how people can be able to do something like that and get away with it.” 

Those are just a few of the cases CBS 2 Investigators found by merging Chicago Board of Election voter histories with the death master file from the Social Security Administration. 

In all, the analysis showed 119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade. 

Moreover, an ABC affiliate in Philadelphia uncovered similar instances of dead voters in the ""City of Brotherly Love."" 
So, Action News dug through a decade's worth of election and death records to see if there was any truth to the claim. 

Some of what Action News investigation found was stunning. 

Pezzano passed in 2006 . But state voting records show the South Philadelphia native still listed as an ""Active Voter"" who cast ballots in 2008, 2012, 2014, and the 2016 primary election. 

Our investigation also found Joseph B. Haggarty resting peacefully in a Bucks County cemetery. His grave marker confirmed he died in 2010, but records show he voted five years after his death. 

Action News also found Paul Bunch, who died in 2006, also cast a vote in this year's primary which was nearly ten years after death records show he died. 

But, while all of this may seem shocking, in due time, we're confident these arrests and all other instances dead people voting, etc. will be seen for what they really are, namely another blatant attempt to suppress low-income and minority votes. Share This Article...",0

His team of babysitters woke up to chaos at the crack of Trump which turned into more cat fights amongst themselves. Donald Trump managed to grab one of them before his phone was confiscated. 
One babysitter said Trump is totally out of control, he doesn't listen, and he says and does whatever he wants like a spoiled little brat! Another babysitter said if they keep paying him enough, he believes he can control him by buying him more sniffle treats, cover up his lies with bigger blankets and cause lots of tremendous distractions. Another babysitter complained that he's only hanging around because the campaign still owes him money for buying likes, retweets and followers for Donald Trump because everyone who knows him hates him unless they're getting paid and says Trump doesn't deserve to have twitter because he can't even read or write! 
Melania came to her husbands defense by saying Donald has a wonderful ability to keep going and she was proud of him for still being awake at 3:00 AM, dressed as a Marionette sitting on Putin's lap, sniffling, laughing, and playing truth or dare on twitter. 
Paul Ryan said he wants nothing to do with the chaos. He said he was there to look for his house keys, it's not his party, he only watched, and he didn't play! 
Giuliani was found passed out with Donald Trump's shoe in his mouth mumbling drool, and Comey was found tied up on a chair in a corner rambling in and out of consciousness about giving Trump Paul Ryan's house keys and it's not his fault Trump burned his house down.

18459,Mark Zuckerberg Just Betrayed Hillary; Is This The True Reason Why (VIDEO),"By: Voice of Reason | Facebook has done some pretty bad stuff this last year. They spent a lot of money and personal resources to help Hillary Clinton out during the election, but not any more says CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg! After the liberal media tried to make him turn on one of his oldest friends, Peter Thiel, for donating to Donald Trump , Zuckerberg finally decided to fight back. Since Zuckerberg is still technically supporting Hillary for President, in the following video I suggest what his real motive may have been for lashing out with pro-Trump rhetoric, and why the person he’s defending doesn’t win Zuckerberg any humanitarian awards either… He wrote a scathing post, telling people that Facebook will stand for more than just the ideas of a few tech elite, but instead for the ideas of the people. Zuckerberg even acknowledged there are GOOD reasons that people support Trump : They believe strongly in smaller government They want a different tax policy They want a better health care system They want to maintain religious freedom They worry about American gun rights Or ANY other issue where he disagrees with Hillary He ended the post by saying: “That’s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.” So, despite the fact that he still supports Hillary Clinton , I want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for having the common decency to acknowledge the Trump Train even though all his tech billionaire friends will attack him for it. Now let’s get this shared out everywhere so we can show the world that Hillary’s “network” is finally turning it’s back on her. In related news, could what happened just hours after the final debate be the REAL reason Zuckerberg came out of the closet as a pro-Trump keyboard warrior? Several hours after what was arguably Trump ’s best performance of the campaign so far, one of the world’s top political experts gave Trump the best news he could hope to hear… Danny Gold continues: If you love Trump , today just became a HECK of a lot better! A very well respected political professor from Syracuse has just given Donald Trump the best news of the entire election. Professor Helmut Norpoth stepped forward today, despite HUGE opposition from his peers, to announce that his scientific formula has predicted the TRUE results of the election. And the result is… There is an 87%-99% chance that Donald Trump will WIN the election! Heck yeah! See, at least there are still some people who have not been bought off by Hillary Clinton. According to Northrop, all the other predictions are based entirely on opinion polls, which are inherently wrong. Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidates’ performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. His model has correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996. (H/T- The Gateway Pundit ) So if you wanted something to celebrate, I mean other than Donald Trump ’s epic win over Hillary Clinton at the final Presidential debate, then Helmut Norpoth has just given you exactly that. Now let’s help share this GREAT news to everyone else in the entire world. Let every Trump supporting Facebook friend you have know! First of all, Zuckerberg may be a flaming liberal, but he’s no fool. It’s no secret that Zuckerberg has enjoyed a cushy relationship with Obama and the White House over the past eight years, but a Trump presidency could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s current role as the self-proclaimed arbiter of “free speech.” As Facebook’s CEO, Zuckerberg has almost absolute control over what is, and what is not “acceptable” to believe in, or talk about on the Internet. Then, there’s the whole issue of who Zuckerberg was defending when he had his micro-aggression and temporarily boarded the “ Trump Train.” It’s not like he was defending Mother Teresa’s good name or something. Peter Thiel, the guy who is Zuck’s BFF that people were ragging on for donating to Trump , just happens to the chief henchman of the Bilderberg Group, and chairman of its steering committee. It’s worth noting too, that Peter Thiel is HARDLY Zuckerberg’s closest connection to the Bilderberg group. I won’t discuss it here, but he’s got another connection that hits MUCH closer to home, so before everyone gets all excited thinking that perhaps Zuckerberg isn’t such a bad guy after all, it’s more likely he’s just hedging his bets, and Hillary was probably fully aware of what he said ahead of time.

18460,Mail’s giant map of Britain to include names and addresses of all traitors,"Mail’s giant map of Britain to include names and addresses of all traitors 04-11-16 
THE Daily Mail is giving every reader a free ‘giant map of Britain’ to help them hunt down local traitors. 
The paper said the map is particularly huge to allow the millions of names and addresses to be included without the letters being too small to read. 
A Daily Mail spokesman said: “It’s about 16 foot wide and 28 foot long. You can pin it to a large outside wall, though if you live north of Swindon you’ll need a ladder to examine it. Or just lay it on the floor, the lawn or a nearby public park. 
“At that point – assuming you know where your home town is actually located – it’s really easy to find all the traitors within your midst who want to hand this country over to Guyana. 
“We’re also giving each reader a giant pen so they can score off each traitor’s name as they are being bundled into the back of a van by some soldiers.” 
The spokesman added: “It’s a lovely, traditional way of hunting down communists and homosexuals using a proper British map.”

18461,Nevada Judge SLAMS Trump Campaign’s Lawyer For Filing BS Lawsuit Against Poll Workers (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Donald Trump, already laying the ground work for a “rigged election” challenge after he loses, filed a frivolous lawsuit in Nevada that sought to erase the votes of many residents of Clark County because they dared wait line past the time polls closed (as was their legal right) and got their vote in during early voting. 
The lawsuit, on its face, was insane. Trump was arguing that people who waited in the long lines to vote should have been sent home once the polls officially closed. This is contrary to the law, which says that as long as a person is in line at the time of closing, they are legally entitled to cast their ballot. This is done specifically to ensure crooked politicians couldn’t disenfranchise voters by intentionally making lines so long that the poll workers can’t possibly get to all of the people. 
As reporter Jon Ralston noted in disbelief as the court case unfolded: This lawsuit has even less merit than I thought. And that is saying something.

18464,"As China Liquidates US Treasuries, It is “Gobbling” Up Japanese Government Bonds","As we reported one week ago, the latest Treasury International Capital report revealed something disturbing : not only had foreign central banks sold a record amount of US Treasurys in the past 12 months, some $346 billion worth…

… but America’s largest foreign creditor, China, sold a record $34 billion in US paper in the latest month, and bringing its total holdings to the lowest since 2012.

This led to an obvious question: is China dumping all of its foreign reserve holdings proportionately, or is Beijing strategically offloading its US paper, for financial, political reasons or otherwise, as it buys other foreign government bonds. The answer, at least according to the Nikkei, is the latter.
As the Japanese owner of the Financial Times reports , China is on a shopping spree, and has been “gobbling” up Japanese government bonds, adding that Beijing bought close to a net 9 trillion yen ($86.6 billion) worth of JGBs in the January-August period, more than tripling the amount from the same period last year. Incidentally that’s almost equivalent to the number of US Treasurys sold by China.
A simple explanation for the shift is that the People’s Bank of China has been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasurys in anticipation of higher U.S. interest rates and shifting some of its money to JGBs, where higher rates – courtesy of 250% in debt/GDP – are largely guaranteed to never arrive.
But more importantly, and this could explain the perplexing recent strength in the Yuan, this trend may be a reason behind the yen’s appreciation in foreign exchange markets in recent months .
According to Japan’s Ministry of Finance, China invested 8.9 trillion yen in Japanese securities in net terms between January and August. Buying started to exceed selling more often on a monthly basis in the second half of 2015. In April, net buying surpassed 3 trillion yen. Curiously, China is not buying the Japanese bonds for the “yield”, but rather for liquidity: most of the securities purchased by the PBOC are bonds with maturities of one year or less.
Judging by the latest TIC data, China’s selling of US paper is accelerating, which also suggests that just as China has been a factor pushing the Yuan higher, the dollar has been pressured lower by the ongoing Chinese liquidation. One wonders how much higher the USD will jump if and when China decides to halt its selling of US paper, and how much lower the Yuan will then tumble in response, leading to even faster capital outflows from China.

18465,"Democrats Contaminate Cliven Bundy Jury Pool with 700,000 Mailers Falsely Connecting Him to Las Vegas Cop Killers","  Tim Brown 
Well, leave it to the Democrats in Nevada to do something like this. Not only are they engaged in illegal acts concerning voter registration , but now they have ruined the good name of Cliven Bundy by sending out 700,000 mailers to households throughout Nevada and contaminating the jury pool, which has led the defense to call on the court to “change the venue” so that Bundy might receive a fair trial. 
The flyer reads, “This man’s armed standoff led to the deaths of two Las Vegas Police Officers and he’s supported by Congressman Hardy.” It also contains Cliven Bundy’s name and mug shot in front of a row of prison cells. This was also paid for by the Nevada State Democratic Party. 
Attorney for journalist Pete Santilli , Chris Rasmussen, joined with Nevada’s public defenders in a motion to compel the court for a “change of venue.” Rasmussen received one of the flyers and entered it into evidence with the court claiming that Bundy would not receive a fair trial due to the obvious propaganda sent out by the State of Nevada. 
This story about tying the Bundy’s or anyone at Bundy Ranch to Jared and Amanda Miller, the Las Vegas shooters , is bogus. By his own account, Miller was sent home from Bundy Ranch . Here’s Miller’s comment to a YouTube video claiming that very thing. 
In fact, the media jumped all over the false narrative that Miller and his wife were tied to the Bundy’s, labeling them right wing extremist terrorists , and attempting to use the propaganda for advancing attacks on the Second Amendment . The media never mentioned the fact that the Millers were involved in the Occupy Movement and it never informed the public that they were Vegas police informants . 
What’s worse is that this attempt to smear patriots for standing against the illegal and unconstitutional acts of the DC government and their willing accomplices in the Bureau of Land Management , FBI, and corrupt politicians, both in DC and local, is the fact that this was already dealt with once as Constitutional Sheriff Richard Mack was wrongly connected to the Millers. 
Deb Jordan adds , “Las Vegas Metro Police and the Clark County Sheriff’s Department cannot produce any report of violence or destruction of property during the Bundy Civil Rights Protest, except in those instances where the Bureau of Land Management were the perpetrators.” 
“Sheriff Douglas Gillespie, the then Sheriff of Clarke County said at the time, there was no direct link to the couple’s killing spree and Cliven Bundy – noting that the two had arrived in Las Vegas in January of 2014 and that they had their own agenda for starting a revolution,” she added. “Gillespie made clear he had seen NO evidence that the Miller’s had come to Nevada seeking out Cliven Bundy.” 
Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore also took time to call out this injustice . 
“This mailer is completely unacceptable she said, and somebody needs to be held accountable for putting this false narrative in Nevada mailboxes,” she said. “Clearly the Bundy’s Civil Rights were being violated by a United States Government – Terrorist Organization – known as the BLM, and we all saw it happening with our own eyes. I was not the only elected official at that protest and what I want to know is, where the hell are they now?” 
Fiore also said : 
The level of propaganda being allowed by the Democratic Party must come to an end. We have men whose lives are on the line here in Nevada, and poisoning the jury pool with a downright lie must be dealt with. Not only do we have a case here that is already out of balance because it is being overseen by Judge Gloria Navarro, a left winger who was recommended by Harry Reid and appointed by Barack Obama, and Steven Myhre a Liberal Prosecutor who could obviously care less about fairness and truth, now we add to that more unfairness by allowing a left-wing propaganda machine to send out the message, that Cliven Bundy is directly responsible for the death of two of our Metro Police officers. 
This case should be awarded a change in venue in the fairness of law, and my peers should stop being cowards and get back to representing the truth about this case. 
Cliven Bundy held a peaceful protest on his own property and even though the Federal Government was not invited, they came anyway. 
They literally beat up on his family, set trained snipers on hillsides overlooking his ranch, came at them with stun guns and dogs, tried to restrict them to a first amendment area, killed and buried their cattle on public lands – in mass graves, threatened everyone who came to a lawful protest with lethal force, had armed helicopters and drones flying all over the place, and now they honestly want the American people to believe the Bundy’s were the bad guys — come on … 
The Government has stacked the odds against these men, and I am telling you right now; 
I will not stand by and watch them be railroaded by a bunch of left-wing extremist and sent to prison for crimes they did not commit. 
This case should not only be moved out of the State of Nevada, it should be dismissed altogether. 
I have no regrets for doing the right thing here when it comes to the Bundy’s — As hard as it is, I would rather lose every single race for office, before I would lose one nights sleep knowing I had betrayed them .” 
Fiore is correct. The men in Nevada were more peaceful than the agents who surrounded them. So, what are you going to do America? Will you sit quietly by at your keyboard and rage at the machine, or will you take action?

18466,Trump: Terrorism ’One of the Gravest Threats to Religious Freedom’ - Breitbart,"During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Trump stated that “one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror. ”[Transcript as Follows:  “My fellow Americans, This is a season of great hope. This week, Jewish families across our country, and around the world, celebrate Passover and retell the story of God’s deliverance of the Jewish people. The story of the Exodus is a story of freedom. It is the story of an incredible people who were liberated from oppression and raised up the face of humankind. Down through the centuries, the Jewish People have lived through one persecution after another —  and yet, they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure. And now, the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance. Another day of faith and celebration is also upon us. This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation. It is a holy day of reverence and worship it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people. America is a Nation of believers. As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home. We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future. From the beginning, America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship. That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continent —  and it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago. Sadly, many around the globe do not enjoy this freedom —  and one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror. On Palm Sunday, as Christians around the world celebrate the beginning of Holy Week, ISIS murdered at least 45 people and injured over 100 others at two Christian churches in Egypt. We condemn this barbaric attack. We mourn for those who lost loved ones. And we pray for the strength and wisdom to achieve a better tomorrow —  one where good people of all faiths, Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu, can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience. With God’s grace, life always triumphs over death, freedom overcomes oppression, and faith extinguishes fear. This is the source of our hope —  and our confidence in the future. I also want to give a special message to those struggling Americans who have felt for too long the bitter taste of hardship. I want you to know: this White House is fighting for you. We are fighting for every American who has been left behind. We are fighting for the right of all citizens to enjoy safety and peace —  and to work and live with the dignity that all Children of God are entitled to know. As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, we will succeed. Thank you. Have a Happy Easter, and a Happy Passover. God bless you. And God bless America. ” Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
18467,Google Confirms Chrome Browser to Feature Ad-Blocker by 2018 - Breitbart,"Google has confirmed that the company’s popular Chrome web browser will feature a native   by 2018. [VentureBeat reports that following rumors for the past six weeks relating to the implementation of a native   within Google Chrome, the company has finally stepped forward to set the record straight. Google has joined the Coalition for Better Ads, a group that sets specific standards in order to improve ads for consumers. Chrome will reportedly begin to block all ads that do not meet the Coalition’s guidelines, “starting in early 2018. ”  In practical terms, Google will use the Chrome browser to cut off advertising revenue to sites that don’t meet their standards. The browser will be taking a hardline stance towards websites  —   if one of their ads doesn’t meet guidelines then all ads will be blocked, resulting in a total loss of revenue. It seems that Google’s hope with this integrated   is to make third party extensions redundant. Many   ad blockers block all  outright, while Google’s new blocker will only filter poorly optimized ads that they claim hurt publishers “and threatens the sustainability of the web ecosystem. ” Despite the fact that Google actually makes the majority of their revenue from  the company says that they see this type of selective ad blocker as the future of internet browsing and natural evolution of ad blockers. As well as the development of their own ad blocking software, Google has also launched the Ads Experience Reports which enables users to provide Google with screenshots and videos of annoying experiences in order to help websites find and fix their faulty . Once website owners have removed the offending ads, they are eligible to   their website for review which should prevent them being blacklisted by Google in teh future. Google has suggested that website publisher review the new best practices guide to ensure that their website runs smoothly.

18469,Vladimir Putin: The United States continues to sleep with al-Nusra,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 27, 2016 Putin: “Some people, from the outside, think that if they can ‘comb’ the region to how they see fit – some of them call this ‘democracy’ – then the region will come into calmness and order. That’s not how it is."" “Will NWO agents ever learn logic?” …by Jonas E. Alexis 
The United States and New World Order agents have obviously enough reasons to hate Vladimir Putin because he doesn’t back down when it comes to fighting terrorism and the New World Order in Syria. Putin delivers. And obviously NWO agents would love to see his head on a silver platter. Putin declares: 
“ You know what [the Americans] can’t answer us? The key armed opposition group…al-Nusra…Yes, this organization is one of the key ones in the armed opposition [against Assad]. The U.S. State Department has confirmed it is a terrorist organization linked to al-Qaeda. Al-Nusra does not hide that fact. And – what are [the Americans suggesting]? For al-Nusra to be in the future parliament? 
“Or, here’s another example. They support certain organizations that are fighting against Assad in Syria, yet those same countries [who support them in Syria] fight against these organizations in Mali. Often, not only are they the same organizations – they are the same individuals. They simply leave Syria and go to fight in Mali – where western states do not support them. Then the same people go back to Syria and there they are supported.” 
Read those statements again and ask yourself these questions: When was the last time that a leader in Europe and in America ever pointed them out? Has even John Kerry ever taken time to responsibly address this internal contradiction? Has any NWO agent ever even bothered to give their listeners a rational response? 
Well, not a single NWO agent has ever attempted to formulate a serious answer. Not one. In fact, what we have been hearing over and over is that Russia is the bad guy; Putin is a potentate seeking to expand Russia’s influence in the entire world; Russia is not attacking ISIS or terrorist groups but civilians in Syria, and on and on it goes. 
Putin asks: “Where is the logic? How will it all end? These are not just empty words.” 
Well, Mr. Putin, there is no logic at all. The New World Order does not have to have logic and formulate serious arguments. They have to resort to name calling, colossal hoaxes, complete and deliberate fabrications, and deceptive means. These issues have been certainly frustrating to Russian officials, including Russia’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Maria Zakharova. YouTube - Veterans Today - 
Christopher A. Preble wrote in The New Republic that Assad posed no threat whatsoever to the security of the United States, that it was foolish for the US to get involved in this war, and that 81 percent of the American people did not approve sending troops to Syria. [1] 
Russia in particular wanted to talk to the Syrian rebels in order to settle a peace treaty, but their response was that the toppling of Assad was a precondition for peace talk. [2] Who, then, are the real terrorists? 
No New World Order agent will answer this question in any rational fashion because the system itself is incoherent and worthless. Putin again nails it when he says: “Some people, from the outside, think that if they can ‘comb’ the region to how they see fit – some of them call this ‘democracy’ – then the region will come into calmness and order. That’s not how it is. Without taking into account the history, the traditions, religious particularities, you must not do anything in the Middle East, especially as an outsider.” 
Obviously New World Order agents, most specifically the Neocons, are still upset with Putin. They still blame him for virtually anything bad that happens in Syria. Flaming Neocon Max Boot has recently written: 
“Russia aircraft dropped incendiaries, cluster munitions, and even giant ‘bunker buster’ bombs on homes and hospitals, killing and maiming at random.” [3] 
Boot talks about “a durable peace” in Syria, but for that to happen, he advocates a serious confrontation with Assad, which would inexorably lead to another confrontation with Russia. 
In a similar vein, Matthew Kroenig of the Weekly Standard cannot sleep well at night because he thinks that “Putin’s nuclear trash talk needs a serious response.” [4] 
If Putin is the real threat here, then Kroenig has a lot of rethinking to do precisely because the state of Israel doesn’t just declare that they have nuclear warheads. They literally declare that they can obliterate cities in Europe practically overnight. Remember Martin van Creveld’s bold statement? Here it is again: “We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force…. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.” [5] 
Keep in mind that Creveld is an Israeli military historian. He has written books for Cambridge University Press and other academic institutions. Yet Zionist outlets were completely silent about his statement. In fact, they never seriously challenged him or even the state of Israel on that very issue. 
Those outlets are much more interested in Vladimir Putin and Assad than addressing the serious issues. That is one reason why organs like the Economist , Newsweek , and the New Statesman never missed an opportunity to attack Putin. 
Yet despite all their lies and fabrications, Russia continues to thrive. Perhaps NWO agents need to learn very quickly that truth will triumph in the end.

18470,"“They Got In There And Totally Took It Over” – The Tea Party, Black Lives Matter and the 99% Protesters Have All Been Absorbed By The Establishment","Email 
If there’s one thing that the rise of Donald Trump and Britain’s Brexit has proven, it’s that the people have had it with the establishment. No matter what side of the aisle you’re on, you are likely sick and tired of the outright corruption prevalent in every aspect of the system. 
Over the last decade we have seen several movements try to take the initiative to create real, lasting change by upending the business-as-usual behavior of entrenched politicians, corporate lobbyists and mainstream media. All have thus far failed and were eventually absorbed by the power structure. 
The Tea Party was co-opted by the establishment right. The 99% Protesters were co-opted by the establishment left. And according to recent Wikileaks releases, the Black Lives Matter movement has been sucked up by the Clinton camp and Soros-funded globalists. 
Joe Joseph of The Daily Sheeple explains how politicians, including Hillary Clinton, have used these grass roots movements for their own nefarious purposes and to push forth their own agendas: 
If you remember back in 2006-2007 there was something called the Ron Paul Revolution that took off… at one point in time there was a million man march that took place and there was close to a million people that marched on Washington… it was a tremendous grass roots effort and uprising that took place… and after that you had the Tea Party take off… and then it got co-opted. The-Powers-That-Shouldn’t-Be put their operatives in there.. they got in there and totally took it over… and now the Tea Party today is nothing but your mainstream Republican operation that advances the Republican Party platform… certainly not what Ron Paul was doing… certainly doesn’t have the Constitution in mind…

18471,U.S. Envoy To UN Haley Witness To Spat Between IDF and UN Officials,"TEL AVIV  —   U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was witness to a heated dispute between UN and IDF officials while she toured Israel’s northern border, Channel 2 reported Sunday. [Haley was briefed by UNIFIL commander Maj. Gen. Michael Berry who told her the situation on the border with Hezbollah was relatively calm and did not require immediate intervention. Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, Deputy IDF Chief of Staff and the former head of the Northern Command, reportedly interrupted Berry, telling Haley the situation was the exact opposite. He added that UNIFIL was failing at its job and was too afraid of penetrating the villages and cities of southern Lebanon for fear of encountering the Hezbollah terror group.  The argument happened after Haley asked Berry, according to the report, whether “a change was necessary to better handle the situation on the border facing the strengthening of Hezbollah. ” Berry was quoted answering that “the region is calm, the situation is good and there is no need for a change. ” Kochavi stepped in and reportedly said, “I’m sorry my friend, we think entirely differently, UNIFIL don’t enter villages and cities [and are therefore not as aware of the situation as the IDF is]. ” Kochavi had called on Haley to help bring about a change in the mandate of the UN interim force, allowing it to disarm Hezbollah. According to the report, an Israeli diplomat later apologized to Haley for the argument, but she said she was not disturbed by it. In fact, she added, seeing the reality of the Israeli side was a good thing that would influence her work at the UN. Last week, Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Haley had discussed ways to make the   UNIFIL mandate more effective in enforcing Security Council Resolution 1701 passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. According to the terms of that resolution, the territory from the   border to the Litani River is to be an “area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon. ” According to Israeli estimates, Hezbollah now has about 150, 000 missiles.",0
18472,Los Angeles Police Official Resigns Over Racist Emails - The New York Times,"A   official in the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department resigned on Sunday after it was revealed that he had shared a series of racist and sexist jokes from his work email account in a previous job with the Burbank Police Department. Sheriff Jim McDonnell of Los Angeles County said in a statement that the official, Tom Angel, his chief of staff, had resigned on Sunday. His resignation came days after The Los Angeles Times first reported on the emails, which the newspaper said were obtained under the state’s open records act. “This incident is one that I find deeply troubling,” Chief McDonnell said. “Despite the Sheriff’s Department’s many recent efforts to fortify public trust and enhance internal and external accountability and transparency, this incident reminds us that we and other law enforcement agencies still have work to do. ” Last Wednesday, The Times published 15 pages of email correspondence that contained jokes about Muslims, Catholics, Latinos,   and women. In one email, Mr. Angel asked a colleague, “How many virgins do Muslims get in heaven?” In another, he forwarded a joke about a student who had done poorly on a biology exam. “I was asked to name two things commonly found in cells. Apparently ‘blacks’ and ‘Mexicans’ were not the correct answers. ” The emails sent by Mr. Angel also criticized “political correctness” and supported the racial profiling of Muslims. They were sent between 2012 and 2013, when he was the No. 2 police official in Burbank, Calif. Chief McDonnell said on Sunday that the department would review its training curriculum and hold meetings with community groups to brainstorm ways to improve its “understanding” and “appreciation” of the racial, ethnic and religious diversity of the area it serves. He also said the department would begin conducting random checks of its employees’ email accounts. “We are only as effective as the relationships, credibility and trust we have with our community,” he said.",0

Woodhouse, the president of Americans United for Change, called the video “an outrage.” He described Project Veritas as “another lie-filled, selectively edited video from a discredited right-wing fringe activist that actually describes perfectly legal activity.” 
Project Veritas President James O’Keefe discovered the truth after he set up an account in Belize. The account was in order to transfer money without having it traced back to the group.   
However, Woodhouse returned the payment to O’Keefe, claiming to have been concerned that it would represent a foreign contribution. However, the money was returned three days after Project Veritas’ first video in the series was made public.

Hillary Clinton is known for taking money from donors in order to get what she wants, but it was obviously clear to someone that this was going to come back to bite them.  ",0
18476,Scarborough Loses Cool With Mika - ’You Don’t Have to Be So Snotty’ - Breitbart,"Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” host Joe Scarborough blew up at his   Mika Brzezinski after he compared accusations of nepotism in the Trump White House regarding President Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump to that of the Kennedy White House when   John F. Kennedy appointed his brother Robert Kennedy attorney general.  When Brzezinski asked if he was making such a comparison, Scarborough responded by objecting to Brzezinski’s question and said he wasn’t saying Robert Kennedy was Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Partial transcript as follows: SCARBOROUGH: As it was when my hero  —   my political hero was appointed attorney general for his brother, and Republicans didn’t like that back then. I think if you looked at Bobby Kenendy’s record, some good things came out of that. And no  —   BRZEZINSKI: So you’re comparing Ivanka Trump to Bobby Kennedy? SCARBOROUGH: You don’t have to be so snotty. I was about to say, you didn’t let me get it out. BRZEZINSKI: I was curious  —   SCARBOROUGH: You don’t have to be so rude. The fact of the matter is that they are not Bobby Kennedy as I was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in. No, I am not saying Jared and Ivanka are Bobby Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy did a lot of things before he became attorney general of the United States of America. But, I am saying just like when John Kennedy had a question, he called the one person he could trust in the world, Bobby Kennedy to come into the Oval Office and they sat there and talked. When Donald Trump needs to talk to somebody, he talks to these two people. You may like it. You may not like it. But as Willie said, that’s the reality.

18480,Noam Chomsky: Why It’s a Big Danger to Dismiss the Anger of Trump Voters,"by Lambert Strether 
Lambert here: Howard Dean, back in 2003 and before he lost his mind, said : “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks. We can’t beat George Bush unless we appeal to a broad cross-section of Democrats.” Of course, such a gross violation of liberal class and cultural markers could not be permitted, and Dean was forced to grovel and apologize by the dominant identitarian wing of the Democrat Party and then, when his fifty-state strategy won Democrats control of Congress in 2006, instantly defenestrated by Rahm Emanuel, among others, and his organization gutted by Tim Kaine . When Chomsky asks “Why are we failing to organize these people?” he’s asking a question to which Dean already gave the answer. 
Clinton, of course, thinks that organizing “these people” is a bad idea, which is why she called them “deplorable” and “irredeemable” (and if you’re a Christian, as Clinton purports to be, “irredeemable” means irredeemable). So do many of her supporters, who seem to labor under the twin delusions that (a) “these people” will go away on the morning of November 9, and that (b) calling them, in various ways, stupid is, as a strategy, full of #win. If Clinton wishes to fail during a legitimacy crisis, she and her supporters should go on exactly as they have begun. Personally, I’m not a “worse is better” guy (too much suffering), but I confess I see little prospect of the dominant faction in the Democrat Party changing its ways, Dean, Chomsky, or no. 
By Alexandra Rosenmann, AlterNet associate editor. Originally published in Alternet . 
In the past 15 months, Noam Chomsky has weighed in on the U.S. presidential race often. 
“There are differences in the parties,” he said in February, when asked if he’d even consider a Republican over Hillary Clinton. “Small differences [coupled with] great power can have enormous consequences.” 
Chomsky initally favored Sanders over Clinton, but insisted Democrats must win at all costs. Because according to Chomsky , if Trump wins “the human species is in very deep trouble. 
But as for Trump’s supporters, Chomsky’s not counting them out just yet. 
“I’m basically judging by what I see and read about them listening to talk radio and so on,” Chomsky admitted of the protests on the right. “But my strong impression is that these [right-wing protesters] are people with very real grievances.” 
“They give the impression of being a hard-working serious people who think they’ve been doing everything right. They’ve been doing what they’re ‘supposed’ to do [as] god-fearing hard-working, gun-carrying, you know patriotic, Americans,” Chomsky continued. 
“What are they doing wrong and how come their lives are so crummy?” Chomsky asked. 
It’s a question that has plagued the election. 
“They’re not getting answers,” Chomsky insisted. “The answers they are getting are not only crazy, but extremely dangerous, so the right response is to ask ourselves, why are we failing to organize these people?” 
There’s nothing partisan about losing money to Wall Street or lacking health insurance; issues at the forefront of protests from both sides for nearly a decade. 
“We have not succeeded in unifying people,” Chomsky noted. “It’s our fault.”

18481,The Quasi-Legal Coup-Hillary Clinton Information Operations In Election 2016,"Posted on November 7, 2016 by WashingtonsBlog 
By George Eliason, an American journalist living in Ukraine. 
“The purpose of ” Inform and Influence Operations” is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences “think and act” in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning. 
These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. 
Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant.” 
What if the strife, rumor, and clamor were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the practitioner showing what it could look like in the civilian world. 
” What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please don’t forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversary’s leader who is the ultimate target.” – Joel Harding 
IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. 
In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. 
What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. 
By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponent’s decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. 
According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton. “ Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function.” The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. 
Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . 
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the who’s who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. It’s also why big media carries the same line or themes. 
The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrong’s background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. 
In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clinton’s message out. ” All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins — and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs.” 
According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundation’s Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article “Families Valued,” focused on “juggler families” as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. 
Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. 
Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Council’s main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. 
According to journalist Robert Parry “The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe “This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East.” 
Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question to candidates that mattered is “Are you willing to go to war with Russia?” Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. 
The Central and Eastern European Coalition represent the various Central and Eastern European countries to the US government. What makes them special in an election is that they control a 20 million person strong bloc vote in key states across the country and sway elections by themselves. The price of a Clinton win is war with Russia. 
While the rest of the BBG board support Clinton’s proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clinton’s first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . 
Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, don’t they? 
As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? 
Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, it’s no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. 
Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you can’t tell me. The odds are you haven’t heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. 
“Unity to act when required has been the diaspora’s mantra – this cannot be disputed . 
As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN – (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi – are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again.” 
The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930’s they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. 
The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. 
They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. 
There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live…One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons…- Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta – Pers Anders Rudling 
With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions. 
“ OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000’s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system.” 
“I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . 
The Ukrainian issue “trumps” all other personal issues! 
A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! 
When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused.” Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference 
Hillary Clinton’s response is she will defend Ukraine’s borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. 
Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. 
Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaign’s program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S”. 
“ We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. 
One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence.” Joel Harding 
By systematically and continually attacking the voter’s psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. 
What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term “anti-western” refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that aren’t carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. 
“I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call ‘inform and influence activities’. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations – of all sorts – against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel_harding@” 
If you don’t think this is possible , this has been going on around you for a long time. look at the credentials of retired Brigadier General Joel Harding and decide for yourself. But first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him. 
“ Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about a competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm. 
It is our job to maximize your advantages over your competitor while minimizing your competitor. We work on the national level down to the individual level. We seek to give you every advantage possible in order to advance your position, increase your reputation, and maximize your standing in your field.”

With his resume, no guess work is needed to understand how effective his friends are. Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? 
As a litmus test take Hillary’s name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCain’s name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add what’s been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? 
If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already. 
“ I’ve seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. I’ve seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. It’s unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I won’t continue to be until the good Lord takes me.” Cesar Vargas 
Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. 
Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. 
If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I can’t help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. 
If all these things weren’t being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. 
If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win. 
Your voice, your views, your informed choice will no longer matter. The IIO practitioner kills dissent. That’s their job. They’re only doing their job.",0
18482,Automakers Prepare for an America That’s Over the Whole Car Thing - The New York Times,"FOR decades, automakers have been able to count on a fundamental fact of American life: You pretty much need a car to get around. But lately, novel technologies, including   services like Uber and advances in   cars, are creating new alternatives for commuting, shuttling children and going to the store  —   particularly in urban settings. There are also demographic and economic trends in play. Many younger Americans do not consider owning a car a goal or necessity  —   or a necessary expense. So carmakers are looking ahead to a day when the automobile plays a smaller role, or even no role at all, in many people’s daily routines. “The historical model is you buy a car and it’s in your garage most of the time,” said Glen DeVos, vice president for engineering and services at Delphi Automotive, a big developer and supplier of automobile technology. “It’s the   expensive thing you buy after your home, so if you can get around without owning a car, there are a lot of economic reasons people may not own a car, or own only one instead of two. ” One clear sign of the shift is the increasing energy that carmakers are devoting to a design category the auto industry refers to as the “the first   mile” challenge. It refers to the short distances some people must travel from home or work to a local destination, often a mass transit station. Not so long ago, this challenge was strictly a matter for transportation authorities, and barely registered with automakers. “People really didn’t think of the first   mile issue because the car was the primary way to get around,’’ said Erica Klampfl, the global future mobility manager at Ford Motor Company. “You just drove your car to your destination. ’’ In many ways, the industry’s race to solve the   challenge involves the development of   vehicles, an effort involving various carmakers, technology companies and   firms. General Motors and its partner, Lyft, an Uber rival, are about to begin testing a fleet of   cars ferrying passengers short distances in Detroit and other cities. Uber already has similar trials underway in Pittsburgh and has just expanded its tests to San Francisco. Next year, Delphi Automotive expects to have   Audis providing rides to mass transit stations in a section of Singapore. Ford, meanwhile, has vowed to begin producing a   car, with no steering wheel and no pedals, by 2021. The vehicle would be intended for   services in large cities. If these types of cars and services proliferate, Mr. DeVos at Delphi said, people will have more freedom to not own automobiles. Monica Manjarres, a    college student, is embracing that freedom. She lives in Azusa, Calif. 24 miles east of Los Angeles. In the last year, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has opened miles of new light rail extensions to its subway system, including a light rail link to Azusa. “If I want to visit my sister in Pasadena, I can walk to the train and it’s a   to   ride,” Ms. Manjarres said. “If you drive, the traffic is usually horrible. ” After she graduates this semester from Azusa Pacific University with a degree in exercise science, Ms. Manjarres says, she hopes to find a job she can reach by train. “I can confidently say I don’t really need a car,” she said. Kelly Skow has all but come to the same conclusion. A    video producer, Ms. Skow lives in Hollywood and commutes on the Los Angeles subway using the new Expo rail extension that goes to Santa Monica, where her office is. She usually covers the first and last mile of the trip on foot. “I only drive maybe once a week, usually to go shopping on weekends,” she said. During the week, her boyfriend uses her car to get to his job. “I had barely ridden the subway before the Expo Line opened, but now I’m using it a lot more and it’s great. Parking in L. A. is a nightmare and you don’t have to deal with that. ” The twist in Ms. Skow’s story: She works for TrueCar, a website that provides automotive pricing and information to help connect consumers with   and   dealers. Forecasters expect people in metropolitan areas to own fewer cars in the future. But they are not ready to predict a big drop in the total number of vehicles sold, which this year will total more than 17 million cars and light trucks in the United States and about 75 million globally. That is, in part, because so many people have more than a last mile to cover. Automakers are generally betting that sales of vehicles to fleet services will offset any decline in sales to individual consumers. Boston Consulting Group predicts that 44, 000 cars will be sold to   fleets in North America in 2021, more than making up for an expected net decline in consumer sales of about 8, 000 vehicles. The bigger impact might be on how the automotive industry  —   not just carmakers, but also fleet service operators, parts makers and the like  —   makes its money in years to come. According to the consulting firm PwC, the global automotive industry generates about $400 billion a year in profits about 41 percent of that  —   or about $164 billion  —   comes from new vehicle sales. By 2030, PwC forecasts that even as overall automotive profits grow to about $600 billion, only about 29 percent of that will come from new vehicle sales. By then, PwC predicts that “mobility services’’  —   including   and other types of   transportation services  —   will represent 20 percent of the automotive industry’s profits. Ford is among the automakers angling to be in position if that shift occurs. “We are on the cusp of a revolution,” Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive, said at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Cars, he said, “are no longer our entire game. ” The company sees mobility services as potentially more profitable than its traditional business of making and selling cars. Manufacturing vehicles requires billions of dollars in investments in plants and engineering  —   costs that are often difficult to recoup. Mobility services would require less upfront investment, Robert Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “Margins could be more like 20 percent instead of the 8 percent we are trying to get to today,” he said. Some of Ford’s mobility efforts don’t involve cars at all. Ford is sponsoring a   program in the San Francisco area, with the goal of having 7, 000 blue,   bikes in operation by 2018. In recent months, the company has also begun demonstrating a motorized conveyance device, created by its engineers, to help people cover the last mile  —   especially if they are carrying luggage or groceries that would make walking a challenge. Called the   it looks like a giant white hockey puck. The passenger stands on it as it travels to her destination, or she can set a parcel on it and have the   follow along. Ford has no plans to put it into production, but the company says it represents the unconventional ways it is thinking about the transportation future. Glimpses of a less   future, and the emergence of new   options, are evident in Southern California, where the new rail system has given many more people easy access to mass transit. Ms. Skow and other residents of Santa Monica, population 92, 000, can now hop on the Expo Line and ride all the way from the coast to downtown Los Angeles, 16 miles to the east. Although Ms. Skow walks to the train, the Santa Monica municipal government has tried to make it easier to reach any of the city’s three Expo Line stops without using a car. Its bus network was completely reorganized to deliver passengers to the stations in time to catch trains. For   service, after buses stop running, riders can get discounted cab rides. The last mile is more of a challenge in Azusa, a city of about 48, 000 that is less compact and walkable than Santa Monica and does not have as big a bus network. Ms. Manjarres, the college student, lives only a short walk from a station. But so many commuters still drive their cars to the train that the city doesn’t have enough parking for them. Theirs is more than a   gap to bridge. “People coming to the train will park in residential neighborhoods or retail parking lots,” said Troy Butzlaff, Azusa’s city manager. That is why the city is building an     solution: a   parking garage.",0
18483,Is this person our new President?,"Here’s Why Hillary Won’t Allow Her Corporate Speeches to be Published Eric Zuesse (update added 8 November 2016) In a previous report, I indicated “Why Hillary Clinton’s Paid Speeches Are Relevant” , but not what they contained. The present report indicates what they contained. One speech in particular will be cited and quoted from as an example here, to show the type of thing that all of her corporate speeches contained, which she doesn’t want the general public to know about. This is the day’s keynote speech, which she gave on Wednesday, 25 June 2014 , to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization , a lobbying organization in DC, at their annual convention, which in 2014 was held in San Diego . The announcement for attendees said: “Wednesday’s Keynote session is sponsored by Genentech, and is open to Convention registrants with Convention Access and Convention Access & Partnering badges only. Seating is limited.” Somehow, a reporter from a local newspaper, the Times of San Diego , managed to get in. Also, somehow, an attendee happened to phone-video the 50-minute interview that the BIO’s CEO did of Clinton, which took place during the hour-and-a-half period, 12-1:30, which was allotted to Clinton. The Times of San Diego headlined that day, “Hillary Clinton Cheers Biotechers, Backing GMOs and Federal Help” , and gave an excellent summary of her statements, including of the interview. Here are highlights: — It was red meat for the biotech base. Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a 65-minute appearance at the BIO International Convention on Wednesday, voiced support for genetically modified organisms and possible federal subsidies. … “Maybe there’s a way of getting a representative group of actors at the table” to discuss how the federal government could help biotechs with “insurance against risk,” she said. Without such subsidies, she said, “this is going to be an increasing challenge.” … She said the debate about GMOs might be turned toward the biotech side if the benefits were better explained, noting that the “Frankensteinish” depictions could be fought with more positive spin. “I stand in favor of using seeds and products that have a proven track record,” she said [at 29:00 in the video next posted here] , citing drought-resistant seeds she backed as secretary of state. “There’s a big gap between the facts and what the perceptions are.” [that too at 29:00] … Minutes earlier, Gov. Jerry Brown made a rousing 3-minute pitch for companies to see California as biotech-friendly. “You’ve come to the right place.” … Brown had some competition for biotech boosterism in the form of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton ally who pitched his own state as best for biotech. … [Clinton was] Given a standing ovation at the start and end of her appearance. — In other words: As President, she would aim to sign into law a program to provide subsidies from U.S. taxpayers to Monsanto and other biotech firms, to assist their PR and lobbying organizations to eliminate what she says is “a big gap between the facts and what the perceptions are” concerning genetically modified seeds and other GMOs. In other words: she ignores the evidence that started to be published in scientific journals in 2012 showing that Monsanto and other GMO firms were selectively publishing studies that alleged to show their products to be safe, while selectively blocking publication of studies that — on the basis of better methodology — showed them to be unsafe. She wants U.S. taxpayers to assist GMO firms in their propaganda that’s based on their own flawed published studies, financed by the GMO industry, and that ignores the studies that they refuse to have published. She wants America’s consumers to help to finance their own being poisoning by lying companies, who rake in profits from poisoning them. Her argument on this, at 27:00 to 30:00 in the video of the 50-minute interview of Clinton , starts by her citing the actual disinformation (that’s propagandized by the fossil-fuels industries, which actually back her Presidential campaign ) that causes the American public to reject the view that humans have caused global warming. At 27:38 in the video, she said “98% of scientists in the world agree that man has caused the problem” of global warming, and she alleged that the reason why there is substantial public resistance to GMOs is the same as the reason why there’s substantial public resistance to the reality that global warming exists and must be actively addressed: Americans don’t know the science of the matter. She received several applauses from this pro-GMO audience, for making that false analogy. The reality, that it’s false, is that on 15 May 2013, the definitive meta-study, which examined the 11,944 published studies that had been done relating to the question of global warming and its causes, reported that “97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.” The meta-study was titled “Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature” . So, Clinton’s statement “98%” was only 0.9% off regarding the size of the scientific consensus. However, her implication that the public’s rejection of that actual 97.1% of experts’ findings on global warming, is at all analogous to the public’s rejection of the actually bogus finding by GMO industry ‘experts’ that GMOs are safe, is pure deception by her. The reality is the exact contrary: The fossil-fuels industries have financed the propaganda ‘discrediting’ the scientists’ consensus about global warming, much like the GMO industries have financed the deception of the public to think that ‘scientists’ ‘find’ that GMOs are safe. In fact, as was reported in Scientific American , on 23 December 2013, “’Dark Money’ Funds Climate Change Denial Effort” , and the study they were summarizing, from the journal Climate Change , was titled “Institutionalizing delay: foundation funding and the creation of U.S. climate change counter-movement organizations” . It found that: “From 2003 to 2007, the Koch Affiliated Foundations and the ExxonMobil Foundation were heavily involved in funding CCCM [climate change counter-movement] organizations. But since 2008, they are no longer making publicly traceable contributions to CCCM organizations. Instead, funding has shifted to pass through [two] untraceable sources [ both of which had been set up by the Kochs: Donors Trust, and Donors Capital Fund ] . “ On 23 April 2016, Politico headlined “Charles Koch: ‘It’s possible’ Clinton is preferable to a Republican for president” , but this isn’t the only indication that Hillary is merely pretending to be their enemy. On 24 February 2016, I headlined “Hillary Clinton’s Global-Burning Record” and summarized and linked to news reports such as the opening there: “On 17 July 2015, Paul Blumenthal and Kate Sheppard at Huffington Post bannered, ‘Hillary Clinton’s Biggest Campaign Bundlers Are Fossil Fuel Lobbyists’ and the sub-head was ‘Clinton’s top campaign financiers are linked to Big Oil, natural gas and the Keystone pipeline.’” In other words: the same pro-GMO lobbyists who applaud Hillary for verbally endorsing the science that affirms global warming, applaud her for endorsing their own fake ‘science’ which asserts that GMOs have been proven safe. They just love her lie, which analogizes them to the authentic scientists who (97.1%) say that global warming exists and is caused by humans’ emissions of global-warming gases. Also, she expressed the wish that: “the federal government could help biotechs with ‘insurance against risk,’ she said. Without such subsidies, she said, this is going to be an increasing challenge,” because otherwise, biotech companies might get bankrupted by lawsuits from consumers who might have become poisoned by their products. She wants the consuming public to bear the risk from those products — not the manufacturers of them to bear any of the risks that could result from those manufacturers’ rigged ‘safety’ ‘studies’ (a.k.a.: their propaganda). In other words: the reason why Hillary Clinton won’t allow her 91 corporate speeches, for which she was paid $21,667,000 , to be published, is the lying political cravenness of her pandering to those corporations there. Each group of lobbyists is happy to applaud her lying, regardless of whether her lies include insults against another group of lobbyists, to whom she might be delivering similar lies to butter them up at a different annual convention or etc. In other words: she’s telling all of them collectively: You’re my type of people, and the public who despise you are merely misguided, but as President I’ll set them straight and they’ll even end up paying part of the bill to be ‘educated’ about these matters, by my Administration, and even part of the bill to pay corporations’ product-liability suits. The reason why Clinton doesn’t want those speeches to be made public is that she doesn’t want the voters to know that she intends to use their money to propagandize to them for the benefit of those corporations, and also to protect those corporations from liability for harms their products cause the public. This is called (by the propagandists) ‘capitalism’ and ‘democracy’ . Mussolini, with pride, called it sometimes “fascism,” and sometimes “corporationism.” But whatever it’s called, it’s what she supports, and what she represents, to the people who are paying her. And even most of her own voters would find it repulsive, if they knew about it. So: she can’t let them know about it. And she doesn’t. UPDATE : On 5 October 2016, fifty-six food-related lobbying organizations, such as the American Soybean Association and the International Dairy Foods Association, and including some universities that receive large income from biotech firms to produce ‘scientific studies’ so they can promote their products as being ‘proven safe’, wrote a letter to the heads and ranking members of the Appropriations Committee in both the House and Senate, opening , “The undersigned organizations support the inclusion of $3 million within the Fiscal Year 2017 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to better inform the public about the application of biotechnology to food and agricultural production. Regrettably, there is a tremendous amount of misinformation about agricultural biotechnology in the public domain. Dedicated educational resources will ensure key federal agencies responsible for the safety of our nation’s food supply – the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) – are able to more easily convey to the public science- and fact-based information about food.” That was exactly what Hillary Clinton had proposed on 25 June 2014 to the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (which was one of those 56 lobbying groups). As to whether the idea had originated with Clinton or with top executives in the biotech industry, one can, at the present time, only speculate. However, she was on record (privately) proposing it to the biotech industry more than two years before the biotech industry proposed it to Congress.",0

18485,Life: Career Goals FTW: 6 Tips For Asking The Man Whose Hand Is Currently On Your Knee For A Raise,"Email His hand might be on your leg, but right now, you’re in the driver’s seat! 
1. Phrase your request carefully: It’s absolutely imperative that when you ask the man who currently has his hand on your knee for a raise, you are respectful and conscious. Nail down every word in your request beforehand, so that when the time comes, the man with his hand on your knee is inspired, but not threatened. 
2. Anticipate your talking points: Ask yourself: Is your employer data-conscious? Is your parent company in a good financial position to give out raises right now? Are five sweaty fingers simply resting on your knee, or are they moving around, toying playfully with the fabric on your pants? As you’re sitting across from the man controlling those fingers, make sure you’re constantly asking yourself these types of questions, because if you do, you’re guaranteed to step up your negotiation skills tenfold! 
3. Assume a stance that is confident but also gently pushes his hand off your knee: Whether you’re crossing your legs to subtly shake his hand off your knee or swiveling your chair to guide his palm onto the armrest of your chair, try to use your body to signal confidence, rather than looking fidgety. After all, visual cues are just as important as verbal ones. So when you sit down in his office and notice the hand on your leg or rubbing your upper arm, look like the valuable employee you truly know you are! 
4. Make sure to ask for an exact salary before the man’s fingers start moving up your leg: It might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money, but if you don’t come with an exact number in mind, the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused, with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you. Calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain, but when you do, avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched, because this is about you, not them! 
5. Don’t mention the hand: A real negotiator stays on target and doesn’t let day-to-day work conversations creep into business. Mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise. Keep your message laser-focused! 
6. Be prepared for a no: Look, you might not get a raise this time, but don’t worry, it’s not personal! That’s just business, and sometimes you have to ask once, twice, or even three more times before the man with his hand on your knee finally gives you a raise. And if he doesn’t, who knows? Might be time for a new job!",0
18486,Yale Dean Apologizes After Calling People ’White Trash’ and ’Uneducated Morons’ in Yelp Reviews - Breitbart,"Yale Dean June Chu was forced to apologize after she called people “white trash” and “uneducated morons” in a series of Yelp reviews of restaurants and businesses in the New Haven, Connecticut, area. [Her reviews were called “offensive” and “elitist. ” Dean June Chu of Yale’s Pierson College used the terms “white trash,” “low class folks,” and “uneducated morons” to describe employees and patrons of local establishments in series of Yelp reviews, which were spread around the Ivy League university’s community last week.   Condemning a New Haven cinema, Chu wrote that it was a place for ‘barely educated morons trying to manage snack orders for the obese and also try to add $7 plus $7.’ “I am concerned about the shadow that my actions have thrown on my efforts to create an environment in Pierson that respects everyone, and I am especially concerned that it could prevent anyone from coming to me for the support that I offer to all Pierson students,” Chu wrote in an apology statement. “I see that I now have work to do to repair the trust you have all shown me. ” Although some have expressed concerns that backlash against Chu is a result of the excesses of political correctness, others argue that Chu should be held to the same politically correct standards that many Yale professors expect of their community members. Yale University has no plans to formally discipline Chu. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

18487,"Michael Phelps Powers U.S. to Victory in 4x100 Relay, Winning a 19th Gold - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Michael Phelps won his 19th Olympic gold medal as the United States won the 4x100 relay at the Olympics on Sunday. The Americans’ traditional rival in the event, France, was second, and Australia third. The gold was Phelps’s 23rd medal: 19 golds, 2 silvers and 2 bronzes. The final time was 3:09. 92. Phelps, who wasn’t added to the relay team until race day, swam the second leg for the Americans, taking over from Caeleb Dressel in second place behind France and swimming into the lead. His split time was 47. 12, which his coach Bob Bowman said was one of his   fastest. He took the lead from his French counterpart Fabien Gilot after a turn that Bowman described as “probably the best turn that might have ever been done. ” Ryan Held and Nathan Adrian brought the U. S. home Adrian’s split was an even better 46. 97. Phelps retired after the 2012 Games but decided to return in part because of disappointment with how the American men swam in the 4x100 relay at the 2013 world championships, losing to France. The relay was the most unpredictable event of the night in swimming, with Australia, France, the United States and Russia all having claims to a gold medal. France and the United States split the last two Olympic gold medals, with Yannick Agnel of France outdueling Ryan Lochte in the anchor leg to win four years ago.

18488,Obama Going To Prison? SHOCKING New Evidence Could Put Him Away | RedFlag News,"
Mad World News 
Barack Obama is delusional. While he’s campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the FBI is investigating clear evidence that indicates he is guilty of treason. These idiots, Obama and Hillary, are in denial, running around the country and droning on about “hope and change” when the cat’s out of the bag. New evidence could put Obama in prison right next to Hillary, and Americans couldn’t be happier. 
No one is above the law, but Hillary and her crime cartel thought that they were. Now, Obama is facing his worst nightmare as the FBI is also gunning for him. Shocking new revelations came from Fox News’ Catherine Herridge, who reports that Huma Abedin spilled the beans on Obama: 
“One of the key things we’ve learned in the FBI interviews, known as 302s, came from Clinton aide Huma Abedin . She told the FBI investigators that every time Hillary Clinton’s personal [email] address changed, they would update the White House so that the president could continue receiving Hillary Clinton’s emails on his high security devices, including his Blackberry.” 
Listen to the shocking report below: 
Herridge went on to explain , “The reason that matters is that that is evidence that goes to knowledge of the White House [Obama] of this personal system [Hillary’s home-based server] and the changing addresses. So, this is something where the president and the White House clearly have a horse in the race and a stake in the outcome [FBI investigation].” 
This is exactly what happened to former president Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal , except no one made money and there was never any risk to national security. So, as far as degree of damage done, Hillary and Obama put American lives at risk and allowed our enemies access to our top secrets — and that’s treason. ",0
18489,How To Revive Your Old Guns And How To Use Them,"Fred Tyrell November 4, 2016 How To Revive Your Old Guns And How To Use Them 
If your firearms require repair after a social collapse, it will be too late to start thinking about how to work on firearms and keep them in good working order. Now is the time to start learning how to repair and maintain your firearms so that your guns are always ready to serve your needs. 
You Need to Be a Gunsmith and a Blacksmith 
These days, if your handguns, rifles, or shotguns need repair, you can just take them to a gunsmith, or return them to the manufacturer for factory warranty work. 
In a time of crisis there may not be any gunsmiths or even any warranty service centers open to repair your weapons. With this in mind, you must know how to make and replace any parts that break or wear out. 
Two good trades to learn and be proficient in are gunsmithing and blacksmithing. A good gunsmith can repair and modify most modern firearms with a good supply of spare parts. If you don’t have anymore spare parts to repair broken firearms, you will need blacksmithing skills so that you can make the needed parts for these repairs. 
Aside from fixing your own weapons (and other machines), you can also barter or trade for other goods and services when needed. To do well in these two trades, you must have all of the necessary tools, repair manuals, a good memory, and a natural ability to do the work. 
Count on Cannibalizing Other Broken Firearms 
Battle field cannibalization should be used when you have run out of spare parts and there are none left to use. Sometimes there is not enough time for your gunsmith or blacksmith to manufacture the needed parts. Turn to cannibalizing non-serviceable firearms instead, to keep others working until they can be fixed or repaired. 
A good source of firearms to cannibalize are those weapons that were discarded by their old owner because they would no longer work. Another place to search are battlefields or skirmish lines. Most of these firearms, when retrieved, may still have usable parts. If not, all of the steel and other metal parts can be melted down and reused. 
The question is, do your old weapons need special care to make them work? 
When repairing or working with any gun that has cannibalized gun parts, take the time to hand fit each part to ensure that it fits and works perfectly, otherwise you will waste your time. You also run the risk of damaging or destroying the firearm or the valuable repair parts. 
Do safety tests before and after repairs to determine if the firearm is safe to use! 
A good gunsmith will always test the firearms that are to be repaired before any work is done. The first safety check is to see if the firearm is loaded. If not, then check the function of the weapon. If the weapon doesn’t function, then you can begin to disassemble the firearm. Once inside the firearm, the gunsmith can determine the problem and go about fixing it. 
After the firearm is fixed, a good gunsmith will physically test the weapon unloaded. If the firearm passes the function testing, then it is time to load the gun and do a live fire test to check the weapon. Some gunsmiths will use a firearm rest to strap down the firearm and tie a string to the trigger so that the trigger can be pulled from a safe distance. 
This could save your life, especially if the firearm explodes. When the firearm passes all the function tests, then you know it is safe to use. 
When buying survival handguns , rifles, or shotguns, ask questions and try to find out which firearms: Will last the longest with heavy use. Have a history of minimal repairs. Are easy to obtain repair parts for. Include easy to make parts as a gunsmith or blacksmith. Have easy to install replacement parts. 
If you can find firearms that have simple trigger, gas, loading, and other systems, then you could make the necessary parts on your own. Once you decide on a weapon, get all the gunsmith exploded views and specs for each weapon, but you will need tools, gun steel, or other supplies. 
Like any other skill, you need to practice repairing firearms by making your own replacement parts and test firing them to insure they work properly. 
Basic Gunsmith Tools and Procedures You Need for Reviving Old Guns 
Here are some videos that can help you figure out which tools to obtain as well as the kinds of things you can do once you know the basics: 
Here’s a video that shows the basic tools and supplies that are necessary for gunsmithing: Video first seen on Iraqveteran8888 . 
Here’s how to make primers for reloading if they were not available. Remember, these methods can be dangerous, so make sure you study this and other resources before trying this on your own. Video first seen on Jon with no h . 
It is also possible to make a rifle firing pin by using a drill bit that fits the firing pin channel in the bolt. The rear portion of the drill bit will be used. It is better to make the firing pin a little too long, and then cut it back if needed. If you make the firing pin too short, it must be discarded. Video first seen on beltstowing . 
Making your own firearm parts when replacements are not available. Video first seen on MidwayUSA . 
The Best Guns You Can Revive for Your Survival Arsenal 
The following are firearms I would recommend for your survival arsenal . Each was selected because it is either readily available, or spare parts will be easy to get for some time. In some cases, you may also be able to make important parts on your own if needed. 
Glock family of semi-auto pistols 
Glock pistols are offered in 7 different calibers. There are 21 different styles for the Glock pistol. For each of the calibers, there are three different models: subcompact, compact, and full size for police or military. 
The Glock pistol is known as a safe action pistol. It is a polymer framed, short recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. Even though the Glock was referred to as the plastic gun because of its polymer frame, it is extremely well-built and durable. It is carried by approximately 65% of all United States police departments and sheriff departments. 
Glocks are also extremely popular among civilians for recreational and competition shooting, home and self-defense, and for concealed or open carry. Since Glocks are very popular, there is an excellent supply of spare parts to repair or upgrade the pistol. If you needed to make replacement parts, that can also be done. 
S&W Revolvers 
S&W is an American firearms manufacturing company that has built revolvers since 1852. With this long tradition, they have built high quality revolvers that will last the average shooter a life time. The designs of the S&W revolvers are simple, which allows the average person to work on them. If no suitable parts are available, a good gunsmith or a blacksmith should be able to make them and repair the revolver . 
Another thing that makes these revolvers a good choice is that certain ones can fire more than one type of bullet in the same gun. An example of this is the .22LR revolver which can shoot the .22 long rifle round, .22Long, and the .22short. The .357 magnum can also shoot .38 Specials, 38 Special + P, and 38 Special +P+. When you can shoot different ammo types, it makes it much easier to scavenge when bullets become more scarce. 
The S&W revolvers come in the following frame sizes: The smallest frame size is the “J” frame that features a 1-2 inch barrel. The “K” frame is for medium sized revolvers with a 2-6 inch barrel. The “L” frame is for medium to large frame revolvers with a 4-8 inch barrel. The “N” frame is also for large frame revolvers with a 4-8 inch barrel. The “X” frame revolvers were designed for the very heavy recoiling S&W 500 and 460 round. The “Z” frame was designed for the S&W Governor revolvers which can shoot the .410 shotgun shells ( 2 1/2 and 3inch ), the 45ACP, and the 45Long Colt. 
Remington Model 700 series of bolt action rifles 
The Remington Model 700 is a series of bolt action rifles manufactured by Remington Arms since 1962. These rifles are all based on the same Centerfire bolt-action design. They come with a three, four, or five round internal magazine depending on the caliber. 
Some models of the Remington Model 700 have a floor plate for quick unloading of the weapon while others do not. In recent years, this rifle has also been modified so it can be used with a detachable box magazine. 
The Model 700 is available in many different stock, caliber, and barrel lengths. There are three versions of the Model 700: the civilian version, the police version, and the military version. This rifle can be chambered from the .17 Remington to the .458 Winchester magnum. 
I would recommend that you have your Remington Model 700 chambered in the .308 Winchester round. In a time of crisis the .308 Winchester round would be more plentiful than other calibers because the police and military use this caliber in their rifles. 
AR-15 platform of semi-auto rifles 
The original AR-15 Sporter models were first manufactured in 1963 by Colt firearms. Over the years, other companies have made the AR-15 style rifles that vary in ammo type and other features. Even though the original caliber for this weapon was .223, some models have been chambered in 5.56, the Russian 7.62×39, AAC Blackout, and .458 SOCOM. 
Some AR-15 style rifles can also take Pistol calibers such as the .22 caliber long rifle, 9×19, and the 45 ACP. 
Positive features of the basic AR-15 style rifles are excellent molecularity, the great availability of spare and replacement parts, and accessories. These rifles have a great potential for excellent accuracy and they fit the shooter quite well. The greatest feature of the AR style rifle is that anybody can swap out the upper receiver and quickly replace it with another. 
The wide availability of spare and after market parts allows you to customize your rifle for almost any purpose and budget. It is possible to build the AR style rifle yourself, have a gunsmith build it, or even order one from a custom manufacturing company. 
Negative features of a typical AR-15 style rifles include sensitivity to ammunition and relatively high maintenance requirements, compared to its longtime rival, the AK. Another weakness of the AR-15 style rifle is the flimsy design of the original magazines. 
Another feature which can be considered as a negative is the buffer tube housing which protrudes rearward from the receiver and into the shoulder stock. This precludes any use of folding stocks. 
It is important to note that the ammunition used for AR style rifles is plentiful to buy and to reload. This ammunition it’s also used by the military and the police. 
AK-47 and AK-74 platform of semi-auto rifles 
The AK platform is the end result of years of research and development of a Russian selective fire rifle while the rifles made for the American civilian market are semi-automatic only rifles. The most commonly found AK platform rifles are mainly stamped receiver rifles, but there are a few milled receiver rifles available in the marketplace as well. 
The AK-47 platform was design to be cheaply, easily and quickly manufactured using mass production methods. It is simple to use and very reliable. It uses a lot of stamped steel parts to help keep the unit price down. 
The AK uses a long stroke gas system that is generally used for great reliability in adverse conditions. The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the AK platform to endure large amounts of dirt, other foreign matter, and fouling without failing to cycle. 
This rifle is cheaper to produce and repair than other semi-automatic rifles. Furthermore this rifle was designed to be used by individuals that did not have much formal education. It is an easy to use, relatively simple rifle. 
The AK platform can be broken down into its basic groups quickly and easily for cleaning and repairing. No special tools are required for cleaning or simple repairs in the field. This platform is one of the easiest to work on. If there are no spare parts to repair the rifle, they can be made easily enough by a good gunsmith or a blacksmith. 
Ammunition for the AK platform is cheap to buy and easy to reload. 
The standard AK-47 magazines are metal and hold 30 rounds of 7.62×39 ammunition. After market magazines can hold from 5-40 rounds of ammunition, or you can use a drum that holds 75 rounds of ammunition. 
The standard AK-74 magazines are made of metal or synthetic materials and hold 30 rounds of 5.45×39 ammunition. There are also after market magazines that hold between 5-40 rounds of ammunition. 
Keep spare parts that are known to break easily or often. 
For each of your firearms you should have a spare parts kit. If any of your firearms have known weak points in their design, it is to your advantage to get rid of these weapons before a time of crisis and replace them with a more reliable weapon.

18490,Post-Maidan Ukraine Has Become a Full Fledged Totalitarian State - Volodymyr Chemerys,"Media skeptic Post-Maidan Ukraine Has Become a Full Fledged Totalitarian State 
In Ukraine, the state apparatus, far-right movements and patriotic citizens are working together to shut down debate and silence criticism   Open Democracy 
This article, which originally appeared in Ukrainian on a Ukrainian website, is indicative of a growing realization in Ukraine that those who supported the ""revolution"" for freedom and democracy in that country were duped. The author, however, sadly maintains the baseless preconception that Russia is the ultimate model of totalitarianism that Ukraine must avoid - in fact today's Russia bares no resemblance to the reign-of-terror state Ukraine has degenerated into. But the acknowledgement that the war in Donbass is being used by the Kiev regime to maintain control over society is very significant 
Under Ukraine’s pre-Maidan criminal regime, any pressure on journalists used to provoke a wave of indignation. This indignation, which came from journalists, human rights defenders and civic activists themselves, even became a precursor to the first Maidan in independent Ukraine — the protests under the banner of “Ukraine without Kuchma”. 
Information about temnyky, the authorities’ secret instructions to the press about what they should and should not report, and the murders of critics of the regime invariably provoked protests. The arrest of a journalist solely for expressing his opinion in print could raise a wave, even a tsunami, of public outrage. Indeed, in 2004, putting an end to temnyky was one of the slogans behind the Orange protest. pa-25751119-1_2.jpg March 2016: 2,000 people rally in support of Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko at Independence Square in Kiev.

In post-Maidan Ukraine, temnyky , arrests and censorship have become commonplace . What’s more, repression against dissidents and even murder have become socially acceptable . The murder of the journalist Oles Buzyna in April 2015 or the burning of dozens of people in Odesa in May 2014 now find their justification in the speeches of “ patriots ”. Meanwhile, former opposition journalists who gained seats as parliamentary deputies refuse to defend their colleague Ruslan Kotsaba, the blogger who spent a year and a half in jail for his views. In all, over 100 journalists , bloggers and indeed ordinary people who expressed their views about the war in the Donbas, conscription , the constitutional order of Ukraine (law enforcement authorities qualify such views as “ separatism ”) and other issues have been criminally prosecuted in Ukraine for their publications. 
The boldest predictions of George Orwell’s 1984 have come to pass — phrases like “civil war” have become taboo. In their place, we have newspeak. In particular, the newspeak term “hybrid war”, which means everything in our mass media from military action in the east to an article in the New York Times. 
To be fair, it should be noted that justifications of violence and murder of “enemies” have not been accepted by society as a whole — only by one segment of social media, the mass media and those who call themselves “Maidan activists”. However, that fact does not bestow a rosier vista of Ukraine today. Critics of the current state of affairs generally remain silent for fear of repression or they censor themselves. Meanwhile, our mass media presents the postings of the “Facebook Hundred” or the speeches of “patriots” as though they were the voice of the entirety of Ukrainian society. 
It used to be that the prohibition of an opposition party would evoke society’s indignation. After all, there were no precedents for this after 1991 in Ukraine. Now, however, banning the Communist Party of Ukraine and a number of other parties was met with silence inside the country. Only international human rights organisations protested the ban. 
The practice of “five minutes of hatred” (again reminiscent of Orwell) has become commonplace. True, these “five minutes”— mass attacks in social media and the news media against Nadia Savchenko, Tetiana Montian, Stanislav Serhienko, Volodymyr Zelensky as well as “anti-corruption activists” and “euro-optimists”— last not for five minutes, but often weeks on end. The initiators of such campaigns (the authors of the first posts) are advisors to the president (Yuri Biriukov), public officials (Anton Herashchenko, Georgy Tuka) or structures that belong to representatives of the pro-government People’s Front (Mykola Kniazhytsky, Serhiy Pashynsky). 
Is it right to talk about signs and tendencies of totalitarianism in post-Maidan Ukraine? And how important is it to dwell on them, to emphasise them? 
Informing has become socially acceptable in post-Maidan Ukraine. The State Security Agency (SBU) encourages it. The website Myrotvorets (“Peacemaker”) collects informers’ reports and regularly publishes lists of “enemies” — journalists and civic activists. These lists often become an instruction of sorts for the actions of ultra-right paramilitary groups, who use violence against “traitors”, attacking participants in social protests, anti-war, anti-fascist meetings, threatening and even beating up journalists. 
For example, the Myrotvorets website published lists of journalists who were careless enough to get press accreditation in the Donetsk People’s Republic, resulting in a wave of brutal threats against them by “patriots” . International human rights organisations and OSCE Representative on Media Freedom Dunja Mijatovic were forced to take a stand given that foreign journalists and not just Ukrainians were among those subject to attack. The lists of “undesirable people” created by activists of the ultra-right Azov Civic Corps became the basis for attacks on left-wing and anti-fascist activists. 
Something really has happened to us —Ukraine has changed after the last Maidan. From a country that stood out for its level of civic freedoms on the territory of the former USSR, it is transforming into a copy of the Russian Federation in terms of the suppression of those freedoms. 
Are we actually agreeing to this? 
Practically according to Arendt 
The facts above show that several aspects of civic life in today’s Ukraine are under the control either of state organs or non-state far-right formations. And citizens who want to express views that are not approved by these formations face threats, violence or criminal prosecutions. 
A number of NGOs and internet resources monitor what bloggers say on social media, the publications and activities of journalists and civic activists, appearances by actors and singers (both Ukrainian and Russian), television broadcasts, films and peaceful gatherings. The result of this “monitoring” is usually an appeal to state bodies such as the SBU, the Interior Ministry, the Ministry of Information (the “Ministry of Truth” as it is called by many journalists), National Council for Television and Radio, State Film Agency, demanding that criminal charges be brought against certain people, that broadcast of certain television programmes or films be prohibited, that television broadcast licences be revoked. 
One example is the Vidsich page in social media, and the activity of the “Citizens’ Council” of the State Film Agency, in response to whose submissions a number of Ukrainian and Russian television programmes were not allowed to be shown. In many instances, state bodies actually bring criminal charges against journalists (the case against Ruslan Kotsaba was brought on the basis of a denunciation of an informer) and they prohibit certain films. The April 2016 ban on broadcasting the cult 1970s Soviet film Garage is symptomatic of this practice . rian_02928582.lr_.ru_1_0.jpg 4 September: the Kyiv headquarters of Inter TV, a major Ukrainian broadcaster, suffers an arson attack. (Ń) RIA Novosti. In other incidents, ultra-right activists, openly racist and Nazi (such as Azov) formations have themselves attacked television stations such as Ukraina and Inter, social protests, anti-war meetings, meetings with left wing and antifascist banners and symbols, actions of the LGBT community . As a rule, these attacks take place with the police passively standing by. 
During these attacks on mass media outlets, the attackers demand changes to their editorial policy and the portrayal of events in Ukraine according to their “patriotic” point of view only. As a result of this pressure, attacks and criminal prosecutions citizens refrain from stating their views in public and the mass media censors itself. 
The initiators of campaigns against dissent are typically the representatives of ultra-right formations, as well as those civic activists who previously presented themselves and currently do so as people with a liberal and democratic outlook. However, these campaigns succeed primarily as a result of either the support or the inactivity of state institutions. 
In essence, a mechanism has been created in post-Maidan Ukraine to control citizens expressing their thoughts and opinions 
Apart from that, state bodies also take an active role in restricting civil rights. The Verkhovna rada has adopted a set of such laws. In particular, changes have been made to Ukraine’s Criminal Code that permit the prosecution of people who oppose conscription and those who call for a halt to military operations, or “for opposing the Ukrainian army”. The 2015 law on “decommunisation” established the basis for banning a number of political parties and prosecuting citizens who hold left-wing views. 
During 2014-2015, Ukraine’s parliament introduced changes to existing articles and introduced new ones in the special section of the Criminal Code “Crimes against national security” — Articles 109, 110, 110-2, 111, 112, 113, 114 and 114-1. According to these norms, any actions, public calls or the circulation of materials advocating the fall of the existing order are crimes that incur prison sentences of up to 15 years. In today’s judicial proceedings, the state prosecutor interprets these legal norms in such a way as to treat any approval of the Soviet experience or speaking out against the violation of civic and social rights in Ukraine, sympathy for a federal system of government or criticism of the general military mobilisation (normal things in democratic countries) as grave crimes, up to and including “state treason”. 
In essence, a mechanism has been created in post-Maidan Ukraine to control citizens expressing their thoughts and opinions, as well as a mechanism to suppress freedom of speech, expression, assembly and association. This is a combined mechanism made up of cycles of action by state and non-state bodies. 
Today, at the end of 2016, this mechanism is not all encompassing, but it already bears the marks of totalitarianism. Much in accordance with the classical works of Hannah Arendt’s The Origins of Totalitarianism and of Karl Popper’s The Open Society. 
To control everything 
The numerous investigators of totalitarianism didn’t agree on a common definition. That why it’s worth identifying what the classical works share in common. 
Thus, totalitarianism is a system of social relations that establishes full (total) control over the important aspects of people’s lives. Above all, over the social and political aspects. Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski in Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy (1956) declined to give an abstract definition of the term and proposed instead an empirical approach on the basis of the practice of fascist Italy (where this term originated), Nazi Germany and the USSR. In their treatment, totalitarianism was not so much full control over a person’s activity (which is impossible in principle) as the absence to any limits to such control. 
Only social movements, movements of citizens who have become conscious of their social interests, can destroy the movement of mass men united around “a single way of thinking” 
The subject of control: Arendt distinguishes between the totalitarian state and the totalitarian movement. Until the time a totalitarian movement leads to a totalitarian state, it will attempt to control the activity of the citizenry. For example, with the help of people in black shirts and brown shirts. On the other hand, the state apparatus (its special services, censors) will not be able to completely control the citizenry without the assistance of formally non-state actors: Party committees, Komsomol or Hitler Youth and especially police informers. The latter are the most important mechanism of control because they allow the state “to listen in on everyone”. Therefore, the subject of total control over society is not the state alone but also the totalitarian movements. 
According to Arendt totalitarian movements and states have in common the conception of an objective enemy. Totalitarianism can hardly exist without such a conception. After all, it must explain to the popular masses the reasons why it needs to restrict their civic rights and why they must endure total control: 
The introduction of the notion of “objective enemy” is much more decisive for the functioning of totalitarian regimes than the ideological definition of the respective categories. If it were only a matter of hating Jews or bourgeois, the totalitarian regimes could, after the commission of one gigantic crime, return, as it were, to the rules of normal life and government. As we know, the opposite is the case. The category of objective enemies outlives the first ideologically determined foes of the movement; new objective enemies are discovered according to changing circumstances. 
Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism 
There already exists in contemporary Ukraine a functioning mechanism of control over the expression of people’s views and their social and political activity. It lies in uncovering treason (the meme that became widespread here over the past two years) and by neutralising treason through criminal prosecution, violence, campaigns of persecution in social media and mass media, by establishing “a single way of thinking” through propaganda and newspeak. 
The most important element in this mechanism is self restraint or self censorship. When one part of society accepts the argument that it is necessary to restrict their civil rights and indeed the rights of all citizens for the sake of “victory” over the enemy, the objective enemy. 
Erich Fromm called this process a flight from freedom. 
War as the basis for totalitarian tendencies 
The empirical evidence shows us that totalitarianism was not introduced from outside the three model countries (fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the USSR) or in opposition to their internal political processes. It was a domestic product. However, not every country in which such tendencies appear in the form of totalitarian movements necessarily become totalitarian states. Nor can we say that the totalitarian tendencies appeared in Ukraine as a result of someone’s evil intent, say Putin’s or Poroshenko’s, because these tendencies are the result of social and political processes in the specific conditions of war. And for now there is no basis to claim that we will surely fall into the abyss of totalitarianism. 
But there are evident totalitarian tendencies in Ukraine today. And they have appeared as a result of societal processes, in the first instance as a result of the war. 
The general condition for the emergence of totalitarian tendencies and their consolidation is that objective enemy. And this enemy becomes recognised and felt by everyone precisely during a war. It was no accident that German Nazism grew out of the traumatic experience of the First World War. 
The war in the east has become the main argument for justifiying control over citizens’ expressions of their views and their actions. August 2016: Ukrainian soldiers play table tennis at a damaged swimming pool in the village of Marinka, near Donetsk. (c) Max Black AP/Press Association Images. 
The division of people between “us” and “the enemies”, characteristic of a state of war, is a foundation for repressing those that “patriotic” movements place in the opposing camp. You can then remove their civil rights, or it may indeed be necessary to do so. Otherwise they might overwhelm you. 
Accordingly, the level of public discussion typical of a democratic and pluralistic society is significantly depressed in a society experiencing totalitarian tendencies. The only argument typically appearing during such a discussion is naming (slandering) one’s opponent as “an agent of the enemy”. After that any other argument is useless. That is, even discussion itself isn’t becomes superfluous. 
In our particular situation such a “discussion” has descended into a caricature. For example, after the tragic events of 31 August 2015 in front of the parliament when representatives of the government and the far right Svoboda party started calling each other “agents of the Kremlin”. 
Something really has happened to us — Ukraine has changed after the last Maidan 
War is a self sufficient condition for a totalitarian mentality to be formed, or even a necessity. An end to war means the loss of the justification and the arguments in favour of control and prohibitions. And it therefore constitutes a danger to the very existence of these totalitarian movements. 
These are all elements in the construction of the mass man according to Arendt. In fact, a totalitarian society is composed of such mass men. 
Dynamic balance 
Is it right to talk about signs and tendencies of totalitarianism in post-Maidan Ukraine? And how important is it to dwell on them, to emphasise them? 
It is important that these tendencies are not ignored. After all, not every country where such totalitarian tendencies and movements have appeared went on to become a totalitarian state. 
The two fundamental factors of totalitarian practice today in Ukraine — the state apparatus and ultra right movements — are in a dynamic balance. Complementing and at the same time combating one another, they have occupied their place on the political terrain of this country for two and a half years now in an attempt to control civil society. 
Apart from that there is no other important feature characteristic of all classical totalitarian states. There is neither authoritarianism , nor a supreme leader. 
But this balance can be upset at any time. 
In what direction it moves – towards totalitarianism or democracy – depends on how social processes unfold in Ukraine. Only social movements, movements of citizens who have become conscious of their social interests, can destroy the movement of mass men united around “a single way of thinking” for the sake of “victory over the objective enemy” and total control over oneself and one’s fellow citizens.",0

18493,"Comment on 15 Plants & Herbs That Can Boost Lung Health, Heal Respiratory Infections & Repair Pulmonary Damage by Why Not News 15 Plants & Herbs That Can Boost Lung Health, Heal Respiratory Infections & Repair Pulmonary Damage - Why Not News","Share on Facebook Share on Twitter When it comes to taking herbs for medicinal purposes, it seems the mainstream belief is that they are not as effective and not worth taking. While the effectiveness of herbs has not been studied deeply to determine how well they work across the entire population, the same could be said for most pharmaceutical drugs. Much of the time, pharmaceutical drugs attempt to mimic a compound that occurs in nature (herbs), but often bring the risk of side effects in the process. advertisement - learn more Safety is one of the most critical areas of review amongst herbs and drugs. According to stats released by the American Association of Poison Control Centers, no deaths have been reported due to the use and consumption of herbs. [4] However, pharmaceutical drugs and physician prescribed medications kill approximately one million Americans each year. While it is important to note that herbal medicines can be lethal in extreme doses, it appears their safety is much greater than that of pharmaceutical drugs. [2] Interestingly, pharmaceutical drugs are actually adding to the world-wide issue of declining health due to their side effects and encouragement of viral resistance. Antibiotics in particular are adding to the wave of increased viral strength when it comes to certain infections. [3] Herbs, on the other hand, can be a useful tool in fighting infections that have turned into superbugs due to the overuse of antibiotics. It is always useful to perform as much research as possible, or as you see fit, when it comes to both pharmaceutical drugs and herbs prior to taking them. Just as we approach the use of herbs with skepticism, so too should we approach the use of any pharmaceutical drugs with the same discerning eye. Contrary to popular belief, our reluctance to use herbs in Western culture is not a result of their inefficacy. It is because pharmaceutical companies (and those who can benefit from the sale of pharmaceutical drugs) have done a great job of making them seem unsafe and inadequate. Herbs cannot be patented and owned, unlike synthetic drugs, which is why many pharma companies operate the way they do. Seek out the assistance of a naturopathic doctor, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, ayurveda practioner, or herbologist before you use herbs. Like any medical issue, each illness can have different root causes and it’s always important to understand them before relying on any treatment to solve the entire problem. 
Below is a list of herbs that can not only boost lung and respiratory health but can also repair it. Herb information is courtesy of John Summerly who is a nutritionist, herbologist, and homeopathic practitioner. advertisement - learn more 1. Licorice Root – Glycyrrhiza Glabra Licorice is one of the more widely consumed herbs in the world. In Traditional Chinese Medicine it occurs in more formulas than any other single herb because it is thought to harmonize the action of all other herbs. Licorice is very soothing and softens the mucous membranes of the throat and especially the lungs and stomach, and at the same time cleanses any inflamed mucous membrane that needs immune system support . It reduces the irritation in the throat and yet has an expectorant action. It is the saponins (detergent-like action) that loosen the phlegm in the respiratory tract so that the body can expel the mucus. Compounds within this root help relieve bronchial spasms and block the free radical cells that produce the inflammation and tightening of the airways. The compounds also have antibacterial and antiviral effects to them as well, which helps fight off viral and bacterial strains in the body that can cause lung infections. Glycrrhizins and flavonoids can even help prevent lung cancer cells from forming. For people with high blood pressure this should be taken with caution. 2. Coltsfoot – Tussilago Farfara Coltsfoot has been traditionally used by Native Americans for thousands of years to strengthen the lungs. It clears out excess mucus from the lungs and bronchial tubes. It also soothes the mucus membranes in the lungs and has been shown in research to assist with asthma, coughs, bronchitis, and other lung ailments. Coltsfoot is available in dried form for tea or as an alcohol extract known as a tincture. 3. Cannabis The toxic breakdown of therapeutic compounds in cannabis from burning the plant are totally avoided with vaporization. Extracting and inhaling cannabinoid essential oils of the unprocessed plant affords significant mitigation of irritation to the oral cavity that comes from smoking. Cannabis is perhaps one of the most effective anti-cancer plants in the world, shown in study after study to stimulate cannabinoid receptor activation in specific genes and mediate the anti-invasive effect of cannabinoids. Vaporizing cannabis allows the active ingredients to stimulate the body’s natural immune response and significantly reduces the ability of infections to spread. Vaporizing cannabis (especially with very high amounts of cannabinoids) opens up airways and sinuses, acting as a bronchodilator. It is even a proven method for treatment and reversal of asthma. 4. Osha Root – Ligusticum porteri Osha is an herb native to the Rocky Mountain area and has historically been used by the Native Americans for respiratory support. The roots of the plant contain camphor and other compounds which make it one of the best lung-support herbs in America. One of the main benefits of osha root is that it helps increase circulation to the lungs, which makes it easier to take deep breaths. Also, when seasonal sensitivities flare up your sinuses, osha root, which is not an actual antihistamine, produces a similar effect and may help calm respiratory irritation. 5. Thyme – Thymus Thyme is very powerful in the fight against chest congestion. It produces powerful antiseptic essential oils which are classified as naturally antibiotic and anti-fungal. Thyme is well known to zap acne more so than expensive prescription creams, gels, and lotions. Thyme tea has the power to chase away and eliminate bacteria and viruses, so whether your infection is based on one or the other, it will still work. Thyme has been used as a lung remedy since antiquity and is used extensively today to prevent and treat respiratory tract infections and bacterial infection pneumonia. 6. Oregano Although oregano contains the vitamins and nutrients required by the immune system, its primary benefits are owed to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that have direct, positive benefits on the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow. Oil of oregano fights off the dangerous bacteria Staphylococcus aureus better than the most common antibiotic treatments. Oregano has so many health benefits that a bottle of organic oregano oil should be in everyone’s medicine cabinet. 7. Lobelia Inflata Did you know that horses given lobelia are able to breathe more deeply? Its benefits are not limited to equestrians. It has been used as an “asthmador” in Appalachian folk medicine. Lobelia, by some accounts, is thought to be one of the most valuable herbal remedies in existence. Extracts of Lobelia Inflata contain lobeline, which showed positive effects in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Lobelia contains an alkaloid known as lobeline, which thins mucus and breaks up congestion. Additionally, lobelia stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine; in effect, this relaxes the airways and allows for easier breathing. Also, because lobelia helps to relax smooth muscles, it is included in many cough and cold remedies. Lobelia should be part of everyone’s respiratory support protocol! *Use with caution as too much can cause side effects. 8. Elecampane – Inula Helenium Elecampane has been used by Native Americans for many years to clear out excess mucus that impairs lung function. It is known as a natural antibacterial agent for the lungs, helping to lessen infection, particularly for people who are prone to lung infections like bronchitis. Herbal practitioners often recommend one teaspoon of the herb per cup of boiling water, drunk three times daily for two to three weeks. Elecampane is also available in tincture format for ease. 9. Eucalyptus – Eucalyptus Globulus Native to Australia, eucalyptus isn’t just for Koala bears! Aborigines, Germans, and Americans have all used the refreshing aroma of eucalyptus to promote respiratory health and soothe throat irritation. Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups and its effectiveness is due to a compound called cineole. Cineole has numerous benefits — it’s an expectorant, can ease a cough, fights congestion, and soothes irritated sinus passages. As an added bonus, because eucalyptus contains antioxidants, it supports the immune system during a cold or other illness. 10. Mullein – Verbascum Thapsus Both the flowers and the leaves of the mullein plant are used to make an herbal extract that helps strengthen the lungs. Mullein is used by herbal practitioners to clear excess mucus from the lungs, cleanse the bronchial tubes, and reduce inflammation that is present in the respiratory tract. A tea can be made from one teaspoon of the dried herb to one cup of boiled water. Alternatively, you can take a tincture form of this herb. 11. Lungwort – Pulmonaria officinalis As early as the 1600’s, lungwort has been used to promote lung and respiratory health and clear congestion. Pulmonaria selections come in all kinds so seek a herbologist for direction. Lungwort also contains compounds that are powerfully effective against harmful organisms that affect respiratory health. 12. Chaparral Chaparral, a plant native to the Southwest, has been appreciated by the Native Americans for lung detoxification and respiratory support for many years. Chaparral contains powerful antioxidants that resist irritation, and NDGA, which is known to fight histamine response. NDGA inhibits aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis (the energy-producing ability) of cancer cells. Chaparral is also an herb that fights harmful organisms. The benefits of chaparral are mostly available in a tincture extraction but chaparral tea may support respiratory problems by encouraging an expectorant action to clear airways of mucus. [Source] 13. Sage – Salvia Officinalis Sage’s textured leaves give off a heady aroma, which arises from sage’s essential oils. These oils are the source of the many benefits of sage tea for lung problems and common respiratory ailments. Sage tea is a traditional treatment for sore throats and coughs. The rich aromatic properties arising from sage’s volatile oils of thujone, camphor, terpene, and salvene can be put to use by inhaling sage tea’s vapors to dispel lung disorders and sinusitis. Alternatively, brew a strong pot of sage tea and place it into a bowl or vaporizer. 14. Peppermint – Mentha × Piperita Peppermint and peppermint oil contains menthol — a soothing ingredient known to relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract and promote free breathing. Dried peppermint typically contains menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthofuran, and cineol. Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene, and pinene. Paired with the antihistamine effect of peppermint, menthol is a fantastic decongestant. Many people use therapeutic chest balms and other inhalants that contain menthol to help break up congestion. Additionally, peppermint is an antioxidant and fights harmful organisms. 15. Plantain herb – Plantago major and P. lanceolata Plantain leaf has been used for hundreds of years to ease coughs and soothe irritated mucous membranes. Many of its active constituents show antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, as well as being anti-inflammatory and antitoxic. Clinical trials have found it favorable against cough, cold, and lung irritation. Plantain leaf has an added bonus in that it may help relieve a dry cough by spawning mucus production in the lungs.

18494,Huffington Post: ’Could It Be Time to Deny White Men the Franchise?’,"The South African edition of left wing media site The Huffington Post has published an opinion piece accusing white men of being a retrograde force in politics and calling for the vote to be withdrawn from the racial gender group as a means to advance the “progressive cause”. [Writing on the potential to run down the political and social influence of “toxic white males” by withdrawing their right to the ballot, Huffington Post contributor Shelley Garland  —   who describes herself as an “activist and a feminist” student who is “working on ways to smash the patriarchy”  —  says the change only need be enacted for 20 to 30 years or so. This period would “go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and   ideology in the world”.  Blaming white males for “Some of the biggest blows to the progressive cause in the past year” including Brexit and the election of President Donald Trump, Garland’s apparently serious piece claimed just a couple of decades of white men being excluded from elections could see such progressive leaps forward as the collapse of Western law and capitalism, and a massive redistribution of wealth from “toxic white masculinity” through “expropriation of these various assets”. Among the charges laid at the feet of white males by the author are the 2008 recession, and “500 years colonialism, slavery, and various aggressive wars and genocides”.

Social media users also speculated on the likelihood of Shelley Garland merely being a pseudonym, with some pointing out her lack of presence on the internet besides The Huffington Post.

18495,Comment on ‘I won’t stop until I’m too fat to move’: Morbidly obese model who dreams of weighing 1000lbs by welcometoskaamoog,"Posted on September 7, 2016 by DCG | 53 Comments 
Liberals would probably tell you to not “body shame” her. I say this woman needs serious medical and mental treatment. 
From Daily Mail : An obese model who is paid by men to eat wants to pile on a further 300lbs to become the world’s fattest woman and be completely immobile. Monica Riley, 27, from Fort Worth, Texas, already tips the scales at 700lb but dreams of being too fat to move and is working towards hitting 1,000lb so that she feels like a ‘queen’. 
Her feeder boyfriend Sid Riley, 25, whose surname she has taken despite not being married, spends his days cooking Monica meals and even feeding her 3,500 calorie shakes lavished with double cream through a funnel . He then rolls her over when her 91-inch stomach is full. 
Among the things Monica – a model on Super Sized Big Beautiful Woman websites – is looking forward to being immobile and getting a bed with a built-in toilet which Sid will need to empty. 
Monica said: ‘The plan is to reach 1000 lbs and become immobile. I would feel like a queen because Sid would be waiting on me hand and foot and he’s excited about it too. 
‘ It’s a sexual fantasy for us and we talk about it a lot. He already has to help me get off the sofa and get me out of bed. If I lay down after a big dinner he has to help me roll over because my belly is too full for me to roll – it’s a big turn-on for both of us .’ 
Despite their controversial plans, the Monica and Sid are trying for a baby and have endured two miscarriages so far. She said: ‘We do plan to have children – there’s nothing to stop me raising a child from my bedroom . We would get a nanny in to help around the house and take the baby out and about. There’s nothing to stop us raising a child. Some people might think it’s selfish but I’m confident we would be good parents.’ 
Monica had been overweight all of her life and just two years ago she was preparing for bariatric surgery after an ex-boyfriend urged her to shed the pounds. But at the last minute she pulled out of the operation and decided to embrace her figure instead. 
And since meeting average-built Sid online four months ago, Monica has gained almost 55 lbs by gorging on 8,000 calories every day. 
Monica said: ‘ The bigger I get the sexier I feel. I love my big soft belly and stuffing myself with food really turns me on . Sid loves to cook for me and hand-feed me and I’ve achieved so much since we got together . He feeds me around the clock and I never have to get up to do anything.’ 
On an average day, Monica will eat six biscuits, six sausages in a bread roll, a big bowl of sugary cereal, two weight gain shakes, four McChicken sandwiches, four double cheeseburgers, a large portion of French fries, 30 chicken nuggets, macaroni cheese, Taco Bell treats and a gallon of ice cream. 
Monica hopes to get to a size where she will be unable to do anything for herself – requiring Sid to clean her, feed her and change her – by the time she is 32. 
The couple have run into criticism for their intentions, especially from Monica’s mother Terri, but they won’t be deterred in their efforts. Monica said: ‘My mom doesn’t understand it at all and she says I’m killing myself. ‘I understand her concerns but it’s my life and gaining weight makes me happy. I do worry a little bit about losing my independence but I know Sid loves taking care of me and would never let me suffer. ‘ 
Sid, who is 6ft 2in and 220 lbs, is also defensive against any criticism and insists he is simply helping Monica achieve her dreams . Sid said: ‘There is a misconception that feederism and immobility is about control but that’s not the case. If Monica wanted to stop I would accept her decision without question. I wouldn’t see caring for Monica as a chore at all. I love her and I love doing things for her – caring for her would be a dream come true.’ 
To assist Monica with her weight-gain, Sid prepares a special shake for her to drink through a funnel. The shake consists of ten Pop Tarts, heavy-duty cream, ice cream, milk and weight-gain power, totalling 3,500 calories. 
Monica said: ‘The funnel feeding is what I really look forward to. I find it to be a very sexual experience and I know Sid likes it too. I have 20,000 online fans and they love to watch the funnel feeding – it’s a big hit.’ 
And regardless of the health risks of being morbidly obese, Monica and Sid are charging full steam ahead with their mammoth quest. 
Monica said: ‘I could get hit by a car tomorrow and my life would be over. At least if I die this way I will have lived out the life I wanted and fulfilled all of my dreams.’

18496,J Scott Armstrong: Fewer Than 1 Percent Of Papers in Scientific Journals Follow Scientific Method - Breitbart,"Fewer than 1 percent of papers published in scientific journals follow the scientific method, according to research by Wharton School professor and forecasting expert J. Scott Armstrong. [Professor Armstrong, who   the   Journal of Forecasting in 1982 and the International Journal of Forecasting in 1985, made the claim in a presentation about what he considers to be “alarmism” from forecasters over   climate change.  “We also go through journals and rate how well they conform to the scientific method. I used to think that maybe 10 percent of papers in my field   …     were maybe useful. Now it looks like maybe, one tenth of one percent follow the scientific method” said Armstrong in his presentation, which can be watched in full below. “People just don’t do it. ” Armstrong defined eight criteria for compliance with the scientific method, including full disclosure of methods, data, and other reliable information, conclusions that are consistent with the evidence, valid and simple methods, and valid and reliable data.  According to Armstrong, very little of the forecasting in climate change debate adheres to these criteria. “For example, for disclosure, we were working on polar bear [population] forecasts, and we were asked to review the government’s polar bear forecast. We asked, ‘could you send us the data’ and they said ‘No’  …     So we had to do it without knowing what the data were. ” According to Armstrong, forecasts from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) violate all eight criteria. “Why is this all happening? Nobody asks them!” said Armstrong, who says that people who submit papers to journals are not required to follow the scientific method. “You send something to a journal and they don’t tell you what you have to do. They don’t say ‘here’s what science is, here’s how to do it. ’” Digging deeper into their motivations, Armstrong pointed to the wealth of incentives for publishing papers with politically convenient rather than scientific conclusions. “They’re rewarded for doing   research. One of my favourite examples is testing statistical significance  —   that’s invalid. It’s been over 100 years we’ve been fighting the fight against that. Even its inventor thought it wasn’t going to amount to anything. You can be rewarded then, for following an invalid [method]. ” “They cheat. If you don’t get statistically significant results, then you throw out variables, add variables, [and] eventually you get what you want. ” “My big thing is advocacy. People are asked to come up with certain answers, and in our whole field that’s been a general movement ever since I’ve been here, and it just gets worse every year. And the reason is funded research. ” “I’ve [gone through] my whole career, with lots of publications, and I’ve never gotten a research grant. And I’m proud of that now. ” Armstrong concluded his talk by arguing that scientific evidence should be required for all climate regulations.

18497,Native Americans March Against Trump’s Pipeline ’Fast Tracking’,"PARK CITY, Utah  —   At the close of the Sundance Film Festival, those standing in solidarity with protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline met in Park City, Utah. [A protest was held this past week and Malia Obama, President Obama’s eldest daughter, was reportedly seen attending the protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline during the Sundance Film Festival, Breitbart News reported.  Dave John, a Tewa Navajo Indian, told Breitbart Texas President Trump has “  the signing of papers” for the pipelines.   John, the treasurer of the group that organized the event, answered an inquiry before the march as to whether he thought the event would be peaceful. He answered by saying that those in Morton County at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation have flash grenades, bean bags, and rubber bullets. The Native American charged there was “good   by the mainstream media in the area and they had lied about what was happening at Standing Rock. The reporting was influenced by the “Sheriff’s Department,” he said. John explained he was there with others gathered “fighting for water mostly,” and they wanted to bring awareness to the issue. Those marching held signs that said “Water is Life,” “Water is Sacred,” “People Over Profits,” “When You Poison Water the Little Babies Die, and “I Stand With Standing Rock. ” The organizers of the event, (P. A. N. D. O. S. an acroynm for Peaceful Advocates for Native Dialogue and Organizing Support) said they were showing support for “the brave water protectors at Standing Rock. ” Carl Moore, a Native American, said they were there to support not only those at Standing Rock, but people in Arizona and “all over. ” He asked folks gathered to pray for those who are protesting in the freezing cold at Standing Rock and are “threatened every day. ” He said it is so “discouraging [for the protesters] when they see those lights out there working. ” Moore was also critical of the media saying, the “media has left them behind,” “forgotten about them. ” He said the word has gotten out by “social media” and “people who care. ” Moore said “We have our country that has been taken over,” but added “we have a renewal. ” The event was promoted on the group’s official Facebook page as “Prayerful Resistance for Standing Rock,” and the event and march was a peaceful, prayerful gathering. Law enforcement officials from Park City were present at the event. “Dee,” a Park City, Utah resident, told Breitbart Texas she was there because she loved beauty and said, “Clean air and clean water used to not be political. ” She continued, “I do not think that there is anything political about oil into waterways, and yes, pipelines break all the time. ” Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

18498,The Island of Happiness in the Sea of Suffering,"0 
The question may have occured to many of us: 
”Why do we need to suffer so much in our life, why is there so much suffering on Earth?” 
As if the whole world has conspired against us, almost everything causes suffering to us. We suffer when we are ill, we suffer when things do not work out the way we like or plan. We suffer when we have lost something, we have lost our money or we are left by a loved person. We suffer when we are not loved, not appreciated, when our performance is underestimated. We suffer when we see our loved ones suffer and we are unable to alleviate their suffering. We could go on a loing way, continuing the list of things causing us suffering. On the other hand, there is so little joy in our life. 
What sense does all this suffering have? Does it have a meaning at all? Or is it just a bad joke of an evil Universe? Our Own Heaven 
Let us imagine a life free of any kind of suffering. It is easy to imagine a life in which we do not suffer, where we are healthy, everything we do is successful, when all our wishes are fulfilled, everybody loves and respects us whoever we meet. In this private heaven of ours we could be happy. 
But there are 7 billion other people on Earth, who share the Earth with us. Would they also be happy in our imagined heaven? Would they also escape suffering? 
We cannot be fully certain about it, as in our isolated existence we are not sure, only guess what makes other people happy. In our isolated state we always use our own experience as a starting point, and assume that what is good for us must be good for others as well, and others suffer from the same thing we suffer from. Extending this logic makes us believe that once we no longer suffer, other people will also have a good time in our imagined heaven. 
The reality is, however, that the earthly heaven we imagine, and which is free of suffering for us, would cause a lot of suffering for a lot of other people, and would be even a real hell for many. 
The seven billion people living on Earth today would create seven billion different and separate earthly heavens if they had a chance to do so. They are in an isolated state of consciousness, and though there would quite a lot of similar heavens, they would still be different. 
A common feature of all these heavens would be, however, that suffering would be present in every one of them. The Deeper Sense of Suffering 
We must conclude therefore that suffering–no matter how much we would like to avoid it–is a part of the life of every single human being. When we are suffering, we never say that ”my body is suffering,” but we say that ”I am suffering” or ”my heart is broken with sorrow.” Suffering is ours, because we ourselves are the suffering itself. And we suffer because we identify with the suffering . 
Our daily sufferings point out to us that suffering us such is the result from our turning away from the Miracle and our identification with the separate state of consciousness. 
It is only possible to understand all this when the intensity of our identification with the body and the psychological Self is weakened a little bit, and we are–even only for brief periods–able to step out of the small prison of our thoughts and mind, and enter the endless space of the Consciousness. 
Suffering in that sense is the wake-up call that prevents Consciousness from finally sinking into the dream of separatedness. Suffering is what actually stops us from finally and irrevocably identify with a body and a personal identity. 
When we place our sufferings in the light of Consciousness , we no longer try to run away from them in despair, and no longer dream of a heaven free of suffering. We are now aware that oure sufferings are in fact our helpers and they may accelerate the process through which the Consciousness wakes up in the body we formerly and mistakenly considered our own.

18500,"10 Engaging Proposals, From the Rooftop to the Subway - The New York Times","“Will you marry me?” Hundreds of thousands of potential grooms and brides pop that question every year, and yet the logistics of delivering that momentous phrase  —   where to do it, when to do it and how much of a surprise should it be  —   remains among the most important decisions anyone planning on getting married has to make. Some of the couples whose wedding announcements were featured in the pages of The New York Times this past year, or whose weddings The Times learned about, got engaged in unusual spots  —   from a Manhattan rooftop to a subway construction site below the city’s streets  —   and one proposal even involved seeking advice from President Obama. And, of course, at least several can now be found on YouTube. Here are 10 of our most engaging stories of the year. Mr. Litman, who first began dating Ms. Michelis in the eighth grade at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, proposed in November 2015 in Montauk, N. Y. the entire scene captured by a drone hovering above on an unusually warm   day at the beach. With waves rushing the shore and the Montauk Point Lighthouse in the distance, Ms. Michelis can be seen from a windblown aerial view playfully running beneath the drone before turning back to Mr. Litman. As she runs closer, he drops to his knee, engagement ring in hand. Momentarily shocked at the sight, she drops her purse as he asks her to marry him, and the two then fall into each other’s arms. “The first thing that came to my mind was, I can’t wait to show it to our kids,” Ms. Michelis said. They were married Oct. 8. The couple first met in fall 2011 while working on the digital team for Mr. Obama’s   campaign. After the president’s victory, Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director of Organizing for Action, the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for Mr. Obama. In 2015, Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during the Organizing for Action Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June, Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president, and told him that he was bent on proposing (which he would do three months later). “You got a rock picked out and all that?” he recalled Mr. Obama asking. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice. Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and who understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. Wilson’s best friend, the president responded, “I think that’s the right strategy, but you’ve got to swear her to secrecy. ” The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. Wilson’s best friend, he pulled her aside. “I told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States,” he said. Mission accomplished. Mr. Fallsgraff and Ms. Wilson were married July 3. The couple, who met in June 2015 through a dating app called the League, went to Paris six months later for a New Year’s celebration. While at a restaurant there, Mr. Purcell ordered a bottle of Champagne for what he thought was 110 euros, the equivalent of about $119. But when the bill arrived after dinner, he realized he had mistakenly ordered a bottle of vintage Champagne  —   the 2003 Dom Pérignon Rosé  —   at a cost of 1, 100 euros, a total at the time of roughly $1, 195. In May, Mr. Purcell invited Ms. Bui to the rooftop of his apartment building in San Francisco to enjoy the unobstructed   view that included the Golden Gate Bridge. As they took in the view, Mr. Purcell surprised Ms. Bui by breaking out an expensive bottle of the same vintage Champagne he had mistakenly bought in Paris. It was all a part of a special occasion, he told her, and then he surprised her again, this time with an engagement ring. They were married Nov. 26. The couple, who met in 2007 while they were working for the New York City Department of City Planning, became engaged in May 2014, when Mr. Meagher proposed while they were on a tour of the construction site of the 86th Street station, part of the Second Avenue subway. The tour, conducted below street level, included residents who live near the new subway line as well as officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “We’re both passionate about cities and infrastructure,” Mr. Meagher said. And about each other, as the group learned when Mr. Meagher, wearing a hard hat and an orange safety vest, got down on one knee and asked Ms. Grossman, who was wearing the same gear, to marry him. Gasps, then applause, broke out among the tour group, as well as from the bride’s parents, who had also shown up for the occasion. They were married Jan. 9. The couple met in August 2014 during a performance of the Broadway musical “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder. ” Mr. Fogelman, who was there alone, tried to move to an empty seat next to Ms. Phillips to get a better view of the stage. “Not in the middle of a song,” said Ms. Phillips, who was there with a friend. Mr. Fogelman waited until after the song to switch seats, and at intermission, he apologized profusely to her for his poor theater etiquette. She forgave him, he sat down next to her, and they began talking. They were soon dating, and in August 2015, while sitting in those same seats, Mr. Fogelman turned to Ms. Phillips at intermission and proposed. “It turned out to be a wonderful   at the theater,” Ms. Phillips said, “one that I will never forget. ” They were married Sept. 4. Mr. Whelden, a plumber in Boston who sings with two professional   touring a cappella groups (Five O’Clock Shadow and Overboard) proposed during his performance at a New Year’s Eve concert in Rockport, Mass. The crowd roared when he sang “Fall in Love,” a song he wrote for his future bride that included the words “will you marry me. ” “It was the most amazing, romantic proposal I could’ve ever imagined,” Ms. Delaney said. They were married May 7. The couple, who were both living in Park Slope, Brooklyn, met through OkCupid in early 2011. They immediately became a couple. In July 2015, they moved into a   together in Bay Ridge. On their first day in the new place, Ms. Roth put in motion her proposal while Ms. Marini was at work. She was hiding when Ms. Marini returned, and watched her follow a path of lighted candles to a makeshift bed where Chinese food boxes had been placed across the floor, leading to a smaller box. (“Melina had always idealized the movie trope of people moving into a new apartment that’s not yet furnished, and having to eat Chinese food on the floor, ” Ms. Roth explained.) When Ms. Marini opened the smaller box, which contained an engagement ring, she started sobbing. Along with the ring was a note that said: “Will you marry me? Check yes or no. ” Ms. Marini checked “yes,” and she and Ms. Roth, who came out of hiding, cried in each other’s arms. “I’m not the type of person who wants to see ‘Will you marry me?’ splashed across a Jumbotron,” Ms. Marini said. “This was much more intimate to me, and much more meaningful. ” They were married Aug. 6. The couple met on March 11, 2005, while shooting pool in what Ms. Powell described as a dim, smoky bar on Avenue B in Manhattan. They shared several beers, then a single kiss outside the bar. Mr. Albertson, 23 at the time, was beyond taken with her, but Ms. Powell, then 20, was not quite ready for a serious relationship. They settled on becoming friends. Ms. Powell eventually married another man, and fell out of touch with Mr. Albertson. By May 2014, however, Ms. Powell was divorced and dating Mr. Albertson, often telling him that the word “marriage” now frightened her. On March 11, 2015, 10 years to the day they met, they were back on Avenue B and heading into that same dim, smoky bar when Ms. Powell looked down and saw a huge chalk mark indicating the spot where she had first kissed him. She turned to find him down on one knee, holding her engagement ring. “I was freaking out,” she said. “I just started crying and hugging him. ” He proposed but managed to avoid scaring her by leaving out the word “marriage. ” “I was wondering,” he said, “if you wanted to hang out with me forever. ” They were married March 11. Mr. Turke, who proposed in February, chose to give his future bride a full day of   bliss, rather than a single moment of happiness. An hour after he sneaked out of their apartment at 6 a. m. he called her with instructions to go into their kitchen, where she found a huge bouquet of white lilies with several notes that he had left for her, including one that read, “Today is the day that we get engaged,” and another that read, “Enjoy the moments ahead of you, have fun and say ‘yes. ’” What ensued was a dizzying series of events that first took Ms. Helmling to the NoMad Hotel in Manhattan, where she found her three best friends waiting at a breakfast table. A waiter then gave them a note with instructions to walk across the street to a spa, where they each enjoyed Champagne and a massage before being whisked away for manicures and pedicures. Later in the day, Ms. Helmling was chauffeured over the George Washington Bridge to a small park in New Jersey overlooking the Hudson River  —   the spot where Mr. Turke had first asked her out in September 2013. “When she arrived, we hugged and cried and she told me all about her day,” said Mr. Turke, who also presented a slide show that included every photo that had both of them in it, arranged in chronological order as a way of telling their story. Then he proposed, and Ms. Helmling cried some more. They were married Nov. 13. The couple met online in 2008. At the time, Mr. Stucky was living in Somerville, Mass. and going through a divorce. They were soon dating, but their relationship began to sputter. In the space of three years, each of them proposed to the other, and each was soundly rejected. In June 2014, Ms. Mathiowetz was partying with friends in New York when she consumed too many psychedelic mushrooms. The episode left her paralyzed for nearly six hours  —   and longing again for Mr. Stucky, whom she was no longer seeing. “I can’t believe I haven’t been telling you every day that I love you,” she called to tell him the moment she got back on her feet. Mr. Stucky was feeling much the same way, as he too had had a   experience, he said, a nightmare in which he was on his knees and looking up at a stranger who was telling him he had only 24 hours to live. Completely shaken, he awoke and began taking into account all the things in life that mattered most to him, and quickly realized that Ms. Mathiowetz was at the top of that list. Those shared experiences brought them back together, and in January 2015, Mr. Stucky proposed to Ms. Mathiowetz, for a second time, during a weekend trip at a    in Portsmouth, N. H. This time, she accepted. They were married June 11.",0
18501,Donald Trump’s Remarks Rattle NATO Allies and Stoke Debate on Cost Sharing - The New York Times,"LONDON  —   Donald J. Trump’s statement that the United States might not come to the defense of NATO allies that do not foot their share of the bill fueled anxiety on Thursday in a Europe that is already deeply unsettled about Russia’s assertive posture, Britain’s decision to withdraw from the European Union and the rise of   populist and nationalist parties. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump suggested that if elected president he would use a country’s level of military spending as a factor in deciding whether the United States would honor its commitment to defend any member nation that comes under attack. While President Obama and other American officials have also pressed European countries in recent years to increase military spending in line with their commitments to NATO, Mr. Trump more explicitly linked financial considerations to the strategic response he would order as president in the event of an attack by Russia. His comments left some European officials concerned that the United States under Mr. Trump would edge away from the security guarantees that Washington has provided to the Continent since World War II. But they also stoked the debate over cost sharing after years in which Europe had been slow to meet its commitments on military spending. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general and a former prime minister of Norway, said that he “will not interfere in the U. S. election campaign,” but made clear that he was alarmed by Mr. Trump’s remarks. “Solidarity among allies is a key value for NATO,” he said in a statement. “This is good for European security and good for U. S. security. We defend one another. We have seen this in Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of European, Canadian and   troops have stood shoulder to shoulder with U. S. soldiers. ” He added, “Two world wars have shown that peace in Europe is also important for the security of the United States. ” Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that set up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obliges any member of the alliance to come to the defense of another member if it comes under attack. The article has been invoked only once  —   after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. “They have an obligation to make payments,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. “Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they’re supposed to make. ” Asked whether the United States would come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  —   three Baltic states that were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and joined NATO in 2004  —   in the event of a Russian invasion, Mr. Trump replied, “I don’t want to tell you what I’d do because I don’t want Putin to know what I’d do,” referring to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, for whom Mr. Trump has expressed admiration. Reminded that NATO members are obligated by treaty to come to one another’s defense, Mr. Trump responded: “Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes. ” Asked on Thursday about Mr. Trump’s comments, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon of Britain snapped: “Article 5 is an absolute commitment. It doesn’t come with conditions or caveats. ” Less than two weeks ago, at a NATO summit meeting in Warsaw, Mr. Obama reassured America’s allies that “in good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States  —   always. ” Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, took to Twitter to emphasize that his country was one of only five NATO members to meet the target that it spend 2 percent of gross domestic product  —   a broad measure of economic activity  —   on military spending. (The others are the United States, Britain, Poland and Greece.) Mr. Ilves also noted that Estonia contributed troops to the fight in Afghanistan in keeping with Article 5. Artis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister of Latvia, which borders Russia and has stepped up military spending, wrote on Twitter: “If Trump doubts NATO solidarity in the case of Article 5, then his election is dangerous for Baltic security. ” Lithuania’s president, Dalia Grybauskaite, tried to calm her citizens. “Regardless of who becomes the next president of the U. S. we trust America,” she told reporters. “It has always defended nations under attack, and will do so in the future. ” Ms. Grybauskaite added: “Lithuania  —   as well as other Baltic states  —   is doing everything it can. We are modernizing our armed forces, we have reinstituted conscription and our defense spending will reach 2 percent of G. D. P. in 2018. I do not think interpretations of candidate Trump’s remarks are necessary. We know that the U. S. will remain our most important partner. ” In Russia, Mr. Trump’s comments met with approval. Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign relations committee of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, contrasted Mr. Trump with Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. “Clinton’s creed: strengthen the U. S.’s   alliances. Trump’s creed: respond only to real threats,” Mr. Pushkov wrote. “Aggressive banality versus common sense. ” NATO’s 28 members pledged at summit meetings in Wales in 2014 and in Warsaw this month to do more to meet the 2 percent of GDP spending target, and Mr. Stoltenberg has made reaching that goal a priority. Xenia Wickett, the head of the United States and Americas program at Chatham House, a foreign policy think tank based in London, said Mr. Trump was echoing  —   albeit in far less diplomatic terms  —   concerns raised by a succession of American secretaries of defense, including the three who have served Mr. Obama: Robert M. Gates, Leon E. Panetta and Ashton B. Carter. “The U. S. is no longer willing to cover the approximately 75 percent of the NATO budget that it currently does,” Ms. Wickett wrote in an email. “Trump takes it to the extreme, which is new, but the direction is not new. Trump wants to see a more ‘fair’ division of labor. ” She added, “Unfortunately, his way of expressing it is likely to aid our adversaries rather than assist the alliance. ” Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the head of the Paris office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization, said too much was being made of Mr. Trump’s remarks. She said the imbalance in NATO spending “is just not sustainable,” adding, “Trump is taking the   debate to extreme levels, by directly calling into question U. S. responsibility as a NATO member state to fulfill its obligations under Article 5, in case a NATO member state got attacked by Russia. ” She added that European leaders needed to persuade their citizens “of the importance of investing in defense to face current and future security challenges. ” But Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, said he feared that Mr. Trump’s remarks would embolden autocratic and aggressive powers. “There is certainly a risk that he will encourage states like Russia and China to take the risk that U. S. will not stand up for its allies and its commitments, and that could be extremely dangerous for global stability,” he said. “He’s downplaying not only the defense of common interests, but also the defense of common values. Democracy seems nearly to be a derogatory term for him. ”",0
18502,John Podesta: Donald Trump an ‘Existential Threat to the Entire Planet’ - Breitbart,"Former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta believes that Donald Trump has doomed the entire planet. [“Make no mistake, the Trump administration’s rampage against the environment presents an existential threat to the entire planet,” Podesta wrote in the Washington Post on Wednesday.  The former failed campaign manager, a passionate warrior for global warming, appeared distraught after Trump signed an executive order to ratchet back the   environmental regulations that choked businesses and job growth. Podesta appears unwilling to let go of the fact that Clinton lost the election, again citing the popular vote in 2016 as a reason to fight Trump’s agenda. “Winning the popular vote by nearly three million votes was not enough for Hillary Clinton to win the White House, but those votes nonetheless reflect the voices of a majority of Americans,” he said. He urged Americans to work against the administration’s environmental agenda. “As Americans, we need to do all we can to stop the Trump administration and Republican leaders in Congress from implementing the most   agenda in decades,” he said, adding that “resistance works. ”",0

Trump onstage, The Tampa Bay Times reported. The comic, who is in the middle of a global arena tour, is an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton. During her set at Amalie Arena, she invited a Trump supporter up to the stage to defend the candidate. “Do you get worried at all with how impulsive he is, that he gets so fired up from ‘Saturday Night Live’ doing a skit on him?” she asked. She also called Mr. Trump an “orange,      monster. ” Video of the performance shows audience members booing and walking out. Ms. Schumer encouraged security to throw out the hecklers. “It’s too important,” she said as members of the crowd grew restless. “So we’re going to spend five minutes talking about it. ” In a statement to Vanity Fair, Ms. Schumer wrote: “I want to thank the 8, 400 people who stayed. We have always depended on comedians to make us laugh and tell the truth. I am proud to continue that tradition. ” In her set, Ms. Schumer talked about gun violence and attending Mrs. Clinton’s birthday party, two subjects she has covered in previous shows.

18505,Bountiful Afghan Opium Harvest Yields Profits for the Taliban - The New York Times,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan  —   It is spring that determines how a year turns out, according to an Afghan proverb. And if the Helmand poppy fields this spring are any indication, the Taliban will have a very good year. As the opium harvest winds down across Helmand Province, Afghanistan’s largest in territory and poppy cultivation, farmers and officials are reporting high yields. The skies were generous with heavy rainfall, and the Afghan government with its cancellation of annual eradication campaigns. It had lost much of the territory in Helmand to the Taliban anyway. So it was with peace of mind that farmers, and thousands of seasonal laborers who had traveled to Helmand, scraped the gum from the opium bulbs. Taliban fighters were just around the corner to lend a hand  —   and to receive their share of wages and taxes, in cash or kind. The crowded fields amounted to an insurgent recruiter’s dream. “We are happy that we had a good harvest this year compared with previous years,” said Abdul Rahim Mutmain, a farmer in Musa Qala district. Mr. Mutmain said his modest plot saw a   increase in yield compared with 2015, which was plagued by crop failures and concerted government eradication. “There is no security concern for a single laborer being checked or robbed by the police,” Mr. Mutmain said. “The entire district is under Taliban control and the bulk of the harvesters are Taliban. ” He added, “Actually, this is the Taliban regime  —   you can take your narcotics anywhere or anytime you want to sell them. ” The United Nations, which has described the Taliban behavior “more like ‘godfathers’ than a ‘government in waiting,’ ” says the insurgency extracts a large share of its expenses from the narcotics trade, which the agency put at roughly $3 billion a year within Afghanistan. The story of just how deeply the Taliban are intertwined in the business even at the farm level can be told by the fluctuations in violence since last year’s poppy harvest. For much of the winter, the insurgents had the Afghan forces on the back foot in Helmand, inflicting heavy casualties, overrunning outposts and even entire districts. The fighting reached the gates of Lashkar Gah, the provincial capital, drawing American and British special operations forces into the combat. Then, just as harvesting began in late March and early April, officials reported a sudden dip in fighting. Despite the Taliban’s official launch of their annual offensive on April 12, with violence intensifying across other parts of the country, Helmand is still experiencing a relative lull as the last bulbs of poppy are scraped. The period of calm has allowed the Afghan Army in Helmand a rare breather to train and rebuild a force that took a bad beating last year. With men dying at alarming rates and outposts overrun easily, the 215th Afghan Army Corps was forced to abandon certain districts, bringing what remained of the troops to the headquarters for collective retraining. The   NATO mission in Afghanistan, which has officially shifted to a limited role of training and assisting the Afghan forces, has said that overall training lagged behind because of the relentless tempo of fighting last year. The army was forced to turn out raw recruits simply to fill the gap caused by casualties and desertion. Now, Afghan military officials and NATO advisers say they are trying to refocus on quality, better logistics and cooperation at the   level. During the monthlong harvest season in Helmand, the Taliban have better things to do than fight: They profit in multiple ways from the lush opium fields. Their fighters often lay down their weapons to work as day laborers, farmers say. They also collect the opium tax they impose on the local level, as well as stick around for the additional 10 percent Islamic tax on farm produce, called ushr. Those proceeds are supposed to go to the needy, but often end up going to the Taliban. Above all, the harvest season becomes a Taliban recruitment drive, with thousands of men coming in from all over the country who are already frustrated with their lack of job opportunities. “The poppy harvest is a good time for the Taliban to interact with new faces  —   best time for new recruitment,” said Bashir Ahmad Shakir, the head of security committee at the Helmand provincial council. Abdul Jabar Qahraman, the Afghan government’s representative in charge of the fighting in Helmand, said the Taliban were campaigning “ ” to recruit from the pool of 15, 000 laborers, mostly jobless young people, who arrived in Helmand for the harvest season. He said the government arrested some 700 of the laborers to disrupt the harvesting, but the men were released a few days later except for a small number suspected of being Taliban members. “The war in Afghanistan is not a war of ideology, it is a war of financial benefits,” Mr. Qahraman said. “The poppies support the Taliban financially,” he added. “The commanders of the Taliban stuff their pockets with cash. Once they receive the cash that makes their stomachs oily, they prepare themselves for fighting. ” But Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said opium cultivation was a regional and “traditional” issue that brings people the income they need for the rest of the year. “Poppy farming has nothing to do with us, and in such in an environment of conflict we cannot prevent it either,” Mr. Mujahid said. “It’s natural that in some areas the Taliban are residents of that area and have family needs, maybe for meeting those needs they may have participated in the harvesting. But it is not some formal work from our side. ” Consider Mr. Mutmain’s roughly four acres in Musa Qala district. This year, he said he collected about 88 pounds of raw opium, compared with about 30 pounds from six acres last year. Among the 25 laborers he hired for the 15 days of gum collection, Mr. Mutmain said 10 were active Taliban members who took a break to work the harvest. The rest were young men from other provinces, mostly neighboring areas. “You know, they become good friends with each other  —   they spend at least 12 or 15 days, which is enough time to build trust,” Mr. Mutmain said. The Taliban fighters recount “stories of bravery, how they manage to blow up armored vehicles” and overrun checkpoints. “Those kinds of tales really impress the newcomers, and some go to the battlefields with them and join,” Mr. Mutmain said. Since he lives quite a distance from his fields, Mr. Mutmain built makeshift huts for the workers to rest in during the afternoon and sleep in at night. He also hired a cook who served beans, chickpeas and the traditional southern yogurt drink, shrumbai. Soon after the harvesting was over, a Taliban tax collector arrived with a notepad and a witness, Mr. Mutmain said. Sometimes, the farmers need to line up the plastic bags of opium they have collected, each weighing about 10 pounds, for inspection. But most of the time, the Taliban take their word for it. “You either pay them in the current price, or in narcotics,” Mr. Mutmain said about the tax. He paid cash, the equivalent of $400. Mahatabuddin Khan, another farmer in Khanshin district, said he paid his taxes in kind. He had hired 15 people, five of them Taliban and the rest young men from northern districts of Helmand, to work on his two acres, which ultimately yielded about 35 pounds of opium. The tax collector arrived before the harvesting was even over. He estimated how much the plot in front of him would yield, and Mr. Khan paid just under two pounds in raw opium. “He had a notepad to write my name and the amount of narcotic collected from me,” Mr. Khan said of the collector. Many across Helmand fear a difficult year of fighting ahead, now that the insurgent machine is fueled with new cash and fresh fighters. “The Afghan military forces in Helmand are preparing to face the toughest summer season of fighting,” said Mr. Shakir, the provincial council member.",0

18510,Trump And Clinton Have Both Assembled An Army Of Lawyers To File Lawsuits And Contest The Election Results,"in: Politics , Special Interests What happens when you get thousands of lawyers involved in the craziest election in modern American history? Unfortunately, we may be about to find out. We all remember the legal tug of war between Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000, and with each passing day it is becoming more likely that we could see something similar (or even worse) in 2016. In a brand new article entitled “ Clinton, Trump Prepare for Possibility of Election Overtime “, Bloomberg discusses the armies of lawyers that Clinton and Trump are both assembling for this election. It would be nice if it was the American people that actually decided the outcome of this election, but if things are very close on November 8th it may come down to what the courts decide. Traditionally, there has been a lot of pressure on the losing candidate to concede to the winning candidate before election night is over. However, in recent elections this has begun to change. I already mentioned what took place in the aftermath of the 2000 election, and in 2004 John Kerry did not concede to George W. Bush until the next morning. And looking back at the numbers from the 2012 election, it is clear that Mitt Romney should not have conceded the race to Barack Obama so early. There was evidence of election fraud in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia , and many people out there still believe that Mitt Romney would have won if the election would have been conducted fairly. So when Donald Trump says that he may not immediately concede the election if the results are tight, I think that there is wisdom in that. A couple of weeks ago, it looked like we may have had a situation where Hillary Clinton could have won by a landslide . But the FBI changed everything when they announced that they were renewing their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails. Since that announcement, the poll numbers have been rapidly shifting and now Trump has all of the momentum . For example, the ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll had Hillary Clinton up by double digits not too long ago, but now it is showing a one point lead for Trump . The race is very close at this point, and if the race to 270 electoral votes is razor tight on election night, I don’t anticipate that either candidate will be eager to concede. We could see a prolonged legal battle ensue, and that could mean that we don’t have a new president until long after election day is over. Already, both campaigns are assembling large armies of lawyers. In fact, Bloomberg is reporting that Clinton already has “thousands of lawyers” that have donated their time to her campaign… Clinton is assembling a voter protection program that has drawn thousands of lawyers agreeing to lend their time and expertise in battleground states, though the campaign isn’t saying exactly how many or where. It is readying election observers in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Nevada and Arizona to assess any concerns — including the potential for voter intimidation — and to verify normal procedures. The Republican National Lawyers Association, which trains attorneys in battleground states and in local jurisdictions where races are expected to be close, aims to assemble 1,000 lawyers ready to monitor polls and possibly challenge election results across the country. Hedge fund manager Robert Mercer, one of Trump’s biggest backers, has sunk $500,000 into the group, its biggest donation in at least four presidential elections, Internal Revenue Service filings show. And most Americans don’t realize this, but Reuters is reporting that the Democrats have already filed election-related lawsuits in four key swing states… Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election . In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a “campaign of vigilante voter intimidation” that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan. Meanwhile, the legal challenges for the Clinton campaign continue to mount. The renewed investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents is just one of five FBI investigations that are currently looking into the conduct of “Clinton’s inner circle” … There are, in fact, not one but five separate FBI investigations which involve members of Clinton’s inner circle or their closest relatives – the people at the center of what has come to be known as Clintonworld. The five known investigations are into: Anthony Weiner, Huma Abedin’s estranged husband sexting a 15-year-old; the handling of classified material by Clinton and her staff on her private email server; questions over whether the Clinton Foundation was used as a front for influence-peddling; whether the Virginia governor broke laws about foreign donations; and whether Hillary’s campaign chairman’s brother did the same. Despite everything that we already know about Hillary, about half the country still plans to vote for her. If the American people willingly choose to elect the most corrupt presidential candidate in our history, it may be a sign that the events that I talk about in my new book are a lot closer than many people had originally been anticipating. But the good news is that a Clinton victory is looking a whole lot less likely than it was just a week or two ago. Could it be possible that the FBI has just delivered the “ miracle ” that Donald Trump desperately needed? Americans are more emotionally invested in this presidential campaign than they have been in any presidential campaign since at least 1980. Many of those that are backing Trump will be emotionally devastated if he does not win on November 8th, but if Trump does win we are likely to see the radical left throw a political temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Earlier today, I shared with my readers the amazing fact that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old during his first full day in the White House if he wins the election. Many conservatives are fully convinced that it is Donald Trump’s destiny to be president. Personally, I do not know what is going to happen. But with a race this close, it may be the courts that end up deciding who our next president is, and that is an outcome that none of us should want to see. Submit your review",0

18512,"Pressure From Trump May Delay a Factory’s Exit, but It Won’t Stop It - The New York Times","Even if President Trump’s      fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore, there’s a good chance that it will appear, at first, to be a success. But this is a dangerous illusion, the result of companies responding strategically to the new president’s threats. And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions. That’s why it’s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years. Some simple economics can help. Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter to name and shame manufacturing firms planning to relocate some of their production lines overseas. His attacks on Carrier, on Toyota, on General Motors have made their chief executives squirm and, in some cases, have produced what appear to be results. Carrier, for instance, has promised to keep some of the jobs it had planned to send offshore in the United States. Other companies have recycled old announcements of their domestic expansion plans. At first glance, pressuring a handful of companies seems unlikely to have much impact in an economy as large as that of the United States. Imagine that you are a chief executive of a company that has not been a Trump target there are so many companies in the country that the risk of yours being denounced by the president is tiny. At least that’s what the math shows. But the psychological reality is very different. Research has shown that people often overreact to insignificant risks, especially when the risks are so vivid. Just as it is almost certain that you won’t get eaten by a shark this summer, it is a near certainty that the vast majority of companies won’t end up in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs. Yet the fears persist, and people take greater precautionary measures than the actual threat warrants. Moreover, Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously: their personal reputation. Which makes them edgy. So far, the evidence bears this out. There are plenty of anecdotes suggesting that Mr. Trump has executives running scared. Some are hiring communications and crisis managers. Few have been willing to announce the sort of plant closings that might put them in the harsh glare of the president’s spotlight. But this doesn’t mean that Mr. Trump’s tweets have saved jobs. At least not in a lasting sense. To see why not, put yourself in the shoes of a C. E. O. You’re not just deciding whether to send production offshore you also need to decide when to act. This gives you a relatively cheap way to avoid the president’s ire: Mothball your blueprints for the new overseas factory, but don’t burn them. When the political threat passes  —   and, eventually, it will  —   just dust them off and move. If enough companies follow this script over the next couple of years, the number of factory jobs in the United States should stabilize, or even rise. Mr. Trump’s eventual successor may well inherit a manufacturing sector that is superficially stronger, though it will hide an underlying weakness: thousands of C. E. O.s ready to move production offshore. As soon as Mr. Trump leaves the stage, several years worth of   demand for offshoring may erupt, and as these plans are followed and factory jobs return to more normal levels, expect a sharp drop in manufacturing employment. Now imagine what all this will look like to a future policy wonk. Manufacturing jobs seemed to be scarce before Mr. Trump’s tenure, improved while he was at the helm, and then shrank sharply as soon as he left office. It might seem as though his angry tweets actually caused manufacturing to thrive. But it would be a mistake to infer that businesses really perform better when threatened. Rather, the fluctuating jobs numbers reflect the ease with which cuts can be delayed, not prevented. Sure, a delay is, in itself, good news for factory workers who keep their jobs a little longer, but it doesn’t address their   problems. Indeed, many economists, both Democrat and Republican, fear that Mr. Trump’s policy of naming and shaming will hurt the manufacturing sector in the long run. After all, the point of the exercise is to allocate workers and machines based on presidential diktat, not market forces. He is pushing corporate leaders to please the White House, rather than their customers and shareholders. The cost of hiring crisis managers to deal with Mr. Trump raises the cost of doing business just as surely as a tax hike would. By making it more expensive to leave the market, he also creates a disincentive for foreign companies thinking of building plants in the United States. The difficulty with trying to use the bully pulpit to create a lasting change in corporate behavior is that words  —   even a president’s  —   don’t much alter a company’s bottom line. Corporate decisions are driven by the balance of costs and benefits, and the benefits of offshoring are typically large and enduring. Still, for short periods, even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay, not fundamental change. For example, imagine two people who love Cancún and have decided to vacation there if the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway, because the cost isn’t enough to deter them. But if the airfare rises by $100 on Sunday, the day they had planned to go, but was to remain at the original price on Monday, the travelers may well decide to wait a day. So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend, when it’s more expensive, yet there will be no   impact on travel. Temporary policies often look as though they have disproportionately large effects, but they aren’t meaningful. That is the odd truth here: Mr. Trump’s approach may appear to have had a big effect precisely because it’s not viewed as a permanent solution. In fact, the more temporary his   industrial policy is thought to be, the more likely it is that chief executives will delay job cuts until the climate changes. Perhaps corporate bosses are currently pliant because they expect that this storm will pass. But bad economics can be good politics. We may see some spectacular   effects, even if Mr. Trump undermines the   competitiveness of America’s factories. The political upside will be obvious in the monthly employment numbers, while the economic downside will be difficult to disentangle from the   trend of declining factory jobs. Yet we shouldn’t be deluded. C. E. O.s will ultimately move jobs abroad if that’s what it takes to churn out profits.",0

18514,"Illegal Voting Claims, and Why They Don’t Hold Up - The New York Times","There isn’t any evidence to support President Trump’s assertion that three to five million illegal votes were cast in the 2016 presidential election. But there is one study that has been interpreted to suggest it is at least possible. It found that between 32, 000 and 2. 8 million noncitizen voters might have fraudulently cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. The study, based on a survey of 38, 000 people after that election, has been under fire since it was published in 2014. Now even its authors concede that it probably overstated the amount of noncitizen voting. “The   estimates are likely incorrect,” Jesse Richman, one of the   of the study and a political science professor at Old Dominion University, said in an email exchange on Wednesday. In a post online, he also said that the findings do not support Mr. Trump’s contention that millions cast ballots illegally. Mr. Richman still maintains that some small percentage of noncitizens vote in American elections. But the debate over this study has moved on. It’s no longer about whether millions of illegal votes were cast, but whether there’s any evidence for noncitizen voting at all. The study’s bold claims fell apart because of something called response error: the possibility that people taking a survey don’t answer a question correctly  —   in this case, a question about being American citizens. There is always a tiny amount of response error in surveys. Respondents might not understand the question. Or they might understand it, but mark the wrong answer by mistake, if the survey is  . An interviewer, if there is one, could accidentally record the wrong answer. Such errors usually aren’t a problem large enough to change the results of a survey. But both the survey and the question posed by researchers were unusual. The survey  —   the Cooperative Congressional Election Study  —   was huge, with 38, 000 respondents in 2008. And the group in question  —   noncitizens  —   was very small, just 339 of those respondents. The problem is that even a tiny amount of response error among the 38, 000 respondents could have been enough to contaminate the results of the tiny group of noncitizens. Imagine, for instance, that 99. 9 percent of people respond to the survey’s citizenship question correctly. In such a big survey, even that high success rate would still imply that there were 38 respondents who answered incorrectly  —   enough to make up a big chunk of the tiny pool of 339 noncitizen respondents. If those 38 misreported noncitizens had indeed voted, then suddenly it would look as if 10 percent of noncitizens voted. This critique could explain all of the noncitizen voting observed in the study. Critics of the study  —   Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard political scientist, Samantha Luks, a statistician at YouGov, and Brian  Schaffner, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  —   were able to marshal evidence strongly consistent with that possibility, because of the survey’s unusual design: Thousands of voters are   in subsequent elections. That allowed the study’s critics to check whether people were consistent about their answer on the citizenship answer from year to year. If the people were consistent, they were probably noncitizens. If voters were inconsistent, it would be a sign that the category was contaminated by the tiny number of voters who misreported their citizenship. There was not much consistency. Between 2010 and 2012, 20 voters switched from being citizens to noncitizens (an extremely unlikely transition) and 36 others switched from noncitizens to citizens (a more common transition, but one reported at a far greater rate than typically occurs). These shifting answers strongly bolster the theory that many of the respondents logged as noncitizens had responded in error. But most important, among the 85 respondents who said they were noncitizens in both 2010 and 2012  —   those most likely to really be noncitizens  —   none had voted in the 2010 midterm elections. The critics concluded that “the likely percent of noncitizen voters in recent U. S. elections is 0. ” In a response published in October, Mr. Richman and his colleagues did not contest the finding that measurement error probably exaggerated the number of noncitizen voters. “The response error issues they focus on may have biased our numbers,” Mr. Richman said in an email to The New York Times on Wednesday. Mr. Richman and his colleagues have not estimated a new range of possible noncitizen voting. Instead, the October response sought only to rebut the notion that there was no noncitizen voting. They argued that measurement error couldn’t explain all of the people who said they were noncitizens and voted. When it came to hard evidence immune to the measurement error critique, Mr. Richman and his   found one validated 2012 voter who had indicated not being a citizen in both the 2010 and 2012 surveys. But the same noncitizen had indicated in the survey that he or she was not registered to vote. The determination that he or she was a voter was based on voter records: The respondents to the survey were matched to a voter registration file. It is possible that this noncitizen was erroneously matched to the voter file. The matching process is good but imperfect, and becomes harder with less information  —   like the absence of a specific address or date of birth. That the respondent said he or she wasn’t registered certainly raises the possibility that the match was wrong. “I haven’t seen any evidence that I would say shows that any noncitizens vote,” Mr. Schaffner said. “That doesn’t mean that the rate is exactly zero. But it does mean that it’s   frequency that we can’t even measure it with traditional methods. ”",0
18515,The Electoral College Is Hated by Many. So Why Does It Endure? - The New York Times,"In November 2000, as the Florida recount gripped the nation, a newly elected Democratic senator from New York took a break from an upstate victory tour to address the possibility that Al Gore could wind up winning the popular vote but losing the presidential election. She was unequivocal. “I believe strongly that in a democracy, we should respect the will of the people,” Hillary Clinton said, “and to me that means it’s time to do away with the Electoral College and move to the popular election of our president. ” Sixteen years later, the Electoral College is still standing, and Mrs. Clinton has followed Mr. Gore as the second Democratic presidential candidate in modern history to be defeated by a Republican who earned fewer votes, in his case George W. Bush. In her concession speech on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton did not mention the popular vote, an omission that seemed to signal her desire to encourage a smooth and civil transition of power after a divisive election. But her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, highlighted her higher vote total than Donald J. Trump’s in introducing her. The disparity left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Democrats, whose party won the country’s national popular vote for the third consecutive election but no longer controls any branch of government. “If we really subscribe to the notion that ‘majority rules,’ then why do we deny the majority their chosen candidate?” asked Jennifer M. Granholm, a former governor of Michigan. Mr. Trump himself has been critical of the Electoral College in the past. On the eve of the 2012 election, he called it “a disaster for a democracy” in a Twitter post. Now, after months of railing against what he called a “rigged” election, he has become the unlikely beneficiary of an electoral system that enables a candidate to win the race without winning over the most voters. None of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters have gone so far as to suggest that the popular vote tally should delegitimize Mr. Trump’s victory, and the   margin in Tuesday’s election was in fact narrower than the one that separated Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore in 2000. But the results are already renewing calls for electoral reform. “I personally would like to see the Electoral College eliminated entirely,” said David Boies, the lawyer who represented Mr. Gore in the Florida recount in 2000. “I think it’s a historical anomaly. ” Defenders of the system argue that it reduces the chances of daunting nationwide recounts in close races, a scenario that Gary L. Gregg II, an Electoral College expert at the University of Louisville, said would be a “national nightmare. ” A variety of factors informed the creation of the Electoral College, which apportions a fixed number of votes to each state based on the size of its congressional delegation. The founding fathers sought to ensure that residents in states with smaller populations were not ignored. In an era that predated mass media and even political parties, the founders were also concerned that average Americans would lack enough information about the candidates to make intelligent choices. So informed “electors” would stand in for them. Above all, some historians point to the critical role that slavery played in the formation of the system. Southern delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, most prominently James Madison of Virginia, were concerned that their constituents would be outnumbered by Northerners. The   Compromise, however, allowed states to count each slave as   of a person  —   enough, at the time, to ensure a Southern majority in presidential races. On social media Wednesday, some drew connections between that history and what they perceived as an imbalance in the Electoral College that favors Republicans. “Electoral college will forever tip balance to   “white”  voters  —   a concession to   originally,” the author Joyce Carol Oates wrote on Twitter. To its critics, the Electoral College is a relic that violates the democratic principle of one person, one vote, and distorts the presidential campaign by encouraging candidates to campaign only in the relatively small number of contested states. “I think it is intolerable for democracy,” said George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas AM University and the author of a book on the Electoral College. “I can’t think of any justification for it, and any justification that is offered doesn’t bear scrutiny. ” But calls to change the system, which would require a constitutional amendment, are likely to fall on deaf ears with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress. And though there was some momentum for reform after Mr. Gore’s defeat, it dissipated after Mr. Bush and Barack Obama won both the popular and electoral votes in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Some states have discussed a possibility that would not necessarily require amending the Constitution: jettisoning the    system, in which a single candidate is awarded all of a state’s electoral votes  —   regardless of the popular vote  —   and instead apportioning them to reflect the breakdown of each state’s popular vote. Two states, Maine and Nebraska, already do this. But even that approach could face challenges, said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School. For reformers, the best hope may lie in the   National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an agreement among states to award all of their respective electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in a given election. So far, 10 states and the District of Columbia have joined the agreement. But it will only go into effect when enough states have signed on to guarantee that the winner of the popular vote would win an election. For now, it seems, any change still remains a   notion. “I am very mad at James Madison,” said former Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. “But I don’t think there’s anything I can do about it. ”",0
18516,North Dakota Arrests 10 as Pipeline Protest Camp Empties - The New York Times,"CANNON BALL, N. D.  —   The fires burned for hours on the flat, muddy landscape, their thick smoke rising through snowflakes that tumbled to the ground. Someone rode a snowmobile across the dirt, and others moved their belongings to the side of a rural highway. The police gathered, prepared to follow the governor’s order to clear people from this rural part of the state. But the Wednesday afternoon deadline for protesters of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to empty their largest encampment passed with far more uncertainty than unrest. In the hours after the deadline, the authorities made 10 arrests but said they would not fully empty the camp on Wednesday night. Roughly 25 to 50 demonstrators were believed to remain in the mandatory evacuation zone, said Gov. Doug Burgum, who said cleaning crews planned to enter the camp Thursday morning. “Anyone who obstructs our ability to do cleanup will be subject to arrest,” Mr. Burgum said. The scene here, about an hour’s drive south of Bismarck, the state capital, seemed to represent a muffled end to a specific and passionate protest that drew thousands of demonstrators and became central to the national debate about energy, the environment and the rights of Native Americans. Protesters argued that the nearly completed pipeline, now moving ahead with the support of President Trump’s administration, could imperil the drinking water supply on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. “We won,” said Vanessa Red Bull, 54, who has spent months here. “We slowed that pipeline down months and months and months. We cost them who knows how much money. And we slowed them down. ” She added, “This has been a multilayered event that has brought attention to glaring issues. ” Ms. Red Bull and her allies won a brief victory last year, when the Army Corps of Engineers said in the waning days of the Obama administration that it would conduct an environmental impact study before allowing the   pipeline to cross Lake Oahe, the Missouri River reservoir near the encampment. But the beginning of the Trump administration brought a swift and substantial defeat: an instruction that the Army abort its study, a decision that allowed construction to resume. Barring court intervention, oil from the Bakken fields in western North Dakota could flow through the pipeline this spring. But on Wednesday, the matter at hand was what to do with the encampment, which had become an abiding and, for some, spiritual symbol of activism. State officials cited fears of flooding for the governor’s decision last week to order a mandatory evacuation of the site. “It’s time for protesters to either go home, or move to a legal site where they can peaceably continue their activities without risk of further harm to the environment,” the North Dakota attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, said in a statement. Officials said that trash at the protest camps would pose an ecological risk if it were washed downstream by flooding, and that urgent cleanup was necessary. Both sides have accused the other of escalating tension and engaging in violence since the protest started last year as a decidedly local affair. The camps ultimately swelled to thousands in the summer and fall, with Native Americans and supporters from across the country gathering in spirited opposition and setting up a makeshift society in the camps, complete with cooking tents and supply areas. But on Wednesday, months of tension mostly gave way to a somber calm as demonstrators left and a cold rain turned to snow. Some protesters set fire to semipermanent structures before the 2 p. m. deadline. “It’s an act of defiance,” Nick Cowan, 25, said as he watched a fire burn on Wednesday after living here for more than two months. “It’s saying: ‘If you are going to make us leave our home, you cannot take our space. We’ll burn it to the ground and let the earth take it back before you take it from us. ’” Two youths were injured at the camp Wednesday, apparently from the fires, officials said, including a teenage girl who was hospitalized with severe burns. North Dakota officials offered meals, lodging, a medical exam and a bus ticket to anywhere in the 48 contiguous states for protesters who left by Wednesday afternoon but needed help getting home. That approach was at odds with events of recent months, when the demonstrators sporadically clashed with the police, leading to the activation of the North Dakota National Guard and hundreds of arrests. The police sometimes used tear gas and rubber bullets. The North Dakota Guard said on Wednesday that it had spent more than $8 million responding to the protest since August. Despite the lingering frustrations, tensions seemed to have eased in recent weeks as the ranks of demonstrators declined during the harsh winter. Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has sued seeking to block the pipeline construction, urged protesters to go home. On Wednesday, many of them did. “I think people are saying goodbye,” said Ms. Red Bull, who spent about six months here. “I think that’s why people are setting things on fire: as a way of a last homage to what had become many people’s homes. A community was here. ”",0
18517,"Muslims Are Kidnapping White Girls And Forcing Them Into Sex Slavery, Says UK Children's Charity","Print 
Islam and sex slavery are like peanut butter and jelly - you always find the one next to the other. Muslims kidnapping vulnerable white girls in the UK and forcing them to be sex slaves has reached an epidemic level, according to a recent report from the UK Charity Barnados. They say that Muslims are setting up fake businesses, primarily car washes, when, in reality, they are brothels and transit houses for these kidnapped girls: 
Barnardo’s claims girls are being ferried from one unit to another as sex slaves for Kurds[s]. 
It suggests white British girls on the run from the care system in Hartlepool, Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough are being targeted. 
The report said: “There were connections between people that work in car washes and the sexual exploitation of children on Teesside. 
… 
Officers on the immigration-led operation found beds at one. It was suggested staff were living on the premises. 
Cleveland Police said: “It was not confirmed that child sexual exploitation had taken place although enquiries were conducted.” ( source ) 
This is a sad and sickening picture of what the UK has become. Once one of the safest places in the West, it has allowed itself to become little more than a third-world cesspool, where its own women are being sold like slaves in the Muslim bazaars of old, and the government refuses to do its job to stop it, instead allowing it to continue and trying to stop those who want to put a stop to it.

A DONALD Trump supporter listened carefully to the president-elect’s call for national unity before registering the domain name for a white supremacist website. 
Brent Logan, from Ohio, paid $19.99 for aryanknightsofamerica.net and said he hoped it would be a website for all Americans, ‘except the black, hispanic, Asian, Muslim and Jewish ones’. 
He added: “But they’re not American anyway. Which is what President Trump has been saying all along. 
“Which us why his call for national unity is so important. He wants to unify us against blacks, hispanics, Asians, Muslims and the Jews. 
“He is a very good public speaker.” 
Logan continued: “It’s going to be very much an Aryan lifestyle website. Fashion tips for intimidating minorities at a picnic; how to decorate your basement with flags, that sort of thing.”

18519,They’re Working: Anti-Trump Protests Send Trump Into Humiliating Twitter Rage Spiral,"  
Donald Trump has a Twitter problem. He has so little self-control when it comes to his chosen form of communication that in the final days of his presidential run, Trump’s team actually took control of his Twitter account away from him. Well, it seems that now that the election is over, Trump is back in control of that account, and he will be the president of out of control tweets. 
As everyone knows by now, Trump’s new position as President-elect has sparked nationwide protests by people who are standing against the hate and bigotry that Trump represents. In NYC alone, a massive peaceful protest broke out, filling the streets with people who wanted to make a statement: Donald Trump’s bigotry does not represent all Americans. Wow! #NotMyPresident protest in NYC right now. pic.twitter.com/RY7ALHQFih

Notoriously thin-skinned, the moment Trump got his Twitter account back, he let loose in a rage for the ages, accusing the protesters of being paid to do what they are doing, and of being incited by a biased media. Here is a screenshot of that tweet, just in case someone around him decides it would be wise to delete it: 
So, in other words, Trump has once again showed America how temperamentally unfit he is to be president. If people exercising their First Amendment rights in protesting him and his policies provokes this kind of reaction, what will he do with the nuclear codes and the power of the presidency at his disposal? What will he do when a foreign leader insults him, or stands up to him or disagrees with him? We should all be terrified at the thought of such a situation.

Donald Trump is unhinged, and he keeps proving it. No matter how “presidential” or “gracious” he may have seemed during his meeting with President Obama or during his victory speech, do not be fooled. Make no mistake – this man is a hot-head and a loose cannon, and the 59 million suckers in America just made him the most powerful man in the world.

18520,INFURIATING: One Week Before The Election And The FBI AGAIN Tries To F*ck Over Hillary’s Campaign,"By Jameson Parker News , Politics November 1, 2016 INFURIATING: One Week Before The Election And The FBI AGAIN Tries To F*ck Over Hillary’s Campaign   
There is something ugly happening within the FBI and it could have major implications for the presidential election. 
On the heels of FBI Director’s bone-headed, possibly illegal letter misleadingly suggesting Hillary Clinton is being re-investigated for her emails, the FBI’s “Records Vault” Twitter account doubled-down on the pro-Trump Hillary smears by inexplicably tweeting the records of “a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich”– a matter that was settled over a decade ago and has absolutely no bearing on the current election. William J. Clinton Foundation: This initial release consists of material from the FBI's files related to the Will… https://t.co/Y4nz3aRSmG 
— FBI Records Vault (@FBIRecordsVault) November 1, 2016 
The ancient nontroversy was provided with absolutely zero context or explanation. In fact, this single cryptic tweet is the only thing the FBI Records Vault has tweeted in the past 36 hours. However, just like FBI Director James Comey’s letter to Republicans, it will be used by Clinton’s opponents – particularly Trump’s campaign – to fan the flames of “scandal.” 
The question on everyone’s mind is: Why? Why tweet this? And why tweet this just one week before an election that has already been marred with too many false scandals and misleading announcements? 
The decision is baffling and unprecedented. As demonstrated by Washington Post ‘s political reporter Peter Stevenson’s stunned reaction. So, an FBI account is tweeting things about the Clinton foundation. Appears to be from 2001 investigation into several of Clinton's pardons https://t.co/PDIwBYueIO

And Clinton campaign staffer Brian Fallows’s even more stunned reaction: Absent a FOIA litigation deadline, this is odd. Will FBI be posting docs on Trump's housing discrimination in '70s? https://t.co/uJMMzX6rtI 
— Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 1, 2016 
Comey has been rightly slammed for his decision to meddle in the election contrary to FBI policy not to get involved in politics, but even his critics were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder – a staunch Democrat – called Comey an “honorable man” who made a massive mistake. Now that assessment seems far too kind. The FBI is dumping opposition research to the public that hurts Hillary Clinton and favors Donald Trump. 
Not that the FBI Records Vault has been completely silent about Trump – but when it does speak about him, its tone is much more deferential. If the FBI’s policy is to keep politics out of it, they are only achieving that when it comes to Trump. Two days previously, it tweeted a brief write up about Donald Trump’s father. It describes him a “philanthropist” and the release appears mostly harmless. Fred C. Trump: Fred C. Trump (1905-1999) was a real estate developer and philanthropist.

At the same time, it’s carefully withholding information regarding its investigations into Donald Trump’s businesses and his connections to the Russian government . This imbalance is so clear that it stretches the imagination to the breaking point to believe it was done on accident. 
As the race tightens in the closing week of the election, the fact that a government agency would repeatedly throw its weight behind one candidate over another – and do so in a way that is inherently dishonest – is infuriating. The damage being done to the FBI’s claim to objectivity is possibly irrevocable.

18523,California Today: Fretting Over the ‘Netflix Tax’ - The New York Times,"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Sign up.) Dozens of California cities looking to shore up revenues are flirting with a new idea  —   tax your “Gilmore Girls” binge. Pasadena was among the first to say publicly this fall that it wanted to tax video streaming services like Netflix, a step that could make up for lost tax revenue from growing numbers of  . At 9. 4 percent, the   Netflix tax would treat streaming services as a traditional utility, the city said. If you use multiple services  —   for example, Hulu, Amazon Video and HBO  —   it would be added to each bill. The move in Pasadena, with a population of about 140, 000, has drawn consternation from technology companies and consumers who worry that it could be copied across the state. “Websites and apps are not utilities and it defies logic to tax them like electricity, water or gas,” said Noah Theran, spokesman for the Internet Association, a trade group. No California city has yet to begin collecting the tax. But roughly 40 cities, among them Glendale, Santa Barbara, Stockton and Sacramento, have gotten guidance from municipal consultants on how they might. Public officials have argued that taxation rules need to be revised to account for changing technologies. It is unfair, some say, that people who get video through cable television are taxed while those who have shifted over to internet streaming services are not. One question officials would need to resolve is where to stop, analysts say. If streaming video is taxable, then what about music, podcasts or video games? “It opens a big Pandora’s box,” said Paul Verna, an analyst at eMarketer, a technology research company. Mr. Verna said many of the streaming video tax proposals in California have bubbled up under the radar. If there is to be a larger debate, it will erupt when people start seeing their bills, he said. For now, the proposed tax is “under internal review,” William Boyer, a Pasadena city spokesman, said in an email. Tyron Hampton, a council member who has opposed the tax, said that with the city’s underfunded pensions, officials were right to be looking for novel ways to raise money. But the web should be off limits, he said: “The basic tenet of the internet is that the internet is supposed to be free. ” • Officials in   sanctuary cities say they will act as a bulwark against mass deportations, even at the risk of losing federal money.

But another sort of rebellion occurred in Northern California long before Election Day. It was this week in 1941 that a group of miners halted traffic along Route 99 in Siskiyou County and handed out proclamations to motorists declaring the formation of Jefferson, a new state named after the author of the Declaration of Independence. With Yreka as its capital, Jefferson would include parts of both Oregon and California where resentments had simmered over the supposed neglect of politicians in the capitals of Salem and Sacramento. The journalist Lawrence E. Davies described the scene in the Nov. 28 edition of The New York Times: The agitators complained that the region was deprived of proper roads needed to transport their copper ore and timber. They vowed to barricade the highway every Thursday until their demands were met. But the uprising was to be  . Gilbert Gable, the mayor of Port Orford, Ore. who had initiated the Jefferson movement and led its public relations effort, died on Dec. 2. Five days after that, Pearl Harbor was attacked. And the mood for rebellion was eclipsed by the war effort. Now, more than seven decades later, the movement for a state of Jefferson remains a hot issue in Northern California. In 2013, the Siskiyou County board of supervisors approved a declaration that called for breaking away from the state. The complaints echo those of the miners in the 1940s: chiefly, a perceived lack of representation in Sacramento. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.

18524,Chase Sapphire Reserve Card’s Huge Bonus Will Be Slashed - The New York Times,"When a Wall Street banking institution starts throwing   bonuses at credit card customers, it may be best to grab them before they inevitably disappear. And so it goes with Chase Sapphire Reserve, a card that the bank, JPMorgan Chase, introduced last summer. The bank offered a   bonus worth $1, 500 to people who spent $4, 000 on the card in the first three months they had it and then redeemed the bonus for travel. Now the bank is cutting the bonus in half. Jan. 12 will be the last day that people can earn it by applying for the card online, though people who apply at a bank branch will still be able to get the bonus until March 12. You need not be a current bank customer to apply at a branch, according to a bank spokeswoman, Ashley E. Dodd, who confirmed the changes. The bonus played a big role in bringing the card so much attention, landing it on the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek and leading the bank to hand out so many perks that it caused a $200 million to $300 million hit to its earnings. Even without the outsize bonus, which was very rare in the history of credit card bonus offers, the card is likely to remain popular. While it has a steep $450 annual fee, cardholders receive a $300 credit each year for any travel spending they put on the card. And customers earn three points for every dollar they spend on all travel and dining, which can lead to better value than the rewards that most other cards offer for customers who spent a lot in those areas. The Points Guy blog first reported the slashing of the   bonus. Many such sites now exist to help consumers take advantage of the most lucrative   offers, while collecting commissions when they pass readers on to card issuers’ application sites. If those customers keep the cards for a few years (and especially if they run up balances and pay interest) the banks can come out ahead.

If you’ve ever been with friends or family members over the weekend then received an urgent email from work, you’re aware of the dread that fills your stomach and causes your mood to dip. Being unable to fully disconnect from work can have mental and physical health implications, which is why unwarranted contact by the workplace is soon to become illegal in France. Already, the country gives its employees 30 days off a year and 16 weeks of full-paid family leave; this latest initiative is only making France more popular. According to BBC News , the new “right to disconnect” law will mandate that a company with 50 employees or more cannot email an employee after typical work hours. The amendment is largely a result of studies showing that people have an increasingly difficult time distancing themselves from the workplace. Good relays that the law seeks to make sure the French citizens are able to fully enjoy their time off. Said Benoit Hamon of the French National Assembly: “All the studies show there is far more work-related stress today than there used to be, and that the stress is constant. Employees physically leave the office, but they do not leave their work. They remain attached by a kind of electronic leash— like a dog. The texts, the messages, the emails — they colonize the life of the individual to the point where he or she eventually breaks down.” Stipulations of the new law include that companies must negotiate policies that limit the spillover of work into the private lives of their employees. There are no penalties for companies that violate the amendment, but the businesses are required to establish “charters of good conduct” that specify the times which employees are completely free from being contacted by their workplace. When the law was first proposed, it received plenty of criticism and mockery. According to Linh Le, a partner at Elia management consultants in Paris, however, the amendment is necessary, particularly because it could benefit citizens’ mental and physical well-being. She says that burnout, described as ”physical, psychological and emotional distress caused by a total inability to rest”, can result from never being fully free from work, which is why time away from the office is required. Some are concerned that the amendment – passed as part of a controversial French labor law – will weaken unions and enhance employee job insecurity. It is worth noting, however, that the digital disconnect amendment was the one part of the law that’s been viewed favorably by French citizens. What are your thoughts?

18526,"If Clinton Goes Down, Loretta Lynch Will Go Down With Her","Posted on October 31, 2016 by Daisy Luther 
Oh, Loretta. 
I’ll bet that AG Loretta Lynch is shaking in her boots right now, because when Hillary Clinton goes down, Lynch’s career will go down with her. Heck, maybe they’ll even be cellmates. 
Loretta Lynch’s ties to the Clintons go back to 1999 when then-President Bill Clinton appointed her to run the Brooklyn US Attorney’s office. She left in 2002 and went into private practice, but returned to the Brooklyn office in 2010 at the behest of President Barack Obama. ( Here’s her official bio. ) 
In 2015, she was sworn in to become the 83rd Attorney General of the United States, taking the place of the blatantly corrupt Attorney General, Eric Holder , who will probably be most famous for his roles in the Fast and Furious operation, inciting racial tensions, and his mishandling of the Lois Lerner/IRS debacle. First, there was the secret airplane meeting with Bill Clinton 
It all started to publicly go downhill for Lynch during the first investigation into Hillary Clinton’s carelessness with national secrets via her home email server . Right before FBI Director James Comey was to meet with Hillary Clinton to interrogate her about the subject, Lynch was busted having a secret meeting with Bill Clinton . The Washington Post reported: 
Clinton’s private, unplanned meeting with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch at the Phoenix airport last week, coming at a time when the Justice Department should be nearing completion of its examination of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server for her emails as secretary of state, will inevitably — and negatively — affect public attitudes about that investigation… 
…Lynch has tried to make amends, though not without leaving some confusion in her wake. In a conversation Friday with Washington Post editorial writer Jonathan Capehart at the Aspen Ideas Festival, she insisted again that the conversation was innocent — about grandchildren and golf and such — and did not touch on the investigation of the emails. But she said she recognized that others would not see it that way. “The fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that I take seriously, and deeply and painfully,” she said. 
Lynch said that she would “be accepting” whatever recommendation the career prosecutors and FBI Director James B. Comey bring her — though she did not say she would remove herself completely from the case. She also said she had made that decision some months ago but was only now making it public. 
Of course, it was all much easier for Lynch to abide by the decision when Comey miraculously found that Hillary Clinton was not criminal in her negligence with national secrets. 
Now, though, people are asking questions about that ill-founded meeting. Judicial Watch has filed a lawsuit for “all records” related to the illicit meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton . 
“On June 29, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch is reported to have met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton’s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting.” 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested that during that meeting, Bill Clinton may have offered to extend Lynch’s position in the AG’s office during a Hillary Clinton administration. Then she blocked a congressional investigation into the notorious Iranian ransom payment. 
Last week, AG Lynch blocked a congressional investigation into the cash payments that the Obama administration made to Iran by pleading the Fifth. The Washington Free Beacon reported: 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon … 
…“It is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people’s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,” the lawmakers wrote. “Your staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.” 
“As the United States’ chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,” they stated. “The actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.” 
How very judicial of her. Lynch tried to shut Comey up about the new investigation into the Clinton emails. 
Now, even the mainstream media can’t turn its head. 
Earlier I wrote about the fact that FBI Director James Comey made the decision on his own to go public about the new investigation into the Hillary Clinton emails. But let’s talk a little further about Lynch’s desperate attempts to shut him up. 
The New York Times reported that the Justice Department “strongly discouraged Comey” against releasing the information: The day before the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed Hillary Clinton email investigation, the Justice Department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy, three law enforcement officials said on Saturday. Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections. 
How interesting that it’s seen as “influencing the election” to investigate someone now but it wasn’t back when she was investigated and not charged. I’m not sure exactly how that works, but according to USA Today (emphasis mine), a “…federal official familiar with Comey’s decision said Saturday that the FBI director considered the attorney general’s advice during a spirited discussion of the matter Thursday and early Friday but felt compelled to act.” Do you remember Janet Reno? 
Poor Janet was another Attorney General who went down for the Clintons. She was also sworn in as AG under Bill Clinton, and many questioned her appointment at the time. According to a report in the Chicago Tribune : 
She arrived in Washington from Miami as Caesar’s wife, and so she has remained. She was ignorant and independent of insider D.C. and has stayed that way. Bill Clinton never much liked her and never confided in her, and she reciprocated. 
She became AG just in time to take the fall for the debacle in Waco , actually. According to History.com 
The Waco standoff had already begun by the time Janet Reno became the first female attorney general on March 12, 1993. She approved the FBI’s tear gas plan the following month, explaining that negotiations with the Branch Davidians had stalemated and that the children inside the compound were at risk. “We will never know whether there was a better solution,” Reno said in 1995. “Everyone involved … made their best judgments based on all the information we had.” Nonetheless, a Republican-led congressional report called her decision “premature, wrong and highly irresponsible.” She was also criticized when facts emerged contradicting some of her earlier statements. 
The Tribune post continued to discuss Reno’s position as a scapegoat: 
Every day since she took office , she has been supervising at least one probe embarrassing to Clinton–Whitewater, fundraising, Lewinsky, China espionage, etc. Clinton can’t afford the political beating he would take if he cashiered her. 
…But no such attorney general could have survived the Clinton scandals, much less survived them with her own reputation–and her department’s–intact. 
Attorney Generals who have anything to do with the Clintons don’t seem to fare too well. They end up so embroiled in Clinton scandals that they, too, are pulled down into the mire, regardless of what their intentions were when they started out. Lynch can see her future…and it has something to do with “Help Wanted” ads 
The last time Lynch was involved in the Clinton email kerfuffle, she promised to abide by FBI Director James Comey’s recommendation . 
I wonder if she’ll make that same promise this time? 
She really can’t, because if she does, it will show she was complicit with the Clintons the last time around, and also this time when she decried Comey’s release of information about the investigation. 
I wonder if she and Hillary Clinton will be able to get adjoining cells when/if the truth comes out.

18527,A Round with Rory McIlroy on St. Patrick’s Day Weekend - Breitbart,"To celebrate St. Patrick’s Day weekend, I followed Ireland’s and arguably the world’s greatest golfer at the Bay Hill Classic. [Rory started Friday one over par and far back of the leader, Charley Hoffman, who sat at 10 under. Consequently, it was an earlier than usual tee time. He played with Jim Herman, a    journeyman who had his first tour win at the Shell Houston Open last year. Rory walked up onto the first tee and shook hands with all the volunteers and scoring officials. He immediately started chatting up Herman. He’s a natural conversationalist. If you’re a golfer or a first baseman, it’s important to always have something to talk about because there’s a lot of waiting around. After the players tee off there’s a mass exodus from the stands as most people are there to follow Rory’s group.  First   Rory makes a pedestrian par. I ran into his dad Gerry McIlroy on the first green. I met him a few times over the years at tournaments and he’s one of the most affable guys around. He was so welcoming, in fact, that I had visions of him really taking a liking to me and asking if I would become Rory’s business manager. That never happened sadly, but he still sort of remembers me. Maybe there’ still a chance I could take over Rory’s finances. Second Hole —  Rory misses the green on a tough par three and thins a chip shot 20 feet past the hole.  The ball was on a severe downhill but he still elected to chip it. I asked my buddy Gerry if he agreed with that call, and he said, “Yes, without a doubt. ” That’s good enough for me.  All’s well that ends well as he drains the putt for par. Third Hole —  Another   par for Rory. On his tee shot some idiot in the crowd yelled, “Bababooey. ” I made an effort to track him down and box their ears to no avail. I’m doing my part as a golf vigilante, though. Fourth Hole —  Rory is under par for the round with a great up and down for birdie. His second shot into the   hole went left into the crowd but he hit a classy chip to six feet and made the putt. Fifth Hole —  Rory hits an iron off the tee to get into position for the short par four. Nobody clapped after the shot even though it appeared perfect. If one person had started clapping then everyone else would have. It’s like singing in church. This phenomenon should have a name if it doesn’t already. He just misses a downhill   and makes par. Sixth Hole —  This is a beautiful par five that bends around a lake. An osprey diving into the water for fish entertains the crowd. The bird actually caught a fish and flew to a nearby tree to consume his catch. It’s the Nature Channel and the Golf Channel. We are definitely getting our money’s worth. Rory hits a huge drive and a monster long iron over the flag. He two putts for par and is now two under and looking sharp.  Seventh Hole —  Rory hits a towering iron shot on the long par three. There is an audible gasp from the crowd as the ball reaches its apex. It’s really a sight to behold and McIlroy is the only player in the world that can hit these shots. It goes 15 feet past the hole but he misses the birdie putt and makes par. Eighth Hole —  Rory gets another birdie chance on the tough par four. I approach Gerry, and say, “How about he makes this and shoots a 65?” Gerry says, “Sounds good to me. ” So, he’s onboard. He misses the birdie. Ninth Hole —  Another birdie putt goes begging on the tough   ninth. Rory is two under for the round but could easily be four or five under with the way he’s striking the ball. As the crowd walks to the tenth hole, U. S. Open and Olympic gold medalist Justin Rose tries to walk the other way to the range. Pretty funny to see Rose fight the crowd while carrying a bucket of range balls. One guy nonchalantly says, “Hey Justin” and Rose, to his credit, was nice enough to smile and “Hey” back. Tenth Hole —  Rory opens the back nine with a birdie to get to three under. As he walks to the next tee an inebriated college kid yells, “Rory you have to shake my friend’s hand, he has the same name as you. ” I ask him if his friend’s name is Rory McIlroy, but, unsurprisingly, it’s just the first name. Rory passes up the chance to shake his friend’s hand but fist bumps with drunk college guy because his extended fist is blocking his way. Drunken college guy is a treat. He’s in a good spot now still fun and coherent. It’s only noon, so I shudder to think what 5 p. m. will bring. He did tell me about how Rory’s playing partner Jim Herman received sponsorship from Trump early in his playing career. Trump played a lot of golf with Herman, who served as an assistant pro at Trump’s course in Bedminster, New Jersey. He saw how good Herman was and implored him to follow his dream on the PGA Tour. Trump’s instincts are correct once again.  As Herman walks by drunk college guy yells out, “Herman!” and then “Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump!” Good times. Eleventh Hole —  Another birdie to get to four under for the round! We may have something brewing here. A guy had an awesome Fathead of Rory and I wanted to take a picture for the article. But every picture I took he was grabbing his girlfriend’s butt. Unacceptable. What kind of a website does he think we’re running around here? Twelfth Hole —  On the reachable par five, Rory’s drive just trickles into the sand. Gerry says no way he can reach in two. He hits out to 85 yards. After an indifferent approach shot, he drains an   for his third birdie in a row. There’s now a buzz in the air. Thirteenth Hole —  After a good drive and an excellent approach shot, Rory has   for birdie. He just misses and that is deflating. It looked like four birdies in a row. I see his lovely mom Rosie and try and worm my way into the McIlroy’s good graces even more. I approach her and ask if she’s Gerry’s better half? She doesn’t hear me and I then mumble hello. Not a good start. I ask if she is staying with Rory at his house in Jupiter, Florida. She looks at me dumbfounded as if to say, no, my son is worth over 100 million dollars, I think he can afford to buy us a house in Florida. It’s looking unlikely I’ll ever get control of the McIlroy fortune. She was very nice though and was happy to hear about Jim Herman’s Shell Open win late in his career. Fourteenth Hole —  Tough par three and he hits a decent shot 20 feet below the pin. Putt just misses and what could have been a phenomenal round may just be a good round. I’m seeing a lot of pretty girls on the course. This is expected at PGA events. They get dolled up as well. A number of these woman are wearing   wedge shoes. They can barely stand, let alone walk around the course. Very impractical ladies. We appreciate the effort but would rather you just wore running shoes so we wouldn’t have to worry about you turning an ankle. Fifteenth   Rory makes par on the difficult par 4. As he waits on the green for Herman to putt, he’s looking down and fiddling with his ball. A young kid in my area jokingly asks those around him, “is he texting?” There’s hope for this next generation. Sixteenth Hole —  This is an easy par five but Rory’s tee shot goes well right into the high rough and on a downhill slope. It’s a really difficult shot as he also faces a creek in front of the green. People in crowd think he will lay up but he chooses to go for the green. He somehow digs it out and gets it pin high but just off the green. His chip is decent but he can’t make the birdie putt. Facing two very tough finishing holes it looks like he will be lucky to hold on and shoot five under. Seventeenth Hole —  On the treacherous   par three over water, Rory hits an excellent tee shot to 14 feet. He then drains the putt. The gallery is now twice as big as when he started. Eighteenth Hole —  This is the second most difficult hole on the course. Rory hits a huge drive then stuffs an approach shot to 14 feet. My prediction to Gerry of a 65 is definitely in play. Speaking of Gerry, I haven’t seen him in four holes. There’s a chance the whole McIlroy clan is avoiding me. Rory, with a flair for the dramatic, drains the putt to shoot 65! He vaults himself back into contention for the championship. What a great day at Bay Hill. Check back here for Dan Redmond’s recap of the final round tomorrow.",0
18528,"Protesters Take Anti-Trump Message to His Doorstep, and Plan Next Steps - The New York Times","Thousands of demonstrators filled public squares, parks and streets in the country’s three largest cities on Saturday to protest   Donald J. Trump, part of a wave of dissent that has swelled since the presidential contest last week. They were transgender people, the children of immigrants, and parents toting infants on their back. They were families, students, and men and women of all ages and races. Many carried cardboard signs  —   “Show the world what the popular vote looks like,” read one, “Putin Won,” said another. As throngs marched through city streets, the participants joined in a cry of “Not my president!” In one of the largest   demonstrations since his election on Tuesday, a mass of people marched from Union Square in Manhattan to Trump Tower, the headquarters and home of Mr. Trump. Protesters marched around one of Mr. Trump’s buildings in Chicago. In Los Angeles, thousands of people marched up Wilshire Boulevard, forming a crowd that stretched for nearly a dozen blocks. “I’m just doing my part in democracy,” said Alfred Diaz, 25, who joined the protest in Los Angeles. “I feel that this is a way for me to voice my opinion. ” “I disagree with a lot of Trump’s stances, so I’m just out here practicing my rights,” said Mr. Diaz, who was born in Los Angeles but whose family is from Mexico. “I’m unsure and I’m unsatisfied. ” The demonstrations followed a week of protests, as thousands of people have taken to the streets. Demonstrations have taken place in Oakland, Calif. Baltimore Kansas City, Mo. Milwaukee Miami and Portland, Ore. Students have walked out of classes, protesters have blocked highways and demonstrators have clashed with the police. Speakers and protesters have talked about their fears of deportation, reduced access to to birth control, a rollback of   marriage and the potential for racially motivated violence. “We need to protest what we believe to be a disturbing turn in politics this week,” said Kimie Liu, 40, as she stood near Trump Tower in New York with her    son, Kellan, strapped to her back. “My son is here because this is the future. Trump stands for so many things I find abhorrent, and we won’t sit down when hate wins. We stand for what we believe in. ” The demonstrations have mostly been organized on the fly by local activist groups, although national organizations like Showing Up for Racial Justice and the National Action Network have supported the protest efforts. The calls to participate have come largely through Facebook and other social media. Most of the gatherings have remained peaceful, but tempers have flared sporadically. Demonstrators burned trash cans in Oakland on Wednesday night, and tried to block a highway on Thursday before the police intervened. In Portland on Thursday night, one marcher was shot, according to local reports. And after the protest there thinned out, dozens of people the police described as anarchists remained in the streets, clashing with officers. Car windows were smashed and smoke filled the air during what the police deemed a riot. In New York on Saturday, protesters were quick to describe their motivations for marching. Shaké Topalian, 71, a child of Armenian immigrants, said she was fearful of a genocide like the one her parents had survived. “I want to make sure that this does not happen again,” she said. “I refuse to be a bystander. ” Fin Justin Ross, 20, a transgender man from New Jersey, said he had woken up around 3:30 a. m. on Saturday to pick up friends for the rally. “When Trump won, my first thought was I needed to go back into the closet,” he said. Virginia Jimenez, 45, a   from Long Island said she came to the protest to show that “not all Mexicans are bad people,” she said, adding, “I raised three sons without asking for any handouts. ” Lisa Harris, also of Long Island, spoke about her father, a Holocaust survivor. “I know hate,” she said. Many protest leaders had supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary race and either did not vote or chose a   candidate in the general election, said Ben Becker, an organizer with the Answer Coalition, an antiwar and antiracism activist group based in New York. Their anger, he said, had been exacerbated by the conciliatory tone shown to Mr. Trump by President Obama and Hillary Clinton after Mrs. Clinton’s defeat. More protests are planned for the coming days, and preparations already are underway for a large demonstration at Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. It is uncharted territory for a modern American presidency. One would have to go back to Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860 to see these types of widespread demonstrations in response to the election of a president, said Douglas G. Brinkley, a presidential historian who teaches at Rice University in Houston. President Lincoln won only about 40 percent of the popular vote and was not even on the ballot in some Southern states. Spontaneous protests broke out across the country after the Lincoln victory, Professor Brinkley said. For many of the people who have turned out for the current protests, it has been a kind of group therapy, and already seem to be cementing new,   liberal coalitions. People with “Nasty Women”   have stood with signs that read “Climate change is real. ” Black Lives Matter protesters have marched alongside those proclaiming themselves “Undocumented and Unafraid. ” But beyond the commotion in the streets, activists are pursuing strategies for what they think will be tumultuous times during a Trump administration. In Wisconsin, the Latino rights group Voces de la Frontera has scheduled forums to provide emotional support to Latinos and other minorities, and to brainstorm ways to help immigrants fight policies that might hurt them. Cat Brooks, a   of the Anti   Project in Oakland, said her group and other leaders in the city were planning to raise money to provide direct services for social programs they feel certain will be cut under a Trump administration and a   Congress. They were making plans, for example, to find ways to offer diabetes testing and counseling if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. Ron Gochez, an organizer with Unión del Barrio, an immigrants rights group in Los Angeles, said that it will gather community organizations to discuss what to do if mass deportations occur. It will also train undocumented immigrants to use their cellphone cameras if immigration enforcement agents show up at their door, and help people set up emergency phone lists so they can call neighbors if they are picked up for deportation proceedings. “It’s not just saying that we’re against Trump, we have to defend ourselves against the policies he’s promising to create,” he said. Leaders from several black civil rights groups like the National Action Network and the N. A. A. C. P. have been holding conference calls to form a legislative strategy, the Rev. Al Sharpton said. They plan to lobby Congress on criminal justice reform and expanding voting rights, highlighting what they believe are the negative effects of voter identification laws and reductions in early voting periods, Mr. Sharpton said. They hope to use the stories of millions of newly insured Americans to highlight the devastating consequences of repealing the Affordable Care Act. They will fight any new    policies in court, Mr. Sharpton said, and bring witnesses to congressional hearings to challenge cabinet appointments they see as questionable. Their efforts will kick off with a rally and a march in Washington for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s birthday, just days before Mr. Trump is inaugurated, Mr. Sharpton said. “We’re not going to go away and say, because we lost an election, that we, therefore, lost our right to stand up for civil rights and civil liberty,” he said. “This, in many ways, we feel is bigger than one election. ” As the protest began to wane in Los Angeles, Jay Brown Jr. 42, surveyed the large group around him. “If you look around, there are a lot of families out here,” he said. “That should say something to you. People are trying to teach their kids what’s acceptable. ”",0
18529,Kurt Andersen-Alec Baldwin Satire Is Part of a Trump Cottage Book Industry - The New York Times,"A little more than a month into Donald J. Trump’s presidency, it’s safe to say that the satire business in America is booming. Penguin Press announced today that Kurt Andersen and Alec Baldwin will team up to write “You Can’t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump. ” The book is scheduled for publication in November. Mr. Baldwin (as President Trump) will read the audiobook version. Mr. Andersen is a novelist and the host of the public radio program “Studio 360,” but perhaps most relevant for this new project is his experience as a founding editor of the satirical Spy magazine in the 1980s. It was Spy that now famously referred to the future president as a “  vulgarian. ” The real estate mogul was often in the magazine’s cross hairs. “I didn’t think this former hobby of mine would return with this ferocity,” Mr. Andersen said in a phone interview. Mr. Baldwin’s blustering portrayal of Mr. Trump on “Saturday Night Live,” starting last fall, impresses Mr. Andersen, who said: “It is extreme, and with a guy like Donald Trump, to be effective it needs to be extreme. ” Mr. Andersen suggested the book would be an attempt to capture more of President Trump than just Mr. Baldwin’s version of him. “I think we’ll be channeling and amplifying the real Trump,” Mr. Andersen said. “Writing for a   or   sketch is different than writing a book, which has to be a narrative. ” “I think it’s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing,” Mr. Baldwin said in an email interview. “We have that arrangement whereby he doesn’t put on the wig, I don’t open up a Word document. ” Asked how the book would balance broad lampooning with cutting political commentary, Mr. Andersen said: “It’ll be sharp. I’m going to start talking like Trump: It’ll be great! It’ll be fantastic! But it will be sharp. It won’t just be  . ” Two Booker Prize winners have also been influenced by the 45th president’s election. Howard Jacobson’s novella “Pussy,” to be published in Britain in April, is a fairy tale about an egoist from a golden city who falls into a leadership position. In January, Mr. Jacobson told The Guardian that he wrote the book in a “fury of disbelief,” and that he hoped it would offer readers the “consolation of savage satire. ” And Salman Rushdie’s “The Golden House,” to be published in September, reportedly includes a character resembling Mr. Trump. Parodists have been going at the president since the campaign trail. Andrew Shaffer’s “The Day of the Donald,” published last summer, envisioned the first two years under a Trump administration. (From that book’s flap copy: “While Trump’s detractors may call him a tyrant, the American people love bullies when the victim is Congress: Every time they impeach the president, his approval rating skyrockets. ”) In 2016, the comedian and author Michael Ian Black and the illustrator Marc Rosenthal published “A Child’s First Book of Trump,” a picture book with shades of Dr. Seuss that attempted to explain Mr. Trump, a candidate at the time. “There will be a moment when this will be over,” Mr. Baldwin said. “When Trump will fade into ignominy and take with him his ability to outstrip satire. ” Of course, a republic cannot live on satire alone, and several books are in the works that take a more straightforward look at Trump’s election and presidency. Publishers are betting that the new administration will be a boon for sales, much like the Clinton and Obama years drove conservative titles up the   lists. Agents, editors and publishers have been snapping up everything from campaign trail memoirs to   books with images from the women’s march to titles that sound suspiciously like   books (Gene Stone’s “The Trump Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living Through What You Hoped Would Never Happen”). Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington has already written “The Case for Impeachment,” which will be published in April. Reporters who were on the Trump beat in 2016 will also offer inside looks at the campaign. In “My Year Covering Trump,” the Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold will detail his eventful time writing about the candidate. Mr. Fahrenthold conducted a very public investigation of Mr. Trump’s charitable giving, enlisting the help of people on Twitter to find out whether donations had been made. He also exposed the video in which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women off camera with the “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. The NBC News reporter Katy Tur has sold the rights to a memoir called “Unbelievable. ” Mr. Trump referred to Ms. Tur several times in front of crowds, singling her out for criticism while he discussed the media’s treatment of him. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump will get to have his own say about his presidency in a book someday. For now, the previous president is one step closer to that reality  —   earlier this week, Penguin Random House won a highly competitive auction to publish future books by both Barack and Michelle Obama.",0
18530,"For Incarcerated, Contraband Cell Phones Are Lifeline To Outside","Jails and prisons across the country struggle to tamp down the sale and use of contraband cell phones. But for many prisoners, especially those involved in the national prison strike against slave labor, access to such technology is considered a lifeline.
Prisoners in Alabama, South Carolina, New York, and other states use contraband phones to communicate with family, supporters, and members of the media about their work, and to document the violence, deteriorating and filthy facilities, and the testimonies of other incarcerated people. If prisoners did not have access to these cell phones, it’s possible the public would know even less about the prison strike than they do today.
“A lot of people have phones in prison. But a lot of them are scared to use them the way we use them. It’s complicated,” said a prisoner, who was granted anonymity to prevent retaliation from prison officials. “Being able to stay in contact with our families is helpful as far as rehabilitation goes.”
“Cell phones are part of the day to day life that we live in today. To say that you’re preparing someone to re-enter society and to rehabilitate them [and then] say that they can’t have access to a cell phone is contradictory,” the prisoner argued. “This serves as a supplement to rehabilitation but also it allows us to be connected to society, to the actual world that we’re going to be entering back into when we go back out there.”
“They don’t let the media inside of any prisons in any state. If they do allow the media to come in, it’s a dog and pony show. They walk them where they wanna walk them. They don’t let them talk to nobody they don’t really want them to talk to. So there’s no realistic perspective of what prisons are really all about.”
“With these cell phones, it allows us to put the reality out there, and they’re afraid of that. And they should be, because of what’s going on in the prisons.”
Another incarcerated person, who operates the @prisonslavery1 Twitter account, told Shadowproof, “The prison system slave drivers want to muffle our voice, dehumanize us through silence.”
“With them allowed to control the narrative and the prisoners silenced under brutal repression tactics, it’s a win-win for the enslavers. These phones level the playing fields. These (weapons) will go down in history as an essential tool used by 21st century slaves,” they said. “These weapons will cause their collapse. As we continue to expose them and push for human rights”
Going back to the prisoner, who spoke about cell phones as a connection to society, the phones may be especially useful to incarcerated parents eager to play a role in their children’s lives.
“Children live in households that they’re not in control of. They can’t just call collect to reach someone else’s house. They may be able to get a phone and let’s say their child acts out and they’re going through something. Well, that child can call their parent, their daddy or their momma on the cell phone and say, ‘Dad I’m in a bad situation. What do I do?'”
“But the wall phone, [the child] can’t call the wall phone. That’s a problem that [the parent] can’t offer advice, that he can’t help.”
The prisoner pointed out that many of these phones are smuggled in by the officers and sold at a high price to the incarcerated. But he argued the primary motivation for prison officials to clampdown on contraband phones is that it deprives them of a revenue stream.
“They’ll say, ‘Well, if you got the money to pay for the cell phone, you should be able to pay for the [wall] phone bill. But the cell phone allows us unlimited calls. The wall phone you have to pay every time you use the phone.”
“So if I pay $60 a month and I get unlimited calls, well that may be five or ten phone calls on a wall phone. And after that it’s over with. It’s not an unlimited amount of time on the phone call.”
“You get 15 minutes—that’s a $6 phone call,” they added. “You got to hang up and call back. Fifteen more minutes, six more dollars, so you can run through your 10 phone calls in just a few hours and that’s it. You can’t talk to anyone else for the rest of the month ’cause they don’t have money.”
“So [cell phones] just make it easier, it makes everyone more accessible. They can check on their cases, if they cant find information they can call a lawyer or they can seek legal help. You can’t do that on a wall phone, you really can’t help yourself on a wall phone.”
“If they allowed us to have cell phones and they told us they were gonna monitor our calls, no one would care,” the prisoner argued. “The issue is not that they’re monitoring our phone calls, we’re not on the phone trying to get in touch with ISIS or no shit like that. We’re trying to call our brothers and see how their day was at school.”
The prisoner mocked the argument by prison officials that the phone are how they get drugs in the prison. He noted drugs have been in prisons since their inception.
“They had drugs and shit, since the first time the prison doors open. So the cell phones do not facilitate anything. If the individual wants to commit crime, they’re gonna do it regardless. So the cell phone is not a part of that.”

18531,Secret Israeli Operation Brings Tons Of Winter Supplies To Syrian Refugees,"TEL AVIV  —   A clandestine Israeli initiative has gathered over a hundred tons of winter supplies bound for Syrian refugees who have no idea that the donations come from the   enemy state next door. [Identifying tags and Hebrew logos have been removed from 3, 000 boxes of blankets, coats, sleeping bags, gloves and boots in order “to protect the effort and the recipients,” a statement from the organizers of “Operation Human Warmth” said.  Jointly organized by Zionist youth movement HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, Dror Israel and the Combat Genocide Association, the supplies will be handed over to another aid organization that will distribute the items to the refugees. The sensitive nature of the mission means the exact date and method of delivery have not been revealed. Gilad Perry, Dror Israel’s international collaborations director, said he was moved by the amount of Israelis  —   Jewish, Arab and Druze  —   who came together for the operation. “I thought people would be reluctant to support an effort they would not get credit for,” Perry said. “I was amazed to see how wrong I was. The generosity of people just caring for those who suffer from the cold winter on the other side of the border, in an ‘enemy country,’ overwhelmed me. ” “The most moving part of the operation for me is to see thousands of Israelis from different religions join forces in a humanistic effort, emphasizing the similarities in the core values of all of us who simply try to make good on this planet, no matter what our backgrounds may be,” Perry added. Last month, Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Israel is set to absorb more than 100 Syrian child refugees who have been orphaned as a result of the civil war. Over 2, 500 Syrians have been treated in Israeli hospitals since 2013, even though Syria and Israel have officially been in a state of war since 1948.",0
18532,Marco Rubio Pushes Left-Wing Conspiracy Theory About Trump Advancing Russian Interests in Ukraine,"During Tuesday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) pushed the misleading Democratic Party talking point that the Republican Party platform was changed to “not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. ”[Here is a transcript of the relevant section of the hearing:   RUBIO: My last question, you were on the foreign policy team and the Republican platform was changed to not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. Were you involved in that decision and do you know how the change was made?  SESSIONS: I was not active in the platform committee and did not participate in that, and I don’t think I had direct involvement. RUBIO: Do you know who did or you have no recollection of a debate about that issue internally in the campaign? SESSIONS: I never watched the debate, if it occurred, on the platform committee. I think it did. So I don’t recall that, Senator. I’d have to think about that. Rubio was alluding to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had the Republican Party platform changed on the issue of Ukraine to allegedly aid Russian interests. The charge, which comes mostly from a Washington Post opinion piece, remains so unproven that even the   PolitiFact   fact checker failed to reach a judgement on the issue, allowing “it’s hard to use those news reports as evidence in this  . ” The entire issue revolved around one platform committee member, a Ted Cruz supporter, who wanted to use language calling for the U. S. to provide “lethal defensive weapons” to the Ukrainian military. Instead the platform eventually called for “appropriate assistance” to Ukraine  —   which leaves open the possibility of providing “lethal defensive weapons”  —   and called for “greater coordination with NATO defense planning. ” That was enough for the Washington Post’s Josh Rogin to pen an opinion piece titled “Trump campaign guts GOP’s   stance on Ukraine. ” MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow used the tidbit to claim on television that “something weird” happened regarding “that Ukraine and Russia thing” on the platform. She claimed the Trump campaign “jumped right up on that and they insisted that that plank only, that one, had to be taken out, that language could not stand. ” Writing at the Washington Examiner, media critic Byron York noted: Missing from all the talk is what the Republican platform actually said before it was allegedly “gutted” by Trump. What did the original draft of the platform say about Russia and Ukraine? Was it, in fact, changed? If so, how? As it turns out, a look at the original draft of the platform  —   which has never been released publicly  —   shows that it always had tough language on Russian aggression in Ukraine. And not only did that language stay in the final platform  —   nothing was taken out  —   it was actually strengthened, not weakened, as a result of events at the convention.   …     Not only that, the later, final platform contained a few additional words on Russia and Ukraine that weren’t in the original draft. To the first passage cited above, after “from the Baltic to the Caucasus,” the GOP platform committee added this: Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

18533,"Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, North Dakota: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times"," (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • Trump and taxes. The Times obtained documents that show that Donald J. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income in the early 1990s by using a maneuver that his lawyers warned would most likely be deemed improper by an I. R. S. audit. “Whatever loophole existed was not ‘exploited’ here, but stretched beyond any recognition,” said one of the tax experts who reviewed the documents. Here’s how Mr. Trump structured his companies to gain personal tax advantages. • Clinton and emails. The F. B. I. is using a special computer program to see if recently discovered emails belonging to a top aide to Hillary Clinton contained classified information. The software should show whether the messages were already examined during the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private server, officials said. James B. Comey’s decision to start the new review so close to Election Day has led some historians to draw parallels between the F. B. I. director and an infamous predecessor: J. Edgar Hoover, who ordered the bureau to wiretap the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. • Interview with Bashar  . The Syrian president rejected any personal responsibility for the war raging in his country, and placed all the blame on the U. S. and on Islamic militants, during a recent interview with our reporter. Mr. Assad also said he will remain in office until at least 2021, when his third   term ends. • North Dakota oil pipeline protests. Demonstrators in the monthslong fight against the $3. 7 billion Dakota Access project say it will threaten water supplies, and members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe say it violates their right to sacred land. The protests have led to numerous clashes with local law enforcement. We interviewed a protester and a sheriff’s deputy to explore both sides of the debate. • Pope attempts to heal religious rift. Pope Francis was in Sweden on Monday to observe the 499th anniversary of Martin Luther’s protest of the sale of indulgences, which set off more than a century of religious warfare and forever changed the practice of Christianity. The pope noted the positive impact of Luther’s actions on Catholicism. “The Protestant Reformation helped give greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the church’s life,” he said. • Physical triumphs. “Having something foreign in my body after a cancer diagnosis is the last thing I wanted,” said Debbie Bowers, a breast cancer survivor. “I just wanted to heal. ” She is one of a growing number of women “going flat” rather than having additional surgery to reconstruct their breasts. Separately, we spent time with competitors in a megatriathlon race that requires 703 miles of swimming, biking and running over five days. “This is not good for my body,” one participant said, “but it is good for my soul. ” • The yogurt company Chobani and its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, have been criticized for hiring refugees and are being targeted by racist attacks on social media. “He’s the xenophobe’s nightmare,” the executive director of Human Rights Watch said. “Here’s an immigrant who isn’t competing for jobs, but is creating jobs big time. ” • The tech billionaire Peter Thiel defended his support of Mr. Trump in a speech on Monday, and said that Silicon Valley was out of touch with most of the country. “I think the truth has been more one of specific success but more general failure,” he said, suggesting that the tech industry had not done much for people outside of Silicon Valley. • What happens to all the leftover Halloween candy? Buyback programs and donation drives for charities help absorb the surplus. • U. S. stocks were slightly down on Monday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • Be transported. We’re introducing a series of immersive 360 videos that let you experience Times journalism in a powerful new way. The first offers a rare glimpse of   Yemen after a deadly airstrike. Watch it here. • New to read. The ranks of the literary detective are getting a new member. His name is Isaiah Quintabe (the book is titled “IQ”) and he’s from the same part of Long Beach, Calif. as Snoop Dogg. Our reviewer calls Quintabe a “fine, durable character for the long run. ” We also recently reviewed the latest horror novels, and six new thrillers for fall. • World Series, Game 6. The Cleveland Indians can win their first title since 1948 tonight (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox) or the Chicago Cubs can force a    Game 7. Either way, relief pitching has been the dominant story of the series, our columnist writes. • Recipes of the day. Learn how to master two   side dishes: roasted vegetables and fried rice. Halloween may be over in the United States, but Mexico and Central America are celebrating Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. Hundreds of years ago, the Aztecs of that region honored their dead with elaborate rituals in the summer. The invading Spanish could not stamp out the tradition, and it was eventually merged with the Roman Catholic holidays of All Saints Day (Nov. 1) and All Souls Day the next day. Decorative skulls made of sugar are the most famous symbols of the holiday. They’re sometimes eaten or used on masks and dolls to represent the sweetness of life. People honoring Day of the Dead also visit the graves of their relatives and build ofrendas, or small altars with flowers and gifts, inside their homes. On Saturday, Mexico City hosted its first official Día de los Muertos parade. The inspiration: last year’s James Bond movie. “Spectre” begins with a chase through a Day of the Dead parade, and Mexican officials saw an opportunity to promote the capital city. Tens of thousands of people attended the parade. Among the marchers was a troupe dressed as Aztec warriors on   skates. “It would be hard to conserve these traditions without any changes,” its leader said. Karen Zraick contributed reporting.

18536,"Trump Digs In on Wiretap, No Matter Who Says Differently - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   The former president denied it. So did the former national intelligence director. The F. B. I. director has said privately that it is false. The speaker of the House and the chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees  —   all three Republican  —   see no indications that it happened. But President Trump insists he is right. No matter how many officials, even in his own party, dismiss his unsubstantiated claim that President Barack Obama secretly tapped his phones last year, the White House made clear on Thursday that it would stand by the assertion. Ultimately, it insisted, the president will be proved correct. Nearly two weeks after Mr. Trump first accused his predecessor in a series of Saturday morning Twitter posts, the standoff between the president and the available record has come to shadow the White House even as it tries to overhaul the nation’s health care system and drastically rewrite the federal budget. Much like his longstanding assertion that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States, Mr. Trump dismisses contrary information with undiminished surety. Indeed, the White House even added a new assertion on Thursday during a fiercely combative and sometimes surreal briefing by the press secretary, Sean Spicer, who berated reporters and read from news accounts that either did not back up the president’s claims or had been refuted by intelligence officials. One report that Mr. Spicer read contended that Mr. Obama used Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters, the signals agency known as GCHQ, to spy on Mr. Trump. In effect, the White House was embracing a claim that the United States’ closest ally collaborated with a president against a presidential candidate. “There’s widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election, there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people,” Mr. Spicer said. Asked if the president stood by his original allegation, Mr. Spicer said, “He stands by it. ” The White House defiance came shortly after the top two senators overseeing the intelligence community joined the chorus of lawmakers debunking the claim. “Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,” Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement. The blunt conclusion by the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee means that all four congressional leaders who oversee   surveillance by the government have rejected Mr. Trump’s claim. On Wednesday, their counterparts on the House Intelligence Committee, Representatives Devin Nunes, a Republican, and Adam B. Schiff, a Democrat, both from California, made similar statements. For the president’s staff, the continuing furor over his claim has produced mixed responses. Some advisers, privately recognizing that there is no evidence to support it, are increasingly frustrated that it continues to dominate the conversation in Washington and wish Mr. Trump would find a way to let it go. At the same time, they feel besieged by what they see as a hostile Washington establishment and resent the carping. In some cases, as Mr. Spicer did at his briefing, they argue that the news media has   information to make the president look bad. But they assume that Mr. Trump will stick by his assertion no matter what comes out of an emerging congressional investigation. After all, he refused to back off his “birther” allegation  —   and then only grudgingly  —   until five years after Mr. Obama produced a birth certificate showing that he had been born in Hawaii. In this case, Mr. Trump sees the surveillance allegation as a way to push back against what he considers the unfair insinuation that he somehow colluded with the Russians during last year’s election  —   another assertion for which intelligence committee leaders have said they so far have found no evidence. In recent days, the president and his aides have tried to recast his original assertion to make it more defensible. Mr. Trump and Mr. Spicer have both noted that in two Twitter posts the president used quotation marks around the phrases “wires tapped” or “wire tapping,” which they said indicated that they were not meant to be taken literally. “That really covers surveillance and many other things,” Mr. Trump told Tucker Carlson in an interview on Wednesday night on Fox News. “Nobody ever talks about the fact that it was in quotes, but that’s a very important thing. ” That, however, ignores the fact that two other messages Mr. Trump posted that morning did not use quotation marks and were pretty specific. “How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process,” he wrote in one, misspelling the word tap. “This is  . Bad (or sick) guy!” Mr. Trump also suggested that he had secret evidence no one else had seen. He told Mr. Carlson that he “will be submitting things before the committee very soon that hasn’t been submitted as of yet  —   but it’s potentially a very serious situation. ” Mr. Trump added, “You’re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks. ” The White House staff took its cue from that interview and mapped out an aggressive defense on Thursday. Mr. Trump was already angry that two courts had blocked his temporary travel ban even though he had been assured by his staff that his latest one would pass judicial muster. So Mr. Spicer headed to the lectern on Thursday primed for a fight and armed with a stack of news clippings that he read at length to justify the president’s claim. “The bottom line is the investigation by the House and the Senate has not been provided all the information,” Mr. Spicer said. But Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mr. Warner, later responded: “The bipartisan leaders of the Intelligence Committee would not have made the statement they made without having been fully briefed by the appropriate authorities. ” At the White House briefing, among the articles Mr. Spicer read from were several from The New York Times. However, none of them actually reported that Mr. Obama had authorized surveillance of Mr. Trump or that Mr. Trump had been eavesdropped. The Times has reported that law enforcement agencies are investigating contacts between some associates of Mr. Trump and Russian figures and had access to intercepted communications. Other news reports cited by Mr. Trump on Wednesday night and Mr. Spicer on Thursday repeated   claims that a secret foreign intelligence court had approved a surveillance order involving Mr. Trump in October. Reporters from The Times have not been able to corroborate the existence of such an order. The British assertions came from a Fox News commentator, Andrew Napolitano. Early on Friday, GCHQ, the British communications intelligence agency, issued a statement denying that it had wiretapped Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign, saying that the allegations were “nonsense. ” “They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. ” The agency rarely comments on intelligence matters its statement was both unusual and unusually vehement. Mr. Spicer complained that reporters had not focused on a comment by Mr. Nunes, the House intelligence chairman, that “it’s possible” that intelligence agencies could have swept up others in the course of their surveillance, including Mr. Trump. Mr. Nunes did note that Mr. Trump was concerned about “other surveillance activities looking at him and his associates” and said his committee would find out. But Mr. Nunes was firm in saying that Mr. Trump’s original Twitter posts were not borne out by the facts. “I don’t believe there was an actual tap of Trump Tower,” he said on Wednesday. If Mr. Trump’s posts were to be taken literally, “then clearly the president was wrong,” Mr. Nunes said. That was not a word the White House was willing to use on Thursday. Asked if Mr. Trump would apologize to Mr. Obama if it turned out he was wrong, Mr. Spicer demurred. “We’re not going to prejudge what the outcome of this is,” he said. “I think we’ve got to let the process work its will, and then when there’s a report that comes out conclusive from there, then we’ll be able to comment. ”",0
18537,"Tested by Russia, NATO Struggles to Stay Credible - The New York Times","BRUSSELS  —   Six weeks before a critical summit meeting aimed at bolstering NATO’s deterrence against a resurgent Russia, the alliance is facing a long list of challenges. The first is to find a country to lead the last of four military units to be deployed in Poland and the three Baltic nations. But that, analysts say, could be the least of its problems. Security concerns are as high now as they have been since the end of the Cold War. As the immigration crisis has strained relations within the Continent, anxieties have been heightened by Russian military offensives in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and a bombing campaign in Syria that has demonstrated Moscow’s rapidly increasing capabilities. Lately, Russia has talked openly about the utility of tactical nuclear weapons. Despite the growing threats, many European countries still resist strong measures to strengthen NATO. Many remain reluctant to increase military spending, despite past pledges. Some, like Italy, are cutting back. France is reverting to its traditional skepticism toward the alliance, which it sees as an instrument of American policy and an infringement on its sovereignty. And that is not to mention the declarations of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, that NATO is “obsolete,” that the allies are “ripping off” the United States and that he would not really be concerned if the alliance broke up. While that may be campaign bluster, it does reflect a growing unwillingness in the United States to shoulder a disproportionate share of the NATO burden, militarily and financially. The current concern, and a major element of what the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, calls “the biggest reinforcement of collective defense since the end of the Cold War,” is the decision to put four combat battalions of up to 1, 000 soldiers each in those   countries bordering Russia. While Britain, Germany and the United States have agreed to lead one battalion each, to be filled out with soldiers from other NATO allies to preserve the idea of multinational forces, leadership of the fourth is not yet in sight as the July   summit meeting in Warsaw rapidly approaches. The United States “is not thinking about doing two,” said its ambassador to NATO, Douglas E. Lute. “We’re planning to do one and get our allies to step up” for the other three. But other larger nations like Italy and France have declined. Italy cut military spending after pledging to increase it two years ago in Wales. Its leaders say it is already participating in a newly enlarged alliance   force. And France, which has reverted under the current Socialist government to a more mistrusting view of NATO and its American leadership, is stretched thin in its military campaigns in Mali, the Central African Republic and North Africa and Syria, let alone patrolling its own streets against terrorist attack. France is likely to contribute only about 150 soldiers to the new deployments, NATO officials say, after finally agreeing to the idea of forward deployments in Poland after initial opposition. Germany, which six months ago opposed these deployments, agreed in return for efforts at renewed dialogue with Russia. It also agreed to lead one battalion. So the search goes on for a fourth lead nation. Mr. Stoltenberg is confident it will be found by the summit meeting. The deployments are important, because these combat battalions are designed not to be simple tripwires, but to be large enough and sufficiently well equipped to do an invader real damage. Then they can be reinforced more quickly with the enhanced   force and  —   another NATO and American decision  —   to station another United States armored combat brigade of around 5, 000 soldiers in Europe (for a total of three) and to   its heavy equipment like tanks and artillery. Poland is demanding that some of that equipment be   on its territory, but for the moment, most of it will go to Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, which have storage and transport facilities dating from the Cold War. Only now, in fact, is NATO actually surveying the infrastructure  —   the bridges, roads and railways  —   of relatively newer member states in Central and Eastern Europe, not having judged it necessary before to plan how to quickly reinforce them in case of a Russian invasion.   in Eastern Europe would currently require large sums for capital investment to build special new warehouses and infrastructure, Mr. Lute said. Poland, eager to send messages to Moscow, did succeed in advancing groundbreaking for a ballistic missile defense site to coincide with the operational opening of one in Romania. While Mr. Stoltenberg and Washington insist that such missile defenses are not aimed at Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles, Moscow is not convinced. Here, too, France has been skeptical, nervous that the reaction time of missile defense will circumvent the political oversight of the North Atlantic Council, the assembly of member states and their ambassadors that makes NATO decisions by consensus. For the same reason, France has been reluctant to allow the NATO supreme commander, who is always an American general, too much authority to act in a crisis, which others say is needed to respond quickly. But the initial missile defense program, combined with new forward deployments near Russia (to be rotated, to avoid calling them “permanent”) and an enlarged rapid reaction force, supposedly ready to deploy in 48 hours, all are a measure of how much Russia’s recent actions have changed NATO’s calculations. NATO is trying to reassure vulnerable members like the Baltic States, Poland and even southern members, like Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey on the Black Sea, that the alliance intends to deliver on its promise of collective defense. Missile defense is part of the response, along with more naval exercises in the Black Sea and more consistent overflights by reconnaissance aircraft. As Mr. Stoltenberg points out, the impact of Russian policy has finally pushed European members of NATO to at least halt the   decline in military spending. This year, he said, estimates are that European allies will as a whole increase military spending, something Washington has been demanding, even though most are not yet spending the 2 percent of G. D. P. that is the NATO guideline. Some 16 of the 28 member states have increased military spending in real terms, with only Italy, Bulgaria and Croatia still cutting, although they insist that the cuts are temporary. “I know the mood in Washington and I understand it: the Americans want to see the Europeans doing more, contributing more,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “This has been my main message in European capitals. ” Still, there is another troubling   issue for NATO  —   how to deal with a new Russian military doctrine that considers the utility of tactical nuclear weapons at the beginning of a conflict, as a deterrent against an adversary retaking territory, followed by what planners call “a quick  . ” Some member nations believe that Russia already has nuclear weapons in the enclave of Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea, where it publicly displayed nuclear warheads in a previous exercise. Russia has been unclear about whether they have been removed. While aware of public horror about using nuclear weapons, Mr. Stoltenberg, Mr. Lute and others emphasize that NATO “remains a nuclear alliance” and that its deterrence is meant to be “seamless,” ranging from responses to cyberattacks through conventional weapons and if necessary, nuclear weapons, too. NATO does not regard its nuclear arsenal as having any use other than political deterrence, Mr. Stoltenberg said. “But as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world,” he said, “we have to remain a nuclear alliance. ”",0
18538,Russia Kicked Out Of UN Human Rights Council; Saudi Arabia Reelected | RedFlag News,"
Zero Hedge 
The UN is a joke! 
Yesterday, for the first time since 2006, Russia failed to be re-elected for a spot on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) - which until July was chaired by none other than Saudi Arabia - after being narrowly beaten by Croatia in a vote. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was successfully re-elected, despite vocal criticism from human rights organizations. The 47 places on the council are distributed on a regional basis, with staggered elections seeing a third of the body re-elected each year. Russia had finished its three-year term, and was running against Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. 
The decision was close, and came down to just two votes: with Hungary far ahead, Croatia received the votes of 114 of the 193 member countries, and Russia was selected on 112 ballots. 
""It was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We've been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,"" Russia's UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said quoted by RT . Russia is eligible to run next year, against a new set of countries. 
Ahead of this year’s vote Russia came under concerted pressure from human rights organizations. “The non-election of Russia shows that the nations of the world can reject gross abusers if they so choose,” said executive director Hillel Neuer. “This makes the election of Saudi Arabia, China and Cuba even more preposterous.” 
As we reported earlier this week , a petition signed by 80 NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and Refugees International, asked the voting countries to ""question seriously whether Russia's role in Syria which includes supporting and undertaking military actions which have routinely targeted civilians and civilian objects renders it fit to serve on the UN's premier inter-governmental human rights institution."" Russia dismissed the petition, published this week, as “cynical” and “dishonorable,” and said the accusations were motivated more by politics than by concern for human rights. Moscow, which has been conducting airstrikes in the country over the past year, says that it is acting legally, following an official call for assistance from the Syrian government, and insists that its war efforts are targeted at terrorists. 
However, most perversely, in what was clearly a politically-motivated choice, Saudi Arabia sailed through the Asian regional ballot with 152 votes, and will sit on the UNHRC alongside China, Japan and Iraq for the next three years. ",0

According to legend, the temple was designed that way to honor the days of the ancient ruler’s coronation and his birthday with sunlight. But if the legend’s true, then the light has been arriving a day late for several decades. In the 1960s, the    temple was moved inland to save it from rising water levels caused by the Aswan Dam. More than a thousand blocks of stone were meticulously cut and transported to its current location. “We didn’t lose a single baboon,” an engineer working on the project told The Times then. He was referring to the scores of carved baboons at the temple’s entrance, which are shown barking at the rising sun. The move pushed back, by a day, the arrival of sunlight to the inner sanctum. It now happens on Feb. 22 and Oct. 22. The mummy of Ramses II has also narrowly avoided obliteration in recent decades. In 1974, it was flown to Paris where scientists attempted to slow its deterioration. Egypt issued the mummy a passport on that occasion, its profession listed as: “King (deceased). ” Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

18540,America’s Poor still Getting the Shaft,"By Sami Jamil Jadallah on November 3, 2016 
In a few days, the ugliest and most distasteful presidential election in US history will be over, and we will see which candidate won to preside over the US as president. This is an election that is all about groping and emails, making us the laughing stock of the world. 
As we all saw in this campaign, there was little of anything about the priorities that really matter to the American people. Both candidates talk about bringing back jobs, industrial and manufacturing jobs. 
We know well that both are liars and will never bring back the kind of industrial and manufacturing jobs that gave middle-class Americans a sense of dignity and security. 
The two candidates did their best to cater to the rich and powerful, the people with the money and the billionaires who always shaped our nation agenda and politics. 
Billions have poured into this year national elections, no different from previous national/presidential elections where close to $5 billion were injected in and invested in the elections. The returns are for the donors never for the voters. 
America’s poor, not only Black and Hispanic but White as well have been neglected for a long time. They are getting the “ shaft” everywhere and from everyone, especially from Congress, that empower corporate America to screw the poor at every turn and in every way. And Congress does that through legislation that gives incentives to corporations to locate their manufacturing jobs overseas, that allows banks and financial institutions especially the credit card companies to give the shaft to the poor. What does the future hold for our next generation? 
It should not be surprising that this great country of ours has such a staggering number of poor — over 45 million or 14.5% of the population — with the prospect that most Americans will be part of this category at least one year, if they are between the age of 24-75 years. 
Not all poor are unemployed living off the system, but there are millions of these poor who are working hard, very hard one or two jobs to make ends meet, with Hispanics and Blacks most likely to be among this category than Asians and Whites; with women more likely than men to fall into this category of working poor; and with White males with less than a high school education spending at least one year in this category. 
It is hard to think, in this country of plentiful that 46.5 million people earn less than $19,090 a year, and 20.4 million are in deep poverty, earning less than $11,510 a year. 
While our presidential candidates cater to the rich and powerful seeking their support, no candidates are talking about the poor-paying jobs that Americans have; with 50% of available jobs paying less than $34,000 annually. Talk about the banks and financial institutions that looted tens of millions from Americans’ pension funds during the financial crisis of 2007-8, or the fact that Congress allowed corporations to restructure, benefiting Wall Street and the investors, while cheating workers out of their pensions and health care. Of course, Republicans talk about eliminating “entitlements” for the poor, while forgetting or neglecting the kind of entitlements the US Military gets, or the kind of entitlements corporations and rich executives get as part of the deal worked out with members of Congress — entitlements that are triple what the hard-working and poor American gets. 
It is true that 27 families out of 100 get cash assistance, but not all of them are Black or Hispanic, as we are lead to believe, thus causing an outcry to end the Welfare system. I should note here that 90% of the entitlements goes to the elderly and the poor and retired workers on social security and Medicare, amounting to $500 billion. 
But then let us look at how the system, which is sponsored and nurtured by Congress screws American every day. 
Let us take, for example, the interest rates charged on credit cards. In most cases, the poor are the ones who gets behind on credit card payments and as such, the interest rates charged is almost twice as much as the average rate and moreover if one gets behind on one payment on one credit cards, all the other credit card companies hike the rate. Thus the poor pay a higher price and costs. 
With high-interest rates charged and the likelihood of default on one payment, then the credit ratings are changed, forcing the poor to pay higher interests on car loans and on mortgage loans. 
What is truly a rip off is the fact that companies like “payday loans” and “car title companies” while considered as banks receiving funds at less than 1% can charge borrowers 30 even 50%? Unconscionable. 
The poor also get the shafts from health care companies especially supplemental insurance. Because of the fact that the poor are most likely to suffer from certain chronic diseases such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes, their rates are much higher than the average. 
Add to that the way our schools are funded. Since we do not have a national tax plan that funds education, all the funding comes from property tax. 
As such if you are in a poor neighborhood, the income to support the schools system, the police, and the fire department is much less than in affluent communities and, as such, children get less quality education, and most likely they will be among the poor who will live on government subsidies; and most likely these neighborhoods will have higher crime rates and a higher percentage of incarceration. What the government saves in support of education, it pays double that in the cost of crime and incarceration. This simply makes no sense, as a society. 
I leave you with two incidents that I personally experienced. 
– Supplemental Health Insurance : We, I mean those of us over the age of 65, have and must purchase supplemental health insurance to complement our Medicare. I purchased a policy from UnitedHealth through AARP paying $258 a month. After almost a year, I discovered that the CEO of UnitedHealth earned $60,500,000/year in salary. I made a simple calculation; and it was shocking to realize that I have to pay 19,500 years of monthly premium just to pay his salary for one year. Of course, I dropped UnitedHealth because of this. 
– Exploitation of Disadvantaged Communities : The other when I had my private company, which offered auto dealers a smart loyalty card, where dealers can add to the card special packages, such as oil change, discount on maintenance, and extended warranty, while consumers benefited from being able to keep track of their vehicle service and maintenence records on the smart chip in the card (Patented), thus saving car owners from getting ripped off by duplicate or unwarranted repairs. Many dealers especially those in the poor neighborhoods where charging the poor interest rates exceeding 20% on car loans, and forcing these poor guys to buy additional warranties, and charging them thousands of dollars of services the dealers knew the customers would never need. I had to drop these dealers from my network. 
Who knows, maybe one day, we will have a Congress and presidential candidates who will represent, not only the very rich but the very poor and the middle class, and offer solutions that get the people to work and out of welfare and subsidies. The American people are not lazy, but they need an opportunity; and Trump and Clinton will not bring that opportunity. America’s problem is not the presidency, but Congress, and that is where the changes must take place.",0
18541,Tensions Deepen Between Donald Trump and R.N.C. - The New York Times,"The Republican National Committee had high hopes that Donald J. Trump would deliver a compassionate and measured speech about immigration on Wednesday, and prepared to lavish praise on the candidate on the party’s Twitter account. So when Mr. Trump instead offered a fiery denunciation of migrant criminals and suggested deporting Hillary Clinton, Reince Priebus, the party chairman, signaled that aides should scrap the plan, and the committee made no statement at all. The evening tore a painful new wound in Mr. Trump’s relationship with the Republican National Committee, imperiling his most important remaining political alliance. Mr. Priebus and his organization have been steadfastly supportive of Mr. Trump, defending him in public and spending millions of dollars to aid him. But the collaboration between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Mr. Priebus’s committee has grown strained over the last month, according to six senior Republicans with detailed knowledge of both groups, some of whom asked to speak anonymously for fear of exacerbating tensions. There is no prospect of a full public breach between the Trump campaign and the R. N. C. because both sides rely on a joint   arrangement crucial to their election efforts. But tensions have grown to such a point that they threaten to diminish the party’s ability to work smoothly with Mr. Trump during the most critical   Day phase of the race, when the committee traditionally helps supervise an extensive voter turnout effort. Mr. Trump, who has struggled to raise money, is dependent on his party’s national committee to perform many of the basic functions of a presidential campaign. Should the partnership continue to deteriorate, it could hinder Mr. Trump’s bid for a late comeback in the race. Mr. Priebus said in a statement that there was no significant friction between his committee and the Trump campaign, describing theirs as a “fantastic working relationship. ” “Any insinuation to the contrary is purely overblown gossip,” Mr. Priebus said. And Jason Miller, Mr. Trump’s spokesman, said: “Cooperation between the Trump campaign and the R. N. C. has never been better  —   we are fully integrated. Everybody knows what has to be done to elect Mr. Trump and stop Hillary Clinton. ” But senior advisers to Mr. Priebus and Mr. Trump have collided over the turbulence in the campaign, the senior Republicans said. Mr. Trump’s top policy adviser questioned Mr. Priebus’s competence in a caustic email this week after the Phoenix speech. And Mr. Trump’s    Jared Kushner, and Mr. Priebus’s chief of staff clashed in a tense meeting over the use of the committee’s war chest. Within Mr. Trump’s circle, there is impatience with what advisers view as a cautious and conventional party bureaucracy,   to accommodate Mr. Trump’s improvisational style. At times, Trump aides have vented that frustration in language that was contemptuous of Mr. Priebus, a genial Wisconsin lawyer who has been chairman for five years. When Mr. Trump’s immigration speech this week spurred resignations from the National Hispanic Advisory Council for Trump, a   group, one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers lashed out at Mr. Priebus in an email to the campaign staff. “The RNC needs to take control of this situation and quickly,” wrote Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s senior policy adviser, who often travels with the candidate. Describing the Hispanic Republicans who resigned in dismay as “professional amnesty lobbyists,” Mr. Miller asked, “Can Reince do his job?” Inside the committee, top officials have lost confidence in Mr. Trump’s ability to right his listing campaign, according to the senior Republicans. Complaints abound about the haphazard nature of Mr. Trump’s operation, in which power is so divided among strategists and members of the Trump family that the process of making even simple decisions is laborious and unpredictable. Mr. Trump is on his third campaign leadership team, having dismissed two previous chief advisers, and he has already fired two senior staff members, Rick Wiley and Ed Brookover, whose jobs included coordinating his strategy with the R. N. C. Mr. Priebus, who has a warm relationship with Mr. Trump and speaks with him daily, has also confided to some Republicans that he has been disappointed by Mr. Trump’s failure to evolve as a candidate in the general election. He denied in a statement that he had complained about Mr. Trump’s refusal to shift course. “I’ve said exactly the opposite,” Mr. Priebus said. “I think he’s had his best three weeks. ” Robin Hayes, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he was optimistic about the emerging relationship between his organization and the Trump campaign in his own state. But Mr. Hayes said it was widely understood within the national committee that Mr. Trump needed to make adjustments. “There have been discussions, that we don’t need to create, ‘Cleanup on Aisle 3,’ for ourselves,” Mr. Hayes said. “He’s still going to be Trump  —   that’s important  —   but Trump in a way that fits into a general election. ” Throughout the campaign, Mr. Priebus and his committee have been broadly deferential to Mr. Trump, declining to criticize many of his most provocative remarks and quickly designating him as the party’s presumptive nominee in May. For Mr. Trump, Mr. Priebus has appeared to be a patient and accommodating partner, eager to promote his campaign and willing to rebuke Republicans who have declined to support him. Recently, the committee has sent aides to work several days a week at Trump Tower to bolster collaboration with Mr. Trump’s campaign. These include Sean Spicer, a close adviser to Mr. Priebus. But the conflict has continued. At a meeting in New York late last month, Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, pointedly challenged Katie Walsh, the committee’s chief of staff, over the party’s spending plans. In a tone that several witnesses described as imperious and aggressive, Mr. Kushner suggested that the national committee might not be giving Mr. Trump all the support he was due. Ms. Walsh pushed back strongly, telling Mr. Kushner, who has no background in politics, that the committee’s   and spending are disclosed in detail to the Federal Election Commission, according to the witnesses who were in the room and two people briefed by them afterward. Ms. Walsh told Mr. Kushner that the committee had a responsibility to take a broad view of its finances, mapping out a budget for the entire party and ensuring it could remain operational for the rest of the year, and could not solely focus on Mr. Trump’s needs. Mike DuHaime, a former political director for the committee, said tensions with the campaign could be harmful to both sides in the general election. “For the field operation to be truly effective, the campaign, the R. N. C and   races need to be on the same page about goals and resource allocation,” he said. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, said he was confident that Mr. Priebus remained “on board” with the Trump campaign. At the same time, he acknowledged that much of the institutional Republican Party remained unfriendly to Mr. Trump. “The R. N. C. is giving him a lot of support,” Mr. Giuliani said. “He doesn’t have the united Republican Party behind him in the way that a more establishment candidate would. ”",0
18542,Liberal Establishment in Meltdown Over Trump Immigration Pause,"The liberal establishment in Britain has reacted with fury to U. S. President Donald J. Trump’s decision to pause immigration from some Muslim states. The policy is aimed at protecting U. S. citizens from “radical Islamic terror attacks”. [President Trump has put a temporary suspension on the U. S. refugee resettlement programme while tough new vetting rules are put in place, meaning that for 90 days no visas will be issued to migrants or visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  But angry MPs have dubbed the new security measures a “Muslim ban” with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn arguing on Sunday that Trump’s planned state visit to the UK should be postponed until he lifts restrictions. Claiming that the U. S. president used “awful misogynist language throughout the election campaign” and launched “awful attacks on Muslims” the Labour leader demanded that Theresa May “condemn Trump’s actions in the clearest terms”. He added: “Donald Trump should not be welcomed to Britain while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees’ and women’s rights. ” Despite the fact that more walls are being built than ever before  —   65 countries have now erected fences on their borders compared to just 16 at the time of the Berlin Wall’s collapse  —   Corbyn also slammed Trump for what he said was “this absurd idea of building a wall with their nearest neighbour. ” In the past the Labour leader has himself come under fire for inviting controversial people and groups to the House of Commons, including Hamas. And in 1984, just weeks after the IRA bombed the Tory conference in Brighton, Corbyn invited Sinn Fein boss Gerry Adams to plug his autobiography. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who has repeatedly said the will of the British people can be overturned and Brexit stopped, claimed that the President’s actions have “horrified the world”. Slamming Theresa May for being, in his view, insufficiently condemnatory of Trump, he said “at [a recent] press conference she contrived to make the Turkish government look liberal. “They said it was wrong to build walls. Rather than fighting to build a world that is open, tolerant and united, Theresa May is dividing the world in a very dangerous way. ” Farron neglected to mention the fact that Turkey is currently building a concrete wall barbed with wire along its border with Syria. Outrage over Trump’s actions has not been limited to the political class, with recently knighted athlete Mo Farah stating today that the president’s policy “comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice. ” Referring to his move to Britain from Somalia as a child, the   gold medallist said: “My story is an example of what can happen when you follow policies of compassion and understanding, not hate and isolation. ” While Farah is often hailed as a refugee success story, his younger brother Omar has a string of criminal convictions including for domestic burglary, and false imprisonment during a knife raid, for which he served a four and a half year sentence.",0
18543,Hilarious Cartoon Reveals 2016 Political Version of The “Walking Dead”,"Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer writes that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press . 
The AP reported: 
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. 
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. 
In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark “second-lowest cost silver plan” will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. 
But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. 
Larry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: “Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.” 
Donald Trump’s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: “This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.” Miller added, “While (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation’s failing health care system is complete and total reform.” 
Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS’s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 — one week before the election — is likely to cause major headaches for many people. 
This debacle is not unexpected either — it’s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen. 
Obamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president — his legacy is at stake. 
Obama’s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected. 
If Clinton becomes president, there’s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there’s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.",0
18544,Obama Won’t Go Away After He’s Done. That’s Good News. | Daily Wire,"Obama Won’t Go Away After He’s Done. That’s Good News. By: November 21, 2016 
So, soon-to-be-ex-President Obama won’t be going away anytime soon. 
After George W. Bush left office, he essentially went silent. He had no criticism for President Obama; he didn’t sound off about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump. He went away. Not so for Obama. It seems that Barack Obama will follow the Jimmy Carter pathway to Annoyingland: he’ll be commenting whenever possible. After acknowledging that Bush “could not have been more gracious to me when I came in,” Obama said, “As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle or go to core questions about our values and ideals, and if I think that it’s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, I’ll examine it when it comes.” 
This comes as welcome news for Republicans. Obama’s policy unpopularity – and his tendency to lecture from on high to Americans in rural areas – means that he’ll suck all the oxygen out of the room when it comes to criticizing Trump and Republicans. Middle Americans voted for Trump in order to sound off against Obama’s obvious scorn for them. Here’s what Obama had to say about those who didn’t vote for Trump in today’s Der Spiegel : 
If you look at the new generation of Americans, they reflect the vision that I spoke about. They're diverse. They believe in tolerance. They're accepting of things like same-sex marriage. They believe in integration. The problem, though, is that young people are less likely to vote than older people. What results is a situation in which sometimes the elections don't fully reflect the views of the American population. Essentially, the president-elect was supported by about 27 percent of the American population. One of our challenges, historically, is that we have very low voting rates, even during presidential elections. 
This sort of language drove Americans to Trump. And if Obama continues to critique Trump from the outside with this sort of language, not only will he be doing Trump a favor, he’ll be preventing any other Democrat from taking a leading role in opposing Trump. He’ll become the point of resistance for his own party – and his party won’t be able to escape his shadow. 
Obama’s ego has already cost his party the presidency, the Senate, the House, a bevy of state legislators and governor’s mansions. Now it may cost them the future.

By Susan Duclos - All News PipeLine Progressive liberals, George Soros and his merry band of paid protesters, and the mainstream media are certainly giving new meaning to William Shakespeare's "" Fight to the last gasp ,"" quote, but what none of them seem to realize yet as they cry, scream, riot and offer their mea culpa's is that the fight is over, the election is finished, their opponents have gone home to celebrate and they are doing nothing but flailing in the wind while grunting incoherently.While anyone can see the headlines about the third day of protests and riots, and how those that are incapable of understanding quite how elections work and are holding out for a pipe-dream that maybe they can make electors of the electoral college change their vote, what many are missing is how the mainstream media is attempting to suck more air out oxygen tanks that have gone empty.... and they have no one to blame but themselves. THE ULTIMATE LOSERS IN THE 2016 ELECTION - THE MSM For the last year and a half we have witnessed and reported on the mainstream media's unrelenting and unapologetic campaign against Donald Trump, where 91 percent of the reporting since the party's convention, where he was named the GOP nominee, has been studied and found to have been negative, but even before that they treated Trump as if he didn't stand a chance to win that nomination.We have noted and reported via Wikileaks releases how that very same MSM had colluded with the DNC and the Clinton campaign in order to influence the public to elect Hillary Clinton.We have also observed and reported how Trump supporters were constantly labeled and portrayed as racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, uneducated, uninformed, white nationalist deplorables, just to name a few of the colorful descriptors.How did that work out for them?Despite their biased reporting and throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at Trump, we now have President-Elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, to be sworn in on January 20, 2017. While Hillary Clinton will fade into obscurity and the protesters will eventually go home just to criticize everything Trump does for the next four (maybe 8?) years, and progressives will get over their sworn ""revolution"" within the party between liberals and moderate Democrats, the ultimate losers are not Clinton supporters, celebrities that swore to leave the country if Trump won, nor Democrats as a party.... it is the mainstream media that was rendered irrelevant, crushed by a wave of ""deplorables"" and alternative media bypassing their once-influential status to communicate without their fasle prism of 'truth.' MSM'S LAST GASP Now they are offering their mea culpas, dedicating countless hours and ink to explaining and justifying how they were so wrong in their predictions that they knew ahead of time were based on a false premise, and taking their ""last gasp"" by swearing to ""rededicate"" themselves to reporting honestly, while at the same time claiming they reported on ""both candidates fairly.""I kid you not.Below is a letter by Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and Dean Baquet, the publisher and editor of the New York Times:First point is that if they had been reporting ""fairly"" as claimed in the letter above, they would not need to ""rededicate"" themselves to honesty. Secondly, they did not strive ""to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences,"" of Trump supporters, rather they maligned, criticized, belittled and mocked anybody that did not agree with their superior and smug political opinion.While it is to be expected that Trump supporters, verbally abused on a regular basis will not forget nor forgive media outlets such as the Times, the Public Editor Liz Spayd, who works independently, with the job of examining The Times with an eye to protecting journalistic integrity and good practices, describes the reaction from other members of the public to their reporting. Readers are sending letters of complaint at a rapid rate. Heres one that summed up the feelings succinctly, from Kathleen Casey of Houston: ""Now, that the world has been upended and you are all, to a person, in a state of surprise and shock, you may want to consider whether you should change your focus from telling the reader what and how to think, and instead devote yourselves to finding out what the reader (and nonreaders) actually think."" Another letter, from Nick Crawford of Plymouth, Mich., made a similar point. ""Perhaps the election result would not be such a surprise if your reporting had acknowledged what ordinary Americans care about, rather than pushing the limited agenda of your editors,"" he wrote. ""Please come down from your New York City skyscraper and join the rest of us."" What Ms. Spayd does not acknowledge is that their reporting will not and cannot change as long as their publisher and editor, the ones that wrote the letter in the image above, continue to insist their reporting during the campaign season was in any way fair, or to even pretend they attempted to ""understand and reflect all political perspectives."" What Ms. Spayd also does not address is the fact that five different New York Times' reporters accepted the invitations for the off-the-record gatherings to ""frame the HRC message"" with the Clinton campaign staff before her campaign launched, including, Gail Collins, Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, Patrick Healy, and Amy Chozick, all of which consistently penned hit pieces against Trump.It is heartening to see that outlets like the New York Times are being called to the carpet by their own readers, as well as admitting they are losing subscribers, because while Trump supporters were maligned and lied about, their readers were misinformed and lied to . The countrys major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trumps ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (""To editors and writers of The NYT,"" one reader wrote, ""you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry."") It came in Facebook posts. (""You were in a bubble and werent paying attention to your fellow Americans,"" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. Former Times' reporter Michael Goodwin offers the Times some free advice : Using an outside law firm or even in-house reporters, he must assess how and why Baquet made the decision to sever the paper from its roots. He must assess the impact on reporters and editors, and whether they felt pressure to conform their stories to Baquets political bias. Whatever the findings, the publisher must insist that the standards of fairness again become a fundamental tenet in the news room. As an added guarantee, he must insist that the paper enlarge its thinking about diversity to include journalists who disagree with the Times embedded liberal slant. There has to be a difference of perspective to judge where fairness lies. Readers, and former readers, should be part of the process. Many already know that the paper must get its head out of parochial New York and into the hearts and minds of Americans everywhere. This is about survival. If it doesnt change now, the Gray Ladys days surely are numbered. BOTTOM LINE Frankly I believe traditional media's days are numbered whatever they do, and they are on their last gasp. There are too many Independent journalists and alternative news sites from both sides of the political aisle that are rendering them irrelevant. While alternative media has its own set of biases, the majority always provide links, documents when available, video clips and other methods for readers to verify, research and come to their own conclusions, something mainstream media doesn't want readers to do because they feel they have the right to lead the public where the MSM wants them to go, rather than inform the public and trust them to make their own determinations.",0

18547,Vorse: Memo to Congress When Replacing Obamacare – Health Insurance Is Not Health Care - Breitbart,"Health care and health insurance are different things.  They are related but different products.  Conflating the two was destined to create one failed product  —   Obamacare. [On the evening of September 9, 2009, President Obama presented his namesake health plan to a joint session of Congress. He correctly identified the amount spent on underlying health costs (i. e. hospitals, physicians, labs and drugs) as the reason for skyrocketing insurance premiums, stating: “We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren’t any healthier for it.  This is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. ”  However, the plan he put forth ignored this fundamental problem and merely addressed health insurance reform, the question of how those skyrocketing health costs were to be financed.  The net result is our nation still spends “one and a half times more per person on health care than any other nation” while the World Health Organization currently ranks us 31st in life expectancy  —   behind Chile and Costa Rica. An important impediment to the   sustainability of Obamacare was its inability to create and market an insurance product that healthy people (especially young adults) both understood and wanted to buy without relying on tax credits or other government financial assistance.  The Obama administration constantly touts the 22 million Americans that now have insurance because of Obamacare.  However, the overwhelming majority of these 22 million Obamacare enrollees are: None of the above groups of buyers are participating because they see the product, absent government subsidy or dictat, as a rational choice.  Their choice to enroll was based upon either subsidy (wealth transfer) or government elimination of alternatives.  Consequently, Obamacare has primarily become more of an insurance entitlement rather than an affordable, appealing product people want to buy because it helps address their healthcare needs.  And like most other products dependent on financial assistance to convince people to buy, Obamacare has failed to sustain itself   without significant ongoing government financial support. So why aren’t healthy Americans buying Obamacare healthcare insurance?  Put simply, from the consumers’ perspective, the costs and benefits to buying Obamacare healthcare insurance don’t make sense.  This may be a wise decision or an imprudent decision, but this is the decision that most healthy Americans that don’t qualify for tax subsidies or Medicare have made. Furthermore, in the process of pushing a failed insurance product that consumers don’t want to buy, Obamacare has destroyed both the healthcare service and the healthcare insurance markets for the other 300 million Americans, and thereby created significant financial demands on the US economy. The debate thus far has been obscured by the various parties putting forth specific policies, when a first step should be to agree upon principles.  Given the subject matter, policies are necessarily complex, but the policy complexities mask the serious differences in the underlying principles driving each policy idea.  We should demand our representatives first clearly articulate, debate and find   agreement on the principles upon which the new replacement policies will be built, then move on to the complex business of implementing those principles in policy. Going forward, to achieve a sustainable policy that will not require disruptive wealth transfers, elimination of choice, perverse incentives or erosion of care, the new replacement policies for both health insurance and access to quality affordable healthcare should be developed only after establishing a clear set of core free market driven principles  —    and not haphazardly slapping together   policy prescriptions without core principles which is the genesis of Obamacare. Obamacare was not the answer. It failed both on a political level, dividing our country because it was passed as a loyalty test on a   vote of a mysterious package no one understood, but also on a rational test at the consumer level. What is needed first is   agreement on the guiding principles, and then implementing policies for each of the two related but independent markets and products (healthcare service and healthcare insurance) resulting in rational   choices that Americans want to buy and that providers are willing to sell at a reasonable profit in a competitive marketplace.  Products based on common sense and easily understandable benefits and incentives for all parties. A program that forces people facing tough budget choices to purchase a product they don’t want or face horrendous penalties is a coercive train wreck in the making. When we foster a free market in healthcare services with real, legitimate published prices, everyone in our society will benefit from increased access to affordable care, especially low income families. The time has come for Oblimination  —   the   dismantling of Obamacare and replacing it with a system based on free market principles that actually work. Big Government, Obamacare, oblimination",0
18548,Top 5 Versatile Foods To Survive Nowadays,"Gabrielle Ray October 28, 2016 Top 5 Versatile Foods To Survive Nowadays 
When you’re living small and running out of space in your home, anything you buy raises the same big question: where am I going to store it? 
A lot of people live in small spaces, and still buy a lot of everything, even if most of it finally goes to waste. Let’s be smart and buy what you really need and use, in or outside the kitchen. Think about how to use in multiple ways everything you buy, including food. 
In other words, choose versatile food as much as you opt for multipurpose items when building your reserves. In the end, its about money, but also about space and resources. 
Here’s what I chose! 
Flour 
First, there are a lot of grains that you can use to make flour at home: wheat, barley, rye, spelt, corn, oats, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, nuts (such as almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, pecans, macadamias, and walnuts), seeds (such as sunflowers, hemp, pumpkin, amaranth and flax), potatoes, arrowroot, tapioca, coconut, soybean and others. 
You have undoubtedly heard of cornmeal and possibly even almond meal, but what’s the difference between a meal and flour? Meals are ground more coarsely. To make meal, just don’t grind your product as long. When it starts to get a crumbly texture, you’re done. Compare it mentally to cornmeal. 
Meals are great for several different uses because they add a heartier flavor and more texture to your goods. They’re bad, though, if you’re shooting for something nice and light to make a cake with. 
Then you have pasta, and all those tasty dishes based on them: lasagna, spaghetti, macaroni and cheese or simple yet delicious rustic dishes made only from the ingredients in your garden. You won’t need many ingredients: flour, eggs (optionally) and salt. Some people like to add oil, but it’s not essential to making basic pasta. 
All-purpose flour is just fine for a basic pasta mix. If you want to add texture and a bit of hardiness to your pasta, you can add some semolina flour to the mix. If you want silkier pasta for a more refined noodle, add some cake flour, or 00 flour. 
Milk 
Milk is packed with calcium and protein and is also a necessary ingredient in many recipes. 
It’s something that you’ll want to have on hand in a survival situation. 
Milk doesn’t keep long, but there are different ways to preserve it for later use. Read this Survivopedia article to find out more about how to preserve milk. 
Also, there are about a million different cheese recipes out there that you can make depending upon your personal preferences and the type of milk (goat or cow) that you’re using. 
Cheese is a lot easier to make than you’d think and you can keep it forever without refrigeration. 
Coat the cheese in wax to preserve it. You’ll need a special cheese wax because paraffin wax will crack as it dries. Waxed cheese will last up to 25 years but remember that it will age and become sharper so if you plan to store it for an extended period of time, start with a mild cheese. 
Another idea is to make butter or buttermilk. Or if you’d like, you can also make yogurt ( here are a few recipes you might use for making yogurt ), sour cream or cottage cheese but storage methods for those are just simple refrigeration. It will extend the life of the milk for a couple of weeks, though. And I’ve also heard rumors of canning buttermilk. 
Salt 
Let’s talk multipurpose! The main purpose of salt for most people is to add a bit more taste to their food. However, salt can be so much more useful in the kitchen and around the house, thanks to the many applications it has. Prevents the browning of fruits and vegetables. This is something that can be done with lemon juice or vinegar, but a bucket of salty water will also do the trick. Preserves food naturally for long term survival. Salt works by dehydrating the food as well as the microbes present in the food. Most especially, mold and yeast cannot grow in food pretreated with salt. Food preserved this way could last for years. Fresh egg test. You need a cup of water with two teaspoons of salt in them. Drop an egg in the cup. A fresh one should sink straight to the bottom while an older one would float. An older egg has more buoyancy because the air cell inside of it increases. Makes cheese last longer. Even when it is preserved properly in a refrigerated environment, cheese will inevitable spoil due to mold. This cannot be prevented with salting the cheese, but it can be delayed. Wrap the cheese before storing it in a damp cloth moistened using saltwater. Puts out grease fires. One thing to never do is to throw water on top of a grease fire. The water evaporates instantly and spreads the fire all over the room. Instead, throwing salt on top of the grease fire will create a crusty layer without oxygen, thus smothering the flames. Moreover, the salt also acts as a heat sink, dissipating the heat. 
Salt keeps well in cool, dry places and you can prevent it from clumping by dropping a few grains of rice at the bottom of the shaker. 
Honey 
In addition to tasting delicious in tea and in baklava, honey has some pretty nifty health benefits. When you eat local honey, it’s said to help with allergies, which is great. The real use in an emergency though lies in the antibacterial, antimicrobial and emollient properties. It also has a ton of practical uses: Has vitamins and minerals so if you’re using a sweetener, honey is better than sugar Can be used as an antibacterial on wounds Is a great healing agent for wounds and helps keep the bandage from sticking Barter – sweeteners are going to be way up there on the list Excellent skin moisturizer (if your skin is so dry that it cracks, you’re going to have problems) Makes a great burn treatment because of the antibacterial properties and the moisturizing power Soothes sore throats When mixed with vinegar and water is an effective parasite remover Make fly/bug strips 
Did you know that honey was found in Egyptian pharaohs’ tombs and it was still as good as new? 
It only needs to be kept in a sealed container in a cool, dry place and it will last a lifetime. And don’t fret if your honey has crystalized; just place the jar in some warm water (without letting water enter the jar) and it will be smooth and good as new in no time. 
Kitchen Scraps 
Some of us throw away a ton of food scraps on a regular basis, but did you know that you can repurpose much of it? You can, of course, start a compost pile , but there are also many uses of kitchen scraps, and they would make your life easier if you are prepping or just homesteading. 
First, use them to grow more food . In most of the cases, the roots will regrow if you plant them in the soil, just like bulbs of flowers do. 
You can also use some of the scraps for filtering water. For example, grind the corn husk into dust and mix it with coffee grounds and clay. Add enough water to make it “clay-like” and shape it into a bowl. Allow to dry in the sun, then put your water in it and place it over another vessel. The water will soak through the bowl and into the other vessel, leaving contaminants behind. Rinse the corn husk bowl and reuse. 
Onion peels, apple peels and banana peels also help removing pollutants from water. They attract and capture ions and pollutants because they’re adsorbent. This won’t purify the water or remove biohazards but it will help remove some of the dangerous pollutants. 
And here are a few more examples on what kitchen scraps can help: 
Onion Peels Sooth stings – the end of the onion can be used to sooth stings. Just hold it on your skin. Use them to dye your hair a beautiful golden brown, or to color fabrics or Easter eggs a bright purple! Cook it up along with your garlic peels to make an organic pesticide. It stinks, but it works! 
Corn Husks Make baskets – braid or weave the husks into a basket. Protect delicate foods when grilling – if you want to grill your fish or other delicate food but are afraid it will fall apart and be wasted, wrap it in a wet corn husk while cooking. Treat bladder infections – boil the husks into a tea for relief. It also works as a pain reliever for some types of joint or muscle pain. Start fires – dried husks are extremely flammable so if you don’t have any good kindling, don’t pitch those husks! 
Egg Shells Fertilizer – your plants need the calcium and other minerals in the shells so you can crush them up and mix them into the dirt or you can soak the eggshells in the water that you use for your plants. You can even use the entire shell as a “cup” to start your seeds in if you crack them carefully. Pest deterrent – having problems with deer or cats in your garden? Crush the eggshells and scatter them around your garden. Calcium supplements – we all need plenty of calcium but in a survival situation, we may not be able to get enough. Thank goodness you thought to raise chickens! Just grind the eggs into a fine powder and mix it into your smoothie or other food once per day. Feed them to your chickens – that’s right – they need calcium to make more eggs so instead of using oyster shells, crush up the egg shells and give them back. Candles – if you crack the tops off carefully, you can fill the shells with beeswax, add a wick, and you’ve got a candle that you didn’t need to use another container on. Seed starter pots – again, crack them carefully and put your soil and seeds in them. You’ve got organic seed pots that are already rich in calcium and minerals that your plants need. 
Add few more items to this list, and you’ll have a practical “To Buy” list for your kitchen, and your stockpile too. Less means more, and people living small can confirm that. Not to mention how easy and convenient is to carry a smaller bag when you are on the run for survival.

18549,Dallas Cowboys Beat Ravens for First Time,"The Dallas Cowboys seem to be doing well this season. Ezekiel Elliot set a new record for the most rushing yards, over Tony Dorsett for the franchise record. Quarterback Dak Prescott threw over 300 yards and completed 75 percent of his passes.
Dorsett, who had held the record since 1977, and helped the Cowboys win Superbowl XII, was present to congratulate Elliot. Dorsett made history with 1,007 yards rushing, 12 of which resulted in touchdowns, and he managed this feat in 208 carries. He also added almost 30 receptions for 273 yards, with one resulting in a touchdown.
Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, Elliott was a big part of the Cowboys’ 27-17 win over the Baltimore Ravens, who did not make it easy for the Dallas based team. He came into the game two yards shy of tieing Dorsett’s record, which he did on his opening run of the game. As the No. 4 pick in the draft, and the only 20-year-old rookie, makes his accomplishment that much more amazing.
Backup quarterback, Prescott was sent in to play for Tony Romo, who voluntarily stepped down for the good of the team. Prescott is only two years older than Elliott. The Ravens are one of the top defensive teams, in the league. The Cowboys’ win over The Ravens proves they can win when they are having a stroke of bad luck.
Winning nine consecutive games, then defeating a team they have not been able to beat gave over 93,000 fans, who were in attendance at the game, something to smile about. Especially after a controversial election that left America divided.
Football fans all over can rejoice in this accomplishment. However, this does not mean the team is unbeatable. The best team Dallas has faced this season is the New York Giants, who gave them their only loss, and currently, hold a record of 7-3. The Dallas-based team has a winning record against teams playing under .500 and only one win against a team above .500. Nevertheless, it is exciting to see a team approaching the playoffs, first place in their division, with a 9-1 record. The finest game they played all season was against Pittsburgh, which they pulled out a win because of some superb moves from Elliot. The rest of their wins are due to the schedule of teams not exactly playing to their best ability.
The Cowboys did what was needed, by beating the teams they were capable of and holding their own against the teams that were equal to them. They played well and earned their nine consecutive wins. There are six games left in the season including a rematch with the Giants at the Meadowlands stadium. When they played Baltimore, they managed to control the clock and forced their opponent to use their timeouts.
The Cowboys pulled off their ninth consecutive win against a team, which has proven to be one of their toughest opponents. The Ravens could not hold on in Sunday’s game and took a 27-10 loss, against a team they had conquered many times. The momentum is with Dallas for an exciting end to the season

18551,"Last Wish of Dying Girl, 14, to Be Frozen, Is Granted by Judge - The New York Times","LONDON  —   During the last months of her life, a terminally ill    British girl made a final wish. Instead of being buried, she asked to be frozen so that she could be “woken up” in the future when a cure was found  —   even if that was hundreds of years later. “I want to have this chance,” the teenager wrote in a letter to a judge asking that she be cryogenically preserved. She died on Oct. 17 from a rare form of cancer. “I don’t want to be buried underground,” she wrote. The girl’s parents, who are divorced, disagreed about the procedure. The teenager had asked the court to designate that her mother, who supported her daughter’s wishes, should decide how to handle her remains. The judge, Peter Jackson, ruled in her favor. Local news reports said he was impressed by the “valiant way in which she was facing her predicament. ” He said she had chosen the most basic preservation option, which costs about £37, 000, or nearly $46, 000, an amount reportedly raised by her grandparents. “I want to live and live longer and I think that in the future they might find a cure for my cancer and wake me up,” the teenager wrote in her letter to the judge. Local reports said she had told a relative: “I’m dying, but I’m going to come back again in 200 years. ” For legal reasons, the teenager cannot be identified. The case was revealed for the first time on Friday. Cryogenic preservation involves storing people’s bodies, or sometimes just their heads, at very low temperatures in the hope that scientists will one day be able to resuscitate them. According to Cryonics UK, a nonprofit organization that embalmed and transferred the girl’s body to a storage facility in Michigan, once a patient is declared dead, a response team swiftly injects a cocktail of chemicals to try to reduce blood clotting and brain damage. The body is then cooled to around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 Celsius) and the blood is removed and replaced with a kind of antifreeze to prevent ice crystals from forming inside the body during the freezing process. The body is then placed in a waterproof bag and gradually cooled to minus 94 degrees using dry ice. Once packed in ice, the body is flown to a storage facility where it is cooled further, to minus 321, and stored in a container filled with liquid nitrogen. The    London girl is one of 11 Britons to have been frozen under this procedure, Cryonics UK said. Judge Jackson acknowledged ethical issues surrounding the procedure and called the case “an example of the new questions that science poses to the law. ” “The scientific theory underlying cryonics is speculative and controversial, and there is considerable debate about its ethical implications,” the judge said in a statement. “On the other hand, cryopreservation, the preservation of cells and tissues by freezing, is now a   process in certain branches of medicine, for example the preservation of sperm and embryos as part of fertility treatment,” the statement said. “Cryonics is cryopreservation taken to its extreme. ” Zoe Fleetwood, the girl’s lawyer, said her client had called Judge Jackson a “hero” after being told of the court’s decision shortly before her death. “By Oct. 6, the girl knew that her wishes were going to be followed,” Ms. Fleetwood told BBC Radio 4. “That gave her great comfort. ” There are only three cryonics storage facilities in the world: two in the United States and one in Russia. Since the procedure was invented in the 1960s, more than 300 people have reportedly been frozen, many of them at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, Ariz. So far, no one has been revived. Asked about the chances that the British girl would ever be resuscitated, Tim Gibson, a committee member of Cryonics UK, said they were “somewhere between zero to 100. ” “Cryonics is just a big experiment,” he said. “You can be part of the experiment or part of the control group. ” On its website, Cryonics UK addresses the  question of whether customers could know for sure that the procedure works. “You can’t,” the company says. “You have a choice, though: You can try it, and maybe live and maybe die. Or you cannot try it, and definitely die. ”",0
18552,‘James Bond of Philanthropy’ Gives Away the Last of His Fortune - The New York Times,"As it happens, Donald J. Trump is not the only person to announce plans to shut down a personal philanthropy, just the best known. This is the story of a man who made and kept that same promise. Nearly five years ago, Charles F. Feeney sat in a cushy armchair in an apartment on the east side of Manhattan, grandchildren’s artwork taped to the walls, and said that by the end of 2016, he was going to hand out the last of a great fortune that he had made. It was a race: Mr. Feeney was then 81, and Atlantic Philanthropies, a collection of private foundations he had started and funded, still had about $1. 5 billion left. Flinging money out the window or writing checks   was not Mr. Feeney’s way. Last month, Mr. Feeney and Atlantic completed the sprint and made a final grant, $7 million to Cornell University, to support students doing community service work. He had officially emptied his pockets, meeting his aspiration of “giving while living. ” Altogether, he had contributed $8 billion to his philanthropies, which have supported higher education, public health, human rights and scientific research. “You’re always nervous handling so much money, but we seem to have worked it pretty well,” Mr. Feeney, now 85, said last week in a phone interview. His remaining personal net worth is slightly more than $2 million. That’s not quite broke, by any standard, but it is a modest amount for a man who controlled thousands of times as much wealth. He and his wife, Helga, now live in a rented apartment in San Francisco. “You can only wear one pair of pants at a time,” Mr. Feeney has said. Until he was 75, he traveled only in coach, and carried reading materials in a plastic bag. For many years, when in New York, he had lunch not at the city’s luxury restaurants, but in the homey confines of Tommy Makem’s Irish Pavilion on East 57th Street, where he ate the burgers. None of the major American philanthropists have given away a greater proportion of their wealth, and starting in 1982, Mr. Feeney did most of this in complete secrecy, leading Forbes magazine to call him the “James Bond of philanthropy. ” His name does not appear in gilded letters, chiseled marble or other forms of writing anywhere on the 1, 000 buildings across five continents that $2. 7 billion of his money paid for. For years, Atlantic’s support came with a requirement that the beneficiaries not publicize its involvement. Beyond Mr. Feeney’s reticence about blowing his own horn, “it was also a way to leverage more donations  —   some other individual might contribute to get the naming rights,” said Christopher G. Oechsli, the president and chief executive officer of Atlantic. During the early 1990s, Mr. Feeney met secretly with paramilitary forces in Belfast, Northern Ireland, urging them to drop armed guerrilla conflict and promising financial support if they embraced electoral politics. Atlantic grants paid to create a public health system in Vietnam, and to provide access to antiretroviral treatment for AIDS in southern Africa. The last rounds of grants, about $600 million, included support for Atlantic Fellows, described as young emerging leaders working in their countries for healthier, more equitable societies. Raised in Elizabeth, N. J. Mr. Feeney served as a radio operator in the Air Force and attended Cornell University on the G. I. Bill. In 1960, he and a partner set up a company that sold items like brandy and cigars to travelers in   shops at airports. It became a booming success. Mr. Feeney has also been a shrewd investor in technology  . In 1984, he secretly transferred all of his assets, including his 38. 75 percent ownership of the   business, to Atlantic Philanthropies. He grew the Atlantic pot with early investments in companies like Facebook, Priceline,   Alibaba and Legent. A business dispute in 1997 forced disclosure of Mr. Feeney’s funding for Atlantic. As for Mr. Trump, if he really does shut down his foundation  —   stung by inquiries about the use of foundation money to pay Mr. Trump’s personal liabilities, or purchase football helmet memorabilia, or oil paintings of himself  —   he is not likely to follow the Feeney model. The two men are mirror images. For years, Mr. Trump lobbied hard to get onto lists of the wealthy, like the Forbes 400 Mr. Feeney has tried to stay off them. The Atlantic endowment came entirely from Mr. Feeney’s money much of the money that went into the Trump foundation in recent years was from others. One of Atlantic’s projects was to propose reforms to the American health care system, which helped lay groundwork for the Affordable Care Act another was advocacy for the end of the death penalty for juveniles. Mr. Trump has been on the other side of both of those issues, vowing to “dismantle Obamacare on Day 1,” and calling, in 1989, for the restoration of the death penalty after five teenagers were arrested in the rape of a jogger in Central Park. (They were convicted but later cleared of the charges.) Just as Mr. Trump was opening Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in the early 1980s, Mr. Feeney was a few blocks away in Makem’s pub, thinking about the first big checks he would write for charity, on the condition that his identity not be disclosed. “I don’t recall ever meeting Trump,” Mr. Feeney said last week. No wonder. The thought crossed my mind 20 years ago that Chuck Feeney is what Donald Trump would be, if he lived his entire existence backward.",0
18553,"Bernie Sanders, Theresa May, South China Sea: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. “Can we do this? Can we find the character, as Americans, to open our hearts to each other?” For the 11th time in his tenure, President Obama sought to offer comfort and a way forward after a mass killing. At a memorial for five Dallas officers targeted by a black Army veteran, he praised the city as a model for progressive policing and said the country’s racial tensions could be overcome. “I’m here to insist that we are not so divided as we seem,” he said. Former President George W. Bush also spoke of healing. “To renew our unity we only have to remember our values,” he said. _____ 2. The memorial paused for a long ovation for the Dallas police chief, David Brown, who has become the face not only of the city’s grief but the voice of national police frustration. He expressed his feelings for his force and their sacrifice with the lyrics to the Stevie Wonder song “As. ” “I’ll be loving   the rainbow burns the stars out in the   the ocean covers every mountain high,” he read. _____ 3. The family of Philando Castile, who was killed by a Minnesota police officer during a traffic stop, called for a special prosecutor to take over the case. He was one of two black men shot by police officers last week in killings that drew widespread attention. _____ 4. “Secretary Clinton has won the Democratic nominating process,” Bernie Sanders told a cheering crowd in New Hampshire. In his endorsement, intended in part to coax his 13 million voting supporters into Hillary Clinton’s camp, he denounced Donald Trump as much as he praised her. “You were great, so great,” Mrs. Clinton told Mr. Sanders after they shared a hug. Her campaign is looking at a retired admiral and former top NATO commander, James Stavridis, as a possible vice president. _____ 5. Mr. Trump said he would announce his choice of a running mate by Friday. He’s been considering Gov. Chris Christie retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn Senator Joni Ernst Gov. Mike Pence the former Speaker Newt Gingrich and two unknowns  —   none of them seen as the party’s top stars. He also criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for her recent harsh criticism of his candidacy, calling her engagement in politics “a disgrace” to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the most vulnerable   Republican candidates are trying to escape Mr. Trump’s shadow. _____ 6. U. S. stocks had a particularly good day. The Dow closed at a record high, and the S. P. 500 logged a second strong day. The Nasdaq, heavily weighted with technology and biotech stocks, erased its losses for the year. But the embrace of risk did nothing to raise historically low bond yields. _____ 7. Major League Baseball’s   game is tonight in San Diego. The National League’s team is rich with Chicago Cubs, including the full starting infield. Johnny Cueto of the San Francisco Giants pitches. Pitching for the American League team: Chris Sale of the Chicago White Sox. (8 p. m. Eastern, Fox). _____ 8. “It’s an overwhelming victory. ” That’s a lawyer for the Philippines, saluting an international tribunal’s sweeping ruling against China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. But tensions are hardly over. There is no mechanism to enforce the decision, and China’s Foreign Ministry said, “China does not accept or recognize” it. _____ 9. The House may vote this week on a bill requiring that most foods containing genetically engineered ingredients be identified. One of our   articles today looks at the myths and mysteries of G. M. O. s. For instance, mushrooms genetically modified not to easily bruise don’t have to be labeled, because no DNA from another organism was added. And Japan’s square watermelons have nothing to do with genetic manipulation  —   they’re just grown in boxes. _____ 10. Finally, it’s moving day for David Cameron. The British prime minister is vacating 10 Downing St. in a hurry. The home secretary Theresa May, is to succeed him on Wednesday, just two days after she won the Conservative Party’s leadership contest.

18554,Elaine Chao Gets Cozy Reception at Confirmation Hearing - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   Elaine L. Chao, a veteran cabinet secretary who has served under two Republican presidents, offered remarkably few specifics but many promises of cooperation on Wednesday as she cruised through her confirmation hearing to become transportation secretary. Democrats on the Senate committee charged with reviewing Ms. Chao’s nomination by   Donald J. Trump made it clear that they have no objections to her, suggesting that she will be easily confirmed in a full Senate vote. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, the top Democrat on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, praised Ms. Chao for acting with “grace and excellence” in her previous government service. “I certainly look forward to you, in this new administration, doing the same,” he said. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the committee’s chairman, called her “an ideal candidate. ” Ms. Chao spent most of the   hearing promising to examine and learn more about drones, fuel efficiency standards, air traffic control services and many other subjects that may soon be part of her portfolio. With most of the spotlight falling on Mr. Trump’s desire for a major infrastructure overhaul  —   in his own words, a priority for his first 100 days in office that could cost $1 trillion  —   Ms. Chao vowed to keep senators informed of emerging plans. She called the overhaul “a heavy lift” that would require cooperation both between the parties and between Congress and the administration. “As the infrastructure proposal is being put together, we will certainly be in great discussion with the Congress, because, once again, we can’t do it on our own,” she said. The selection of Ms. Chao to lead the Transportation Department and its $75 billion budget stands out in the lineup of largely billionaire business executives Mr. Trump has nominated to populate his cabinet. She served as labor secretary for the duration of George W. Bush’s administration and as a deputy transportation secretary under the elder George Bush. Ms. Chao vowed on Wednesday to work with lawmakers on a host of transportation issues  —   including maritime infrastructure and positive train control, a safety system intended to prevent collisions. Emphasizing the need to revitalize the nation’s transportation infrastructure, Ms. Chao called for creativity to fund improvements. Asked whether Mr. Trump would support including federal spending in his infrastructure package, she said, “I believe the answer is yes. ” Support for federal infrastructure funding could put the Trump administration on a collision course with congressional Republicans, who have been reluctant or even openly hostile to increasing domestic spending in recent years. Ms. Chao offered few other funding solutions, though she did propose turning to more   partnerships, referencing the potential capital available from “equity firms, pension funds and endowments. ” That seemed to raise concern from Mr. Nelson, who cautioned against the privatization of government services, alluding to a possible point of friction between Democrats and the incoming Trump administration. Since leaving public service, Ms. Chao has joined the boards of Wells Fargo, News Corporation and Vulcan Materials, among others  —   positions she said she would resign from if confirmed. However, according to documents she filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Ms. Chao will continue for a time to receive payments under financial agreements with Vulcan, which makes construction supplies, and Wells Fargo as she severs her ties with them the payments from Wells Fargo stocks will continue through March 2021. She has agreed to recuse herself from matters involving those companies. Though Wells Fargo came under fire late last year for its business practices, senators did not ask her to elaborate on her continued ties with the embattled company. There was a notably cozy, familiar tone to much of the hearing, as senators questioned a nominee with close ties to one of their own: Ms. Chao is the wife of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. Praising Ms. Chao as “incredibly capable” in his introduction, Mr. McConnell cheekily endorsed Mr. Trump’s pick. “She’s got really great judgment, on a whole variety of things,” he said. To capture his feelings, Mr. McConnell turned to the words of a previous Republican senator whose spouse was a transportation and labor secretary, paraphrasing what Bob Dole once said about his wife, Elizabeth. “I feel a little bit like Nathan Hale,” Mr. McConnell said. “‘I regret that I have but one wife to give for my country. ’” Ms. Chao said, “I will be working to lock in the majority leader’s support tonight over dinner. ”",0
18555,The Apps That Make Keeping Up With Soccer Easier - The New York Times,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Rory Smith, chief soccer correspondent for The Times, who is based in Manchester, England, discussed the tech he’s using. As a soccer reporter, you must be savvy about   apps and gear like antennas. What are your favorite tools for staying on the ball, so to speak? The ones I use the most are Virgin Anywhere and Sky Sports Mobile TV, the two official apps from the two major cable networks in the U. K. Sky holds the rights to most Premier League games subscribing to Virgin means I can watch the rest of the major European leagues, too. I have friends, more technologically minded than me, who prefer streaming matches through a Kodi box (a   device that runs an   media app that can be used to stream pirated content, including illegal sports streams). I can see why they’re tempted: The cost of subscriptions is considerable. I can justify it  —   to my wife, and to myself  —   as a professional necessity, but many can’t. It is worthwhile only because of the apps, though: I use them not only when I travel, but increasingly often at home, too. My wife, Kate, would rightly regard herself as something of a soccer (well, a soccer journalism) widow being able to watch a game on an iPad while she reads or watches something else has soothed a regular source of   domestic disharmony. What do you like about the tools, and what could be better? The Virgin app, certainly, needs work to iron out various bugs. In the early days of streaming  —   before these apps were commonplace  —   I’d quite often have to find matches on websites of dubious provenance and even more uncertain reliability. It was always kind of a crapshoot as to how much of the game you’d actually see in between all of the buffering and   and losses of connection. Virgin has not yet quite escaped at least two of those problems Sky is better, but not perfect. I would imagine that’s a problem that applies to whatever the United States equivalents of those apps are, too. Do you think it’s feasible for avid sports fans to cut the cable cord or is cable still the way to go?  It’s feasible, but it depends on how avid you are and how patient you are prepared to be. I know Kodi and its equivalents are becoming ever more popular, and there are plenty of people I know who consume as much soccer as they want without paying very much, if anything at all, for the privilege. I can’t condone doing things that aren’t entirely legal, of course, but at the same time the cost of watching sport is rising all the time, and if there comes a point where that is out of reach for a substantial number of people, you almost have to accept that they will try to find ways around it. That said, the Premier League  —   like the N. F. L. and others  —   are doing all they can to combat streaming, so it remains, by all accounts, somewhat   and not entirely reliable. It is definitely easier to have cable, but I’m not sure, especially to a younger, digital native generation, that it is still an absolute necessity. What tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? In my   I’ve found that I’ve pared down the tech I use to what I’m comfortable with. Twitter and Instagram, but not Snapchat. An iPhone and iPad, but only occasionally Apple TV (we still watch DVDs in our house, on a PlayStation 3, like cave men). Lots of my friends use Strava or wear a Fitbit, but I lack the competitive instinct for the former and the inflated sense of   for the latter. The last thing to be added to my little tech bubble was Spotify that’s the one that may have made the biggest difference. About 10 years ago, I found that discovering new music had become almost impossible. Music stores were becoming rarer and rarer, and ever harder to navigate, because they were full of achingly hip teenagers the radio offered nothing but indecipherable millennial pop. This sounds extreme, but Spotify has stopped  —   well, delayed  —   my journey into middle age. I’ve not decreed that all music nowadays is terrible yet without Spotify, I’m pretty sure I was on course to do so by 2014. What do you and your family do with Spotify? Together with a welter of podcasts, it provides the soundtrack to our lives. I drive a lot  —   to and from games, interviews, stories  —   and fly a lot, too. It keeps me awake and sends me to sleep (respectively). It sounds a little excessive, but it’s helped both me and my wife do something we had forgotten how  —   or been disenfranchised from being able  —   to do. I would never have found the Rural Alberta Advantage without it, or been able to relearn the words to “Regulate,” and what sort of world would that be? What could be better about it?  I’m not sure I’d be able to pinpoint any one thing. I’m sure it’s not perfect. And there are times when the recommendations list makes me think someone in some   West Coast lair is judging me. Oh, you liked this? Well, maybe you should be listening to Mansun then, you recidivist throwback. Apart from soccer, what is your favorite sport and what tech do you use to stay on top of it? Twitter keeps me across my other fleeting passions  —   cycling, cricket and rugby  —   though to be honest, they fade in and out. I’ll read anything on any subject, though, and some of the stuff that the likes of Vice do on sports is fascinating.",0
18556,Минобороны России: Эвакуация жителей Алеппо была сорвана боевиками,"  
Конашенков пояснил, что представителями сирийских властей и российским Центром примирения планировалось вывезти около 40 мирных жителей из восточных районов Алеппо в безопасные места, однако из-за снайперского огня со стороны боевиков сделать это не получилось. 
По его словам, ""террористы продолжают вести из самодельных реактивных установок беспорядочные обстрелы жилых кварталов города, пресекая выход мирных жителей по действующим гуманитарным коридорам"". 
Добавим, что ранее постоянный представитель России при ООН Виталий Чуркин возложил ответственность на всемирную организацию за не до конца проработанную операцию по эвакуации населения из Алеппо. 
Как сообщили в Детском фонде ООН (ЮНИСЕФ), ""двадцать два ребенка и шесть учителей, согласно полученным сведениям, были убиты сегодня, когда здание их школы было неоднократно атаковано в Идлибе, Сирия"", «Это трагедия. Если это было сделано намеренно, то это - военное преступление»,- приводит AFP слова директора ЮНИСЕФ Энтони Лейка. 
До этого правозащитники сообщали, что «военные самолеты или российские, или сирийские нанесли шесть ударов» по деревне Хасс Лэйк отметил, что произошедшее является трагедией или военным преступлением. 
По его словам, речь идет о возможно самом смертоносном нападении на школу в Сирии с момента начала конфликта в стране в 2011 году. 
Как пишет РИА Новости, постоянный представитель РФ при ООН Виталий Чуркин назвал ужасным сообщение об ударе по школе в сирийском Идлибе. ""Мне проще всего сказать, что это не мы, но я ответственный человек, так что мне нужно подождать и посмотреть, что скажет наше министерство обороны"", - цитирует дипломата ТАСС. 
Вооруженное противостояние продолжается в Сирии с марта 2011 года. По данным ООН, погибли более 220 тысяч человек. 
США и их союзники с 2014 года проводят в Ираке и Сирии операцию против ИГ. В ночь на 17 октября премьер-министр Ирака Хайдер аль-Абади заявил о начале военной операции по освобождению Мосула от боевиков ИГ. Иракские военные и силы полиции, а также курдские формирования при поддержке авиации коалиции во главе с США начали массированное наступление на город.

18557,Comment on Tutorial: Riding The Philippine Jeepney by Ivan Jose,"adobochron 1 Comment 
MANILA, Philippines (The Adobo Chronicles, Manila Bureau) – This is a tutorial on how to ride the jeepney which is an important mode of mass transportation in many cities and towns in the Philippines. 
Many of you may already be familiar with these rules, etiquette and tricks but for those who are visiting the country for the first time or are returning nationals (balikbayan) who have been away for a long time, you might want to keep this tutorial handy. First of all, not all jeepneys you encounter are as colorful, shiny and clean as the one pictured here. If you are bothered by smoke or the smell of gasoline, remember to always carry and wear a disposable surgical mask. It also helps with, you know, body odor. In most cases, there are no jeepney stops like there are bus stops. Wherever you are, be rest assured that so long as there is room for one more passsenger, the jeepney will stop for you. Speaking of room, when the driver says the capacity of his jeepney is 10 passengers on either side, you can’t argue. Ten means ten, even if only half your butt sits comfortably on the padded seat. Only cash payment is accepted, but you probably already know that. Exact fare is appreciated but Mr. Driver is happy to provide change except very early in the day. “Barya lang po sa umaga!” No five hundred peso bills in the morning, please. Jeepney fare is passed on from one passenger to another until it reaches the driver. The same is true for any change back due the passenger. It takes a village to ride the jeepney you know. If you don’t want to be bothered by other passengers asking you to pass on the fare to the driver, sit as far as possible from the driver, assuming that premium spot is vacant. The jeepney driver would appreciate it so much if you pay your fare before you start texting on your mobile phone. “God knows who doesn’t pay,” says one jeepney sign. There are two phrases you need to learn when riding the jeepney: “Bayad po” (here’s my fare) and “Para po” (this is my stop). If you don’t speak the language, no worries. Just pass on your fare to the passenger next to you and he or she will know what to do. And if you need to disembark, just knock on the jeepney’s roof. It also means “please stop.” There are discounted fares for students and seniors. Be sure to say “one senior” or “one student” when paying your fare. Otherwise, you pay full fare. Filipinos have learned to respect seniors and people with disabilities. The spot closest to the jeepney entrance (farthest from the driver) is reserved for them. Isn’t that nice? As always, hold on to the hand rails. It can be a very bumpy ride. Rate this:",0
18558,Comment on It Is Happening Again America! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton by donaldbreaux,"Posted on October 26, 2016 by Michael Snyder 
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote. 
Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state. 
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a quote from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times … 
“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens. 
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney . 
“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House. 
She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.” 
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time. 
“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News. 
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago. 
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012. 
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning. 
And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country . 
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again. 
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper … 
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday. 
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas … 
Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed. 
I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that. 
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas … 
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit! 
And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon … 
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines ? 
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots… 
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters . 
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch. 
Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done. 
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else. 
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“… In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country: Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote Close to 3 million registered in multiples states Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state 
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “… 
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. 
Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner. 
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media. 
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up … 
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud. 
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election. 
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said. 
Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious. 
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it. 
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us. 
And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

18559,Donald Trump Faltering? Die-Hard Fans Refuse to Buy It - The New York Times,"  Pa.  —   The line to see Donald J. Trump snaked back and forth on itself hours before his arrival. There was a carnival atmosphere with people in costumes, including one   man with a sign, “Don’t let the   media elect crooked Hillary. ” A cavalcade of motorcycles roared up, and there were cheers and laughter for a man shouting, “Donald Trump is going to make America great! He hasn’t paid taxes in 20 years!” A day after Mr. Trump defended himself at the second presidential debate for making vulgar comments about women, amid a wave of polls showing an increasing lead for Hillary Clinton, thousands of Trump supporters turned out with undimmed fervor for the Republican nominee and optimism about his electoral prospects. They echoed nearly verbatim Mr. Trump’s defense that his lewd comments about women on a 2005 recording were merely “locker room talk,” calling them harmless words compared with the   actions Mrs. Clinton and her husband had taken to shame women. They reiterated Mr. Trump’s claim that national polls showing him behind by double digits were “rigged” and that he was heading to victory in November. In the campaign’s last weeks, at such rallies, Mr. Trump is sealed in a hermetic bubble with his most fervent supporters. They are people passionate enough to wait hours to attend a rally where the candidate and the crowds draw energy and affirmation from each other, while dismissing any discouraging information. His supporters routinely pointed, as the nominee did, to the huge crowds still flocking to see him as evidence that his campaign remains strong. “I don’t believe anything the media says,” said Brad Chilson, 47, a truck driver from Bradford County, Pa. who waited hours with his wife outside the   Mohegan Sun Arena in   for Mr. Trump. “Look at the turnout we’ve got here. ” Mr. Trump was in high spirits on Monday night in northeastern Pennsylvania, in the heart of a largely white,   region that he has visited regularly, running a campaign sustained by a visceral feel for his audience while ignoring abstractions like data and research. “I think the state of Pennsylvania, we’re going to win so big,” he said. A New York Times polling average shows Mrs. Clinton 7. 2 percentage points ahead in the state. “Everybody in Pennsylvania wants Trump, you know,” he said. “We get crowds like this everywhere. ” He boasted of a rally planned for Florida with an expected 25, 000 people. As he spoke, Katie Packer, a strategist for Mitt Romney in 2012, posted a photograph on Twitter of 30, 000 people at an Ohio rally four years ago a week before Mr. Romney’s defeat. “None of the Trump crowds so far in the general election surpass what we regularly had in ’12,” Ms. Packer wrote. “They are so naïve. ” Yet Mr. Trump whipped the crowd to anger at the news media and its “crooked” polls. At one point, he falsely claimed that CNN had turned off its live coverage as he was accusing the network of manipulating a   focus group. The crowd then chanted an   epithet. He also read the results of unscientific,   online surveys. “Trump 70, Clinton 30,” Mr. Trump quoted from a reader survey by the Drudge Report on which candidate had won the second debate. “Oh, listen to this,” he said, reading from an iPhone. “Time magazine. You think Time magazine likes me?” He cited the result: 89 for Trump, 11 for Clinton. “Oh, here’s a good one,” he added. “Well, they’re slightly conservative  —   Breitbart. 93 to 7,” he read. Mr. Trump’s supporters who were waiting to hear him speak cited alternative sources of information they preferred, dismissing even Fox News in favor of emails from   commentators like Allen B. West, a former congressman, and Dennis Lynch, who makes films about illegal immigration. They also repeated conspiracy theories that flourish online. “A lot of people affiliated with Hillary have died over the years, and nobody says nothing about it,” said Eric Bulger, a retired police officer with the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey. There were equal numbers of women and men at the rally, and many dismissed as insignificant Mr. Trump’s private comments, caught on the 2005 recording, about being able to grab women by their genitals because he was a “star. ” “When all this baloney came out about Trump, I understand it’s a scandal,” said Brenda Stchur, 56, a Democrat from Hudson, Pa. who supports Mr. Trump. “But John F. Kennedy wasn’t innocent, either, and everyone loves John F. Kennedy. ” Marilyn Sevigny, a retiree from Lake Ariel, Pa. said that “as a woman, I don’t like what he said, I’m not defending it. ” But she added that there was a double standard at work. “If a Democrat says it, it’s just words. If a Republican says it, it’s an assault,” she said. Before Sunday’s town   debate, David Quinn, an electronics engineer, told his wife that Mr. Trump should drop out, as some senior elected Republicans were calling on the candidate to do. But Mr. Quinn changed his mind, he said, after Mr. Trump’s apology for his comments from 11 years ago. “The only thing that tape shows is he’s a healthy heterosexual,” he said. Those at the rally agreed that Mr. Trump had won the debate. Many cited as their favorite moment Mr. Trump’s retort that Mrs. Clinton would “be in jail” if he were president. They dismissed the F. B. I. ’s recommendation that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. They faulted the news media for not highlighting that Mrs. Clinton had deleted thousands of emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, as Mr. Trump charged in the debate. Mike Pisano, 65, a factory worker, echoed Mr. Trump’s contention that Mrs. Clinton had escaped indictment because Bill Clinton had met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. “He was on the plane with her fixing that,” Mr. Pisano said. Still, outside the bubble of such devoted followers, Mr. Trump’s prospects in northeastern Pennsylvania are less certain. On  ’s Public Square, whose sidewalks filled during lunch hour on Monday, several Republicans and   Democrats said they were appalled by Mr. Trump and would skip the election, or vote for a   candidate. “I just think he’s a pig,” said Janice Kontur, 44, a registered Republican, who manages an apartment complex. She said she could not bring herself to vote for Mrs. Clinton and planned to sit out Election Day. “As a matter of fact, if he’s elected, me and my daughter will be moving to a different country,” she said of Mr. Trump. Melinda Thompson, a controller for an insurance company, said she would vote for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. She said of Mr. Trump, “I think his temperament would backfire on the United States. ” Paul Galante, a lawyer on a smoking break across from a statue of Christopher Columbus, said he was a registered Democrat but had consistently voted for Republican presidential nominees. Not this year. “All people want is a reason to like the man, and he doesn’t give them a reason,” he said of Mr. Trump. He called the Republican Party “a joke” for nominating Mr. Trump from a field of 17. In the primary, Mr. Galante wrote in a protest candidate, and he is considering voting for Mrs. Clinton in November. “She’s a sneak and a liar,” he said. “But so what at this point? He’s worse. ” The Trump campaign is counting on doing well in the   region, where factories have closed and the presence of   immigrants has caused tensions. But Mr. Galante, a longtime resident, was deeply skeptical of Mr. Trump’s prospects. “He’s going to get slaughtered,” he said.",0

18562,Full Text: Donald Trump’s Speech in Saudi Arabia - Breitbart,"Read the full text of President Donald Trump’s speech to the Muslim world delivered in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia:[I want to thank King Salman for his extraordinary words, and the magnificent Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for hosting today’s summit. I am honored to be received by such gracious hosts. I have always heard about the splendor of your country and the kindness of your citizens, but words do not do justice to the grandeur of this remarkable place and the incredible hospitality you have shown us from the moment we arrived.  You also hosted me in the treasured home of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom who united your great people. Working alongside another beloved leader  —   American President Franklin Roosevelt  —   King Abdulaziz began the enduring partnership between our two countries. King Salman: your father would be so proud to see that you are continuing his legacy  —   and just as he opened the first chapter in our partnership, today we begin a new chapter that will bring lasting benefits to our citizens. Let me now also extend my deep and heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of the distinguished heads of state who made this journey here today. You greatly honor us with your presence, and I send the warmest regards from my country to yours. I know that our time together will bring many blessings to both your people and mine. I stand before you as a representative of the American People, to deliver a message of friendship and hope. That is why I chose to make my first foreign visit a trip to the heart of the Muslim world, to the nation that serves as custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic Faith. In my inaugural address to the American People, I pledged to strengthen America’s oldest friendships, and to build new partnerships in pursuit of peace. I also promised that America will not seek to impose our way of life on others, but to outstretch our hands in the spirit of cooperation and trust. Our vision is one of peace, security, and prosperity —  in this region, and in the world. Our goal is a coalition of nations who share the aim of stamping out extremism and providing our children a hopeful future that does honor to God. And so this historic and unprecedented gathering of leaders —  unique in the history of nations —  is a symbol to the world of our shared resolve and our mutual respect. To the leaders and citizens of every country assembled here today, I want you to know that the United States is eager to form closer bonds of friendship, security, culture and commerce. For Americans, this is an exciting time. A new spirit of optimism is sweeping our country: in just a few months, we have created almost a million new jobs, added over 3 trillion dollars of new value, lifted the burdens on American industry, and made record investments in our military that will protect the safety of our people and enhance the security of our wonderful friends and allies  —   many of whom are here today. Now, there is even more blessed news I am pleased to share with you. My meetings with King Salman, the Crown Prince, and the Deputy Crown Prince, have been filled with great warmth, good will, and tremendous cooperation. Yesterday, we signed historic agreements with the Kingdom that will invest almost $400 billion in our two countries and create many thousands of jobs in America and Saudi Arabia. This landmark agreement includes the announcement of a $110 billion   defense purchase  —   and we will be sure to help our Saudi friends to get a good deal from our great American defense companies. This agreement will help the Saudi military to take a greater role in security operations. We have also started discussions with many of the countries present today on strengthening partnerships, and forming new ones, to advance security and stability across the Middle East and beyond. Later today, we will make history again with the opening of a new Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology  —   located right here, in this central part of the Islamic World. This groundbreaking new center represents a clear declaration that   countries must take the lead in combatting radicalization, and I want to express our gratitude to King Salman for this strong demonstration of leadership. I have had the pleasure of welcoming several of the leaders present today to the White House, and I look forward to working with all of you. America is a sovereign nation and our first priority is always the safety and security of our citizens. We are not here to lecture —  we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship. Instead, we are here to offer partnership  —   based on shared interests and values  —   to pursue a better future for us all. Here at this summit we will discuss many interests we share together. But above all we must be united in pursuing the one goal that transcends every other consideration. That goal is to meet history’s great test —  to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence, and innocent of hatred. And young Muslim men and women should have the chance to build a new era of prosperity for themselves and their peoples. With God’s help, this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed. At the same time, we pray this special gathering may someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East  —   and maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it. Few nations have been spared its violent reach. America has suffered repeated barbaric attacks  —   from the atrocities of September 11th to the devastation of the Boston Bombing, to the horrible killings in San Bernardino and Orlando. The nations of Europe have also endured unspeakable horror. So too have the nations of Africa and even South America. India, Russia, China and Australia have been victims. But, in sheer numbers, the deadliest toll has been exacted on the innocent people of Arab, Muslim and Middle Eastern nations. They have borne the brunt of the killings and the worst of the destruction in this wave of fanatical violence. Some estimates hold that more than 95 percent of the victims of terrorism are themselves Muslim. We now face a humanitarian and security disaster in this region that is spreading across the planet. It is a tragedy of epic proportions. No description of the suffering and depravity can begin to capture its full measure. The true toll of ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, and so many others, must be counted not only in the number of dead. It must also be counted in generations of vanished dreams. The Middle East is rich with natural beauty, vibrant cultures, and massive amounts of historic treasures. It should increasingly become one of the great global centers of commerce and opportunity. This region should not be a place from which refugees flee, but to which newcomers flock. Saudi Arabia is home to the holiest sites in one of the world’s great faiths. Each year millions of Muslims come from around the world to Saudi Arabia to take part in the Hajj. In addition to ancient wonders, this country is also home to modern ones —  including soaring achievements in architecture. Egypt was a thriving center of learning and achievement thousands of years before other parts of the world. The wonders of Giza, Luxor and Alexandria are proud monuments to that ancient heritage. All over the world, people dream of walking through the ruins of Petra in Jordan. Iraq was the cradle of civilization and is a land of natural beauty. And the United Arab Emirates has reached incredible heights with glass and steel, and turned earth and water into spectacular works of art. The entire region is at the center of the key shipping lanes of the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, and the Straits of Hormuz. The potential of this region has never been greater. 65 percent of its population is under the age of 30. Like all young men and women, they seek great futures to build, great national projects to join, and a place for their families to call home. But this untapped potential, this tremendous cause for optimism, is held at bay by bloodshed and terror. There can be no coexistence with this violence. There can be no tolerating it, no accepting it, no excusing it, and no ignoring it. Every time a terrorist murders an innocent person, and falsely invokes the name of God, it should be an insult to every person of faith. Terrorists do not worship God, they worship death. If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen. Terrorism’s devastation of life will continue to spread. Peaceful societies will become engulfed by violence. And the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. If we do not stand in uniform condemnation of this killing —  then not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, but we will be judged by God. This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between Good and Evil. When we see the scenes of destruction in the wake of terror, we see no signs that those murdered were Jewish or Christian, Shia or Sunni. When we look upon the streams of innocent blood soaked into the ancient ground, we cannot see the faith or sect or tribe of the victims  —   we see only that they were Children of God whose deaths are an insult to all that is holy. But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong  —   and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfills their part of the burden. Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land. America is prepared to stand with you  —   in pursuit of shared interests and common security. But the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them. The nations of the Middle East will have to decide what kind of future they want for themselves, for their countries, and for their children. It is a choice between two futures  —   and it is a choice America CANNOT make for you. A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, andDRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH. For our part, America is committed to adjusting our strategies to meet evolving threats and new facts. We will discard those strategies that have not worked —  and will apply new approaches informed by experience and judgment. We are adopting a Principled Realism, rooted in common values and shared interests. Our friends will never question our support, and our enemies will never doubt our determination. Our partnerships will advance security through stability, not through radical disruption. We will make decisions based on   outcomes  —   not inflexible ideology. We will be guided by the lessons of experience, not the confines of rigid thinking. And, wherever possible, we will seek gradual reforms  —   not sudden intervention. We must seek partners, not perfection —  and to make allies of all who share our goals. Above all, America seeks peace  —   not war. Muslim nations must be willing to take on the burden, if we are going to defeat terrorism and send its wicked ideology into oblivion. The first task in this joint effort is for your nations to deny all territory to the foot soldiers of evil. Every country in the region has an absolute duty to ensure that terrorists find no sanctuary on their soil. Many are already making significant contributions to regional security: Jordanian pilots are crucial partners against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and a regional coalition have taken strong action against Houthi militants in Yemen. The Lebanese Army is hunting ISIS operatives who try to infiltrate their territory. Emirati troops are supporting our Afghan partners. In Mosul, American troops are supporting Kurds, Sunnis and Shias fighting together for their homeland. Qatar, which hosts the U. S. Central Command, is a crucial strategic partner. Our longstanding partnership with Kuwait and Bahrain continue to enhance security in the region. And courageous Afghan soldiers are making tremendous sacrifices in the fight against the Taliban, and others, in the fight for their country. As we deny terrorist organizations control of territory and populations, we must also strip them of their access to funds. We must cut off the financial channels that let ISIS sell oil, let extremists pay their fighters, and help terrorists smuggle their reinforcements. I am proud to announce that the nations here today will be signing an agreement to prevent the financing of terrorism, called the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center  —     by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and joined by every member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It is another historic step in a day that will be long remembered. I also applaud the Gulf Cooperation Council for blocking funders from using their countries as a financial base for terror, and designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization last year. Saudi Arabia also joined us this week in placing sanctions on one of the most senior leaders of Hezbollah. Of course, there is still much work to do. That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamist extremism and the Islamist terror groups it inspires. And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory  —   piety to evil will bring you no dignity. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and YOUR SOUL WILL BE CONDEMNED. And political leaders must speak out to affirm the same idea: heroes don’t kill innocents they save them. Many nations here today have taken important steps to raise up that message. Saudi Arabia’s Vision for 2030 is an important and encouraging statement of tolerance, respect, empowering women, and economic development. The United Arab Emirates has also engaged in the battle for hearts and souls —  and with the U. S. launched a center to counter the online spread of hate. Bahrain too is working to undermine recruitment and radicalism. I also applaud Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees. The surge of migrants and refugees leaving the Middle East depletes the human capital needed to build stable societies and economies. Instead of depriving this region of so much human potential, Middle Eastern countries can give young people hope for a brighter future in their home nations and regions. That means promoting the aspirations and dreams of all citizens who seek a better life  —   including women, children, and followers of all faiths. Numerous Arab and Islamic scholars have eloquently argued that protecting equality strengthens Arab and Muslim communities. For many centuries the Middle East has been home to Christians, Muslims and Jews living   . We must practice tolerance and respect for each other once again —  and make this region a place where every man and woman, no matter their faith or ethnicity, can enjoy a life of dignity and hope. In that spirit, after concluding my visit in Riyadh, I will travel to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and then to the Vatican  —   visiting many of the holiest places in the three Abrahamic Faiths. If these three faiths can join together in cooperation, then peace in this world is possible  —   including peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I will be meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Starving terrorists of their territory, their funding, and the false allure of their craven ideology, will be the basis for defeating them. But no discussion of stamping out this threat would be complete without mentioning the government that gives terrorists all three —  safe harbor, financial backing, and the social standing needed for recruitment. It is a regime that is responsible for so much instability in the region. I am speaking of course of Iran. From Lebanon to Iraq to Yemen, Iran funds, arms, and trains terrorists, militias, and other extremist groups that spread destruction and chaos across the region. For decades, Iran has fueled the fires of sectarian conflict and terror. It is a government that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing the destruction of Israel, death to America, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. Among Iran’s most tragic and destabilizing interventions have been in Syria. Bolstered by Iran, Assad has committed unspeakable crimes, and the United States has taken firm action in response to the use of banned chemical weapons by the Assad Regime  —   launching 59 tomahawk missiles at the Syrian air base from where that murderous attack originated. Responsible nations must work together to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria, eradicate ISIS, and restore stability to the region. The Iranian regime’s   victims are its own people. Iran has a rich history and culture, but the people of Iran have endured hardship and despair under their leaders’ reckless pursuit of conflict and terror. Until the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve. The decisions we make will affect countless lives. King Salman, I thank you for the creation of this great moment in history, and for your massive investment in America, its industry and its jobs. I also thank you for investing in the future of this part of the world. This fertile region has all the ingredients for extraordinary success  —   a rich history and culture, a young and vibrant people, a thriving spirit of enterprise. But you can only unlock this future if the citizens of the Middle East are freed from extremism, terror and violence. We in this room are the leaders of our peoples. They look to us for answers, and for action. And when we look back at their faces, behind every pair of eyes is a soul that yearns for justice. Today, billions of faces are now looking at us, waiting for us to act on the great question of our time. Will we be indifferent in the presence of evil? Will we protect our citizens from its violent ideology? Will we let its venom spread through our societies? Will we let it destroy the most holy sites on earth? If we do not confront this deadly terror, we know what the future will bring —  more suffering and despair. But if we act —  if we leave this magnificent room unified and determined to do what it takes to destroy the terror that threatens the world —  then there is no limit to the great future our citizens will have. The birthplace of civilization is waiting to begin a new renaissance. Just imagine what tomorrow could bring. Glorious wonders of science, art, medicine and commerce to inspire humankind. Great cities built on the ruins of shattered towns. New jobs and industries that will lift up millions of people. Parents who no longer worry for their children, families who no longer mourn for their loved ones, and the faithful who finally worship without fear. These are the blessings of prosperity and peace. These are the desires that burn with a righteous flame in every human heart. And these are the just demands of our beloved peoples. I ask you to join me, to join together, to work together, and to FIGHT together —   BECAUSE UNITED, WE WILL NOT FAIL. Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless Your Countries. And God Bless the United States of America.

18563,Exclusive - Karen Handel: ’I Intend to Have the Last Laugh When I Win’ - Breitbart,"Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel told Breitbart News on Monday morning that she intends to overcome Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats, and liberal media bias, by winning the special election for Georgia’s 6th congressional district on Tuesday. [“There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced,” she told Breitbart News in a telephone interview. “But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow. ”  Handel, a former Georgia Secretary of State, is currently running    with Democrat Jon Ossoff in the race to replace Dr. Tom Price, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year. Ossoff is a newcomer to politics who actually lives outside the district, but who has energized Democratic activists and donors nationwide in the primary race in April by shaping his campaign as a referendum on the Trump administration. Republicans in the district told Breitbart News during a visit Sunday that they were cautiously optimistic, despite poll numbers showing a dead heat or Ossoff with a small but significant lead. Handel shared their optimism: “I feel great about things  —   early voting numbers that we’ve seen look very positive for me, and Republicans tend to be strong on Election Day,” she said. Politico reported on Sunday night that Republicans believe massive early voting numbers  —   over 140, 000  —   favor them, and that they hope to capitalize on the fact that there are more Republican voters in the district. The race has involved some $50 million in spending on both sides, making it the most expensive race in congressional history. On Monday morning, President Trump tweeted his support for the campaign, urging people to “[V]ote now for Karen H” (though early voting ended on Friday): The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P’s. Vote now for Karen H,  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2017, In the face of Democrats’ efforts to make the race about Trump, Handel said that she had neither distanced herself nor tied herself to the president. “The only people who want to make this about other things are, frankly, reporters like you and others out there,” she told Breitbart News. “This race is about the people of the 6th district. ” One of the major national issues  —   aside from Trump himself  —   is health care, with Republicans’ ongoing efforts to repeal Obamacare criticized by both liberals (for tampering with an entitlement) and conservatives (for not going far enough). But Handel says that has not been a big factor in the race. “It hasn’t been that much of an issue on the ground,” she told Breitbart News. “For voters in the 6th district, the biggest issue is that Jon Ossoff is from outside the district. ” Asked why Democrats in the district did not seem to mind that, Handel said: “He’s completely aligned with [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi   …     [Democrats] want someone who will march lockstep with the liberal mantra. ” Other issues, she said, were “veterans issues, transportation infrastructure, the fight against terrorism, [the] budget, and the economy  —     issues. ” Last week, Handel’s campaign were mailed packages that “contained threatening letters and a suspicious substance. ” She told Breitbart that the threats had the effect of “making me and everyone around me more determined to win on Tuesday. ” As for last Wednesday’s shooting attack on Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia, she said that she and her campaign had refused to politicize it. “No one from my camp is going to be making anything political for that. ” She concluded: “I think it’s going to go well for me and for Republicans. We will show the country, and all the eyes on the district, that Nancy Pelosi is not going to come into the district and steal the seat out from under us. ” Election Day is tomorrow, June 20, and both parties seem to expect a close result.

18564,Trump Delays Decision to Withdraw from Paris Climate Agreement - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump will decide whether to keep the United States in the Paris climate agreement after a meeting of leading industrial nations later this month. [White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters about the new timeline Tuesday.  “The president has been meeting with his team for quite a while on this matter, and he will not be making an announcement regarding that agreement until after he returns from the ” Spicer said, referring to the Group of Seven meeting scheduled for May   in Italy. He continued, “The reason that he’s seeking the advice of his team is to get options and then he’ll pursue the best one. But I’m not going to tell you which one that he’s going to do. ” Spicer’s announcement came the same day that a team of White House officials delayed discussions on whether to withdraw from the Paris agreement or stay in the global accord. President Trump promised to withdraw from the Paris agreement during his presidential campaign. Senior White House adviser Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt argued against staying in the Paris agreement. White House advisers Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argue that the United States should remain in the Paris accord. The other world leaders will lobby Trump to stay in the Paris climate agreement at the   meeting. The leaders of all the other   members —  Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the European Union all support the agreement. Sean Spicer said, “The president wants to continue to meet with his team   …     meet with not just the economic piece, but his environmental team, and come to a decision on what’s the best interests of the United States, using the expertise that surrounds him. ”",0
18565,WATCH: Full-Body Tracking Puts You in the Game with Virtual Reality - Breitbart,"In a YouTube video posted on January 19, CloudGate Studio demonstrated an experiment in   virtual reality tracking with the HTC Vive. [With two controllers in his hands, and two more strapped to his feet, CloudGate CEO Steve Bowler demonstrated some amazing live tracking of his body in a  3D VR environment, using two of Valve’s HTC Vives. He posted a link to the video on Twitter:  Wake up, Neo. @CloudGateStudio just figured out how to give you a   presence in VR. pic. twitter.   —   Steve Bowler (@gameism) January 19, 2017,  Bowler first showed off the function of virtual hands in the game, but said that it’s something “everyone’s [doing]. ” Then he displayed unfinished virtual arms, saying “we’re not going to ship this yet,” but “it’s getting there. ” But CloudGate wanted to “do more than just this   …     like, a lot more. ” So with the aid of four total motion controllers in addition to an HTC Vive headset, Bowler showed what he called “a pretty good facsimile of a human body in VR. ” He then demonstrated the ability to look down at his virtual body and make contact with it in a way that mirrored the contact he was making with his own   form. He touched his toes, then his head and shoulders. The shadow of his form mimicked his   motions, even to the point of dancing and crouching, despite a lack of hip tracking. Bowler said that while right now the simulation is effectively guessing at the position of his hips, with a dedicated hip tracker it would look even better. He concluded the video by demonstrating interactivity in the environment, able to “kick all the things. ” He proceeded to do just that, showing how objects in the environment reacted to his motions because he “had a body” in VR. But according to Steve himself, this was just a “hack,” with a better realization of the concept being adapted to the new HTC Vive trackers announced at CES 2017. @nuclearfossil it’s a ”hack” using two Vives so we could get 4 wireless controllers. Now that it’s proven will move to Vive Trackers later.  —   Steve Bowler (@gameism) January 20, 2017,  The possibilities for this development are thrilling.   tracking in VR could provide endless application in entertainment and social spaces alike. We’ll definitely be keeping an eye on further developments from CloudGate Studio and other virtual reality pioneers, as the emerging technology finds its place in the global market.

Trump reeled on Sunday amid a sustained campaign of criticism by the parents of a Muslim American soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq and a rising outcry within his own party over his rough and ethnically charged dismissal of the couple. The confrontation between the parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, and Mr. Trump has emerged as an unexpected and potentially pivotal flash point in the general election. Mr. Trump has plainly struggled to respond to the reproach of a military family who lost a son, and has answered their criticism derisively  —   first implying that Ms. Khan had been forbidden to speak at the Democratic National Convention, then declaring that Mr. Khan had “no right” to question Mr. Trump’s familiarity with the Constitution. And Mr. Trump’s usual political tool kit has appeared to fail him. He earned no reprieve with his complaints that Mr. Khan had been unfair to him on Sunday morning, he claimed on Twitter that Mr. Khan had “viciously attacked” him. Mr. Trump and his advisers tried repeatedly to change the subject to Islamic terrorism, to no avail. Instead, Mr. Trump appeared to be caught on Sunday in one of the biggest crises of his campaign, rivaling the uproar in June after he suggested a federal judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel, was biased because of his Mexican heritage. By going after a military family and trafficking in religious stereotypes, Mr. Trump once again breached multiple norms of American politics, redoubling pressure on his fellow Republicans to choose between defending his remarks or breaking publicly with their nominee. Mr. Trump also risked reopening controversies related to religious tolerance and military service: His treatment of the Khans has brought on a new wave of criticism of his proposal to ban Muslim immigration, and of his mockery of Senator John McCain’s time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Democratic leaders and candidates for Congress began over the weekend to call on Republicans to disavow Mr. Trump. And the top two Republicans in Congress, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, signaled their strong disagreement with Mr. Trump, but stopped short of condemning him in blunt terms. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, sternly reprimanded Mr. Trump on Sunday morning, saying at a church in Cleveland that he had answered the Khan family’s sacrifice with disrespect for them and for American traditions of religious tolerance. “Mr. Khan paid the ultimate sacrifice in his family, didn’t he?” Mrs. Clinton said. “And what has he heard from Donald Trump? Nothing but insults, degrading comments about Muslims, a total misunderstanding of what made our country great. ” Mrs. Clinton chastised Mr. Trump again on Sunday in Ashland, Ohio, calling his comments part of a disturbing pattern. “He called Mexicans rapists and criminals,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He said a federal judge was unqualified because he had Mexican heritage  —   someone born in the neighboring state of Indiana. He’s called women pigs. He’s mocked a reporter with a disability. ” Mr. and Ms. Khan stiffened their denunciation of Mr. Trump on Sunday, saying that he lacked the moral character and empathy to be president. Mr. Khan, who addressed the Democratic National Convention on Thursday, said on “Meet the Press” on NBC that Mr. Trump had shown disrespect to his wife, and he accused Mr. Trump of running a campaign “of hatred, of derision, of dividing us. ” In a direct appeal to voters inclined to support Mr. Trump, Mr. Khan pleaded with them to reject his brand of politics. Addressing “patriotic Americans that would probably vote for Donald Trump,” Mr. Khan said, “I appeal to them not to vote for hatred, not to vote for  . Vote for unity. Vote for the goodness of this country. ” And Ms. Khan, in an opinion article published in The Washington Post, rebuked Mr. Trump for suggesting earlier in the weekend that she had not been permitted to speak at the Democratic convention. Ms. Khan said she did not speak because she did not believe she could remain composed while talking about her son. “All the world, all America, felt my pain. I am a Gold Star mother. Whoever saw me felt me in their heart,” Ms. Khan wrote, using the term for surviving family members of those killed in war. “Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak?” Ms. Khan said Mr. Trump was “ignorant” of Islam and criticized him for offering his business career as evidence that he had sacrificed for his country. “Donald Trump said he has made a lot of sacrifices,” Ms. Khan said. “He doesn’t know what the word sacrifice means. ” It is too soon to say how severe the damage to Mr. Trump might be, but the clash has already entangled him in a   dayslong argument with sympathetic accusers who are portraying him as a person of unredeemable callousness. Still, he has proved remarkably resilient, getting past controversies that might have sunk other candidates. Several prominent Republicans have condemned Mr. Trump’s treatment of the Khans, calling his behavior outside the bounds of political discourse. But Republican congressional leaders responded cautiously to Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell released statements stressing their admiration for the Khan family Mr. McConnell called Capt. Humayun Khan an “American hero. ” And both said they firmly opposed banning Muslim immigration, though neither mentioned Mr. Trump, whom they have endorsed, by name. “Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military, and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example,” Mr. Ryan said. “His sacrifice  —   and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan  —   should always be honored. Period. ” Mr. Trump’s clash with the Khan family threatens to unwind any progress he may have made at moderating his campaign and rallying his party at the outset of the general election. He has sought to play down his proposal for banning Muslim immigration, focusing on blocking immigration from specific countries instead, but has never disavowed the idea of a religious test. And he has not apologized to the Khans for his comments about Ms. Khan. Those comments have deeply unsettled many leading Republicans. Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and John Kasich, the governor of Ohio, have forcefully expressed disapproval. A spokesman for former President George W. Bush declined to comment directly on Mr. Trump’s behavior, but suggested Mr. Bush takes a different view. “President Bush remains deeply grateful for the sacrifice of all Gold Star families, as we all should be. He thinks about them and prays for them each and every day,” said the spokesman, Freddy Ford. Other Republicans went even further in chiding Mr. Trump. Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is seeking   said the Khans deserved the utmost respect: “I am appalled that Donald Trump would disparage them and that he had the gall to compare his own sacrifices to those of a Gold Star family. ” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Sunday that Mr. Trump had crossed another inviolable line. Like his comments about Judge Curiel, Mr. Graham said, Mr. Trump’s jabs at Mr. and Ms. Khan were unacceptable. “This is going to a place where we’ve never gone before, to push back against the families of the fallen,” he said. He added, “The problem is, ‘unacceptable’ doesn’t even begin to describe it. ” Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, a Republican who served in combat as a Marine and now represents a crucial swing district in the Denver suburbs, said Mr. Trump had disrespected American troops. “Having served in Iraq, I’m deeply offended when Donald Trump fails to honor the sacrifices of all of our brave soldiers who were lost in that war,” Mr. Coffman said. The pressure on Mr. Trump and other Republicans is unlikely to relent soon. But so far he has flailed and faltered in response. He first criticized Ms. Khan for not speaking alongside her husband, implying that she had been prohibited from doing so. Facing mounting criticism from Democrats and Republicans, he released a   statement on Saturday night, describing the Khans’ deceased son as a hero, but insisting that Mr. Khan had “no right” to criticize him the way he did in Philadelphia. He made a third attempt to deflect the Khans’ criticism on Sunday, writing on Twitter that the real issue at stake in the election was terrorism. The Republican   nominee, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, appears to be in a particularly awkward position in the uproar. His son is a Marine, a fact he mentions frequently. Mr. Pence’s ability to navigate a racially charged argument between Mr. Trump and a Gold Star family is emerging as his first difficult test as Mr. Trump’s running mate. For most of the weekend, Mr. Pence was silent. His aides referred inquiries to Mr. Trump’s staff, and his lone public comment was a Twitter post about getting his hair cut in Indianapolis. Late Sunday, Mr. Pence issued a statement sidestepping Mr. Trump’s criticism of the Khans. He expressed appreciation for the family’s sacrifice and reiterated his support for blocking immigration “from countries that have been compromised by terrorism. ”",0

18568,VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION ANNOUNCES HISTORIC MARCH AGAINST PRESIDENT MADURO,"Home › WORLD NEWS › VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION ANNOUNCES HISTORIC MARCH AGAINST PRESIDENT MADURO VENEZUELAN OPPOSITION ANNOUNCES HISTORIC MARCH AGAINST PRESIDENT MADURO 0 SHARES [10/27/16] The Venezuelan opposition announced a national strike planned for Friday, October 28 and warned President Nicolás Maduro’s adminstration that it will hold another November 3 that leads to the Presidential Palace of Miraflores if a date is not set for the recall referendum postponed indefinitely early this year. 
“We demand the government reverse this unconstitutional decision,” said Governor of the state of Miranda and leader of the opposition Henrique Capriles. “Either you return the constitutional order or we’re going to Miraflores on November 3.” 
Capriles stressed that people are willing to go out into the streets to defend the constitution. 
“Tell (President of the National Electoral Council) Tibisay Lucena that in the coming hours, she has to announce the date of an election and let the people decide because if we remain in this coup attitude next week … the people will mobilize at Miraflores,” the opposition leader said.

18569,Vatican Invites ‘Population Bomb’ Hoaxer Paul Ehrlich to Workshop,"The Vatican has invited the most notorious population alarmist in recent history to speak at an upcoming   conference titled ‘Biological Extinction. ”[The conference, sponsored jointly by the Pontifical Academy of Science and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, will address issues of biodiversity, “great extinctions” of history, population and demographics.  Dr. Paul R. Ehrlich —  who has defended mass sterilization,   abortion and infanticide —  will speak on “Causes and Pathways of Biodiversity Losses: Consumption Preferences, Population Numbers, Technology, Ecosystem Productivity. ” To allow women to have as many children as they want, Ehrlich has said, is like letting people “throw as much of their garbage into their neighbor’s backyard as they want. ” Ehrlich became famous through the publication of his 1968 doomsday bestseller, The Population Bomb, which generated mass hysteria over the future of the world and the earth’s ability to sustain human life. In the book, Ehrlich launched a series of frightening predictions that turned out to be spectacularly wrong, creating the myth of unsustainable population growth. He prophesied that hundreds of millions would starve to death in the 1970s (and that 65 million of them would be Americans) that   India was doomed, and that odds were fair that “England will not exist in the year 2000. ” Ehrlich concluded that “sometime in the next 15 years, the end will come,” meaning “an utter breakdown of the capacity of the planet to support humanity. ” Mankind stood on the brink of Armageddon, the book proposed, because there was no way to feed the exponentially increasing world population. The opening line set the tone for the whole work: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. ” Despite Ehrlich’s utter failure to predict humanity’s ability to feed itself, his theories will be dusted off and   in the Vatican in late February. In its brochure for the upcoming workshop, the Vatican asserts in Ehrlichian doomspeak that “Earth cannot sustain” our desire for “enhanced consumption. ” Humanity is presently using about 156 percent of “the Earth’s sustainable capacity” every year, the text contends, and it is therefore essential to address “the question whether the Earth system is able to support the demands that humanity has been making on it” and “how global inequality and poverty relate to that. ” The conference will also feature a speaker from an environmental advocacy group called the Global Footprint Network (GFN) which each year calculates the day when the year’s available resources supposedly run out and mankind begins overconsuming nature. “We use more ecological resources and services than nature can regenerate through overfishing, overharvesting forests and emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than forests can sequester,” the group exclaims on its website. “On August 8, 2016, we will have used as much from nature as our planet can renew in the whole year,” GFN announced last summer. In their brochure, the Pontifical Academies make the counterintuitive claim that biodiversity means “everything” for the human race, but then proceed to acknowledge that only 103 species of plants out of an estimated 425, 000 species produce about 90 percent of our food worldwide. Moreover, just three kinds of grain, maize, rice, and wheat, produce about 60 percent of the total, the text notes. Since none of these species are under any danger of extinction, one wonders how biodiversity can mean “everything” for humanity. Just why the Vatican would wish to showcase the purveyor of debunked, apocalyptic theories is anybody’s guess, but it certainly cannot bode well for the relationship between faith and science.

18570,Iowa Girl Faces Death: Life Destroyed by Gardasil Vaccine,"Iowa Girl Faces Death: Life Destroyed by Gardasil Vaccine 
by Health Impact News 
The VAXXED film crew continues interviewing people who are vaccine damaged around the country. They were recently in Iowa, and interviewed the family of Sydney Weggen. 
Sydney states that before Gardasil she used to dance up to 5 hours every day, but now she does not dance at all. 
Her school recommended to her parents that she get the Tdap vaccine, because a student in her class with pertussis “coughed on” her. Sydney was almost 11 years old at that time. 
When they took her to their doctor to get the pertussis vaccine, they were offered the Gardasil vaccine as well. Because they had seen many commercials on TV for the Gardasil shot, and because the doctor was recommending it, they consented and Sydney received the first Gardasil shot. She also received the second and third shots a few months apart. 
Sydney began to have appetite problems, not being able to eat much. She began to lose weight. She lost over 20 lbs. before her 12th birthday and became anemic. Doctors thought at this point it was a psychiatric problem, and not physical. The parents were told it was “all in her head.” 
As her condition continued to deteriorate, blood work done suggested there was something physical going on, and she was referred to the university hospital to check for some autoimmune sickness, such as Crohn’s Disease or Lupus. 
After being admitted to the University of Iowa Hospital, they ran further tests. Her right lung was found full of fluid. But the doctors could not figure out what the problem was, and so they waited for more specialists to look at her. 
As they waited, her weight dropped to only 66 lbs., and her parents realized that she was dying. 
Someone suggested they take her to the Mayo clinic so they could get some answers. After spending $20,000.00 on tests, they were still not getting results. They had to put a stent in to get her lung to keep functioning.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook – Available for immediate download. 
One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

18571,Diver Recounts His Encounter With a Cage-Breaking Great White Shark - The New York Times,"A scuba diver who was on a diving tour of great white shark habitats narrowly escaped an encounter with one this month when it broke through the bars of a diving cage and thrashed for nearly a minute until it freed itself. The diver, Chan Ming, a   advertising executive who is a scuba instructor in his spare time, was among about 20 people on a   tour from Ensenada, Mexico, to Guadalupe Island. The main purpose was to see sharks, and Mr. Chan, 51, jumped into the water on Oct. 5 with a camera. He entered the cage hoping for a  . During the encounter, which was caught on video and then shared across the internet, a juvenile great white leaps for a piece of tuna.   the shark slaps against the bars of the cage, entering and thrashing while Mr. Chan is trapped inside. A tour employee immediately leaps forward to open the top hatch of the cage to allow the shark to escape. About 20 harrowing seconds later, the shark finally wriggles free, breaching as it finds its way back to open water in the Pacific Ocean. The footage was captured by the operator of the Gabe and Garrett YouTube page, an   account for children. The boys’ father, who identified himself as Brian but would not give his last name out of concern for the safety of his children, said in an interview that two divers had left the water about two minutes before the encounter, which was “good timing on their part. ” In a telephone interview, Mr. Chan said he did not have time to take photos of the encounter, and could not see what was happening as the shark was thrashing because the cage was rattling so sharply. He said he was not afraid to be trapped inside the cage with the shark. “Honestly at that moment I don’t have time to get afraid,” he said. “Because the shark is coming, a very sharp moment, two seconds. ” Instead, he focused on staying inside the cage. When the shark finally breached, Mr. Chan pulled himself up and out of the cage. In the end, he still had three more days of diving left. Did he go into the water again? “The next day,” Mr. Chan said. “I felt so lucky,” he added, “why would I be scared?”",0
18572,Trump Quietly Continues Obama’s ’Catch and Release’ at Border,"President Donald J. Trump is allowing former President Barack Obama’s “catch and release” of illegal immigrants to continue deep into his administration’s term with no end in sight to the controversial open borders protocol. Border Patrol agents are once again sounding the alarm and alerting the public about the separation between DC’s rhetoric and the realities on the U. S.  border  —   a practice that the agents hoped would become unnecessary under the Trump Administration. [Though Trump’s interior enforcement of U. S. immigration laws has resulted in far fewer illegal crossings at the border, agents say that low numbers will not be sustained because the Trump Administration has not actually made substantial changes within border security as a whole.  Border Patrol Agent Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) spoke with Breitbart Texas on Trump’s quiet continuation of Obama’s catch and release. He stated, “Obama’s catch and release is definitely continuing and our government is releasing illegal aliens into U. S. communities. The steps taken for such releases have slightly changed and the numbers are not as high, but it is still occurring. Under Trump, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] is holding more illegal aliens than what they did under Obama, but make no mistake, ICE is still releasing a good number of illegal aliens into U. S. communities. Americans need to know this. ” Though Trump ordered    to end and despite claims from the Justice Department that the protocol is now over, the data show that it simply has not ended. One news site touted the program as over, yet further reading in the same article shows it was simply reduced a bit. That news site, The Daily Caller, wrote: Data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University reveals that it is indeed a “new era. ” Records obtained by the group show that 61 percent of immigrants given NTAs under Trump were detained, compared to 27 percent detained under Obama. These are for cases as of the end of March, as immigrants given NTAs under Obama have yet to show up in court. Border Patrol Agent Judd cautioned against media spin on the issue. He stated, “Again, Americans need to know the facts here. They need to know that a decrease in the numbers of illegal aliens released does not mean the program is over. Outlets or leaders making such claims only serve to reduce the accurate information that Americans need to make decisions. ” Agent Judd continued,  “Illegal aliens are being released into U. S. communities just as they were under President Obama. ” Brandon Darby is managing director and    of Breitbart Texas. He   the Cartel Chronicles project with Ildefonso Ortiz and Stephen K. Bannon.

The bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily. It’s not a question of Trump, it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated. If the people choose Hillary, then they must and will be punished. 
“Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillary’s ‘Working Relationship’ with Muslim Brotherhood,” By John Hayward , Breitbart, October 26, 2016: 
In a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015, revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks, former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clinton’s “working relationship” with the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skills.President Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, in a passage that began with the standard Democrat “stuff happens” shrugging defense for foreign policy failures: 
Finally, we live in a world, as I said, that’s full of good news and bad news. The United States cannot control it all, but we need a president who’s most likely to make as many good things happen as possible, and most likely to prevent big, bad things from happening. You can’t keep every bad thing from happening; who’s most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way. Even the people who don’t like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadn’t been for the sanctions. Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off – something I thought she’d never be able to do. I confess. I’m never surprised by anything she does, but that surprised me. I didn’t think she could do it. The Chinese and the Russians to see past their short-term self-interest to their long-term interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race. 
And when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt, in spite of the fact that we were (inaudible), she developed a working relationship with the then-president and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a full-scale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which on top of what was going on in Syria and the (inaudible) Jordan would have been a calamity for the world. 
And when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev, she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty, which limits warheads and missiles. And she lobbied it through the Senate. She had to get 67 votes, which means a lot of these Republicans who say

For example, he said at his press conference, that if he had just thought about it for a moment, had taken his time, he would have said that he had met twice with the Russian ambassador. He had seven weeks to say that. He was testifying under oath to the American people. and, he said something that just wasn’t true. ” He added, “I would like to give him some benefit of the doubt.

18575,Comment on Bryan Cranston: Another Hollyweird actor who “promises” to move out of the US if Trump is elected by Dr. Eowyn,"Posted on November 2, 2016 by DCG | 1 Comment Hollyweird actor Bryan Cranston From Daily Mail : He spent years as America’s lovable dad in Malcolm in the Middle before starring on one of the most-watched cable shows in the country – Breaking Bad. But Bryan Cranston could be saying farewell to the United States after the election results are announced. The 60-year-old actor has warned he will move to Canada if Donald Trump becomes the next president.
‘I would definitely move,’ he told The Bestseller Experiment podcast when asked what he would do if Trump was elected over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. ‘It’s not real to me that, that would happen. I hope to God it won’t,’ he added. ‘It wouldn’t be a vacation. I’d be an expatriate,’ Cranston added. 
The Emmy-award winning actor is the latest Hollywood celebrity to pledge to leave the country if the Donald wins the election next week. He joins the likes of Clinton supporters Barbra Streisand, comedian Chelsea Handler and Girls creator and star Lena Dunham who have all said they will move abroad if the Republican presidential candidate wins the vote. No comment necessary We will have to wait and see whether they will keep their promises.
But the opportunity to test them is becoming more and more likley as Trump closes ground on Clinton after the FBI announced it was re-opening the investigation into her email scandal. An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll released Sunday showed Clinton ahead 46 per cent to 45 – narrower than Saturday’s 2-point Clinton edge. 
Cranston, who more recently played Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson, has been an outspoken critic of Trump, branding him a ‘supreme narcissist’ and an ’emperor without any clothes’ following his controversial campaign . 
The Emmy Award-winner said previously the billionaire tycoon’s rise in politics had ‘slapped’ Americans in the face and he would eventually be ‘swept to the side’. ‘I don’t want to join the vitriol that Donald Trump represents,’ Cranston told the Press Association. ‘He’s crude and crass and empty headed . If it weren’t serious, it would be laughable. Here we have a reality show, game show guy who’s now at the top of one of the two parties. That there are millions of people who are going to vote for him says something about, perhaps, disenfranchisement. People who are left out. People who don’t feel they are being listened to.’ 
Cranston revealed that he’s met both Trump and Clinton, but his facetime with the billionaire Republican was 20 years ago. ‘As he was saying hello it was like he was thinking of three or four or five other things, so it didn’t feel like he was actually present,’ Cranston recalled. Obama showing maturity and introspection His meeting with Clinton and another with her husband were improvements. ‘She asked me questions and I gave my opinion. And I think that’s what I want, I want a president, quite frankly, with what our current president has shown – diplomacy, restraint, introspection, a maturity – he’s not any of those things ,’ Cranston said, moving on to Trump. Hillary showing maturity and introspection ‘He’s the antitheses of what you’d want a president to be as far as behavior and comportment,’ the actor added. He added that university courses will be taught, books will be written and movies will be made in the future about Trump and this bizarre election.
Cranston, who is a Clinton supporter, said he did not care if his views cost him fans, but that it was his responsibility as a public figure to talk politics as well . ‘I am willing to take those risks, I don’t want to sit on the sidelines. 
The socially-conscious Cranston joins the growing list of stars who have spoken up for Clinton which also includes Elizabeth Banks, actress America Ferrera and Scandal star Tony Goldwyn, all Hillary Clinton regulars on the campaign trail. 
More than 100 celebrities have also signed on to a MoveOn.org campaign launched on Monday to urge voters not to put Trump in the White House , with Mark Ruffalo, Neil Patrick Harris, Shonda Rhimes, and Macklemore added to the mix.

18576,Krauthammer: ’I’m Not an America Firster’ - ’I Welcome’ Shifts In Trump Foreign Policy Doctrine - Breitbart,"On Thursday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report,” columnist Charles Krauthammer stated that he welcomes President Trump’s recent foreign policy moves, particularly the Syria strike, because “I’m not an America Firster. I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we’re coming home. ”  Krauthammer said, “[T]he strike on Syria was not something that is a tweak or a slight deviation from what he ran on.   …     And the reason it is a radical departure is because, in the Inaugural Address he defines national interests very narrowly, and here, what we are back to is the traditional American understanding of national interests as a broad definition, going all the way back to Harry Truman, in which we define our interest as worldwide, otherwise, what is Syria to us?” He added, “I welcome this. I’m not an America Firster. I thought it was a mistake to enunciate a doctrine in the Inaugural Address which is, we’re coming home. It scared the   out of our allies in NATO, when he talked about it being obsolete. It scared  —   in the Middle East, the Gulf Arabs were scared to death. I think this is reassuring that we are returning to the classic American definition, where we include our allies, and, most important, we accept world leadership in a way that had not been accepted by Obama, and seemed to be not accepted by Trump the candidate. ” (video via Real Clear Politics) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",0
18577,Kanye West Calls Out Beyoncé and Praises Trump in Onstage Tirade - The New York Times,"Kanye West likened himself to Donald J. Trump at a concert on Saturday in California before tumbling into a     speech addressing radio programmers, MTV, his friends and collaborators Jay Z and Beyoncé, Hillary Clinton, Mark Zuckerberg and more. After getting an array of grievances off his chest  —   from   politics to   politics  —   Mr. West ended the performance with a microphone drop, having played only three songs, leaving fans bitter and upset, according to reactions on social media. “It’s a new world, Hillary Clinton, it’s a new world,” Mr. West said from his floating platform stage above the crowd. “Feelings matter. Because guess what? Everybody in Middle America felt a way and they showed you how they felt. ” The brief concert, at the Golden 1 Center in Sacramento, came two nights after Mr. West shocked his audience by announcing at a show in San Jose, Calif. that he had not voted, but would have cast a ballot for Mr. Trump if he had. Though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like Black Lives Matter and women’s rights, he praised Mr. Trump’s “method of communication” as “very futuristic. ” On Saturday night, in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current Saint Pablo tour, Mr. West doubled down on his embrace of   political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media. “Yeah, I’m taking his lead,” Mr. West said of the  . “A lot of people here tonight felt like they lost,” the rapper began. “You know why? Because y’all been lied to. Google lied to you. Facebook lied to you. Radio lied to you. ” Turning his focus on the music industry, Mr. West questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by Drake but not Frank Ocean, and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows. Referring to this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, Mr. West pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political    dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events. “Beyoncé, I was hurt because I heard that you said you wouldn’t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over ‘Hotline Bling,’” he said. “Sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win,” he continued. “I’ve been sitting here to give y’all my truth even at the risk of my own life  —   even at the risk of my own success, my own career. ” However, Mr. West said, such   was necessary for real progress. “Obama couldn’t make America great because he couldn’t be him to be who he was,” he said. “Black men have been slaves. Obama wasn’t allowed to do this”  —   the rapper screamed  —   “and still win. He had to be perfect. But being perfect don’t always change” things. When more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech, disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds. On Sunday, the Golden 1 Center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full, including Ticketmaster fees. On Monday, a representative for Mr. West said that remaining dates on the second leg of the “Saint Pablo” tour have been canceled. Even amid his raw, spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue, Mr. West seemed to know he was courting controversy. “I’m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way,” he said. “But I’m going to say how I feel. ” He added, “Get ready to have a field day, press. Get ready, get ready. Because the show’s over. ”",0

A couple of months ago, then   Kamala Harris appointed Julie Chavez Rodriguez to be her state director, overseeing operations in California. Ms. Rodriguez, 38, would “give voice to our vulnerable communities,” Ms. Harris said at the time. Ms. Rodriguez had experience. Her most recent job was in the White House serving as senior deputy director of public engagement and special assistant to President Barack Obama. But she also brought a personal connection to politics  —   she is the granddaughter of Cesar Chavez, the great labor leader for farmworkers. Raised in the Central Valley, Ms. Rodriguez was surrounded by activism. Once, at age 9, she was arrested during a protest outside a supermarket while distributing fliers about pesticide risks. Ever since, those battles have shaped her path, she said. We caught up with Ms. Rodriguez by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: • Tell me about your gig.

To pay the cost to City College of San Francisco, the city will draw from the increase of a real estate transfer tax that voters approved in November. Lately, California has seen a spike in programs offering support to community college students, propelled in part by a nationwide push to improve access to higher education. In November, a coalition of education leaders in the San Joaquin Valley introduced an initiative that would provide a free semester of community college to students who meet certain academic goals. City College of San Francisco, founded in 1935, serves about 60, 000 students. Until now, course costs for city residents have run $46 a unit, or roughly $1, 100 a year. Even with that expense waived, students will still have to figure out their living costs. In San Francisco, that’s no small order. California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays.

18579,"Wall Street, Populists, Fight Over Rules for Americans’ Pension Plans - Breitbart","Wall Street pension management companies are protesting a decision by agency officials to preserve a 2016 regulation which supporters say will protect retirees’ savings from   sales managers. [On February 3, President Donald Trump directed officials at the Department of Labor to review the regulation “to determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice. ”  But officials postponed the review until late in the year and set June 9 as the start date for implementation of the regulation, which is dubbed the “diduciary duty” rule because it requires individuals who sell retirement plans to put their customers’ security above their employers’ interest in profits. In other words, salesmen and saleswomen have a “fiduciary duty” to their customers, just as a company’s CEO has a fiduciary duty to the shareholders. The pushback by agency officials to protect the regulation shows “the ‘Swamp’ is working behind the scenes to scuttle President [Donald] Trump’s agenda,” said Patrick Hynes, president of a D. C. advocacy group, Hynes Communications, which opposes the new regulation. Hynes declined to name the business groups who fund his advocacy. But the department’s postponement is good because it gives Trump and his populist aides another opportunity to support the rule amid opposition from greedy Wall Street investment companies, said Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard. The   rule can be preserved “if somebody at the highest level gets the president’s ear and gives him the populist view that 95 percent of what he hears from Wall Street is total B. S.,” said Rostad.  The agency’s delay “is the only way to change the [current] dynamic, otherwise it is a done deal” that the rule will be killed in late 2017 by Wall Street’s political pressure, he added. As required by the Administrative Procedure Act, federal officials must follow a complicated process when they are writing or replacing regulations. The new timeline set by the labor department means that the fiduciary rule regulation will operate from June until at least late in the year when the incoming Trump appointees at the department will have an opportunity to review and replace the regulation, said Rostad. The Department of Labor oversees retirement savings plans because the savings plans are often picked by employers. The rule has been criticized by major firms  —   such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America  —    but its most vigorous critics are small financial advice firms which are less able to shoulder the burden of increased regulatory costs.  Some critics of the rule say it may force smaller firms to back away from providing advice on covered retirement plans. Some of the biggest Wall Street firms, such as Goldman Sachs, would hardly be touched by the role because they do not do a lot of business with the type of retirement plans covered by the new rule.  The rule is opposed by the GOP. For example, no GOP legislators supported the fiduciary rule during an April 2016 House vote. “As someone who has spent decades in the financial services industry, I know the importance of providing all consumers —  regardless of income —  the opportunity to seek sound financial advice,” GOP Rep. French Hill said when the delay was announced this month. “The DOL’s Fiduciary Rule would greatly diminish access to professional retirement planning and guidance for those who need it the most. This is why a broad, bipartisan majority in Congress has called for the rule to be scrapped as written,” he said. The fiduciary regulation is strongly supported by Democrats, partly because it was developed and pushed by President Barack Obama’s top aides and other progressives.    consumer groups are trying to keep the rule alive, according to an article in Politico Pro.  Consumer advocacy groups on Wednesday launched a publicity campaign aimed at preserving the rule, including an event on Capitol Hill. It featured Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Stephen Wingate, a retired Vietnam veteran who is trying to recover damages through arbitration from a broker who he alleges steered him into   illiquid investments.  “Had I known my broker was held to the same standard as a car salesman, I wouldn’t have trusted him so much,” Wingate said.  The AARP, which claims more than 37 million members, is also defending the fiduciary rule. “We look forward to continuing to advocate for the successful implementation of this rule so that advisers can no longer legally trick retirement savers into risky or   investment vehicles,” said Nancy LeaMond, the organization’s executive vice president.  But the rule also has support from some populists who want to help   Americans grow their retirement  . Brendan Maher, a plaintiff’s lawyer in L. A. for example, argued that the rule helps   retirees, according to the BNA news service. “The future of this rule is interesting, because whatever we believe about Trump, he ran on a platform of economic populism,” Maher said. “This is actually a fairly easy place for him to score some points. ” Because the fiduciary rule is aimed at helping “little guy consumers” in the face of controversial financial industry practices, it presents Trump with an opportunity to curry favor with those who support his more populist tendencies, Maher said. He was quick to add that he’s “not that optimistic” this scenario will play out. “I think the future of the rule depends on the political will of the Trump administration, which is less predictable than we might expect,” Maher said. Rostad says the rule is doomed because Wall Street has huge sway in Washington and with the GOP. Even the June date set by the agency officials won’t save the rule if the White Hosue wants it dead, he said. “The Department of Labor have set the stage for being able to come back in December and repeal the whole damn thing,” he said, adding that the Wall Street companies are being greedy in demanding the rule’s demise even before it comes into force. Because of Wall Street’s influence, including with Trump’s economic policy director, Gary Cohn, Rostad said. “The outcome of the process is 95 percent forgone conclusion  —   [and] the 5 percent variable is whether somebody in the White House gets a different type of [ ] command down to the Department of Labor. ”",0

PRESS TV 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton leads her Republican rival by three percentage points nationally as they head into the final day of a tight race for the White House, according to a new poll. 
The final Bloomberg Politics-Selzer & Co poll released on Monday has Clinton ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was at 4 percent and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent support. 
Clinton also leads Trump by three points in a hypothetical two-way matchup when third-party candidates are not included. 
Another tracking poll released early on Monday also put Clinton in the lead. 
The former secretary of state held a four-point lead over the billionaire businessman in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. The survey showed 47 percent of likely US voters backed Clinton while 43 percent said they supported Trump. 
The Clinton campaign received a late break with FBI Director James Comey announcing Sunday that no criminal charges were forthcoming in the probe of Clinton’s newly-found emails. 
“Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July,” the FBI chief wrote in a new letter to congressional committee chairmen. 
The development is a major relief to Clinton, who is spending the final hours of her campaign trying to close Trump’s path to presidency. Donald Trump walks off the stage after holding a rally at Loudoun Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Virginia, early in the morning on November 7, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Comey sent the presidential race into a frenzy last month when he sent a letter to Congress saying the FBI had discovered emails in a separate probe that could be linked to the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private server when she was secretary of state. 
The surprise move infuriated Democrats and lifted the presidential hopes of Trump, who has turned the email controversy into a favorite line of attack against Clinton. 
Still, Trump continued to seize on the email issue, insisting that Clinton is “guilty.” 
“Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know,” he said Sunday at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. “And now it’s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.” 
Both Clinton and Trump plan to spend the last day of the campaign racing across key battleground states that could determine the results of Tuesday’s election. 
Trump will visit Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire and finish the day with a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

18581,Obama’s Solicitor General: Neil Gorsuch ’Thoughtful &amp Brilliant’,"Neal Katyal, who served under President Barack Obama as acting Solicitor General of the United States, praised President Donald Trump’s selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the U. S. Supreme Court formerly held by Justice Antonin Scalia. [Katyal was Deputy Solicitor General under Obama, and served as acting Solicitor General for roughly a year in 2010 and 2011, representing the Obama administration before the Supreme Court. He is now a partner at the Washington, D. C. law firm of Hogan Lovells, and said in a statement:  Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person. I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court. Others shared Katyal’s sentiments. Heritage Action CEO Michael A. Needham praised Gorsuch, saying that President Trump had fulfilled his election promise by selecting him: Judge Neil Gorsuch is a nominee ‘very much in the mold’ of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. President Trump deserves credit for fulfilling his campaign pledge by nominating an individual who will, based on his record, interpret the text of the Constitution rather than create unwritten rights supposedly hidden between the lines. The usurpations of the rule of law, substituting for the will of the people as embodied in democratically enacted legislation rights nowhere to be found in our Constitution itself, only serves to divide our nation. Judge Gorsuch is an outstanding choice, and now the Senate must prepare to carry out its “Advise and Consent” role as it has for the past 227 years. Democrats were slower to respond, as they attempted to absorb the choice of a judge widely praised for his intellect and experience. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer ( ) had not reacted to the choice, half an hour after it was made. Neither had Senate Minority Whip Richard Durbin ( ). Joel B.

18582,Life: Preparing For Change: This Woman Is Scrambling To Experience As Much Human Dignity As Possible Before The Trump Administration Takes Power,"Email 
The results of the 2016 election have left many women frightened for their futures in this country, but 29-year-old Vanessa Carp realizes that times of great upheaval call for decisive action: After realizing how dire the coming years could be for her, this quick-thinking young woman is scrambling to experience as much human dignity as possible before Donald Trump sets foot in the White House. 
Wow. Major props to Vanessa for getting herself prepared! 
With just a few short months before the president-elect comes to power, Vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits. Whether she’s at home, at work, running errands, or even at the gym, Vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected, autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on January 20. 
She now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor, unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf. She relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer. And she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood, savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels. 
“It’s getting down to the wire, but I’m just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as I can,” noted Vanessa, standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact. “I don’t know how many moments like these I’ll get to have, so I figure I should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before it’s too late.” 
Smart move, Vanessa! 
It’s unfortunate that women even have to think about things like this in 2016, but we commend Vanessa for taking necessary precautions. Ladies, let’s all learn a lesson from Vanessa: If you’d like to experience a little human dignity before Trump is in the Oval Office, now is the time to do it!",0
18583,The xx Lets the Sunshine In - The New York Times,"MARFA, Tex.  —   On a   night, a few dozen people clustered near one end of the Lost Horse Saloon here: a small video crew, some Texas locals and tourists including visitors from New York City like me. Deer heads and skulls gazed down from the walls a sign announced “Open Mic Night. ” Seated in the tiny stage area were the two singers and lyricists of the xx  —   Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim  —   while Jamie Smith (a. k. a. Jamie xx) the band’s programmer, keyboardist and main producer, looked on from nearby. It was the first performance by the xx since 2014, and a Texas saloon made an unlikely comeback locale for a British band whose melancholy songs tend to conjure dark, lonely London flats or very late nights in club chill rooms. With downcast glances, as Ms. Madley Croft plucked an acoustic guitar, the duo sang the love song “Islands,” from the band’s   2009 debut album, and the clingy breakup song “On Hold,” the first single from its third album, “I See You,” due on Jan. 13. A stealthy,    way return made sense for a band that grew out of whispery songs recorded at home but has gathered a worldwide following. From the beginning, the xx bridged the       ethic of   the electronic underpinnings of dance music and an intuitive sense of pop songwriting that’s succinct, emotionally open and general enough to feel universal. It has turned out to be a durable, expandable, widely admired hybrid: dark and arty yet grounded in the pop basics, eager to communicate. The xx has already sold out a week of British theater dates in March, is booked as a headliner at Lollapalooza festivals in Brazil, Chile and Argentina and was welcomed as a guest on “Saturday Night Live” almost immediately after “On Hold” was released in November. It was precisely the fragility and reticence of the xx, on the debut album they made as teenagers, that brought the band a rapidly expanding following  —   one that grew further with its more polished but still skeletal second album in 2012, “Coexist. ” Mr. Sim and Ms. Madley Croft, playing   parts on bass and guitar backed by keyboard notes and samples from Mr. Smith, sang in smoky murmurs, like hushed dialogues or shared secrets: songs of isolation, longing and intimate tension. In the years between albums, the band’s signature sound  —   a moody voice in   over just a few instruments, with the barest hint of a dance beat  —   made its way into big pop hits like Hailee Steinfeld’s “Love Myself” and the Chainsmokers’ “Don’t Let Me Down” (though the xx’s habitual restraint doesn’t extend to the choruses). Even in its absence, the xx had an impact. Yet it’s impossible for the xx to return to teenage naïveté. And sticking too closely to its established ways would have made it feel like a “parody band of ourselves,” Mr. Sim said. “What makes us sound like us has been a combination of mistakes and just our personalities and what’s part of us. That definitely was the case on the first one. So trying to hang onto that consciously just doesn’t work. ” The challenge for the new album was how a band with growing clout, influence and experience could still conjure private emotions. “The band came from such an unambitious place,” Mr. Sim said. “But it’s slowly become something where we do have a lot of drive  —   we do have a lot of ambition now. ” The band’s solution was both clear and complicated: Work on the sounds, unblock the feelings and abandon   rules. “I See You” inevitably scales up the sound of the xx, openly courting a wider audience, but its songs still ring true. The video the band shot for “On Hold” in Marfa, where it did some of the first recording sessions for the new album at a cozy local studio, captured it in a new mode: clowning under the Texas sun, with band members riding shopping carts and skateboards, and Mr. Smith D. J. ing a house party for high schoolers. But the core of the xx  —   an endearing insecurity  —   hasn’t disappeared. Over a breakfast of huevos rancheros the morning after the show, the band admitted to renewed stage fright. “Last night  —   that felt scarier than Radio City,” Mr. Sim said. Together, the band members came across as thoughtful, courteous and unified. Ms. Madley Croft was relatively voluble, and Mr. Smith almost entirely   Mr. Sim genially, patiently measured his words. They never interrupted one another. Ms. Madley Croft compared the saloon performance to the awkward club shows at the 2009 CMJ Music Marathon in New York that brought the xx its first buzz in the United States. Back then, they stood stiffly by their instruments in near darkness, barely acknowledging the audience. When the band started, the xx imposed its own strictures. To stay personal, Ms. Madley Croft and Mr. Sim would each sing only lyrics they had written themselves. They also avoided, as they still do, specifics like place names or gendered pronouns  —   using you and I, not he and she  —   “so you can fit it into your own life and imagine yourself within it,” Ms. Madley Croft said. And even on a recording, an xx song could only have the parts that could be played onstage. “We never set out to be a minimal band,” she said. “We just couldn’t play our instruments very well. ” But with “I See You,” the xx upended its old methods. They recorded outside the familiarity of London (though they eventually returned there) in Marfa, Los Angeles and Reykjavik, Iceland  —   places with sunshine and   landscapes. And they fanned out for projects on their own. Mr. Sim appeared in fashion videos for Dior Homme. Mr. Smith stepped up his sideline as a D. J. remixer and producer, touring widely and releasing an album of his own in 2015, “In Colour,” that included the other xx members among many guest vocalists. He bought his first real synthesizer  —   a   Oberheim that supplies many of the swooping sounds in “On Hold”  —   after using for so long cheap keyboards, samplers and software sounds. Making music outside the xx also put Mr. Smith in serious recording studios for the first time in a career of laptop recordings. “It made me realize that I love working in   and I love working with my best friends  —   that is how I make the best music,” he said. “But also that I need to put myself out there to occasionally just   me and to realize how lucky I am. ” In Los Angeles, where as an Englishwoman Ms. Madley Croft had the guilty pleasure of “sunny skies in November,” she got invited to songwriting camps: brief, intense,    collaborations organized to generate hits. She was eager to learn the methods of pop pros. “I just was craving it. I knew it was going to be terrifying and quite outside of what I’ve done before, and I really enjoyed it,” she said. At one session, with the producers Ryan Tedder and Benny Blanco, she recorded a guitar part that came to define a song by OneRepublic, “Fingertips. ” A collaboration with the producer Rick Nowels led back to Jamie xx it yielded a song, “Ecstasy,” that ended up providing a verse for “Loud Places,” a track she sings on “In Colour. ” In an email, Mr. Nowels wrote: “Romy is a wonderful, natural singer and songwriter. She’s a strong intuitive musician which informs her songwriting. Her voice has a quiet intelligence. She writes lyrics from a personal and soulful place. She’s one of the few guitarists these days who has an instantly recognizable style  —   that’s almost impossible to achieve. She played through my little amp with some reverb, and there was that sound!” The camps, Ms. Madley Croft said, “taught me to trust my instincts. Everybody moves so quickly, works so quickly, that it’s kind of like oiling up your joints. But I was not quite pouring out my soul in that music. So I was really happy to come back with the boys and just get really cathartic again. ” But they were working differently this time. Mr. Sim and Ms. Madley Croft sometimes worked together, trading melodies and bits of lyrics, as in the songwriting camps, and no longer worrying who wrote what. Mr. Smith channeled some of his D. J. expertise into the new songs  —   although, he said, “It still sounds like there’s space compared to what you hear on the radio these days. ” And instead of staying cloistered, the band took some of its new songs on the road in 2014, playing small gigs around the South. The band’s early reticence was no pose. Mr. Sim and Ms. Madley Cross, both 27, met at the musically oriented Elliott School in the London suburb of Putney and wrote songs, at first, just for themselves. “We didn’t think anybody was going to hear them,” she said. “They were like a diary for us. But then people connected with that. ” They were so uncertain about their lyrics and singing, she added, that even while they were making their first album they exchanged lyrics by email, not in person. By then the xx also included two fellow students: Mr. Smith, 28, and the guitarist Baria Qureshi, who left after the xx’s first album. The band’s   limitations gave the xx a distinct sound, full of spaces and silences that drew listeners in. The xx’s quiet desolation had precedents in British pop, like Everything But the Girl and Young Marble Giants, but the xx also had its own dynamic there was drama in each pause. It was possible to hear the songs as a couple’s questions, confessions, quarrels and reconciliations, but the two singers were not romantically involved both are gay. “I’ve always been really up for being quite raw and emotional in music,” Ms. Madley Croft said. “I guess that was my outlet before I could have the confidence to be like that in life. ” The band’s growing audience, particularly after its debut won the Mercury Prize as the best album of 2009, made them only more  . When making “Coexist,” Mr. Sim recalled, “There was a lot of thinking of: ‘What do people like about us? What have people picked up on? What makes us us?’ We really tried to cling to that, and it was quite limiting. Our   was: ‘We’re going to shut ourselves away. We’re not going to play anything to anybody.’ And it was really insular, and it was tough. ” The culmination of their 2014 tour was a series of performances at the Manchester Festival in England and then at the Park Avenue Armory in New York. The shows, two or three each day for just 45 people at a time, were as much about architectural proportion as about music. The staging started out closely confined, with stylized movements for the band eventually, walls fell away to expose a huge open space. The xx could have been summing up its career trajectory, from tiny rooms to cavernous ones. The songs on “I See You” no longer insist on the austere minimalism of the band’s first two albums. The sonic palette has vastly expanded there are a few solid dance beats, some plush echoes of the Beach Boys, some resonant and ghostly synthesizer tones, even a sample of Hall  Oates in “On Hold. ” The frailty and tension of the xx’s past catalog remain “Here come my insecurities,” Ms. Madley Croft sings in “Say Something Loving,” which is far from the album’s only song to mention fear. But there are also new glimmers of confidence. At times, Mr. Sim said, the new album is “celebratory  —   it’s not all ‘Woe is me. ’” He paused  —   it is, after all, an xx album  —   and added, dryly, “Of course, given what we’ve done before, my version of celebratory is pretty different from somebody else’s. ” The album opens with “Dangerous,” which revels, tentatively but firmly, in taking a chance on a relationship it has a brisk, danceable beat, though a warning siren wails in the background. But there are also songs like “Performance,” a tearful ballad about putting a brave face on heartbreak, and “A Violent Noise,” an introvert’s nightmare of clubbing. The album concludes with “Test Me,” an eerie, drumless ballad about a relationship at a breaking point Ms. Madley Croft admitted that she wrote it about the friendships in the band. Over all, no one is likely to mistake “I See You” for a party album. After   the new songs, the trio radically reconsidered them, rewriting and sometimes dismantling them almost completely. “We were definitely in the   that we would just try everything, and we did,” Mr. Smith said. “And we made some terrible music in the process. I’ve got a hard drive full of stuff that’s never going to get heard. A lot of it was learning to realize that the first thing that you’ve done is by far the best, but having to take every possible route before you get back to that. ” Before leaving Marfa, the xx took me on a bicycle tour of the local landmarks, from the town center out to the Chinati Foundation, Donald Judd’s monument of minimalism. It was 80 degrees and cloudless under the desert sun. And it was easy to identify the pensive English rock band. They were, as usual, dressed entirely in black.",0
18584,Politics As Usual Is Dead,"Here’s how against the Republican Establishment Trump is: → Gary Youree 
It is very clear to me that Sanders was replaced with Trump by the corporate media. I dont know what no one else can see this. We know who rigged this election, from primary to the predictable nomination, and then the turn on Trump, the pawn, in the general election. I just watched, and tried to share on social media the truth about what had happened, but everyone was lining up with the staus quo account of what was happening – Trump was an out of control idiot, well duh, but yes, be angry at Trump – but be truly angry about those who made him the only choice against Hillary. It is about the corruption and propaganda in the corporate media, the unwillingness to the public media, and the entertainment media to discuss the elephant in the room – and I sure dont mean the republican elephant – I am talking about the unmentionable oligarchy that is the root of everything that we, the people, find deplorable in our government. If you use only television to try and understand our world you will be lost in a matrix (urban dictionary) of misdirections, propaganda, and cheerleading for the direction they want us to think. I dont even know why they bother. Information like that which came from WiliLeaks is the last vestige, unless you are a fly on the wall, that will even get you close to being able to form an opinion from unbiased material. Other than that information it takes a talent to read between the lines, collect from what is omitted, a see just how far the public news media is willing to push the envelope. Beyond that you have to look at what is being censured by all forms of media; the A&E 9-11 Truth Movement, and from beyond the border, the works of Professor John McMurtry. I am beginning to see among those who have the intellect to see this massive misdirection, the obvious rigging of our 2016 election, the impending end out our species due to the dominate economic system; an unwillingness to do the work to deconstruct the truth. The best of us are giving up and would rather remain in denial of what is happening. When I have gone to the effort to try and explain on social media how all this created misdirection of anger towards Trump, who is an idiot, should actually be against the corporate media and the powers who control them. The destroyed our chance to elect a qualified actual anti status quo candidate by blacking out the coverage of Bernie Sanders while at the same time giving Trump, and unqualified idiot, unprecedented, unquestioned, airtime. This in effect replaced Sanders with Trump. To me it was so obvious. I knew and posted that the corporate media, after the nomination, would eviscerate Trump, using information they already had in the hole to counter what ever October surprise would be coming out against Hillary. Hillary needed to be pitted against an idiot pawn, like the predictable Trump, to ensure a win of another insider in the executive branch. I have watch as the Bill Mahers and the Michael Moores have become part of the subset of the 1%, who have crossed that line into the area of comfortability and security, which they are unwilling to sacrifice, this becoming part of those who are unwilling to truly push the envelope into any are resembling the truth of what is truly happening. Mahers and Moore have become part of the establishment propaganda machine. The same is happening of non profit news media, like DemocracyNow. While not so much helping the establishment push their agenda they have either been corrupted by the corporate powers, as with NPR and the Guardian, or they do not have the financial stability to risk telling us the full truth. Only as individuals in such online rags as the Washington Blog, and what pitifully little someone like me can contribute, do we see what a few of us are still willing to say what we think. There are many more I am afraid who are unorganized, in denial, or have just given up. The hopefulness of the Internet to keep the avenues of truth open, through the works of WikiLeaks and the social philosophers beyond the border, like Prof. John McMurtry, are we catching the last glimpse of the light of truth. The NSA is quickly surpassing this last exposure to the light. From the dark, the perception of light becomes brighter as the door dividing them begins to close. If the search for truth is difficult, the telling of truth, a crime, and the speaking of truth an insurrection, then we are correct in our assertion that a new truth is needed – or an old truth rediscovered. To find and reopen this door, to let back in the light, will be far more difficult once the darkness prevails. Lynn Walker 
Politics, as we knew it, is certainly dead, but politics has always been the realm of scumbags, so any pretention that what we knew was good is a fantasy of fools. Politics has always been the realm of the cheaters and the cheated and if you’re not a politician or his biggest sponsor, you’re cheated. Donate",0
18585,Kenyan Doctor Feared UN Promoted Vaccine Was ‘A Mass Sterilization Exercise’,"Waking Times 
The global depopulation agenda stated explicitly on the Georgie Guidestones , but furtively inserted into every matter of our personal affairs is becoming harder to deny. Kenyan doctors in 2014 uncovered mass-sterilizing, infertility-causing chemicals in a widely used tetanus vaccination promoted for use by the United Nations , causing a tense stand off between Catholic bishops and the Kenyan government. 
The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association (KCDA) is charging UNICEF and the World Health Organization (two United Nations organizations) with sterilizing millions of girls and women under the auspices of an anti-tetanus vaccination program which was sponsored by the Kenyan government. 
“We sent six samples from around Kenya to laboratories in South Africa. They tested positive for the HCG antigen,” Dr. Muhame Ngare of the Mercy Medical Centre in Nairobi told LifeSiteNews. “They were all laced with HCG.” 
Anti-HCG or anti-human chorionic gonadotropin is part of documented anti-fertility vaccine trials which sterilized animals on the first injection, and that have been used in human contraceptives . 
The Kenyan government has claimed that the tetanus vaccines are safe to use, but the KCDA found otherwise. 
According to the Nairobi Standard, Robert Pukose, the vice-chairman of Kenya’s National Assembly of Health Committee has said, “We are at loss about who to believe since both sides have tabled conflicting results. That is why we need new tests conducted jointly for us to give final and conclusive results.” 
Dr. Ngare raised some important questions of the vaccines since the were found to be laced by anti-fertility drugs: 
“Usually we give a series of shots over two to three years,” said Ngare. This included men, women, and children alike. Without the fanfare that is usually accompanied with other vaccination programs, Kenyan agencies were targeting women in their child-bearing years, starting at the age of 15 and giving them five doses of ‘tetanus.’ 
Dr. Ngare argues that the only other time a five-dose vaccination program has been used was when it is utilized as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992. 
All six samples of the vaccine that were sent to laboratories at the University of Nairobi and another in South Africa were found to contain HCG. This mimics a natural hormone produced in pregnant women which causes them to develop antibodies. Their own bodies begin to produce HCG and thereby trigger their own miscarriages . 
This is possibly a furtherance of the Nazi sterilization attempts which largely influenced American eugenics laws and practices in the past century, leading to more than 350,000 forced sterilization programs and the legislation which would support them. 
As Kevin Mugur Galalae attests simply in his paper written after a 75-day hunger strike in which he protested the global depopulation agenda, 
“Births have been prevented by interfering with the reproductive system so as to lower human fertility, while deaths have been promoted by weakening the immune system so as to increase morbidity and mortality.” 
If chemical sterilization doesn’t work – by adding fluoride to the water supply, bispehnol A (BPAs) to all manner of food and water, the spraying of aerosol aluminum via chemtrails, genetically modified foods, or manufactured virus, like HIV/AIDS, swine flu, bird flu, Zika, etc. – then you have to depopulate by the use of vaccines . 
And if that doesn’t work? Micro-chipped, remotely controlled contraceptive implants are already an option being readied for roll-out in 2018. About the Author

18586,Lin-Manuel Miranda announces new musical about Trump University,"Monday 21 November 2016 Lin-Manuel Miranda announces new musical about Trump University 
The creator of the musical Hamilton is close to completing his new show based upon Trump University. 
The musical will focus on the back story of Trump University and will include the tale of the creation of a fraudulent organisation, the plot to mis-sell so-called educational courses, the mass exploitation of its customers for financial gain, and a final act which focusses on the out of court settlement forced on Donald Trump. 
Miranda explained, “I like to tell stories that people don’t really know much about, and I was worried that Donald Trump angrily tweeting at a musical over the weekend might distract people from hearing about him paying $25m to the people who sued him for fraud in the Trump University case. 
“So I put together a few tracks to ensure the story will last the ages. 
“The songs are almost complete, including a surprisingly upbeat R&B number called Orange bastard lied to me’, and the more soulful ballads Ain’t no way to hide this shit and Lawyers say I gotta settle now or have my shit dragged through the streets for months before ultimately being found guilty of fraud.

18587,What To Do In An Ammo Panic,"Firearms panics happen over a variety of things, like acts of domestic terrorism, mass shootings, or Democrats getting elected to office. Though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after 2nd Amendment enthusiast Donald Trump’s decisive victory last night, let’s cover our bases and talk about a panic if future Democrats are elected.
What is a panic for ammo and firearms? A panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more, or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items, but maybe not to own them already, as most Americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the Constitution.
Adding to a panic is speculators, who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices, only to resell privately at much higher levels. While this is legal, it certainly isn’t ethical or a decent thing to do, and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity.
Lastly, the gun store’s or site’s inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand, nor can the manufacturer, and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels.
Some prices never return. 22 Long Rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old B-rock “the Islamic Shock” Obama did to it with his multi-year championship of Best Firearms Salesman Ever, and it may be even worse under the Bitch in Chief.
So, what gets grabbed in a panic? What should you get? What should you count on still being available? We’ve got three categories: guns, ammo, and components/accessories.
Guns Anything that’s big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban, so it’s a first target for a panic. Look for things that are popular with the right, and scary to the left. Also look for things that are modern; no one is going to ban the M1 Garand anytime soon.
Evil features matter more than destructive power. Anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the AK-47 and the AR-15 fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots. However, they’re black and have mean things attached to them, so they’re on the shit list, while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an AR can pull is safe as it looks “traditional.”

They have to be popular to the left to get noticed; rifles like the FAL and anything based of the G3/HK91 action simply don’t have enough exposure to get targeted, unless they pull something sweeping like the USC 18 922r rules again. The Mini 30 and the M1A might be safe; maybe.
For pistols, pretty much any semi-automatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned. Oftentimes, stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed. 1911s, Hi Powers, other old domestic semi-autos, and revolvers should be safe. Expect the libtards to go after Glocks and the like.
Shotguns seem to be immune these days as there’s not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length. I think the Saigas are still not being imported, and it’s about the only box mag fed one out there, but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well.
Ammunition Range (full metal jacket) and defense/hunting (hollow or soft point) cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and 22 Long Rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online, and it’s probably beginning as I write this.
Oddly enough, only certain rounds will suffer panic buying. For rifles, it’s limited to .223/5.56, 7.62×39, and .308/7.62×51. Traditional hunting rounds like 30-30, .243, and .270 do not seem to be impacted. Why doesn’t 30-06 get bought in a panic? As the old joke goes, men with 30-06’s don’t panic, but it really has to do with the feedback cycle I mentioned at the start. If there’s little demand, it cannot exceed the in-store supply, so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur.
Everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic.
Panic bought pistol ammo is the big 3: 9mm Luger, 40 S&W, and .45 ACP. .380 will round out the affected semi-automatic rounds, and there usually is a bit of a run on .357 Magnum and .38 Special as well. 10mm, .357 SIG, .45 GAP and other magnums like the .44 do not seem to be affected.
For rimfires, .22 Long Rifle just goes poof, while its Magnum brother and smaller, 17 caliber, cousins do not seem to be as affected. Rimfires are not reloadable, and this contributes to their over-stockpiling.
Components and Accessories Most centerfire ammo is reloadable, and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy, self-reliance, and performance, so the consumable components will also get some panics. Although I’ve held off on reloading articles until I get my press set back up, we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly.

Biggest thing is primers, even bigger than the bullets, oddly enough. The primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges, and they come in two sizes for pistols, two for rifles, and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications.
The second is gunpowder itself. Fortunately, there’s a wide variety of smokeless powder, and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer, so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers. The third is the bullets, and since there are so many types and manufacturers, they also take a little less of a hit than primers. While you obviously need all three to reload, bear that in mind. Always save your brass, and anyone else’s you can pick up.
Even though the little ones are easier to use, the higher capacity ones disappear first. Get both.
While it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage, the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine, especially “high capacity” ones. I don’t mean the 200 round drum mags, although those do take a dive, nor do I really mean the 100 round coffin mags, but I mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags, like a 15 round mag for a full sized pistol, or a 30 round AR-15 mag. Expect to see P-mags and surplus style aluminum AR mags just vanish. The Gabby Giffords Special, the extended Glock 17 30 round mag, is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic.
Holsters, slings, cleaning accessories, optics, and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics.
What to do? If you already own a carbine and/or a semi-auto pistol, make sure you have enough ammo, magazines, and spare parts. It’s a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo.
I try to have at least six mags for my semi-auto pistols, and at least ten mags for my semi-auto rifles. Get some rifle mags of different sizes, the 30 and 40 AR mags are fun for shooting standing up, but they get in the way of prone firing and the 10 and 20 rounders are preferable.
Your ultimate ammo goal, I maintain, should be a thousand practice rounds and 500 defense rounds for each gun you have, but, in a pre-panic or panic situation, just get what you can at a normal price; some is better than none. If you’re into reloading, you know what to get already.
If you don’t own anything, and want to soon, refer to some pistol articles , a rifle article, a shotgun article, and a buying guide here. Consider buying some stripped AR lowers to build on a rainy day later on.
Build an AR and meet girls at the range?
Conclusion No matter who got elected, I think this country is in for rough times. It’s always better to have firearms and not need them, then not have them and need them. Store yours safely, but accessible and ready in times of need.

18588,Finding a Home in the Bronx After Fleeing Anti-Gay Violence in Haiti - The New York Times,"The party was like many others in Delmas, a neighborhood in the Haitian capital,    with a vibrant gay community  —   an evening of men in colorful dresses and revealing attire, laughing and catching up. They sipped Prestige beer and   as Beyoncé and Rihanna played in the background. The party stretched into the early morning hours with no end in sight. Then someone knocked on the door. On that March night in 2012, a group of men dressed in black and wearing ski masks forced their way into the apartment. Wilkenson Joseph, then 35, was the closest to the front door. Wearing a red sequin dress, a dark wig, red lipstick and high heels, he was a prime target for the group looking to attack gay men. One of the men stabbed Mr. Joseph in the gut with a knife. His friends picked him up off the floor, blood pouring from his mouth and his side, and rushed him to a hospital. But a doctor demanded $2, 000 before he would provide any care, Mr. Joseph said. For an hour and a half, his friends negotiated a lower rate as he continued to bleed, eventually persuading the doctor to accept $1, 000. Mr. Joseph survived, but he lost his appendix. In a Manhattan office last month, Mr. Joseph recalled his stories of   violence slowly, softly and in French. “After the party,” Mr. Joseph said before trailing off, his eyes closing. There was silence as he summoned the months after that party more than four years ago. He stopped attending parties and dressing up. “It was too traumatic,” he said. “I recoiled from the party scene. I was no longer me. ” Mr. Joseph said it was not the first time he had been attacked because of his sexuality in Haiti, where homosexuality is not a crime, but gay men often hide their orientation to avoid being targeted. A makeup artist for eight years, he had worked at “Journal de Loisirs,” a celebrity talk show, and often carried a purse and makeup bag to the office. Seven months before the stabbing, Mr. Joseph said, he was kidnapped from his workplace, hooded and taken to an abandoned home, where he was chained to a pole and beaten. Three men threatened to kill him, he said, and called him an embarrassment to his country. They later let him go. “I always felt threatened,” he said. “And I never said anything back to these people. I was afraid of a violent response. There was always a fear. ” After the 2012 attack, Mr. Joseph applied for a tourist visa to the United States, hoping the country would be as welcoming as it was portrayed on the television shows he had watched as a child, he said. “It was always my dream country,” Mr. Joseph said. “America is where you can make happen the dreams you envision for yourself. ” He arrived in April 2013 on a tourist visa and settled in New York City. A few weeks later, he attended his first party since the attack, at the Monster, a piano bar in the West Village. Feeling safe, he took the stage to sing “Lumane Casimir,” a   Haitian song. He applied for asylum shortly after moving to the United States, describing in his application the   abuse he endured in Haiti and his fear of returning there. “I feel a lot more comfortable expressing myself here,” he said. “I’ve never feared for my safety here. ” Since his visa expired, he has been working on his immigration status for the past two years with lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham  Taft, a law firm in Manhattan. He has applied for asylum and has not received an update. They are awaiting an interview date with immigration services. Mr. Joseph lives on $376 monthly in public assistance, including cash assistance and Medicaid. Through a designation known as PRUCOL, he is able to receive benefits despite not having legal status. Without a job, he has struggled to afford a home, flitting between Florida, New Jersey and New York. Shortly after coming to New York, he found himself on the streets, spending nights riding the subway and shuffling between shelters, always worrying that his visa and passport would be stolen. He found temporary housing in Jamaica, Queens, through Unique People Services, an   supportive housing program. He stayed there for more than a year, but the conditions were dangerous, Mr. Joseph said. Drug activity brought the police often. Once, he said, a neighbor robbed him of $150. Mr. Joseph has found support in Voix Fortes, a   group focused on  . There he met Houda Chergui, a coordinator at the nonprofit ASCNYC, which assists New Yorkers living with and at risk for  . She recommended he seek help through the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. With the help of ASCNYC and the African Services Committee, he was able to move into permanent housing, an apartment in the Bronx, in March the city’s   Services Administration covers his monthly rent of $1, 100. But the apartment was bare. He slept on the floor and had nowhere to sit or eat. In April the federation provided Mr. Joseph with a $1, 000 grant from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy furniture. He decorated his apartment with a sofa bed, a chair and a coffee table. “The furniture made it into a home,” he said. Mr. Joseph, who had dropped out of school in Haiti to support his family after his father’s death, longs to continue his education and get a job as a masseur or as a counselor to help others, while sending some money to his relatives in Haiti. “I want to continue my studies,” he said. “I want to be able to motivate other people in my situation  —   others in the L. G. B. T. Q. community  —   to pursue their education. Before respect comes from others, it comes from within. ”",0

18591,Juror 4: Oregon standoff prosecutors failed to prove ‘intent’ to impede federal workers,"Oregon Live 
Juror 4 vigorously defends the across-the-board acquittals of Ammon Bundy and his six co-defendants, calling the rulings a “statement” about the prosecution’s failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge. 
The full-time Marylhurst University business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jury’s deliberations in the case, questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror, No. 11, who the judge bounced from the jury a day later. 
“It should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove ‘conspiracy’ in the count itself – and not any form of affirmation of the defense’s various beliefs, actions or aspirations,” Juror 4 wrote Friday in a lengthy email to The Oregonian/OregonLive. 
He expressed relief that he can now speak out freely, but he wasn’t ready as of Friday morning to drop his anonymity. He said his studies have suffered since the trial started, and he’s not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict. The judge withheld jurors’ names during the jury selection process and trial, instead referring to each by number. 
The jury closely followed U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown’s instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the five-week trial, he said. 
The jury returned unanimous verdicts of “not guilty” to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants. Each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their official work through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation. 
Juror 4 noted the panel couldn’t simply rely on the defendants’“defining actions” to convict. 
“All 12 agreed that impeding existed, even if as an effect of the occupation,” he wrote. 
“But we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings, rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind,” the Marylhurst student wrote. “It seemed this basic, high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout.” 
Prosecutors had argued that the case, at its core, was about the illegal taking of another’s property. The heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the 41-day takeover, in and of itself, was “intimidating,” and prevented officers from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management from carrying out their work, they said. 
They argued that the alleged conspiracy began Nov. 5, when Ammon Bundy and ally Ryan Payne met with Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didn’t step in and block Harney County ranchers Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond. The Hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on Jan. 4 and serve out a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for arson on federal land. 
Defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mix-up the “effect” of the occupation – which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs – from the “intent” of the occupiers. 
Five of the seven defendants, including Ammon Bundy, testified. Many said that they were there to protest in support of the Hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change. 
The defense lawyers’ arguments, coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence, resonated with jurors, Juror 4 noted. 
“Inference, while possibly compelling, proved to be insulting or inadequate to 12 diversely situated people as a means to convict,” the juror wrote. “The air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof.” 
Juror 4 plainly stated that fellow Juror 11, during the initial round of deliberations, “had zero business being on this jury in the first place.” 
Juror 11 had worked for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management as a ranch tech and firefighter “more than 20 years ago,” he had said during jury selection. Asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts, he said, “Not really.” 
Juror 4 explained why he didn’t alert the court immediately after he had heard Juror 11, on day one of deliberations reportedly say, “I am very biased.” 
It wasn’t until the fourth day into deliberations that Juror 4 sent a note to the court, asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was “very biased” could be an impartial judge. The court, flummoxed by the development, a day later dismissed Juror 11 for “good cause,” after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal. At the time, parties to the case weren’t sure which way Juror 11’s alleged bias fell. 
Juror 4 said he “resisted the impulse” to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself. 
In his email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Juror 4, for the first time, also contended that Juror 11 “violated” the judge’s explicit orders “by hearkening to ‘evidence’ that was never admitted in this case, refused to consider the defendant’s state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions.'” 
Juror 4 said, though, he wishes that he “had sent the letter on day one, since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us.” 
The Maryville business student said he is “baffled” by what he described as observers’“flippant sentiments” in the wake of the jury’s acquittals. 
“Don’t they know that ‘not guilty’ does not mean innocent?” he wrote. “It was not lost on us that our verdict(s) might inspire future actions that are regrettable, but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us.” 
The jury, he said, met with Judge Brown after the verdicts were announced and after the U.S. Marshals’ physical confrontation and arrest of Bundy lawyer Marcus Mumford. 
He said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the “conspiracy charge.” He said he learned that a potential alternate charge, such as criminal trespass, wouldn’t have brought as significant a penalty. 
The charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation, threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison. 
“We all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this ‘conspiracy’ charge seemed the best possible option,” Juror 4 said.

18592,George Orwell’s ‘1984’ Is Suddenly a Best-Seller - The New York Times,"George Orwell’s classic book “1984,” about a dystopian future where critical thought is suppressed under a totalitarian regime, has seen a surge in sales this month, rising to the top of the Amazon   list in the United States and leading its publisher to have tens of thousands of new copies printed. Craig Burke, the publicity director at Penguin USA, said that the publisher had ordered 75, 000 new copies of the book this week and that it was considering another reprint. “We’ve seen a big bump in sales,” Mr. Burke said. He added that the rise “started over the weekend and hit hyperactive” on Tuesday and Wednesday morning. Since Friday, the book has reached a 9, 500 percent increase in sales, he said. He said demand began to lift on Sunday, shortly after the interview Kellyanne Conway, an adviser to Donald J. Trump, gave on “Meet the Press. ” In defending a false claim by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, that Mr. Trump had attracted the “largest audience ever to witness an inauguration,” Ms. Conway used a turn of phrase that struck some observers as similar to the dystopian world of “1984. ” When asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” why Mr. Spicer had said something that was provably false, Ms. Conway replied airily, “Don’t be so dramatic. ” Mr. Spicer, she said, “gave alternative facts. ” In the novel, the term “newspeak” refers to language in which independent thought, or “unorthodox” political ideas, have been eliminated. “Doublethink” is defined as “reality control. ” On social media and elsewhere on Sunday, the book’s readers made a connection between Ms. Conway’s comments and Orwell’s language, and the attention on the book “kind of took a life of its own,” Mr. Burke said. The dictionary publisher   described the interview as “fraught with epistemological tension. ” The dictionary also reported that searches for the word “fact” spiked after Ms. Conway’s comments, and then, as an apparent reminder, tweeted the dictionary’s definition. Even outside the United States, interest in “1984” has grown. So far this year, sales have risen by 20 percent in Britain and Australia compared to the same period a year ago, according to Jess Harrison, a   editor at Penguin Books. The novel is usually a   she said, and it sold 100, 000 copies last year in   countries outside the United States and Canada. “But we’ve definitely seen an uplift” in sales, she added. Dystopian novels are “chiming with people,” Ms. Harrison said, adding that “The Man in the High Castle” by Philip K. Dick, an alternative history in which the Nazis defeated America to win World War II, is also selling well. A television series based on Mr. Dick’s novel is now in its second season at Amazon. Penguin also published Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here,” about the rise of a demagogue, last Friday in Britain for the first time since 1935, “and we’re already on to our third printing,” Mr. Burke said. On Wednesday, that book was also ranking among Amazon’s best sellers, as was Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,” another dystopian classic. Prof. Stefan Collini, a professor of intellectual history and an expert on Orwell at the University of Cambridge, said that readers see a natural parallel between the book and the way Mr. Trump and his staff have distorted facts. “Everyone remembers ‘1984’ as containing various parodies of official distortions,” he said. “That kind of unreality that is propagated as reality is what people feel reminded of, and that’s why they keep coming back. ”",0

Eric Ivan   36, nicknamed Shaki, had been married to his husband for about a year, worked at a Party City and a Sunglass Hut, and was entranced by interior design. The dead were mostly young, mostly Latino and mostly gay  —   though some were none of those and a fair number were straight men and women enjoying an evening of Latin music. And on Monday, when their names were read aloud in the auditorium of a   senior center, the worst fears of their families came true as the roster of the victims of the Orlando attack became horribly real. Juan Ramon Guerrero was less than a month shy of his 23rdbirthday and in his third year at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. He was quiet and kind, his uncle Robert Guerrero, 51, recalled. Like other members of his Dominican family, he liked Latin music, which is why he went to Pulse on Saturday night. “He was not a party boy,” Mr. Guerrero said. The family found out that Juan had been hurt when someone saw him being carried out of the club and into an ambulance. Family members began a frantic search. Finally, a hospital confirmed the awful news. The bereft uncle, like so many other relatives, turned to Facebook to pour out his rage. “Once again the tentacles of death have touched our family, this time at the hands of a coward, a scoundrel, a disgusting human being without any scruples,” he wrote. Cesar Flores, who moved to the United States from Guatemala in 1984 to chase what he called the American dream, learned around 1 a. m. Monday that his only daughter, Mercedez Marisol Flores, 26, had died in the club along with a girlfriend, Amanda Alvear, 25. “She was my best, my only girl,” Mr. Flores, who has two sons, said quietly, with evident grief, outside the Beardall Senior Center, where he was to receive help with arrangements to receive his daughter’s body for burial. “She was a happy girl all the time, but now she’s gone. ” The attacker, Mr. Flores said, should be forgiven. “I cannot hang on to that hate,” he said. “It’s not weapons that kill  —   it’s the heart. That kind of hate is in the blood. ” As he spoke, two people nearby hugged each other for a long time and sobbed. From the front door of the building, a procession of relatives and friends emerged after the briefing, heads bowed. Each family was surrounded by a team of church volunteers in bright   their hands linked to protect their charges from reporters’ questions. One woman, Eileen Villega, said the name of a family friend who had been in the nightclub, Angel L.   27, had not appeared on any of the lists of dead or injured. “His boyfriend is in the hospital, but he doesn’t appear anywhere,” she said. Later, after she had left, his name was indeed found listed among the dead. Orlando is a city that cannot be divorced from its tourist attractions, among them Disney World and Universal Studios, where some of the victims were employed. Xavier Emmanuel Serrano Rosado, 35, was the father of a young son and worked at DisneyLive! according to his Facebook page. The Atlanta   reported that he had danced in the Atlanta Bachata Fest, a celebration of Latin dance and music. Luis S. Vielma, 22, worked on a Harry Potter ride at Universal Studios, and was mourned on Twitter by the author J. K. Rowling. He was also an emergency medical student at Seminole State College, whose president, E. Ann McGee, was among several college presidents who found themselves issuing statements of sorrow on Monday, a testimony to the youth lost in the rampage. “We are saddened by the tragic events this weekend, and the loss of one of our own,” Dr. McGee said. Shane Evan Tomlinson, who often sang with his band, Frequency, at Orlando’s Blue Martini nightclub, performed just hours before he was killed. Friends and fellow singers struggled to process the news of a charismatic life cut short. “We’re all really feeling that numbness right now, and just the shock,” said Deejay Young, who met Mr. Tomlinson in a gospel show at Epcot. “It could have been any one of us. ” Jerald Arthur Wright, 31, was one of those Disney World cast members who seemed to never run out of energy for helping guests, and who, as a   man whose family was from Ecuador, forged a particularly close bond with Latin American visitors. He was also straight, two friends who worked with Mr. Wright said. He had gone to Pulse on Saturday night to celebrate the birthday of a friend, Cory James Connell, 21, who was also killed. “It’s a great atmosphere,” said Jessica Weyl, 23, a friend who is also straight and goes to Pulse occasionally. “People aren’t judgmental. People aren’t feeling the need necessarily to impress each other. ” She added, “At Pulse it’s just calm, cool, and collected. No one felt pressure to be anyone they weren’t. I’m straight and I love going there. My brother is gay and he loves going there. ” Ms. Weyl had just finished training for a job in Tomorrowland when she met Mr. Wright. “He took me under his wing and kind of showed me everything,” she said. She turned to him for questions about Disney policies, but especially when she encountered a guest who spoke Spanish. “He really connected with a lot of guests  —   we do have a lot of South Americans come,” she said. “He connected especially to those people. ” Mexico’s Foreign Ministry confirmed Monday that three Mexicans were among the dead. The Mexican Consulate in Orlando was working to determine if a fourth victim was of Mexican origin. President Enrique Peña Nieto said the tragedy’s origins lay in “expressions of hatred, of discrimination, of phobia against certain people. ” Many Latinos in Orlando are of Puerto Rican descent. Edward Sotomayor Jr. 34, was among them. He was proud of his heritage, and had made it his life’s mission to open doors for gay travelers, especially in Latin America. As the national brand manager for ALandCHUCK. travel, an agency that caters to gay people, he organized what the company’s owner, Al Ferguson, called the   gay cruise to Cuba. “He fell in love with Cuba,” Mr. Ferguson said. During the trip, in April, Mr. Sotomayor and Mr. Ferguson met with Mariela Castro, Raúl Castro’s daughter and a prominent gay rights activist there. The two men also posed in front of a poster left over from President Obama’s recent trip. On Sunday morning at Pulse, Mr. Sotomayor’s boyfriend of about three years had gone outside to put some things in his car when the shots broke out. Mr. Sotomayor texted him that he was hiding, but safe, and told him not to come back inside, Mr. Ferguson said. About 25 minutes later, he texted his boyfriend again, saying he was still hiding. That was the last message the boyfriend got. Mr. Ferguson said the boyfriend’s parents, who live in Mexico, do not know he is gay. “It’s a double catastrophe,” he said. “You face such horrible loss and then can’t share it. ”",0
18594,Nikki Haskell Learns the Social Cost of Supporting Donald Trump - The New York Times,"Nikki Haskell has packed many lives into her 75 years. She has been a real estate broker, a party planner, a pioneering stockbroker, a cult   host, a Studio 54 regular, a diet and fitness guru, and a socialite. Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times. But now she is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of her life: maintaining her position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of her oldest friends, Donald J. Trump, whom she first encountered in 1974 at Le Club, a defunct   nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan. Ms. Haskell said she had a wonderful time at the     dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19. But over the weekend, in a   suite at the Mandarin Oriental, she seemed to be wavering a little. Glued to the television on the morning of Jan. 22, she watched the coverage of the women’s marches in various cities across the country, as well as footage from the more raucous demonstrations of Jan. 20, during which protesters smashed windows, set a limousine on fire and clashed with the police not far from the Mandarin Oriental. After watching this stuff all day on many different channels, Ms. Haskell thought an uprising might be underway. “You see what’s going on in the streets, all these people rioting, all these women?” she said in a phone conversation. “Nothing ever happened like this. They never had these riots  —   every street, every city, all across the world. When there’s crowds and craziness like this, you never know what’ll happen. It’s horrifying. ” Given what she was seeing on television and in her social media feeds, she was worried that her vocal support for the new president would make her a pariah. “I can’t be the only person in the whole world defending Donald Trump,” she said. “I’ll be walking down the street, they’ll attack me. I don’t want to be attacked. This is totally out of control. I’m afraid to walk down the streets in New York or L. A. I’m trying to get a television show on the air, which will never happen in this environment. I’ll never have another friend. Nobody’s going to speak to me. ” When Ms. Haskell was a girl growing up on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, her father bought her six horses, and she wore custom riding suits, with white wing collars and high silk hats, in shows across the Midwest. At night, her parents took her to the Chicago nightclub Chez Paris, where she became besotted with show business while taking in performances by Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Carmen Miranda and Mae West. Not long after the family moved to Beverly Hills, Calif. when Ms. Haskell was 13, her father died of a heart attack and her mother went to work. Ms. Haskell soldiered on. At Beverly Hills High School, she was head cheerleader and was voted “Biggest Flirt” in her senior year. In the Los Angeles of the 1960s, she won a twist contest judged by Bob Hope and Joan Collins. She dated Tony Bennett and hung out with Frankie Avalon, Fabian and George Hamilton. She married a real estate developer, Jack Haskell. After divorcing him, she said, she parlayed the $18, 000 settlement into a small fortune on the stock market. She remarried Mr. Haskell in 1966, moved with him to 470 Park Avenue in New York and divorced him again in 1968. She got her apartment in Manhattan, took classes in investing and was hired at Burnham and Company (which would later become Drexel Burnham). For 10 years, she was a stockbroker by day (and one of the few women working on Wall Street) and a constant presence at Manhattan restaurants and clubs by night. She was equally at ease dining at Elaine’s or judging a Blueboy magazine beauty pageant in the meatpacking district. She joked that she lived at Studio 54. She made friends with Rick James, Imelda Marcos, Andy Warhol and the Village People. She hit her stride with “The Nikki Haskell Show,” a charmingly   program on the New York   stations Channel J and Channel 10. In the 1980s, she was the forerunner of a YouTube star, and her guests included Michael Caine, Divine, Timothy Leary, Sophia Loren, Diana Ross, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Peter Ustinov. And Mr. Trump. New York magazine called her the “Queen of Comp” for her habit of scoring freebies in exchange for positive publicity. Spy magazine, less charmed by her social climbing, likened her to Pia Zadora. In the past three decades, she has been a staple at parties and benefits. She has also remade herself as an entrepreneur in the diet and fitness industry as the creator of StarCaps diet pills, which got her in trouble with federal authorities in 2014, because its supposedly “natural” ingredients included the drug bumetanide. Ms. Haskell was fined $60, 000, The Daily News reported. (Ms. Haskell put the figure at $70, 000.) She also sells the Star Cruncher, a piece of exercise equipment, through Groupon  —   “a gym in a bag,” she calls it. A longtime Democrat, she faced a dilemma last year when Mr. Trump’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination began to take off. “I’m sort of in a quandary,” she said in her Upper East Side apartment last April, “because nothing would make me happier in the whole world than to see Hillary Clinton as president. I never thought that in my lifetime we would have a woman president, and I’ve always been very supportive of the Clintons. I’m a registered Democrat, but I vote across party lines and would never have voted for anyone else except for Hillary, if it wasn’t for the fact that Donald’s running. ” One reason she was leaning toward Mr. Trump was her belief that people were not ready for a female president. “The way things are throughout the world, men just don’t respect women enough,” Ms. Haskell said. “At this time a president being a woman might be detrimental. I hate to say that, but we live in a very, very antiwoman society. ” In September, Ms. Haskell came out as a public Trump supporter when she was interviewed for a Politico Magazine article headlined “The Real Trumpettes of Bel Air,” in which she said of Mrs. Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin, “I don’t think we should have a Muslim in power, someone working for the president. ” After it appeared, Ms. Haskell noticed a change in her social position on both coasts. “That’s when it all started,” she said. “It was a disaster. ” On election night, she went to a dinner in New York hosted by an entertainment mogul and was the only person there who admitted to voting for Mr. Trump, she said. Around 3 a. m. Ms. Haskell logged on to Facebook and posted: “How great, America wins. We love President Donald J. Trump. ” “You must be senile,” one of her followers replied. “U ought to be ashamed,” another wrote. On Nov. 10, she made a selfie video in the back of a New York City taxi and posted it on Facebook. “It’s up to us to do our part to make America great,” she said. “Whether you like Donald Trump or not, now is the time to become a better America. ” Before signing off with her customary goodbye (“ ! ”) she reminded everyone to watch her old public access shows  —   now available on Amazon Prime  —   a few of which showed her interviewing Mr. Trump when he was a mogul on the rise. Friends distanced themselves from Ms. Haskell, she said, and one bestie dropped her after 25 years of friendship. “I was actually in tears when someone told me they didn’t want to be my friend anymore because I supported Donald Trump,” she said. But Ms. Haskell refused to stop cheerleading. She made another video of herself while riding in a car down Park Avenue during the time of the frequent demonstrations near Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle. After expressing frustration with the marches and protests (“stupid,” she called them) she said into her iPhone: “Donald Trump is not going away, and people are going to have to smack their kids around and sit them down and tell them to stop acting like jerks. And to be Americans and get with the program. See you later.  !” In December, the writer Kevin Sessums was fed up with her   posts on Facebook. The last straw was Ms. Haskell’s posting her 1982 public access interview with Roy Cohn, the mentor to Mr. Trump who served as Senator Joseph McCarthy’s counsel during the   hearings in 1954. “As if that were a glamorous, wonderful bit of footage,” Mr. Sessums posted. A later thread taking aim at Ms. Haskell grew to more than 100 comments. Over the holidays, she visited the California home of the movie producer Robert Evans, who wrote about Ms. Haskell in his 2013 memoir, “The Fat Lady Sang. ” He said he had no sympathy for those who have dropped her because of her support for the president. “I love her for it,” Mr. Evans said. “By losing Nikki’s friendship, they’re the losers. But she is a winner. ” On the afternoon of Jan. 19 at the Mandarin Oriental suite, which she was sharing with her friend, the   and philanthropist Kelly Day, Ms. Haskell started getting ready for the   dinner at Union Station for Mr. Trump’s donors and family members. “Donald always had big ideas, big dreams, and I was always fascinated with that,” she said while doing her eyelashes. She recalled first seeing him at Le Club. “He was really handsome, a hot guy, and he caught my eye immediately,” she said. “He was very captivating, even in a discothèque at night. ” Several months later, Mr. Cohn invited her to dinner at “21” and seated her next to Mr. Trump. “We clicked right away,” she said. The first night he took a Czech fashion model named Ivana Zelnickova out on the town, Ms. Haskell, along with her date, met up with them at Elaine’s. “Ivana and I became friends like that,” she said. “And when Studio 54 opened in 1977, I went with Donald and Ivana. ” As Ms Haskell and Ms. Day left the suite, Ms. Haskell spoke of her increasing number of  . “It takes a lot to make me cry,” she said, putting on a golden sable coat. “I have no children. I have a fabulous brother, nieces and nephews, but I’m a woman alone of 75 years old, and I find it just so disheartening. ” At Union Station, once through the metal detectors, Ms. Haskell smiled for the paparazzi. Her table was next to those occupied by Trump family members. After a speech by the   Ms. Haskell chatted a while with Melania, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump. “I can’t believe we’re here,” Tiffany told her. As waiters cleared away the main course (roasted branzino) she got up. “I supported Donald when no one supported him,” Ms. Haskell said on her way to the powder room. “One of the family just said to me, ‘It wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for you.’ Well, I don’t know if that’s necessarily true. But I really believe in Donald. ” She walked by Jose Fanjul, the sugar baron, and Christine Hearst Schwarzman, the wife of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman. “You know why it’s a great party?” Ms. Haskell said. “Because everybody here loves Donald. ” After dessert (vanilla meringue cake) she seemed to feel better about those   of hers. “They’ll get over it,” she said. “If they don’t, they don’t. ” A protester was scowling at guests leaving the party. “He makes America ashamed!” the woman said. Waiting for an Uber, Ms. Haskell rhapsodized about the spectacular crystal, the silverware, the gold charger plates, the tablecloths, the decorations. At the lobby bar of the Mandarin Oriental, she ordered a Grey Goose orange vodka with club soda and a slice of orange (a “ ”) and said she hadn’t been offended by any of the remarks made by Mr. Trump, even those captured on the   Billy Bush tape. “Listen, Donald has more respect for women than anyone I know,” she said. “I’m not saying he’s not a guy. Guys talk about girls. They talk about getting them into bed. But it’s just guy talk. ” She remembered the interviews she did with him. “And now they’re all on Amazon Prime,” she said. “The history of what I’ve done will live on forever. ” Back in the suite, Ms. Haskell and Ms. Day ordered room service and didn’t call it quits until around 4:30 a. m. Later, they watched the inauguration together in their bathrobes. On Sunday, while watching the women’s protests on television, Ms. Haskell said she might ease up on the cheerleading until things settled down. “I’m just one little person,” she said. “I’m not Kellyanne Conway. ” She got dressed and made it to Reagan National Airport. “I’m never going to march,” she said on the phone, after clearing through security. “Yes, it worked in the Vietnam War and things like that, but that was a different time. I would have no problem going to Congress, and because I have this close friendship with the Trump family, I will use this opportunity to better all the things for women. Because that’s exactly how I feel. ” While still counting herself a Trump supporter, Ms. Haskell has indeed eased up with the Facebook posts in favor of the president since the inauguration weekend. “You know, I’m running out of friends and I got tired of all the negativity,” she said on Wednesday. “People were busting my chops and I lost a couple of very close friends, which I think is actually quite insane and pathetic, to think that people who are these lifelong friends are not speaking to me because I voted for Donald Trump. ” But lately she has taken pains to post nonincendiary material. “Just to show you how things have changed,” Ms. Haskell said, “the other day I posted myself going to the grocery store. That was a first. ”",0
18595,Star-Studded Guest List for Obama’s Final White House Bash,"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are set to host a final,   party at the White House on Friday featuring the couple’s closest celebrities friends and faithful donors. [There’s been no official word confirming the affair, but the “goodbye party,” the Washington Post reports, will likely include frequent Obama White House guests Oprah Winfrey, Usher, Kendrick Lamar, Samuel L. Jackson, Beyoncé, Jay Z, Bradley Cooper and Stevie Wonder.  The Obamas did, however, say during an interview with People magazine last month that one final “grown up” event was looming. “We are going to have a big party before we leave office,” President Obama said. “It’s going to be kind of a grown up party. ” Film directors J. J. Abrams and director George Lucas are also expected to attend, the Post reports. The last time this many celebrities headed to the White House was for Obama’s 55th birthday party in August. That party featured musical performances from Usher and Kendrick Lamar and had a guest list reported to include Wonder, Jennifer Hudson, John Legend, Anna Wintour, Ellen DeGeneres, Alonzo Mourning and Magic Johnson.

18596,"Gawker, Filing for Bankruptcy After Hulk Hogan Suit, Is for Sale - The New York Times","Gawker Media, the irreverent company that pioneered the wry tone and    approach that came to embody a certain style of web journalism, put itself up for sale on Friday in an acknowledgment that its future as an independent news organization was in doubt. Gawker said it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and would conduct a sale through an auction. The company is under significant financial pressure from a $140 million legal judgment in an    lawsuit by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan and facing a determined foe in the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who is funding legal cases against it. Ziff Davis, a digital media company, has submitted an opening bid, which a person briefed on Gawker’s plans said was in the range of $90 million to $100 million. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sale process. Gawker expects a sale to close by the end of the summer. But even as Gawker took stock of its next steps, it remained, in typical fashion, defiant. “Even with his billions, Thiel will not silence our writers,” Nick Denton, Gawker’s founder and chief executive, said on Twitter. “Our sites will thrive  —   under new ownership  —   and we’ll win in court. ” (Mr. Denton, through a spokesman, declined further comment.) Since its founding in 2002, Gawker has espoused a conversational tone that came to be mimicked across the internet and on social platforms like Twitter. Gawker and its affiliated sites  —   including the   Deadspin and Jezebel, which is aimed at women  —   have relentlessly and gleefully chronicled the lives of the powerful, and often delivered   exclusive stories, some of them too    for other publications. The company was also an incubator of talent: Employees went on to found websites like The Awl and work at publications like The New Yorker and Time. Gawker also had many detractors, who said it often went too far and published items with little news value that aimed to embarrass individuals. But over the last year Gawker. com has been going through something of a cultural transformation. Mr. Denton has vowed to make the site nicer and Gawker has shifted to politics and away from coverage of the New York media world and celebrity gossip. The decision to file for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale is the latest development for a company that has faced a seemingly unending barrage of bad news in the last year. There was the maelstrom last summer after Gawker published, and then removed, an article about a married male media executive who sought to hire a gay escort. That decision led to the resignations of two top editors. More recently, there was the lawsuit by Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea, which has roiled the company and raised questions about its path forward. “It really was an incredibly bad year,” said Hamilton Nolan, a writer who has worked at Gawker for eight years. “I think they’ll study this in journalism schools one day as being the single worst year in media company history. ” In Gawker’s new offices in Manhattan on Friday, the mood was somber. Around noon, Mr. Denton and Heather Dietrick, the company’s president and general counsel, held a meeting to inform employees of the company’s plans and provide reassurance that Gawker would operate as usual during the sale process. “They emphasized that the future is uncertain, but for now we’re going to keep doing what we do, and that was useful for people to hear,” said Alex Pareene, the editor in chief of Gawker. Employees said that few people had known before the meeting of the company’s decision to file for bankruptcy. A keg of beer was brought in and pizzas were ordered. “It was not a raucous or even particularly depressing affair,” Mr. Pareene said. “We’ve had more depressing meetings and we’ve had more argumentative meetings. ” Gawker’s sites published posts assuring readers they were not going anywhere. Filing for Chapter 11 stays claims from creditors, including court judgments  —   meaning Gawker will not need to begin paying the $140 million that was awarded in March to Mr. Bollea. It also allows companies more time and more control as they reorganize themselves. In its bankruptcy filing, Gawker listed $50 million to $100 million in assets and $100 million to $500 million in liabilities. The company still plans to appeal the case. Also on Friday, a judge in Pinellas County Circuit Court in Florida granted Gawker’s request for a stay of the judgment against it in the lawsuit, pending an appeal. That decision essentially became redundant once Gawker filed for bankruptcy. Weeks earlier, Mr. Thiel acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times that he was financially supporting Mr. Bollea’s lawsuit, as well as other lawsuits against the organization. Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal and one of the earliest investors in Facebook, was outed as being gay by one of Gawker’s blogs, the   Valleywag, nearly a decade ago. He said that Gawker published articles that “ruined people’s lives for no reason” and prompted his decision to finance cases against the company. “It’s less about revenge and more about specific deterrence,” Mr. Thiel said of his supporting Gawker’s legal opponents. “I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest. ” A spokesman for Mr. Thiel did not return a request for comment on Friday. Gawker is also exploring at least one lawsuit against Mr. Thiel, according to the person briefed on Gawker’s plans. The offer by Ziff Davis, whose online properties include IGN, Geek. com and AskMen. com, is what is known as a “  bid,” essentially setting a floor in a   auction. Money from a sale would be held aside to cover creditor claims, including any damages after the appeals process. In an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, Ziff Davis’s chief executive, Vivek Shah, said that under the terms of a potential agreement, the company would acquire Gawker Media’s properties but none of its liabilities. When discussing its plans for Gawker Media, he referred to the benefits of having all of the company’s sites, but conspicuously omitted any mention of Gawker. com. He said the auction would most likely take place at the end of July. Other bidders, which will probably include other media publishers, are expected, particularly with the threat of assuming legal claims removed with the bankruptcy filing. In January, Gawker sold a minority stake in the company to the investment company Columbus Nova Technology Partners, partly in preparation for the lawsuit by Mr. Bollea. Mr. Bollea sued Gawker Media in 2012 over Gawker. com’s publication of a    tape that showed Mr. Bollea having sex with a woman who was at the time the wife of a friend of his. In March, after a   trial, a Florida jury awarded $115 million in damages to Mr. Bollea. A jury later awarded $25 million more in punitive damages, bringing the total to $140 million. On Friday, some Gawker employees remained hopeful that a new owner might mean a fresh start, but there was also perhaps a tacit acknowledgment that Gawker as everyone knew it could soon be a thing of the past. “There’s not going to be the magical happy ending to the story,” Mr. Nolan said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be the worst ending to the story, but we’re not just going to go back to everything being how it was. ”",0
18597,"Concerned About Zika, More Top Tennis Players Are Skipping Olympics - The New York Times","WASHINGTON  —   Rafael Nadal, who has not played a match since withdrawing from the French Open in May because of a wrist injury, sounded a note of optimism that his recovery would allow him to compete in the Rio Olympics, after he missed the London Olympics four years ago with a different injury. “Although, as I always say, there is nothing certain in this life,” Nadal told reporters in Majorca on Wednesday. The uncertainty surrounding the Rio Olympics has become more pronounced in tennis, with four top players in the last five days having announced that they will skip the Games, now only two and a half weeks away. Two men,   Milos Raonic and   Tomas Berdych, and two women,   Simona Halep and   Karolina Pliskova, expressed concerns over Zika, which had been largely minimized by players who answered questions about the virus during the French Open and Wimbledon. “I concluded that the risks are too high for my career and for my health, especially as a woman,” Halep said in a statement on Facebook. “Family is much too important for me and I can’t risk not being able to have one of my own after my career in tennis is over. ” Berdych, who reached the Wimbledon semifinals, said previous tournaments had kept him too busy to think about the Olympics until recently. “Obviously, I’ve known about the virus a long time, since when it all started,” Berdych said Tuesday at the Citi Open in Washington. “But of course the season was going on” Berdych, who said he hoped to compete in the 2020 Olympics, said that he could not justify the risks that he saw to his life after tennis. “I’m going to play two, three, four years, and then the rest of my life will be another 60 years, something like that,” Berdych said. “If something happens that makes that not the way you want it, because of one week or one tournament, you might have a sad life. No, I don’t think so I don’t want to take that risk, even if the risks are possibly small or whatever. ” Although several male players removed themselves from Olympic consideration because of a desire to focus on ATP events  —   which Raonic also cited in an interview after his initial announcement  —   only one player had mentioned Zika before late last week as a reason for not traveling to Brazil. That was Alexandr Dolgopolov, who pulled out in June and cited Zika as a particular concern giving his existing medical concerns, which include Gilbert’s syndrome, a liver condition. Concerns over Zika had been discussed privately, however. Horia Tecau, who had planned to play mixed doubles with Halep, a fellow Romanian, before she announced her withdrawal, said that Halep had expressed concerns weeks ago about the virus. Tecau, who still hopes to qualify for the mixed doubles event with a   partner, said the withdrawals by Halep and other athletes had disappointed him, especially given what he sees as the relatively low risk posed by the virus. “When I keep hearing about this virus, if you sit down and think about all the stuff that we go through during the year, with everything that’s happening in the world now, there’s a lot of risk everywhere,” Tecau said. “I think this Zika virus is a very small percentage out of that risk. It’s not a solid enough reason. ” As an example of overblown concern, Tecau pointed to a report from the United States State Department about concerns regarding the Olympic Games that the ATP had distributed to players. While 20 of the 33 pages focused on crime and security, less than one page focused on Zika. Other players are also confident. Denis Kudla, an American, expressed faith in organizers’ preparedness and said, “It’s going to take a lot more than that to not go to the Olympics. ” Brazilians, such as Bruno Soares, a doubles champion at this year’s Australian Open, have been outspoken about assuaging the panic over the virus. “It’s not the end of the world or something like this,” Soares said. “I feel like it’s a little bit of my duty just to try to inform people. ” Soares has cited the   ATP event in Rio de Janeiro in February, when mosquitoes are in season, as reason for his fellow players to be at ease. “So many guys came to me in the last swing in Europe saying, ‘What’s the real situation over there? ’” Soares said. “International media is just making such a huge thing out of it. I’m saying: ‘Listen, guys: I’m from Brazil. We played the Rio event in the summer, when the mosquitoes are way worse  —   they don’t really grow during winter  —   and there was zero cases.’ If you go to Brazil, there’s no worry about that. People are just living normal lives. ” Others remain concerned over the mixed signals. Samantha Stosur, an Australian, said she was “absolutely, 100 percent going” but admitted that she had more questions about these Games than about the three previous Olympics she had attended. Eugenie Bouchard, a Canadian, remains undecided. “I don’t know if anyone knows enough about it to really give a good opinion on whether, as athletes, we should go or not,” Bouchard said. “I just don’t know if the health of my future babies is worth it. So that’s what I’m trying to decide in my head. ” Sloane Stephens of the United States said that she had received conflicting medical advice but that she planned to go  —   and to pack the mosquito nets she had already bought. “One doctor I talked to said, ‘You shouldn’t go, because we don’t know what’s going to happen,’ and yada, yada,” Stephens said. “And some other doctors are like, ‘You know, if this is your dream and you want to go play the Olympics? Go. ’’”",0
18598,The Advocate Calls for More Gun Control: Legal Guns No Different Than Illegal Guns,"The Advocate ran a column on March 3 that claimed, legal or illegal, all “guns are the problem” and called for the LGBTQ community to rally for more gun control. [The jumping point for the call for gun control was the June 12, 2016,   attack at the Orlando Pulse nightclub. The column, written by Igor Volsky and Mark Glaze, both steeped in the gun control movement and who previously used a USA Today column to suggest it was time to go after “legally obtained” firearms, did not focus on the Pulse being a   club and that the   policy guaranteed an armed criminal would face no significant retaliation if he entered with a firearm.  Instead, they wrote: Here’s the central fact that should guide our actions on gun violence going forward: The Pulse shooter, the Fort Lauderdale airport shooter, and countless other murderers were legally entitled to have firearms. They did everything right  —   until the moment they started shooting. Our vision is simple, and unlike the gun lobby’s, it’s actually supported by reality  —   which is precisely why the gun lobby continues to oppose scientific studies on gun violence. Legally obtained or not, whether by “good guys” or “bad guys,” guns are the problem. The push for not differentiating between legal and illegal guns was anchored in the Orlando Pulse attack and the Ft.   International Airport attack. In both instances, the attackers fully complied with gun control laws —  their guns were “legally obtained” —  only to use their guns for evil. The Advocate’s solution for this is to go after all guns, regardless of whether they are acquired lawfully. Volsky and Glaze admit that gun control is impotent to stop determined attackers, that it has repeatedly failed to stop them. Nonetheless, their solution is more gun control —  not simply gun control couched in criminal behavior and criminal possession of guns, but gun control openly fashioned against “legally obtained” firearms, as well. The Pink Pistols, a gun rights group directed toward the LGBTQ community, reacted to the Orlando Pulse shooting differently. On the day of the attack, Pink Pistols spokeswoman Gwendolyn Patton said, “Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killer’s guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. ” She continued, “A human being did this. The human being’s tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that person’s soul. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

18599,IRS Attorney Arrested for Dealing Meth on the Side,"An Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attorney based in Washington, D. C. was arrested for allegedly shipping methamphetamine from his apartment to Long Island, New York over the past few years. [Jack Vitayanon, 41, is facing charges of conspiring with others to distribute 500 grams or more of methamphetamine, the Washington Examiner reported.  “Selling methamphetamine is a serious crime which is made more egregious when it is committed by a U. S. government attorney assigned to the Office of Professional Responsibility of the IRS,” Angel Melendez, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations New York, said in a statement. Vitayanon, who works in the IRS’ Office of Professional Responsibility, negotiated sales and distribution quantities with undercover HSI agents and shipped the meth from his D. C. apartment to Long Island through Federal Express. “As alleged, the defendant  —   a federal attorney working for the IRS’s Office of Professional Responsibility  —   broke bad and supplemented his income by selling distribution quantities of methamphetamine,” stated United States Attorney Robert E. Capers for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY). Vitayanon worked with people in Arizona and Long Island to distribute the drug. An undercover agent recorded a conversation with Vitayanon on the Internet on Dec. 15, 2016 and observed him smoking meth from a glass pipe, according to the complaint. When law enforcement searched his apartment, they found suspected methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia, packaging material and drug ledgers.",0
18600,Donald Trump: ’I Didn’t Get Elected to Serve the Washington Media’ - Breitbart,"President Donald Trump defied media coverage of his presidency, vowing to keep fighting for the people who elected him president.  “Look at the way I’ve been treated lately especially by the media,” Trump said. “No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. ” The president made his remarks during his commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut, offering his advice to the graduates. “You will find that thing happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted, but you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. ” Trump said. “Never ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine. ” Trump’s remarks are the first public remarks since leaked Comey memos accused Trump of trying to shut down an investigation into his investigation into his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The president encouraged cadets to fight hard for what they believed in. “You can’t let them get you down,” he said. “You can’t let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams. ” Trump’s remarks drew cheers and applause from the crowd, as he explained that he would continue to fight, pointing out that he won the election by doing just that. “The more righteous your fight, the more opposition you will face,” he said. Trump boasted that he had already brought back jobs back into the country, appointed a new Supreme Court Justice and invested heavily into the military. He also spoke about his efforts to reduce job killing regulations and his success slowing illegal border crossings. “I didn’t get elected to serve the Washington media or special interests,” he said. “I got elected to serve the forgotten men and women of our country, and that’s what I’m doing. ”  ",0
18601,"After Eight Years in Guantánamo, He Yearns to Return - The New York Times","TUNIS  —   Dressed in a thick jacket and wool hat on a cool winter evening, counting the coins for his bus fare, Hedi Hammami looks like any other Tunisian on his way to work. But he walks with a limp and sometimes pauses midspeech and screws up his face in pain. “That’s Guantánamo,” he explains. After eight years as a detainee in the United States detention facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, he says he still suffers from headaches, depression and anxiety attacks from the torture and other mistreatment he says he suffered there, even six years after his release. Married with two children now and employed as a nighttime ambulance driver, Mr. Hammami, 47, seems to have rebuilt his life. Yet the pressures of living in Tunisia’s faltering democracy, under harassment and enduring repeated raids by the police, have driven him to make an extreme request. “It would be better for me to go back to that single cell and to be left alone,” he said recently. “Two or three weeks ago I went to the Red Cross and asked them to connect me to the U. S. foreign ministry to ask to go back to Guantánamo. ” The Red Cross refused to take his request, he said, but he insists nevertheless that at this point, that would be best for him. “I have lost my hope,” he says. “There is no future in this country for me. ” When he was first released from Guantánamo in 2010, Tunisia was still a dictatorship under the rule of President Zine   Ben Ali and notorious for torturing prisoners, in particular Islamists. Deemed no longer a threat to the United States, Mr. Hammami was sent to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. After the popular uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mr. Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring, Mr. Hammami negotiated his return to Tunisia. He timed it well, benefiting from a national amnesty for political prisoners and a program of compensation that gave him a job in the Ministry of Health. “I hoped very much that after the revolution everything would get better,” he said in one of several interviews in his rented home in a   suburb of Tunis. Yet, soon after he began work in 2013, the police raided his apartment with dogs at 3 a. m. breaking the door and hauling him down to the police station. “They made me crawl on all fours down the stairs,” he recounted. At the police station they said they just wanted to get to know him, and let him go after 15 minutes. “That was just the beginning. ” Since then, Mr. Hammami has lived under a constant regimen of police surveillance, raids and harassment. His cellphone and computer were confiscated. When he moved to a new house, the police followed him, turning up at all hours to question him. In December 2015 he was placed under house arrest, told he no longer had the right to work and ordered to sign in at the police station morning and evening for six weeks. He remains under “administrative control,” and the police enforce the order at will. He cannot travel outside Tunis. Every so often, like on Sept. 11, the police order him to sign in with them. “I feel someone is doing it for revenge,” he says. The police have also scared landlords from renting to him, forcing him to move six times in three years. His Algerian wife’s residency card was confiscated, preventing her from working to supplement his meager salary. The family is barely managing, she said, asking not to be named for fear of further police harassment. Stress and tension from the police actions have intensified the psychological problems Mr. Hammami brought with him from Guantánamo. “I feel too much pressure,” he said, rubbing his temples. “All that blackness comes back. ” Rim Ben Ismail, a psychologist working for the World Organization Against Torture in Tunisia, who has counseled 12 Tunisians who were detained in Guantánamo, says Mr. Hammadi’s wish to return to his cell is fairly typical of the Guantánamo detainees. “They lived with suffering, physical suffering,” she said in an interview. “But now there is a psychic suffering, and often they say, ‘Take me back there. ’” “Because of their past they are all presumed guilty and it is unlivable for all of them and their families,” she added. “The families are being threatened and harassed. ” Parents in particular fear the Tunisian security forces and say they think their sons would be safer in Guantánamo, she added. Raids have often been needlessly violent, she said police officials break down doors and wake a suspect with a gun to his head, often in front of his wife and children. “Everything is being done to create aggression in a person,” she said. “They do not need to raid the house at 2 a. m. ” One of her former Guantánamo patients was harassed so relentlessly by police that he became suicidal and ran off to Syria, where he was killed. “He was such a gentle person,” she said sadly. “By treating these people like this you create a climate of revenge and the sense that they have no place at home. ” There is no doubt that Tunisia has a terrorism problem. It has been grappling with attacks from Al   groups since 2013. The violence escalated to spectacular attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 70 people, many of them foreign tourists at a national museum and at a beach resort hotel. Moreover, Tunisians reportedly make up the largest number of foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and some have been encouraged to conduct attacks when they return home. After an attack killed 12 members of the presidential guard in November 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency. At least 139 Tunisians have been placed under house arrest since, according to Human Rights Watch, which documented the cases in a report released in September. The sanctions have been justified in the context of countering terrorism but have “left people facing stigmatization and unable to pursue studies and work,” it stated. International human rights officials have voiced growing concerns of abuses resurfacing in Tunisia. In a report released this week, Amnesty International accused the Tunisian police and security forces of employing repressive measures used by past dictatorships, including torture, deaths in custody, arbitrary house raids and often unlawful harassment of suspects, their families and communities. Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights while countering terrorism, said during a recent visit to Tunisia that human rights should be central to counterterrorism operations, noting that torture and other repressive measures fuel radicalism. Mr. Hammami says he feels the police are pushing him that way. The son of a farmer from Tunisia’s poor northwest, he says he originally left for Italy in 1986 in search of work. There he fell in with an Islamic missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, and later traveled to Pakistan, where he obtained refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the American military in 2002 and transferred to Guantánamo, where he was accused of training in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Americans also say they found his identification papers in Tora Bora, the last redoubt of Osama bin Laden in the country, according to papers released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Hammami, who denies going to Afghanistan or having any links to Qaeda or terrorism, was eventually released without charge. Whatever his past, he says after nearly 20 years away, he just wants to live quietly. “I never committed a crime,” he said. “I don’t have a record, no theft, no ethics problems, nothing. ” “My only demand is to be stable, but they don’t let me live my life in stability,” he said. “They are pushing you towards death. ”",0
18602,"Berlin, United Nations, Trump: Your Thursday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump added more turbulence to U. S. foreign policy, tweeting that the country should greatly “expand its nuclear capability” after comments by the Russian president. And he pressured President Obama to veto a U. N. resolution condemning the construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, above. The Obama administration is dismantling a dormant national registry program for some foreign visitors amid worries that the new administration would revive it. Mr. Trump has suggested that the attack on a Christmas market in Berlin validated his proposal to bar Muslims from U. S. entry. His transition team is asking employees at the State Department to provide details of   programs, fanning fears of a rollback. _____ 2. Kellyanne Conway, the campaign manager known as “the Trump whisperer,” will be appointed counselor to the president, becoming the   woman in the White House. She is a tenacious strategist who has clashed with Mr. Trump’s most senior advisers. Sean Spicer, the longtime spokesman for the Republican National Committee known for being combative with reporters, was named press secretary. _____ 3. President Bashar   of Syria regained full control of Aleppo, his country’s industrial capital. The final evacuations  —   busloads of civilians trundling through heavy snow  —   spell a major turning point in the   war. Many of the evacuees went north to   areas of Idlib Province, which aid groups and the U. N. are warning could be the government’s next target. _____ 4. In Berlin, the authorities found fingerprints of the lone suspect in the truck used in Monday’s attack on a Christmas market, Germany’s worst terror attack in decades. Anis Amri, a Tunisian who had been denied asylum and turned 24 today, is still on the loose. Public frustration grew as the authorities divulged they had been monitoring him since March because of signs he was a potential security threat, and had nearly deported him from Germany. Berliners, shaken but undaunted, returned to their city’s Christmas markets. _____ 5. New census figures set the U. S. population at just over 323 million  —   just 0. 7 percent more than last year, the smallest annual expansion in 80 years. Demographers say growth will likely be slow for years. The states with the   populations are in the West and South, in part because older people from the Northeast and Midwest retire there. West Virginia’s population shrank the most. _____ 6. Most of Chicago’s 3, 451 shootings this year were gang related. The Times spent weeks with gang members to understand what being in one means. That’s become fuzzy over the last 25 years, as the large,   operations built around drug dealing have splintered. They’re now little more than cliques or sets. “If we’re sitting here bored, getting high and we got guns around, it ain’t nothing else to do,” one gang member said. _____ 7. We took a close look at the Dec. 2 fire that killed 36 people in a building known as the Ghost Ship in Oakland, Calif. Dozens of interviews and a review of documents show that the fire was a disaster waiting to happen, a deadly mix of a flawed safety inspection system and a shortage of affordable housing that led tenants to live in a building that was never intended to be a residence. _____ 8. The new movie “Hidden Figures” tells the true story of three black women who played crucial roles in the American space program in the ‘60s, and the prejudice they faced. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe (above from left) star, and Kevin Costner and Kirsten Dunst play their NASA colleagues. Our critic says the film fills you “with outrage at the persistence of injustice and gratitude toward those who had the grit to stand up against it. ” Opening at select theaters Christmas Day. _____ 9. Among our   stories today is an intimate look at the family history of Steve Kerr, the N. B. A. champion and Golden State Warriors coach. He was 18 when his father was assassinated while serving as president of the American University of Beirut in 1984. Now 51, he has an educated and evenhanded approach that echoes his father’s, and has found his voice on gun control, national anthem protests, presidential politics and Middle East policy. _____ 10. Finally, economic and cultural upheavals made this a tumultuous year. Here’s a look at the pictures that defined 2016. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

18603,"Richard Schickel, Movie Critic, Author and Filmmaker, Dies at 84 - The New York Times","Richard Schickel, who was so captivated by Walt Disney’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” when he was 5 years old that he grew up to be a noted film critic, Hollywood historian and prolific author and documentarian  —   and estimated that he had watched 22, 590 movies  —   died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 84. His daughter Erika Schickel said the cause was complications of dementia. Fortified by boxes of Good  Plenty licorice rather than popcorn, Mr. Schickel reviewed films for Life magazine from 1965 until it closed in 1972, then wrote for Time until 2010 and later for the blog Truthdig. com. In a career that spanned the   studio era and the rise of independent directors, he also wrote 37 books on movies and filmmakers and wrote or directed more than 30 documentaries, mostly for television. He shared or received three Emmy nominations, for “Life Goes to the Movies” in 1976 and “Minnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente” in 1987. Richard Zoglin, a fellow critic and now a contributing editor at Time, said that what distinguished Mr. Schickel among his peers was his comprehensive knowledge of the movie industry’s players and processes coupled with “an astute critical sensibility” that resisted the trendy. “He wrote from the perspective of a film insider,” Mr. Zoglin said in a phone interview, “but responded to films from a gut level and never lost the sense of being an average filmgoer reacting to what was on the screen. ” Mr. Schickel pulled no punches. Reviewing Stanley Kramer’s “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” in 1967, the interracial love story starring Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Mr. Schickel groused, “Kramer is earnestly preaching away on matters that have long ceased to be true issues. ” He even dismissed “The Maltese Falcon,” John Huston’s 1941 film noir classic starring Humphrey Bogart, as “cramped and static” and was damning in a retrospective look at “Gone With the Wind” in The Atlantic in 1973. Mr. Schickel wrote that two measures of a movie’s quality should be how much a viewer retains and how much one wants to see it again. By both measures, he loved “Citizen Kane,” “Double Indemnity,” “The Godfather,” “The Searchers,” “Chinatown,” “Fargo,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” “Pinocchio” and the original “King Kong,” as well as outliers like Audie Murphy’s western “No Name on the Bullet” and François Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows. ” Mr. Schickel did not view filmgoing as an experience frozen in memory. “You loved ‘My Friend Flicka’ when you saw it at age 10,” he wrote. “If you see it at age 65, you may respect it, but you won’t think it’s a masterpiece (which does not mean you should deprive your grandchildren of the pleasure of seeing this picture when they are the perfect age for it). ” He also understood that the public’s perception of his role had evolved. A critic, he told The Hedgehog Review in 2005, is “a very endangered species in a nation that wants indulgence more than a criticism that questions its fatuity. ” But responding to an article in The New York Times, which suggested that blogging might be making book reviewing more democratic, he wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 2007: “Criticism  —   and its humble cousin, reviewing  —   is not a democratic activity. It is, or should be, an elite enterprise, ideally undertaken by individuals who bring something to the party beyond their hasty, instinctive opinions of a book (or any other cultural object). It is work that requires disciplined taste, historical and theoretical knowledge and a fairly deep sense of the author’s (or filmmaker’s or painter’s) entire body of work, among other qualities. ” Richard Warren Schickel was born on Feb. 10, 1933, in Milwaukee, the son of Edward Schickel, who worked in advertising, and the former Helen Hendricks, a docent. He was named for an ancestor, Richard Warren, who arrived on the Mayflower. He was raised in suburban Wauwatosa, Wis. and escaped to the movies on weekends with friends, he wrote in a memoir, “Good Morning, Mr. Zip Zip Zip: Movies, Memory, and World War II” (2003) “because the serene and placid little world I inhabited as a kid was so lacking in romantic and heroic adventure. ” He saw Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator” when he was 8. “I mimed enchantment for my parents’ benefit,” he wrote in American Heritage magazine in 2006. “I did a lot of that in those days. They were so sweetly earnest, as I now appreciatively recall, about introducing me to ‘the finer things.’ Their problem back then was finding, in Milwaukee, finer things for me to appreciate. ” Mr. Schickel graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1955 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and moved to New York, where he freelanced for magazines and reviewed his first film, “A Boy Ten Feet Tall,” starring Edward G. Robinson, in 1965. He described it as “quite a good little movie. ” His marriage to Julia Carroll Whedon, a writer, ended in divorce. In addition to their daughter Erika, who is also a writer, he is survived by another daughter from that marriage, Jessica Vild a stepdaughter, Ali Rubinstein, from his second marriage, to the former Carol Rubinstein, a TV producer who died in 1991 and four grandchildren. His books included biographies of Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood, Lena Horne and Elia Kazan. His documentaries include a PBS series, “The Men Who Made the Movies. ” “The truth, very simply, is that most movies are lousy or, at best, routine,” Mr. Schickel wrote in “Keepers: The Greatest Films  —   and Personal Favorites  —   of a Moviegoing Lifetime” (2015). “We go to see them, much of the time, in search of something else  —   the comforting darkness of the theater, the play of light and shadow on the screen, the consolations they offer for some temporary trouble,” he wrote. “A lot of the time we don’t give a hoot what’s playing. We are at a public event for private reasons which we don’t always recognize until later, if at all. It is the occasion, the atmosphere, that we crave. ”",0
18604,Will Barack Obama Delay Or Suspend The Election If Hillary Is Forced Out By The New FBI Email Investigation?,"in: Government , Government Corruption , Obama Exposed , Sleuth Journal Just when it looked like Hillary Clinton was poised to win the 2016 election , the FBI has thrown a gamechanger into the mix. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey announced that his agency has discovered new emails related to Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information that they had not previously seen. According to the Associated Press , the newly discovered emails “did not come from her private server”, but instead were found when the FBI started going through electronic devices that belonged to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. The FBI has been looking into messages of a sexual nature that Weiner had exchanged with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and that is why they originally seized those electronic devices. According to the Washington Post , the “emails were found on a computer used jointly by both Weiner and his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry”, and according to some reports there may be “potentially thousands” of emails on the computer that the FBI did not have access to previously. Even though there are less than two weeks to go until election day, this scandal has the potential to possibly force Clinton out of the race, and if that happens could Barack Obama delay or suspend the election until a replacement candidate can be found? Let’s take this one step at a time. On Friday, financial markets tanked when reports of these new Clinton emails hit the wires. The following comes from CNN … After recommending earlier this year that the Department of Justice not press charges against the former secretary of state, Comey said in a letter to eight congressional committee chairmen that investigators are examining newly discovered emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the email probe. “In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote the chairmen. “I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” At this point, we do not know what is contained in these emails. But without a doubt Huma Abedin is Hillary Clinton’s closest confidant, and I have always felt that she was Clinton’s Achilles heel. Journalist Carl Bernstein (of Watergate fame) is fully convinced that the FBI would have never made this move unless something significant had already been discovered … We don’t know what this means yet except that it’s a real bombshell. And it is unthinkable that the Director of the FBI would take this action lightly, that he would put this letter forth to the Congress of the United States saying there is more information out there about classified e-mails and call it to the attention of congress unless it was something requiring serious investigation. So that’s where we are… Is it a certainty that we won’t learn before the election? I’m not sure it’s a certainty we won’t learn before the election. One thing is, it’s possible that Hillary Clinton might want to on her own initiative talk to the FBI and find out what she can, and if she chooses to let the American people know what she thinks or knows is going on. People need to hear from her… If the FBI has indeed found something explosive, would they actually charge her with a crime right before the election? It is possible, but we also have to remember that government agencies (including the FBI) tend to move very, very slowly. If there are thousands of emails, it is going to take quite a while to sift through them all. And of course Barack Obama has lots of ways that he could influence, delay or even shut down the investigation. So those that are counting on this to be the miracle that Donald Trump needs should not count their chickens before they hatch. But if Hillary Clinton were to be forced out of the race by this FBI investigation, the Democrats would have to decide on a new candidate, and that would take time. The following is from a U.S. News & World Report article that examined what would happen if one of the candidates was forced out of the race for some reason… If Clinton were to fall off the ticket, Democratic National Committee members would gather to vote on a replacement. DNC members acted as superdelegates during this year’s primary and overwhelmingly backed Clinton over boat-rocking socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC spokesman Mark Paustenbach says there currently are 445 committee members – a number that changes over time and is guided by the group’s bylaws, which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold 200 spots for selection by states, along with an optional 75 slots DNC members can choose to fill. But the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman. The meeting would follow procedures set by the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee and proxy voting would not be allowed. It would be extremely challenging to get a majority of the members of the Democratic National Committee together on such short notice. If Clinton were to drop out next week, it would be almost impossible for this to happen before election day. In such a scenario, Barack Obama may attempt to invoke his emergency powers . Since the election would not be “fair” until the Democrats have a new candidate, he could try to delay or suspend the election. There would be a lot of controversy as to whether this is legal or not, but Barack Obama has not let the U.S. Constitution stop him in the past. Meanwhile, new poll numbers show that the Trump campaign was already gaining momentum even before this story about the new emails broke. According to a brand new ABC News/Washington Post survey, Donald Trump is now only trailing Hillary Clinton by 4 points after trailing her by as much as 12 points last weekend. And CNBC is reporting on a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that accurately predicted the outcomes of the presidential primaries and which is now indicating that Trump will be the winner in November… An artificial intelligence system that correctly predicted the last three U.S. presidential elections puts Republican nominee Donald Trump ahead of Democrat rival Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House. MogIA was developed by Sanjiv Rai, founder of Indian start-up Genic.ai. It takes in 20 million data points from public platforms including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in the U.S. and then analyzes the information to create predictions. The AI system was created in 2004, so it has been getting smarter all the time. It had already correctly predicted the results of the Democratic and Republican Primaries. Without Hillary at the top of the ticket, the odds of a Trump victory would go way, way up. So if Hillary is forced out of the race by this investigation, Barack Obama and the Democrats will want to delay or suspend the election for as long as possible if they can. At this point there is probably not a high probability that such a scenario will play out, but in this crazy election year we have already seen that just about anything can happen.

18605,Email Reveals What Progressive Think Tank Gained By Hosting Netanyahu,"When a prominent, progressive establishment think tank, the Center for American Progress, hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on November 10, 2015, it was widely criticized among the left. However, in an email sent by Neera Tanden, the think tank’s president, she defends the decision to welcome Netanyahu with open arms.
The email was published in the latest batch of “Podesta Emails” from WikiLeaks. It offers a glimpse at how Tanden, an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and moderator of CAP’s Netanyahu event, dealt with the controversy.
John Podesta, Clinton campaign chairman, sent her an email the day after the event. “As a bloodied Jack Nicholson said in Hoffa, ‘What has been gained and what has been lost?’ How did the Bibi event score on that scale?”
In Tanden’s reply, she clearly outlined the pros and cons of hosting Netanyahu.
“Things gained: We will never be called anti-Semitic again. No matter what anyone writes,” Tanden asserted. “Mainstream press and people think we handled it just right – tough questions. I think for any dismissers, not that I think there were a lot, but we have definitely proven we’re a think tank. And it may have sealed the deal with a new board member.”
Tanden continued, “Things lost: Staff is riven. On both sides. We are holding a lot of meetings on that. Worse thing – someone leaked staff statement. That kind of thing really changes the culture.”
“How to keep that culture with that kind of leaking is going to be hard, but need to navigate. And far left hates me. We do have a broader issue of expectations in the organization. I had an intern tell me that she was upset we did not tell her ahead of time.”
What was lost and gained is expressed purely in institutional terms. Tanden writes nothing about what CAP may have done to give Netanyahu cover for the crimes the Israeli government commits against Palestinians through its occupation. She has no words for what this may mean for the people of Gaza, who endure poverty and face humanitarian disaster as a result of an economic blockade.
Overall, Tanden concludes, “Nothing we have done has pitted being a think tank and being ideologically action oriented against each other more harshly. At the end of the day, we had to choose.”
“So answer is complicated. If I could have the whole thing not happen, would definitely have it not happen. But it happened to us.”
Inviting a world leader is not something that just happens , like a branch breaking a car’s windshield when it falls out of a tree. Tanden and other leaders of CAP actively sought to host Netanyahu, and they were proud of the prestige it could garner for them.
When she introduced Netanyahu, Tanden said, “Thank you for taking questions because the choices you make matter profoundly to Israel’s future and the future of the region. And we believe that matters profoundly to America.” Notably, she said nothing about the future of Palestinians.
Journalist Rania Khalek pointed out that Tanden let Netanyahu lie repeatedly during the event about the construction of new settlements, settler violence, land theft, and ethnic cleansing.
Tanden and other Clinton appointees served on the Democratic Platform Committee, and during the process, they blocked language that would have acknowledged there is, in fact, an Israeli occupation. They also refused to remove language suggesting the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) movement “delegitimizes” Israel.
A coalition of Clinton Democrats and other liberal Democrats blocked a resolution to support the rebuilding of Gaza during the full Democratic platform committee meeting in July.
Clinton has distinguished herself as a pro-Israel Democrat and will aggressively challenge the BDS movement as president. With the support of Democratic mega-donor Haim Saban, who has pledged to invest billions to fight BDS, Clinton celebrated college students on the “front lines of the battle to oppose the alarming boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement known as BDS” during her speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference.
Additionally, emails previously published by WikiLeaks already have shown that the letter Clinton wrote to Saban, where she pledged to fight BDS, was written to help the campaign attract more pro-Israel donors.
Returning to the CAP event for Netanyahu, in the week before the event, The Intercept published a story on leaked emails showing the lengths to which CAP was willing to go to “placate AIPAC.” The think tank censored “its own writers on the topic of Israel.”
Tanden may seem exasperated in the email. “I need to clear my head on this and then would love to get your advice on a few things in the coming days,” she shared in the email. However, it is not as if there was any kind of an about-face or open display of regret in the aftermath. Tanden and CAP served the interests of AIPAC, also known as the Israel lobby, and if called upon to hold a similar event as a service to a Clinton White House, they will be loyal soldiers and help whitewash the policies of Israel again.

18607,Sean Spicer: Trump Family Has ‘Made It Very Clear’ What They Think of Kathy Griffin,"The White House declined to respond to comedian Kathy Griffin for her widespread public meltdown after her decision to feature herself holding the bloody, decapitated head of President Donald Trump in a photo. [“The president, the first lady, and the Secret Service have all made it very clear their view on those thoughts,” Spicer said in response to a question from Breitbart News, asking if the family wanted a personal apology from the comedian:   Melania Trump called the photo “very disturbing” and questioned Griffin’s mental health. “When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. The president also condemned the photo in a Twitter message. “Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this,” he wrote. “Sick!” During her press conference on Friday, Griffin accused the president and his family of ruining her career and her life after she posed with the photo and said the family “picked the wrong redhead. ” “He broke me,” Griffin said tearfully.",0
18608,Melting Glaciers In Bolivian Andes Leave Communities At Risk,"Posted on October 29, 2016 by Edmondo Burr in Sci/Environment // 0 Comments Glaciers of the Bolivian Andes receded by 43% between 1986 and 2014 according to the findings of a new study. 
Rising temperatures in the Andes have left people living at high altitudes with a water crisis. 
The study was published in The Cryosphere , an European Geosciences Union journal. Recommended 
The rapid melting of one the largest glaciers on earth, the Totten Glacier in East Antarctica, could raise global sea level at least 2 meters by the end of the century, according to a new study (4 hours ago) 
“ On top of that, glacier recession is leaving lakes that could burst and wash away villages or infrastructure downstream, ” says lead-author Simon Cook , a lecturer at the Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. 
European Geosciences Union reports: 
Receding glaciers also put water supply in the region at risk. Glacial meltwater is important for irrigation, drinking water and hydropower, both for mountain villages and large cities such as La Paz and El Alto. Throughout the year, the 2.3 million inhabitants of these two cities receive about 15% of their water supply from glaciers , with this percentage almost doubling during the dry season. Glacier retreat also means less water is available to supply rivers and lakes, such as southern Bolivia’s Lake Poopó, which recently dried up . 
The new study is one of the first to monitor recent large-scale glacier change in Bolivia, to better understand how receding glaciers could affect communities in the country. “The novelty of our study lies in the bigger picture – measuring glacier change over all main glaciated ranges in Bolivia – and in the identification of potentially dangerous lakes for the first time,” Cook says. 
The team measured glacier area change from 1986 to 2014 using satellite images from Landsat, the U.S. Geological Survey’s and NASA’s Earth observation programme. They found that the area of the Bolivian Andes covered by glaciers decreased from about 530 square kilometres in 1986 to only around 300 square kilometres in 2014, a reduction of 43%. Recommended Bodies Of Climbers Alex Lowe & David Bridges Found In Melting Glacier 
The remains of renowned American mountain climber Alex Lowe and his companion cameraman David Bridges have been found partially melting out of a glacier on Shishapangma, Tibet. The two climbers disappeared in a Himalayan avalanche 16 years ago while attempting to ascend the 14th highest mountain in the world. (4 hours ago) 
As glaciers recede, they leave behind lakes typically dammed by bedrock or glacial debris. Avalanches, rockfalls or earthquakes can breach these dams, or cause water to overflow them, resulting in catastrophic floods known as glacial lake outburst floods. The team reports that both the number and size of glacier lakes in the study region increased significantly from 1986 to 2014. 
After studying glacier change, the researchers used their 2014 glacial-lake observations to identify the lakes where outburst floods could occur and present a hazard to populations. “We mapped hundreds of lakes,” Cook explains. “Some lakes are very small and pose little risk. Others are very large, but there’s little or no possibility that they would drain catastrophically. Others are both large enough to create a big flood, and sit beneath steep slopes or steep glaciers, and could be dangerous.” 
They identified 25 glacial lakes across the Bolivian Andes as potentially dangerous to communities and infrastructure, as they could result in very damaging floods. If the smallest of these 25 lakes was to drain completely, it would yield a flood with a peak discharge of 600 cubic metres per second. The largest could result in a discharge of over 125,000 cubic metres of water, about 50 times the volume of an Olympic swimming pool, in a second. 
While measuring glacier area change was a relatively simple task, Cook says “identifying which lakes are dangerous is the million dollar question” as there are various factors to take into account. 
“We considered that a lake was dangerous if there were settlements or infrastructure down-valley from the lake, and if the slopes and glaciers around the lake were very steep, meaning that they could shed ice or snow or rock into the lake, which would cause it to overtop and generate a flood – a bit like jumping into a swimming pool, but on a much bigger scale!” Recommended 
A new study on antidepressants published in The BMJ has revealed that the risk of suicide and aggression in children and teens increases two-fold when they are prescribed drugs to treat depression. (4 hours ago) 
Such catastrophic floods have occurred in the region in the past. Dirk Hoffmann, a researcher at the Bolivian Mountain Institute and co-author in The Cryosphere study, recently documented a glacial lake outburst flood in the Apolobamba region that happened in 2009 and killed farm animals, destroyed cultivated fields and washed away a road that left a village isolated for months. “As those locations are very remote and far away from the cities, authorities at national level and the wider public are often not even aware of the new dangers that mountain dwellers are facing due to the impacts of climate change, and no appropriate measures are being taken,” Hoffmann says. 
Cook says these events could be under-reported, suggesting the risk of such floods in the Bolivian Andes has been overlooked. “We heard of other [glacier lake outburst flood] events from villagers when we visited the Apolobamba region in 2015, but there is no mention of these in publications or papers, possibly because many of these communities are relatively remote.” Hoffmann adds: “A nation-wide risk assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes would be of great interest to local communities in glacier watersheds.” 
In the study, the team also estimated that glacier area will be severely reduced by the end of the century, to about a tenth of the 1986 values. This would put communities even more at risk from water scarcity, Cook says. “We predicted in our study that most glaciers will be gone or much diminished by the end of the century – so where will the water come from in the dry season? Big cities like La Paz are partially dependent on meltwater from glaciers. But little is known about potential water resource stress in more remote areas. More work needs to be done on this issue.” 
The team hope the study raises awareness about the rapid glacier loss in Bolivia, how it could change in the future, and how it could affect water supply and cause glacial lake outburst floods. “Ultimately, I hope that our results will be useful to people in Bolivia – governments, agencies, people living in rural areas and cities,” Cook concludes. 
This research is presented in the paper ‘Glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the Bolivian Andes’ to appear in the EGU open access journal The Cryosphere on 20 October 2016.",0
18609,A Joyful Bustle to Get Ready for Guests: Syrian Refugees - The New York Times,"LANCASTER, Pa.  —   A dull gray house on a hillside has to become a home. Another Syrian family of refugees will be arriving soon, and this empty, echoing old place needs to be readied in welcome. The word has trickled down from the State Department’s refugee resettlement program. A mother, a father, his brother and four children, the youngest just 10. Muslims, traveling from Turkey. Flying into New York in the next few days. Their imminent arrival explains all the commotion inside this   house in the small city of Lancaster, in   Pennsylvania. The state may have gone to Donald J. Trump, who likened the Syrian resettlement program to a “a great Trojan horse” for terrorists. But he isn’t president yet. That is why volunteers and staff members from the Church World Service, a nationwide nonprofit that helps the government take in refugees fleeing violence and persecution, are cleaning cabinets, carting furniture and doing their best to make things homey. Just not too homey. “Doing too much can make a family feel like it’s someone else’s home,” says Josh Digrugilliers, 26, the group’s local housing specialist, whose crowded key chain jangles in reminder of all the refugees in need. He scours a government checklist of housing requirements for a resettlement, mindful that whatever he spends is deducted from a refugee’s   government grant of no more than $1, 125. A family’s combined grants must cover its rent and other expenses until the nonprofit has helped the adults acquire Social Security numbers and jobs. The used furniture being trundled in reflects the emphasis on economy. Some comes from the donations hoarded in a cluttered garage, where a “Welcome Home” sign in Arabic is on display. Other items were acquired cheap  —   chairs for $5, tables for $20  —   at Root’s Old Mill Flea Market. New paint and flooring give the house the smell of a fresh start, thanks to the landlord, John Liang, who came to Lancaster as a child, one of the “boat people” who fled Vietnam on dangerously overcrowded vessels after the war. He spent a year in a notoriously hellish refugee camp before coming to Lancaster, where he and his family delivered newspapers, shoveled snow, did sewing and   work. Anything. Now 45, Mr. Liang works overtime at a nearby Kellogg’s cereal plant and manages several properties he owns, including this house, which he wants to be  —   just so. “There are other people living a lot harder, tougher, than what I went through,” he says. Mr. Digrugilliers applies his checklist to the kitchen, where the counter is crowded with mismatched dinnerware, new appliances and clutches of flatware bound with rubber bands. Draped over the oven handle is a dish towel printed with a calendar for 1968, another tumultuous year. Then to the bedrooms upstairs. The children’s twin beds, bought at discount from the Lancaster Mattress Company, are covered with the black G of the Georgia Bulldogs, the winged wheel of the Detroit Red Wings and other invitations to sleep in cocoons of American culture. Armed with a list of what he needs, he and a colleague, Orion Hernandez, climb into a   van reeking of McDonald’s. They head to Walmart, where Mr. Digrugilliers recognizes a thin man  —   a Nepalese refugee who resettled here two years ago  —   leaving as he is walking in. “Hey, how are you?” Mr. Digrugilliers calls out. “Hello,” the man calls back. Such encounters happen often in Lancaster, whose rich history of acceptance is rooted, in part, in the influence of the Mennonites, Amish and other faiths. A glimpse of the local worldview came in January when a supportive rally of more than 200 people drowned out a much smaller   protest outside the Church World Service office here. Sheila Mastropietro, the group’s longtime supervisor in Lancaster, took heart in the moment. It reflected a communal understanding of both the global refugee crisis and the rigorous screening process that refugees undergo before coming to the United States. Still, given a   who seems averse to the country’s modest commitment to refugee relocation, Ms. Mastropietro says, “We don’t know what to expect. ” Last fiscal year, the Lancaster office of the Church World Service helped to resettle 407 of the 85, 000 refugees admitted to this country this fiscal year, its target is 550 of a   110, 000. “We are acting as if the numbers are going to be the same  —   until we hear something different,” she says. Decades of resettlement work have transformed the Lancaster area into a medley of cultures so rich that Amer Alfayadh, 34, a senior case manager, struggles to name them all: “Syrians, Iraqis, Somalis, Congolese, Ukrainians, Belorussians, people from Kazakhstan. Then, of course, Lebanese, Palestinians. Bhutanese, Nepalese, Burmese, Sri Lankans   …    ” Mr. Alfayadh himself arrived from Iraq in 2010. Though trained as an engineer, he worked at a Lowe’s  —   customer service, paint, lawn and garden  —   and as a substitute teacher before being hired to help other refugees. He is accustomed now to urgent   calls from fresh arrivals unfamiliar with, say, locks on doors. New clients are often at their breaking point, uncertain what to make of this exotic land called Pennsylvania. Knowing how difficult it can be for anyone in crisis to see ahead  —   to jobs, school, a future  —   Mr. Alfayadh says he tries to impart a simple message: “O. K. Tomorrow will be better. ” At Walmart, Mr. Digrugilliers and Mr. Hernandez commandeer two shopping carts each and begin racing through the cavernous store like contestants on the old “Supermarket Sweep” game show, grabbing specific items, down to umbrellas and sanitary pads. His purchases complete, Mr. Digrugilliers mounts his cart and wheels it into the dusk like a skateboard, exuberant with hope that some refugee family’s journey will be just as smooth. It is not. The Church World Service soon receives word that this particular family’s resettlement has been delayed  —   a   development that could be caused by something as simple as a spike in an  ’s blood pressure at the airport. But there is no shortage of   refugees. Mr. Alfayadh’s supervisor, Valentina Ross, remembers that another Syrian family is arriving in a few days: a father, a mother, three daughters and a boy. They will need a home. Today is the day. A holiday spirit has taken hold in downtown Lancaster, with a colossal Christmas tree glittering in Penn Square and ancient brick houses swathed in festive lights. A mile away, a Church World Service caseworker named Gaby Garver, a focused college graduate of 22, is collecting provisions for the new family at a food pantry. Signing some paperwork, she says, “And no meat products for the family, please. ” As Ms. Garver prepares to leave with milk, vegetables and other items, a pantry volunteer asks: “Since you didn’t take any meat, would you like some extra rice?” Yes, please. More food is needed. Ms. Garver guides her 1999 Pontiac through the cold rain to the    supermarket, where many goods sit in   cardboard cases. She leaves 10 minutes later with bread, fruit, beans, sugar, tea and a receipt for $26. 58, to be deducted from the family’s grant money. Hunched against the weather, the slight young woman makes two trips carrying the food into the drab gray house. After stocking the refrigerator and cabinet, she conducts a   inspection. The fridge is cold. The tap has hot water. The burners on the gas stove ignite. Everything upstairs is fine as well, with even more homey touches added. New pajamas and towels. New clothes hangers. New picture frames, showing stock photos of cheerful families, on the shelves. And on one twin bed, a child’s soccer ball, still in its box. The rain has stopped, a slice of moon risen. Ms. Garver is driving now to the home of a Syrian family that arrived seven months ago. The mother has cooked a hot meal for the refugee family that is about to land any minute in New York, a good   drive away. Inside, where five young children zip and waddle about, the prepared meal sits in expectation on the   table: a large aluminum tray bountiful with chicken and rice and a huge bowl of salad. The oldest child, Mohamad, 14, helps Ms. Garver carry the food out to her vehicle, and she thanks him. He responds with the formality given to a new language being tried on for size. “You’re welcome,” the boy says, and smiles. Returning to the gray house, Ms. Garver fumbles in the dark to open the door while holding the tray of   food. When she returns with the salad bowl, she stoops to collect a clump of junk mail, including a   addressed to “Our Neighbor. ” Later tonight, Ms. Garver and Mr. Alfayadh will drive a Ford van to Lancaster Airport, where they will meet two representatives from the local Islamic Center. Soon after, another van will arrive from Kennedy International Airport. Hugs and handshakes will be exchanged in the December air. Luggage will be collected. And six Syrian refugees will be driven the 20 minutes to a warm home perfumed by warm food, in a city made radiant by the multicolored lights of the season.",0
18610,Pentagon Expects Mosul Push to Unlock Trove of ISIS Intelligence - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   The Pentagon is sending dozens of additional intelligence analysts to Iraq to pore over a trove of information that is expected to be recovered in the offensive to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State, data that could offer new clues about possible terrorist attacks in Europe. The analysts will have several immediate priorities: Share with the Iraqi military any information crucial to the unfolding fight in Mosul pass along insights useful to American officials planning an attack on Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital in eastern Syria hunt for clues about the location of the group’s shadowy leader, Abu Bakr   and search for any information about terrorist cells in Europe and any attacks they may be plotting. Maj. Gen. Gary J. Volesky, the commander of American ground forces in Iraq, has called Mosul the Islamic State’s Iraqi “crown jewel. ” Noting that the militants had been entrenched there for more than two years, he added on Wednesday, “Clearly, there’s going to be intelligence that will be able to be exploited. ” European intelligence and counterterrorism officials said they were eagerly awaiting data gleaned from computer hard drives, cellphones, recruiting files and other sources after Iraqi forces advance into the city in coming weeks. These officials fear an influx of foreign fighters fleeing the campaigns against Mosul and Raqqa. Information recovered from two earlier military operations against the Islamic State  —   one in eastern Syria in May 2015 and another from more recent combat in Manbij, Syria  —   gave American and allied officials trenchant insights into the Islamic State’s leadership structure and its financing and recruiting. Forces have also recovered detailed records of many of the 40, 000 fighters from more than 120 countries who have poured into Syria and Iraq to fight for the group, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. “If we get a phone off of a dead ISIL fighter in Manbij and it has a number of telephone numbers into a particular capital or city around the world, we share that information with the coalition members so that they can conduct their own investigation,” Brett H. McGurk, President Obama’s envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, said this month. “This is now really starting to work at light speed, although we want to speed it up. ” It is unclear if Islamic State leaders in Mosul will try to destroy any of their electronic or paper records before Iraqi forces and their American advisers can seize them. The Islamic State maintains prodigious and meticulous records, and it is not known if the leaders would take such a drastic step. Data is flowing out of Iraq and Syria as   within and between European governments has steadily improved since the deadly terrorism strikes in Paris and Brussels in the past year, European counterterrorism and law enforcement officials say. “A lot has changed since the attacks in Paris,” said Johan De Becker, the police chief of the western districts of Brussels, which include Molenbeek and others that were the home of the Paris and Brussels attackers. “We have made a lot of improvements on the level of national and international signaling concerning the foreign terrorist fighters. ” American officials acknowledge that they face a daunting task in gathering, analyzing and disseminating to Iraqi and Western intelligence services a collection of information from Mosul that is expected to dwarf the 20 terabytes of data retrieved so far in Manbij. One terabyte is equal to the contents of a million books. The Pentagon’s Joint Staff and the Defense Intelligence Agency have been providing intelligence support to the Iraqis for the past two years, American officials said, but there has not yet been a fight to match the size and scope of the battle to retake Mosul, where half of the city’s previous population of two million still resides. The   coalition must be able to offer intelligence support in the Mosul operation to more partner forces  —   including the Iraqi Army, counterterrorism service and police, as well as Kurdish pesh merga fighters  —   than in any previous operations to retake other cities. As a result, in the military’s most recent deployment of more than 600 additional troops, dozens of military and civilian intelligence analysts were dispatched to several locations around Iraq. Most were in place just before the Mosul offensive began, but some are still trickling in. “Whenever you liberate a city the size of Mosul, you can expect to get a tremendous amount of information,” said Col. John L. Dorrian, the chief American military spokesman in Baghdad. “Certainly, if we have a window of opportunity that presents itself rather quickly, we do have adequate forces in theater to go ahead and act upon that. ” The intelligence surge would most likely “give us a lot of insight into Daesh networks not just in Iraq and Syria, but it also gives insight into how they export terror around the world, some of the people they work with, how they finance themselves,” Colonel Dorrian said. That is important because even as the Islamic State loses its physical caliphate, or religious state, in Iraq and Syria, the group can still inflict deadly assaults, senior American counterterrorism officials say. “It’s our judgment that ISIL’s capacity and ability today to carry out attacks in Syria and Iraq and abroad has not thus far been significantly diminished,” Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told Congress last month. “The tempo of   terrorist attacks and terrorist activity in Europe and other places around the globe is a reminder of that global reach. ” “This external operations capability has been building and entrenching over the past two years,” he warned, “and we don’t think that battlefield or territorial losses alone will be sufficient to completely degrade the group’s terrorism capabilities. ”",0
18611,Diez consejos para preparar tu casa de cara a la llegada de tu primer hijo,"Diez consejos para preparar tu casa de cara a la llegada de tu primer hijo NUESTROS EXPERTOS TE ASESORAN vivienda 
El momento ha llegado. Sólo quedan unos pocos meses para que nazca vuestro hijo y tenéis que adaptar vuestro hogar ahora que vais a ser uno más. Ofrecemos unos consejos para que vuestro piso sea el sitio idóneo para vosotros y vuestro primogénito. 
1. Habitación infantil no regida por patrones patriarcales y sexistas : En lugar de pintarla de azul o rosa, mezcla los dos colores y obtendrás un violeta marronáceo francamente desagradable aunque 100% inclusivo y no discriminador. Con los juguetes puedes probar a poner un Action Man con peluca y bikini haciendo la colada y una Dora La Exploradora sosteniendo una metralleta, así el niño aprenderá a no asociar a un género concreto las labores del hogar o la violencia. 
2. Disfraza al niño de lámpara : Ciertos caseros pueden ver en un bebé un foco de problemas con los vecinos: ruidos, malos olores, llantos a altas horas de la noche… Por eso, recomendamos que durante el día sientes al bebé en una mesa y le pongas una pantalla de lámpara sobre la cabeza. Así, ante la visita inesperada del dueño del piso, podrá parecer una parte más del mobiliario doméstico. 
3. Inclúyele en el contrato de alquiler : El bebé va a disfrutar de las comodidades de vuestro hogar como cualquier otro inquilino. Por eso, es lógico que contribuya a los gastos derivados de alquiler, luz y agua. Desde luego, mientras sea menor de edad no podrá pagar su parte correspondiente, pero piensa lo bien que os vendrá en un futuro la inyección económica que os proporcionará el pago de la deuda millonaria que vuestro hijo habrá adquirido con vosotros por contrato. 
4. Vestid siempre como personajes de fantasía : Ir siempre disfrazados del Pato Donald o Bob Esponja alimentará la imaginación y la creatividad del bebé. Se llevará una gran desilusión cuando descubra que en realidad sólo sois unos funcionarios de Correos a punto de cumplir los 40, pero al menos vivirá feliz sus primeros años creyendo que su familia es especial. 
5. Instala en su móvil la app de Idealista : Vivir con tu hijo es una experiencia inigualable, pero seamos sinceros, estabais mucho más tranquilos viviendo solos. Instalad la app de Idealista en el móvil que cuelga encima de su cuna, que el niño se sienta “invitado” a buscar cuanto antes su apartamento de soltero. 
6. Esconde el porno : Trata de buscarles un sitio seguro a todas esas cintas de porno ruso, las esposas, los electrodos y el resto de juguetes que tu pareja y tú empezasteis a usar para avivar la pasión sexual que había desaparecido entre vosotros. Los niños de hoy en día nacen muy espabilados y, si lo descubriese, podría venderlo todo en el Cash Converters a la primera de cambio. 
7. Roba columpios del parque y ponlos en el salón : Es importante que los niños jueguen y se diviertan, pero nada da más pereza que llevarles al parque una fría tarde de febrero. Teniendo los columpios en casa, podréis permitiros no sacar al niño a la calle durante meses. Recomendamos que desatornilléis el columpio y lo subáis a vuestro piso de noche y siempre con el rostro cubierto si no queréis tener que leeros los consejos de nuestro artículo “Cómo cuidar a tu hijo en Alcalá Meco”. 
8. Compra calimocho : Cuando menos te lo esperes, tu hijo habrá crecido e, irremediablemente, querrá hacer botellón con sus amigos. Mejor que sea en casa en lugar de en un callejón de mala muerte y mejor con un buen vino que con un cartón de 60 céntimos. Además, un lingotazo a las botellas de vino puede ayudaros a volver a conciliar el sueño cuando el bebé os despierte a las 4 de la mañana. 
9. Fabrícale un pijama con flecos de fregona : Ya que el niño va a pasar horas y horas arrastrándose por el suelo de la casa, al menos que limpie el suelo. 
10. Llena su habitación de peluches : Si, servirán para divertir y hacer compañía al niño, pero principalmente debes de usar los peluches para esconder dentro de ellos el dinero que ganaste en el Euromillón sin que lo supiera tu pareja para gastártelo tú.",0
18612,"Comment on The Fix is In — Russia Kicked Off UN Human Rights Council, While Terrorist Saudi Arabia Re-Elected by morris","Home / Foreign Affairs / The Fix is In — Russia Kicked Off UN Human Rights Council, While Terrorist Saudi Arabia Re-Elected The Fix is In — Russia Kicked Off UN Human Rights Council, While Terrorist Saudi Arabia Re-Elected Jay Syrmopoulos October 29, 2016 1 Comment 
New York, NY – Russia lost an election to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the first time since the council’s inception in 2006 – narrowly being beaten out by Croatia – as arguably the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world, Saudi Arabia, was re-elected to the council in spite of strong condemnation from global human rights organizations. 
The 47 council seats are elected for a three-year term and regionally distributed, with staggered elections for one third of the seats every year. Russia had just completed a three-year term running against both Hungary and Croatia for the two available seats from Eastern Europe. 
After the U.S. lobbied heavily against the Russians, Hungary finished substantially ahead in the voting, with Croatia receiving 114 votes and Russia garnering only 112 votes of the 193 member countries. 
“It was a very close vote and very good countries competing, Croatia, Hungary. They are fortunate because of their size, they are not exposed to the winds of international diplomacy. Russia is very exposed. We’ve been in the UNHRC for several years, and I am sure next time we will stand and get back in,” Russia’s UN envoy Vitaly Churkin said. 
Russia will be eligible to run for a seat on the UNHRC again next year. 
Staunch U.S. ally, and renowned global terror exporter, Saudi Arabia, easily made it onto the council with 152 votes on the Asian ballot, and will represent the region alongside Iraq, Japan and China for the next three years. 
According to a report from RT : 
South Africa, Rwanda, Egypt and Tunisia were chosen from the African group, Cuba and Brazil from Latin America and the Caribbean, and the US and the UK will represent the Western bloc, which comprises Western Europe and North America. 
Over the next term, which will last between 2017 and 2019, the 14 chosen members will be tasked with formulating the UN’s official position on conflicts occurring around the world, as well as the domestic policies of member states. 
It should be noted that the U.S. is intentionally attempting to utilize the UN as a tool to forward their “aggressive Russia” narrative, thus removing Russia from the council is paramount to the American goal of labeling Russia as a human rights violator. 
A number of the worlds most prestigious non-governmental human rights organizations, have come forward to claim that the UNHRC has been hijacked by oppressive regimes (like the Saudis) looking to deflect criticism and drive their own agendas. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International produced a joint statement earlier this year condemning Saudi Arabia’s “appalling record of violations” in Yemen, where it has been accused of war crimes over the bombing of Houthi rebels — resulting in the deaths of up to 4,000 civilians. Both organizations have called for Saudi Arabia, a council member since 2006, to be suspended from the UNHRC without success. 
Exposing the rampant corruption within the UN system, just last month Saudi Arabia used its power in the council to block an outside inquiry into the Kingdom’s 157 domestic executions last year – often by beheading – while simultaneously heading a successful resolution that allowed their allies from the exiled Yemeni government to investigate numerous human rights abuses committed by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. 
Russia dismissed a petition signed by 80 NGOs, as “cynical” and “dishonorable,” and said the accusations were motivated more by politics than by concern for human rights. The groups, which included Human Rights Watch and Refugees International, asked the voting countries to “question seriously whether Russia’s role in Syria which includes supporting and undertaking military actions which have routinely targeted civilians and civilian objects renders it fit to serve on the UN’s premier inter-governmental human rights institution.” 
Make no mistake that the exclusion of the Russians from the council is a strategic move, orchestrated by the United States, as means of both marginalizing Russian influence, and stacking the deck against them in an effort to control the global narrative regarding Russia’s role as an international peacemaker. The goal is to propagandize people into buying into the “aggressive Russia” narrative continually parroted by US war hawks. 
When Saudi Arabia, a nation that beheaded twice the number of people as ISIS last year , and one of the biggest exporters of global terrorism, is on the Human Rights Council – while the Russia is summarily dismissed because they challenge the U.S. narrative in Syria – it becomes increasingly apparent that the UN is nothing more than a tool to forward U.S. empire globally.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed as hysteria speculations Russia is meddling in the election campaign in the United States. 
""On the list of phantom problems, far-fetched problems there is the ongoing hysteria - I just cannot think of another word - over Russia’s alleged influence on the course of the current presidential election,"" Putin said at a meeting of the Valdai international discussion club on Oct. 27. 
He pointed out that the United States was faced with many problems - from the mammoth federal debt to police brutality. 
""But apparently the elite has nothing to say to calm public anxiety,"" said Putin. ""It is far better to distract people’s attention with rumored Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so on and so forth. 
“Is there anyone who thinks in full seriousness that Russia is capable of influencing the choice of the American people somehow? America is not a banana republic, is it? America is a great power.""",0

18615,“Nothing Good Can Come of This Election”–and That’s Good,"
We the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption. 
The overwhelming consensus of the punditry across the political spectrum is that “Nothing Good Can Come of This Election”–and that’s a very good thing. The handwringing goes like this: The country is deeply divided by schisms that cannot be bridged, every institution from the two parties to the mainstream media to the Department of Justice has been tarnished by cover-ups, collusion or worse; whomever wins the election will enter the presidency without a mandate, and so on.
Why is “nothing good can come of this” good? Because ridding the nation of its political corruption will require hitting bottom. 
Just as an alcoholic or drug addict is incapable of making any truly positive changes until he/she hits absolute bottom, so it is with our tolerance of a corrupt political system that is poisoning the nation, one injection of corrupt cash, collusion and pay-to-play at a time.
If our rotten-to-the-core politics as usual is indeed flying off the cliff to complete destruction, that is an unalloyed good. 
Just as alcoholics continue down their self-destructive path with the aid of enablers, so too has the corrupt political order expanded with the aid of the Mainstream Media, insiders in the Department of Justice, K Street lobbyists and a veritable army of well-paid lackeys, pundits, academics, apparatchiks and assorted toadies in the organs of governance and in the big-money private sector and philanthro-capitalist dynasties of pay-to-play foundations.
The only way anything will truly change in the political order is if every Establishment insider politico loses every election, from the presidency to dogcatcher. Nothing will change until the mere existence of a private foundation like the Clinton Foundation triggers a landslide loss for the politico with ties to such corruption.
Nothing will change until the collusion of the mainstream media (supplying the insider candidate with debate questions, etc.) alone causes the colluding candidate to lose by a landslide.
Nothing will change until candidates who refuse to accept any donation larger than $100 from anyone or any entity beat the Goldman Sachs/Saudi prince-funded insider candidates by a landslide.
Nothing will change until candidates who fund costly negative TV advertising campaigns with millions in pay-to-play “contributions” from Goldman Sachs et al. lose by a landslide.
You get the point: we the citizens and voters have to stop being enablers of systemic corruption. We have to stop being bamboozled by insiders with promises of “hope and change” and the usual negative TV blitzes funded by corrupt big money.
It’s easy to blame lax campaign laws or the corrupted candidates and their insider toadies, but ultimately we’re responsible for enabling corruption, collusion, pay-for-play and a political and financial Elite that’s above the law. 
From the point of view of the corrupted, colluding insiders, MSM flunkies, Department of Justice lackeys and well-paid parrot-pundits, nothing good can come from this election because half the voters may actually cast off the shackles of the nation’s corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites. 
This mass rejection of the politics as usual of corrupt and corrupting political and financial Elites is the highest possible good –a public good that eludes the hand-wringing corrupt insiders, pundits and toadies who have sucked up fortunes from the trough of putrid systemic corruption.

18616,Media Meltdown Over Breitbart Expansion,"The mainstream media’s reaction to Breitbart News’ expanded influence has run the gamut from bewildered hostility to turgid hysteria, and not much in between. [Media sites are struggling to frame the news of Breitbart’s recent high profile hires, plans to open new bureaus in Europe, and the departure of former Breitbart employees to work in the Trump White House. We summarize their findings here for the amusement of our 45 million unique monthly readers.  First up, the Washington Post is upset that Breitbart is not racist. While falsely labeling us an “ ” site, the Washington Post’s Callum Borchers speculates on Breitbart’s future in an article titled: “How Breitbart could lose its   street cred. ” The Post moans: “Breitbart has, in fact, looked increasingly mainstream since Election Day. ” After weeks of disingenuously associating us with “white supremacists,” “white nationalists,” and “” the Post appears frustrated to learn that we’re not cross burners after all. But, of course, the Post couches their disappointment by feigning concern for our “street cred. ” If we “go mainstream,” the Post warns that we “risk alienating readers who were drawn to the website because it seemed to be by and for outsiders. ” When reached for comment, Breitbart senior management thanked the Post for the warning and shared the following image from Alexa. com’s top US website rankings: The Atlantic’s Rosie Gray claims we’re trying “to go Mainstream. ” She describes Breitbart News as a “scrappy, outsider publication” that “has never enjoyed this much prominence —  but it’s discovering that success brings its own challenges. ” Like the Washington Post, Gray expresses concern that the more Breitbart “becomes part of the mainstream, the more its outsider cred is threatened. ” Ironically, Gray mocked Breitbart just a few days ago for running an oversized headline framing Trump’s inaugural address as  : Breitbart going with the   font pic. twitter.   —   Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) January 20, 2017,  When reached for comment, Breitbart senior management thanked the Atlantic for its concern and shared the following image from Alexa. com’s top US website rankings: Meanwhile, Salon labels Breitbart News a “fringe news site” and “  propaganda organ. ” Salon’s Gary Legum writes that the recent White House hiring of former Breitbart employees ranks high on the list of the “many tragedies   …     set in motion by the nascent Donald Trump administration. ” And as a “fake news” bonus, Salon used a headline photo purporting to show the former Breitbart employees who left to join the Trump White House. They included an image of former Breitbart Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, former Breitbart Senior National Security Editor Sebastian Gorka, and a woman they claim is former Breitbart reporter Julia Hahn. Breitbart    Alexander Marlow, when reached for comment, said, “Scoreboard. Oh, and I have no idea who that woman is. ” Legum describes in lurid detail the horrors of “a fully   White House”: With Bannon in the West Wing, it was inevitable that the administration would bring in a few of the propagators of the racist, isolationist, nativist swill that over the last few years has made Breitbart the   “news” site for the sort of white people who berate Mexican restaurants for printing their menus in Spanish. But even recognizing the likelihood that Bannon would poach some of his former employees was not enough preparation for the   ugliness we will likely hear on a daily basis from a fully   White House. We offer no comment about “  ugliness,” but Breitbart National Security Editor Frances Martel, when reached for comment, said this about the Mexican restaurant menus: Ojalá que tenga razón Salon que los americanos que no hablan español le estén dando tanto negocio a los restaurantes mexicanos, porque la comida mexicana es deliciosa (aunque, claro, no mejor que la cubana). The Associated Press  —   the mainstay of establishment journalism  —   is perhaps understandably miffed that Breitbart is now treated with the same respect as their own hallowed organization at White House press briefings. Two weeks ago, they offered a snarky aside that only Breitbart got a reserved seat at Trump’s January 11 presser. “Other reporters scrambled to save their seats. Reporters shouted and waved their arms at Trump to get his attention, rather than the president calling on questioners from a list, as is often the practice,” the AP sniffed. Breitbart CEO Larry Solov was unavailable for comment.",0
18618,"DuPont freezes payments to pension plan for 13,000 employees","Council approves cleanup funding 
Current retirees’ pensions and health care benefits will not be affected. 
DuPont says it hopes to save $550 million over the years by freezing those pensions. It says it also will stop giving future retiree health benefits to staff currently younger than age 50, saving an additional $50 million. 
The Wilmington, Del.-based pesticides and materials maker, which employs about 50,000 after spinning off such companies as Axalta and Chemours in recent years and laying off 5,000 management, research, and other staff last winter, says it has followed Lockheed, Johnson Controls and other large manufacturers in switching workers from guaranteed pensions to 401(k) savings plans, whose value rises and falls with the investment markets. 
In 2007, DuPont stopped adding new hires to the pension plan. It continued to boost promised benefits to plan members still working at the company. 
Since then, it has assigned new workers to 401(k) retirement plans. Instead of guaranteeing pensions whose value rises with years of service, the company pays the equivalent of up to 9 percent of employees’ salaries into investment accounts if they set aside up to 6 percent of their pay. 
Workers put that money into funds from a menu of investments, in hopes they can stretch the tax-protected accounts, plus Social Security, to pay their way in retirement. 
The freeze will take place in 2018 if the company stays on schedule to complete its planned merger with Dow Chemical Co. and split into separate pesticide, materials and specialized-products manufacturing companies, according to spokesman Daniel Turner. 
Turner said the freeze was not connected to the Dow deal. Under CEO Edward Breen, DuPont has been cutting jobs, closing plants and consolidating vendors in an effort to boost profits and streamline operations in advance of the reorganization. 
“Sadly, the ongoing cash buyout of 18,000 vested pensioners and today’s action to end pension accruals and health benefits project a company with little concern for those who have stayed with the company in order to build security for their families in the future,” Lawrence Craig Skaggs, a retired DuPont lobbyist, told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 
Since the Dow merger was announced in 2015, Skaggs has posted details and questions concerning DuPont retirement issues at his 6,300-member DuPont Pensioners Facebook site. 
“We remain concerned that the DuPont pension plan,” which covers 133,000 current workers and retirees, “is less than 70 percent funded,” Skaggs added, citing Labor Department reports. 
Retirees have been pressing DuPont and Dow to put more assets into retirement plans before they divide the companies, to ensure the plans remain solvent. 
Pensioners in corporate plans that run out of cash typically are rescued by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which imposes limits on early retirement and payments above insured levels. 
Earlier this year, DuPont offered some retirees who are not yet collecting pensions the options of taking their money in lump-sum payments, or replacing their pensions with insurance annuities, backed against loss by state insurance guaranty funds. Recommended for you",0
18619,Review: ‘Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk’: Ang Lee’s Super-High-Definition Take on the Iraq War - The New York Times,"In 2004, George W. Bush was in the White House, Beyoncé was in Destiny’s Child and more than 100, 000 American troops were in Iraq. Whether or not this could be called a more innocent time, innocence is the central idea  —   the premise, the moral, the scarlet letter and the white whale  —   of “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk,” which takes place in that    year. Directed by Ang Lee and adapted from Ben Fountain’s novel, a National Book Award finalist in 2012, the movie is dominated by the baby blues and shy smile of its title character, an Army specialist from a small town in Texas. Billy (Joe Alwyn) and the other surviving members of Bravo Company, having endured a hellish firefight in Iraq, find themselves in equally surreal if less perilous circumstances back in the U. S. A. where they have been conscripted into the halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day professional football game. They are warmly applauded for their service and also callously exploited, fodder for a spectacle that collapses the difference between patriotic sentiment and gross commercialism. The audience’s attention swivels back and forth between the theater of battle and the arena of American   pop culture, pausing for quieter moments backstage, in the barracks and at Billy’s childhood home. A genial kid  —   he’s all of 19, and still a virgin  —   with a friendly manner and an understated sense of humor, Billy is the kind of person everyone seems to like. The officers in charge of his unit, the sarcastic taskmaster Dime (Garrett Hedlund) and the mystical warrior Shroom (Vin Diesel) regard him with   fondness. He is popular with the other men, especially Montoya (whose nickname is Mango). Something about him inspires special devotion from his sister Kathryn (Kristen Stewart) and catches the eye of a cheerleader named Faison (Makenzie Leigh). That’s a lot of people, and I haven’t even mentioned Albert (Chris Tucker) the movie guy who is trying to sell the story of the Bravos to Hollywood, or Norm Oglesby (Steve Martin) the Texas real estate mogul and   owner who is the Bravos’ host. Billy’s dealings with everyone  —   earnest conversations punctuated by flurries of boyish banter and bursts of intense action  —   give the movie a pleasantly hectic rhythm, but also thin out its emotions. The book is propelled by the breakneck velocity and scattershot jokiness of Mr. Fountain’s prose, but neither frenzy nor insouciance is exactly Mr. Lee’s speed. He is an elegant, contemplative filmmaker, observing strong emotions with a careful balance of sympathy and detachment. And even the chaos of combat and the circus inside the stadium have a choreographed, almost serene quality. You are not immersed in Billy’s world or his consciousness, but floating through them, with your eyes and ears open for small, significant details. There are enough of these to make watching “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” absorbing. The clarity of the digital cinematography (by John Toll) and the precision of the production design (by Mark Friedberg) incite a hundred small acts of noticing, and the script (by   Castelli) is attentive to the book’s cacophony of idioms. The movie is being released in two forms: a      version with an accelerated frame rate in a couple of theaters and a more conventional version everywhere else. The   edition, which was screened at the New York Film Festival, is a fascinating failed experiment, an attempt to bring Billy’s drama to life with unprecedented immediacy that falls into an uncanny valley between cinema and virtual reality. The images are, somewhat paradoxically, so   that their artificiality becomes more pronounced you feel as if you’re sitting uncomfortably close to the costumed holograms of famous actors. In more traditional moviegoing conditions the paradox runs in the other direction. The smoothness of the camerawork and the deliberateness of the dialogue make “Billy Lynn” feel more like a filmed play than an adapted novel, despite the verisimilitude of the settings. The acting, in   and medium shots, has a studied, stagy quality. Too often, you can hear the writing when the actors speak. But the median quality of both the writing and the acting is pretty high. Ms. Stewart, in just a few scenes, proves once again that she is one of the most interesting screen actresses of her generation, and you may wish that more of the movie was about Kathryn. It is a pleasure to encounter Mr. Diesel in his   mode, and to be in the peppery presence of the underrated Mr. Hedlund. And also to witness Mr. Lee’s ability to serve the ideas of a literary source. “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is about the gulf that separates modern soldiers from their noncombatant fellow citizens, a rift that is the subject of books like Phil Klay’s “Redeployment” and Sebastian Junger’s “Tribe. ” The film is also, like Mr. Lee’s “Brokeback Mountain,” about love among men. The bonds in this case are comradely rather than erotic, but they are no less deep for that reason, and are stronger than anything else, including patriotism, family loyalty and heterosexual romance. This is not exactly a rare   notion, but “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” explores it with gentleness rather than sentimental bombast. The satire may be a little too gentle, but there is something disarmingly tender about the way Mr. Lee dramatizes young Billy’s predicament. You may be surprised at how sweet this movie is and also, in retrospect, startled by how bleak its vision turns out to be. “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for bloody combat, profanity and sexual longing. Running time: 1 hour 52 minutes.",0

18626,Inside John Calipari’s Media Empire - The New York Times,"LEXINGTON, Ky.  —   John Calipari, residue from that morning’s Ash Wednesday service smudged on his forehead, unbound his iPad’s leather case and showed a visiting reporter its gleaming   desktop. “It’s never off,” he said. “Because I don’t know how to turn it off. ” Calipari, 58, Kentucky’s successful and controversial basketball coach, does not have a computer in his office overlooking the Wildcats’ practice gym. He does not know how to post Facebook updates or messages on Twitter. He does not, he said, even use email. Yet Calipari, whose résumé at Kentucky includes four Final Fours, a national championship and a No. 2 seed in this year’s N. C. A. A.   tournament, is the driving force behind several powerful media platforms  —   including a Twitter account with more than a million followers, a website and a popular weekly podcast. Collectively, these serve as a permanent branding campaign, a public record of his thoughts and actions, and a   mechanism for one of the sports world’s most   and polarizing personalities. “We’re going to give out our message,” Calipari said this month, “but they’re also going to be able to see who I am, who my friends are, what I do, what I read  —   and it’s not filtered through anybody. ” Calipari has long sought to connect directly with fans and showcase his boisterous personality, said David R. Scott, the   of Calipari’s 2009 book, “Bounce Back,” and the founding editor of Calipari’s website, CoachCal. com. In an earlier era, Scott said, those connections were forged in   interactions he recalled that Calipari, while coaching at the University of Massachusetts, delivered pizza to students waiting in line before games. New technology has allowed Calipari to do the same type of thing, only on a much grander scale. “His major was marketing,” said Scott, now a senior director in communications at ESPN, “and he’s used it every day of his life. ” The internet and social media have eliminated the costs of printing and distribution, making anyone a potential publisher. From political campaigns to corporations to celebrities, organizations or individuals that in the past depended on traditional media outlets for their messaging now communicate directly with voters, consumers and fans. This autonomy is especially crucial for Calipari, who stands atop perhaps the most   college sports program this side of Alabama football who seeks a prominent public profile, at least partly to aid the   endeavor of recruiting and who in the past, he acknowledges, has been fitted with the “black hat. ” Notoriety and negative coverage have long trailed Calipari, a Hall of Fame coach known for his brash personality and disruptive methods, along with his teams’ consistent success. The N. C. A. A. vacated his Final Four runs with two previous teams, UMass and Memphis, and it takes only a few keystrokes to find someone criticizing his embrace of the   “  ” strategy  —   recruiting talented prospects who expressly aspire to enter the N. B. A. after a single season in college. While in the past, Calipari said, he could not effectively combat reports or columns that cast him or his team in a bad light, that is no longer true. “In the old days, you had to wait,” said Calipari, describing how he would respond to slights or what he viewed as misinformation earlier in his career. “You can get on a day later on the radio, but it’s too late. It’s already singed in their mind. ” Today  —   with the aid of   staff members in Kentucky’s sports information and image operations, who transcribe and publish the thoughts and musings of the   coach  —   things are different. “Now,” he said, “I can respond in 30 seconds. ” Calipari does not eschew traditional media availabilities, and even cooperated on a forthcoming ESPN documentary about his career. But his own megaphone is a big one. Calipari’s Twitter account has three times as many followers as the main one for Kentucky’s basketball program. More than 500, 000 people follow his Facebook feed, and a   track his posts on Instagram. Then there is CoachCal. com. It is not  —   like some other coach websites  —   a sleepy venue for occasional videos and links to articles posted elsewhere. Instead, it is an     source for news, with its own de facto beat writer, Metz Camfield, and a certain, if limited, amount of exclusive access. (While the site is branded with Calipari’s image, it is owned by JMI Sports, Kentucky’s multimedia rights holder.) The site also has a personal blog with Calipari’s reflections on his team’s progress, celebrations of mentors and, of course, rebuttals to criticism. The newest addition to Calipari Inc. is Cal Cast  —   Calipari’s podcast, a breakout by a major active coach. After only three months and 15 episodes, it has more than a million listens. Calipari has hosted fellow coaches, businessmen, basketball commentators and his good friend Drake. (His dream guest is another clamorous, technologically challenged   media machine according to Calipari, President Trump told a journalist whom Calipari declined to identify that he was open to appearing on the program.) All of these endeavors push a daily dose of the gospel according to Calipari. Wondering whether he truly cares about his players? A recent Instagram photograph showed the stat sheet that Calipari said he receives daily, detailing how his alumni are faring in the N. B. A. Want to know his philosophy? A “Recruiting Manifesto” emphasized Calipari’s “ ” approach (foreshadowing “Players First,” one of two books Calipari has written with the writer Michael Sokolove in the last three years). Skeptical that he is following N. C. A. A. rules? A     rundown last year reminded readers that Calipari’s squads have among the highest graduation success rates of top teams. A case study in how Calipari can bypass the traditional news media came amid the firestorm that erupted after a 2014 Yahoo report that Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski had used his perch as U. S. A. Basketball’s head coach to recruit high school prospects. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, then a Team U. S. A. assistant, said in response that Calipari had complained about the arrangement and added that Calipari’s protests seemed disingenuous since he had coached the Dominican Republic’s team  —   a job that might have helped secure the commitment of the star prospect   Towns. One day after Boeheim’s comments ran on Syracuse. com, Calipari, after appearing to respond via a snarky Twitter post, took to CoachCal. com to tell the world that he had called Boeheim (“We are friends”) to praise Krzyzewski’s stewardship of U. S. A. Basketball and to say he did not “begrudge” any potential recruiting advantage. Years later, Krzyzewski appeared as the guest on Cal Cast’s second episode. Calipari gushed about Krzyzewski’s triumphs with the national team, and the coaches bonded over their   boyhoods and their affinity for legendary coaches. “Everybody’s going to be stunned,” Calipari said, “that we just talked for 30 minutes. ” Was it benign sincerity? Did Calipari have ulterior motives for staying on the good sides of U. S. A. Basketball and Krzyzewski? Either or both might be true  —   this month, U. S. A. Basketball announced that Calipari would coach the    national team. But Calipari’s public stance was probably delivered more cleanly and persuasively than it would have been even through a   with a friendly reporter. “It enables him to put his version of the story out exactly the way he wants to, as sanitized or unfiltered as he cares to,” said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia Journalism School professor. Calipari’s credibility is buttressed by all the things he publishes that have no obvious utility, whether it is a tribute to his family’s late German shepherd or CoachCal. com’s stream of updates on the team, written mostly by Camfield, a former Kentucky journalism major. Even the sponsor announcements Calipari reads during Cal Cast are disarmingly genuine, most of all the Blue Apron spots in which Calipari’s wife, Ellen, describes some delicious meal she has just cooked for her husband. Jerry Tipton, the longtime Lexington   basketball beat reporter, said that Calipari’s platforms had an unavoidable bias. “Cal talks about ‘no filters,’ which is fine,” Tipton said, “except it has the biggest filter of all: Coach Cal. ” But Calipari disputed this characterization. “It isn’t filter,” he said. “It’s transparent. ” “I’m not perfect, I’m a sinner  —   that’s why I’ve got my ash on my head,” Calipari said. But, he continued, “there were so many coaches in the old days that were painted with black hats, and there were guys painted with white hats that should have had black hats on. ” “I’m not trying to write my legacy  —   someone else will write my legacy,” he added. “But what I am is, I’m transparent, and you are not writing my legacy. ”",0
18627,"Police Use Surveillance Tool to Scan Social Media, A.C.L.U. Says - The New York Times","A Chicago company has marketed a tool using text, photos and videos gleaned from major social media companies to aid law enforcement surveillance of protesters, civil liberties activists say. The company, called Geofeedia, used data from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, as well as nine other social media networks, to let users search for social media content in a specific location, as opposed to searching by words or hashtags that would be less likely to reveal an exact location. Geofeedia marketed its abilities to law enforcement agencies and has signed up more than 500 such clients, according to an email obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. In one document posted by the organization, as part of a report released on Tuesday, the company appears to point to how officials in Baltimore, with Geofeedia’s help, were able to monitor and respond to the violent protests that broke out after Freddie Gray died in police custody in April 2015. Geofeedia appears to have used programs that Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies offered that allow app makers or advertising companies to create   tools, like ways for publishers to see where their stories are being shared on social media. Facebook, Twitter and Instagram say they have cut off Geofeedia’s access to their information. But civil liberties advocates criticized the companies for lax oversight and challenged them to create better mechanisms to monitor how their data is being used. “These platforms should be doing more to protect the free speech rights of activists of color,” Matt Cagle, a lawyer with the A. C. L. U. in Northern California, said in an interview. “When they open their feeds to companies that market surveillance products, they risk putting their users in harm’s way. ” Instagram and Facebook terminated Geofeedia’s access to their data in September, while Twitter shut off access on Tuesday. The response from the companies suggested that Geofeedia was using data from the companies in a way that was not allowed under their developer agreements. Jodi Seth, director of policy communications at Facebook, said that Geofeedia had access to data that had been made public on the social network, and that access was subject to the limitations in its platform policy. That policy asks developers to “provide a publicly available and easily accessible privacy policy that explains what data you are collecting and how you will use that data. ” It also asks that they “obtain adequate consent from people before using any Facebook technology that allows us to collect and process data about them. ” Twitter said that based on the information found by the A. C. L. U. it was “immediately suspending Geofeedia’s commercial access to Twitter data. ” Phil Harris, chief executive of Geofeedia, said in a statement that his company “provides some clients, including law enforcement officials across the country, with a critical tool in helping to ensure public safety while protecting civil rights and liberties. ” He said the firm has policies to prevent “inappropriate use of our software. ” Mr. Harris added that the company understands that given how quickly digital technology changes, Geofeedia “must continue to work to build on these critical protections of civil rights. ” In addition to law enforcement agencies, the company has marketed its services to journalists as a way to find people at breaking news events for interviews and social media content. The New York Times used Geofeedia on a trial basis, but has not had access since 2015. The A. C. L. U. said it first learned about the agreements with Geofeedia from responses to public records requests to 63 law enforcement agencies in California. Those records, the organization said, revealed a significant expansion of social media surveillance. “Posts on social media platforms can reveal information about our location, our religion, the people we associate with,” Mr. Cagle said. “Users of social media websites do not expect or want the government to be monitoring this information. And users should not be at risk of being branded a risk to public safety simply for speaking their mind on social media. ”",0
18628,Clinton campaign blames FBI director for loss to Trump,"Politics FBI Director James Comey (AFP file photo) 
Hillary Clinton’s top advisers blame FBI Director James Comey for the Democrat’s bruising loss to President-elect Donald Trump. 
Navin Nayak, the head of the Clinton campaign’s opinion research division, sent an email to senior staffers Thursday, outlining “early signals” as to why the candidate lost the November 8 presidential election, POLITICO reported on Friday. 
“We believe that we lost this election in the last week,” said Nayak’s email, which was published by POLITICO. “ Comey’s letter in the last 11 days of the election both helped depress our turnout and also drove away some of our critical support among college-educated white voters — particularly in the suburbs.” 
“We also think Comey’s 2nd letter, which was intended to absolve Sec. Clinton, actually helped to bolster Trump’s turnout,” he continued. 
The letter also highlighted several other challenges the Clinton team faced throughout the campaign, including a desire for change after two terms by a Democratic president and the reluctance of some Americans to vote for a female candidate.

Despite those challenges, Nayak said, Clinton was on course to win until the last week, when “everything changed"" and the momentum began to shift in favor of Trump. 
“Voters who decided in the last week broke for Trump by a larger margin (42-47). These numbers were even more exaggerated in the key battleground states,” he said. 
The FBI director angered Democrats late in October by announcing in a letter to Congress that the agency had uncovered new emails connected to the Clinton email investigation. 
Just over a week later, Comey notified Congress that Clinton would not face charges over the newly discovered messages. 
Nayak said Comey’s letters encouraged Trump supporters and depressed the turnout for Clinton on Election Day. 
“There is no question that a week from Election Day, Sec. Clinton was poised for a historic win. In the end, less than 110K votes out of tens of millions cast on Election Day made the difference in this race,” he wrote. 
“In the end,” Nayak concluded, “late breaking developments in the race proved one hurdle too many for us to overcome.” 
Clinton had been leading Trump throughout the campaign in most of the polls except for the last week of the election when she lost ground to Trump.",0
