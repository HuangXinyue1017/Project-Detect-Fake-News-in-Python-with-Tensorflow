8517, Trevor Noah Roasts Jeb Bush’s Pathetically Desperate Effort To Remain A Viable Candidate (VIDEO),"If Jeb Bush watched The Daily Show last night, he should finally throw in the towel before he embarrasses himself and his family even more than he has already.On Monday night, Trevor Noah torched George W. Bush s brother in a hilarious segment that began with Noah referring to Jeb as the most desperate candidate in the presidential field. He s so desperate, he s even released his own fragrance for men,  Noah quipped. Dubbed  Desperation by Jeb!,  Noah promoted the scent as being  for when being yourself just isn t enough.  He then took a whiff and laughingly remarked,  Smells like George Bush. But it got even worse for Jeb from there.Noah reported that Bush and his supporters have spent more money on ads than anyone else, but that for all of the $40 million spent on positive ads telling voters about Bush, it has resulted in zero returns.This is a private admission from advisers to Jeb s own SuperPAC, Right To Rise. Even a Bush supporter was embarrassed by the results, exclaiming that,  You might as well light all of this money on fire. An amused Noah pointed out that it s pretty messed up when your campaign spending is failing so bad that burning the money would have been just as useful. That would have been more effective for Jeb Bush because at least people would have gathered around him for the warmth of the fire. People notice a fire. They don t notice Jeb Bush. The money could have been put to better use by building a new water system for Flint, Michigan, Noah added.Instead, Bush spent a lot of the money on video mailers featuring a Bush documentary that were actually mailed to his supporters and potential voters, something that Noah found to be such a huge waste of money that he was rendered speechless for a few seconds before regaining his composure to nail Jeb with another zinger. Poor Jeb, he s so desperate for his videos to go viral he s willing to physically mail them to your house. Still, Jeb Bush hadn t reached the bottom of the desperation pot.Noah then revealed that Bush had enlisted his mother to appear in an ad touting him as the one candidate who  seems  to be able to solve the country s problems. The Daily Show host noted that Jeb s own mom didn t sound sold on her son s qualifications as presidential material. It s like a guy getting his mom to hit people up on Tinder for him,  he said, which led to a video clip showing an exchange between Bush and a voter. Bush asked the voter who she is voting for. After she replied that she  didn t know yet,  Bush responded,  Oh, come on. And thus a new campaign slogan was born.Here s the video via Comedy Central.Seriously, Jeb. Do America a favor and put yourself out of our misery. It s probably the only thing you can do that people will support.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
8518," Fox News Responds To Trump’s Hissy Fit Over Megyn Kelly, And He’s Not Going To Like It","If there s one thing about Donald Trump that pretty much everyone knows by now, it s that he s never wrong. Well, at least according to Donald Trump. He ll never admit a mistake, he ll double down on controversial statements, and heaven forbid he s asked a question he doesn t want to answer, or even worse, challenged on an answer on live television. The latter is exactly what Megyn Kelly did in the first GOP debate, and oh boy, has that thrown Trump into full tantrum mode, especially finding out she ll be moderating the next GOP debate to be held on Fox News. He literally told CNN s Wolf Blitzer: I mean, I don t like her. She doesn t treat me fairly. So, in turn, Trump is threatening to boycott the next debate because he thinks Kelly is a meanie.Trump even took his sophomoric toddler behavior to Twitter and Instagram and polled his followers:Should I do the #GOPdebate? https://t.co/cjTywwIl85  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2016 Should I do the #GOPdebate?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Jan 26, 2016 at 10:04am PSTAll of this led Fox News to issue a reply that was absolutely accurate. Probably one of the few times they ve said something that is completely true. A network spokesperson said: Sooner or later Donald Trump, even if he s president, is going to have to learn that he doesn t get to pick the journalists   we re very surprised he s willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly. They basically called Trump out for being terrified of Megyn Kelly. If he s terrified during a debate because he s asked questions he doesn t completely fancy, how is he going to deal with leaders around the globe who would inevitably call him out all the time for the decisions he would make as Commander-in-Chief?Fox also told Mediaite is a statement that was pure gold: We learned from a secret back channel that the Ayatollah and Putin both intend to treat Donald Trump unfairly when they meet with him if he becomes president   a nefarious source tells us that Trump has his own secret plan to replace the Cabinet with his Twitter followers to see if he should even go to those meetings. Fox News had the perfect response to Trump s hissy fit over Megyn Kelly moderating the next debate. If you desire to be leader of the free world, you re going to have to realize people aren t going to kowtow to your every whim, and bullying really isn t an option with diplomatic relations. Trump needs to grow the f*ck up.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8519, BUSTED: Declassified Memo Shows Rumsfeld’s Lies About WMDs Were Worse Than We Thought,"By now, we re all fairly certain that we ve seen enough evidence to in the very least convict the major players of the Dubya administration of lying to the American people about Saddam Hussein s Iraq. There were no weapons of mass destruction; of that we are sure.We re sure, the people who went looking are sure, even the CIA is sure. The only people who aren t sure are the top ranking members of the Bush administration; George Bush, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. While they seem to admit that they were wrong about WMDs in Iraq, they refuse to admit they made a mistake invading Iraq over the issue because it was the  best information  they had at the time.A newly declassified document is shedding some light on those claims. In a memo written by Donald Rumsfeld himself to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the former Secretary of Defense wrote,  Please take a look at this material as to what we don t know about WMD. It is big. The memo wasn t about what we knew about the alleged Iraqi weapons programs, but rather what we didn t know. As it turns out, we didn t know diddly squat. The report stated:Basically, just before the Bush administration made their case for war, they knew very little about what was actually going on. That translated to the doom and gloom reporting to the American people by their leaders that a maniac had most definitely acquired nuclear, chemical and/or biological weapons that could be used against the US or its interests.While an article in Politico points out that Rumsfeld was under no legal obligation to disclose the classified memo or its contents, it is only fair to note that he and his bosses opted instead to send Colin Powell to the UN for the infamous speech full of lies that gained the support of the United Kingdom and a coalition of nations.The memo proves that we were going to war no matter what. They weren t fed bad information. They didn t push America off that cliff and into another ground war because they thought they knew what Iraq was hiding. They jumped off because they knew exactly what they didn t know, and even that pointed to a country far less dangerous than the one they sold the American people.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
8520," Wealthy Teen Gets Homeless Man To Pour Coffee Over Himself For $5, Then Karma Calls (VIDEO)","A New Jersey teenager thought it would be funny to pay a homeless man $5 to pour coffee over himself. But after the story went viral, the homeless man is now being crowdfunded out of poverty, and that teen is facing the consequences of his actions.65-year-old Ronald Leggatt has been facing the east coast ice storms from a vantage point that most of us couldn t even imagine. While people shiver next to fires in their homes, Leggatt is on the streets, in sub-zero temperatures. Surviving each day is a miracle.On Monday, he was approached by a local teen. He might have hoped for some kind words, or some cash towards extra clothing or food.Instead, the teen offered the desperate man $5 to pour coffee over his own head. So he obliged. 22-year-old local Carlos Mejia posted images of the incident to Facebook, saying: At first I thought it was an act of kindness but I was wrong, The poor man s eyes and face were red because of the burning coffee, In the image, the teen can be seen shaking the hand of a clearly injured Leggatt.After Mejia s post went viral, Lakewood Police investigated the incident and verified that it did take place. But sadly, no charges can be filed against the teen. They said in a statement: After further investigation it was determined, that although the incident occurred in poor judgement, it did not rise to a criminal act, Evidence in the case revealed that both parties were willing participants and no one was injured. But the local community were so outraged by the incident, that they located Ronald Leggatt and decided to provide him with as much assistance as they could muster. First, they got his hair cut, provided him with a decent washroom, and bought him new clothes.They then set up a crowd fund campaign to provide reparations to Leggatt in behalf of the entire community. More than $3,000 has already been raised to help get Laggatt back on his feet.Ari Boyer, a Lakewood resident, told the New York Daily News: The truth is that I saw the thing on Facebook and thought it was a horrible thing to do, I just don t like to see people hurt. Leggatt is almost unrecognizable in his new clothes, clean and trim.But while Laggatt s life has turned around, the teen who abused him in his hour of need has been shamed publicly. So excruciating was the embarrassment, he made a video apology for Ronald Leggatt, offering him $20 and to pour coffee over his own head.Laggatt politely declined the offer.The case is a reminder of the very worst, and the very best, any community of human beings has to offer. Thank goodness that the better angels of Lakewood came together to stand for Ronald Leggatt.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",0
8521, Clinton Skewers GOP Candidates After Muslim Vet Asks Her An Emotional Question (VIDEO),"Last night during the Democratic Presidential Town Hall in Iowa, Democratic presidential candidate absolutely skewered the 2016 Republican candidates for their  dangerous  rhetoric.Clinton s fiery rant against the GOP came as a response to Islamic Air Force veteran Erum Tariq-Munir, who asked a question that no parent in America should ever have to wonder, but it s completely understandable now that the far-right is upping the crazy. Noting the rising Islamophobia in the country, Tariq-Munir asked: As a mother of three young children, as an American Muslim, how can I make sure that this country is the best place on earth to raise my family? Clinton paused and thanked Tariq-Munir for her service before launching into an attack against the people most responsible for the growing bigotry in the United States. Once she got going, the former Secretary of State couldn t hold back, allowing disgust and anger to flow freely.While Clinton s criticism was intended for all GOP contenders, front-runner Donald Trump was singled out specifically. Clinton admitted that  one of the most distressing  parts of the 2016 campaign has been hearing the Republican party s offensive, bigotry-fueled rhetoric. Visibly upset and disturbed by what this coming election has revealed so far about America s conservatives, Clinton said: One of the most disturbing aspects of this campaign has been the language of Republican candidates, particularly their frontrunner, that insults, demeans, denigrates different people. I found it particularly harmful the way [Trump] has talked about Muslims.It s not only shameful and offensive, which it is   I think it s dangerous   We cannot tolerate this. We must stand up and say,  Every person in this country deserves to be treated with respect. Once she was content that she d ripped the GOP enough, Clinton tied Tariq-Munir s question to foreign policy. She said: We need a coalition that includes Muslim nations to defeat ISIS and it s pretty hard to figure out how you re going to make a coalition with the very nations you need if you spend your time insulting their religion! Later on, Clinton solidified her position as a great presidential candidate, demonstrating an amount of poise and class that her GOP rivals would have never been able to pull off. She said: I want to be the president for everyone, and I believe that is exactly what any president should do. You can watch Clinton s passionate response below:Standing up against the GOP is now something that comes naturally to Clinton. Time after time, she demonstrates that she will stand up for ALL Americans   not just the rich white ones.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot",0
8522, Kansas Republicans Try To Add ‘Gun Dealers’ To List Of Protected Classes Like Race And Gender,"Thanks to a repeal of a long-standing law in 2015, Kansas currently doesn t have discrimination protection on the basis of sexual orientation, but rather than rectify that blot on the state s reputation, Republicans are focusing on a group that s a bit closer to home: The hapless gun dealer.In a new bill, astounding in its sheer audacity, Republicans want to  ban discrimination  against gun dealers and manufacturers. In short, they wish to make the sellers of firearms a protected class like those of race, gender and religion.As the Wichita Eagle reports:The bill, titled the Kansas Firearms Industry Nondiscrimination Act, is scheduled for a Thursday hearing by the Senate Committee on Federal and State Affairs. The proposal would function similarly to laws that prevent religious or racial discrimination and allow gun dealers to sue in cases where they felt discriminated against.As one might expect, the bill is in direct response to something conservatives believe about Obama but isn t actually true. (Newsflash: Obama isn t coming for your guns.) The bill s architect, Sen. Jacob LaTurner (R-Of Course) made that clear when he said this was a way to protect gun dealers from the federal government s tyranny.LaTurner said his bill is  intended to give these folks an avenue to push back  and would  give the firearm industry the ability to get some protection against this incredible overreach by our president. Republicans have long floated the conspiracy theory that Obama is attempting to destroy gun businesses by making banks scared to do business with them. The  Jade Helm  of this particular fantasy is a 2013 initiative done by the U.S. justice department called  Operation Choke Point.  Like Jade Helm, the procedure was completely innocent, meant to block fraudsters from accessing bank accounts, but tin foil hat wearing gun enthusiasts see signs of something more sinister. At issue appears to be the fact that since Operation Choke Point deals with overseeing banking operations, now, any time a gun dealer gets rejected for a bank loan for any number of reasons, they blame Operation Choke Point for inspiring it.Reality check:An audit conducted by the FDIC s inspector general, released in September, found no instances where the FDIC has pressured a financial institution to decline banking services to a firearm or ammunition dealer. But chasing the delusion all the way down the rabbit hole, LaTurner and his fellow Republicans felt the need to put gun dealers on the same level as those who faced Jim Crow laws, lynchings, and anti-Semitism.But back to LeTurner: It s not theoretical. It has happened around the country,  LaTurner said.  I ve got a business here in Pittsburg that sells guns   they re a great company   and if a bank decides to stop doing business with them because the feds are breathing down their necks, they need to have some recourse. Because if there is one group in the country that needs more protection it s gun salesmen.Feature image via Wikipedia",0
8523," Fox Pundit Blows Top Over Indictment Of Anti-Abortion Fanatics, Attacks Female Prosecutor (VIDEO)","A Grand Jury in Texas realized who the real criminals are, and Fox News isn t happy about it.On Monday, a Houston Grand Jury chose to indict two anti-abortion activists from the right-wing group Center for Medical Progress (CMP) for their involvement in an investigation of Planned Parenthood that led to the release of repeatedly debunked videos the CMP secretly filmed while posing as employees of the women s health organization.The videos allegedly show Planned Parenthood employees selling fetal body parts when in reality they were only discussing reimbursement of transportation costs to get the cells to researchers. Planned Parenthood wasn t actually selling  baby parts  at all.Despite that, Texas Republicans ordered a court to indict the women s health organization, instead the Grand Jury slapped CMP boss David Daleiden and CMP employee Sandra Merritt with their own indictment, charging them with tampering with government documents and trying to purchase organs illegally, both of which are felonies. The CMP employees also used fake IDs to infiltrate Planned Parenthood.Thus far, Planned Parenthood has been cleared of any wrongdoing by a congressional investigation as well as several state investigations.But that didn t stop Fox legal analyst Andrew Napolitano from throwing a temper tantrum about the indictment.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Tuesday, the former judge weighed in without having seen the actual indictment itself, claiming that the Grand Jury indicted the wrong people and were somehow led astray by the prosecuting attorney.The CMP employees, he said, should be considered  bona fide journalists  running a legitimate investigation, even though they aren t journalists at all. They re really seriously pro-life people wanting to expose how government dollars are being used by Planned Parenthood,  Napolitano said.  The tapes came out, there s a big uproar. He then accused Planned Parenthood of  using tax dollars to kill babies and sell their body parts,  even though such use of funds are prevented by the Hyde Amendment. Furthermore, abortion services only amount to 3 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides and it has already been established by legal and medical experts that Planned Parenthood was not doing anything wrong in the tapes.Napolitano also made some rather serious accusations against Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson, suggesting that she turned the jury against CMP instead of getting the jury to automatically indict Planned Parenthood regardless of the evidence or lack thereof like a real Republican is supposed to do. The grand jury does not turn around and indict your witnesses, the people who brought you the case, without the prosecutor wanting this to happen! So, why would this prosecutor, appointed by Governor Perry, a former judge, a Republican woman, why would this prosecutor want to do this other than to send a message like,  I might be a Republican but leave Planned Parenthood alone ? In the end, Napolitano called the indictment  a political hit job  while continuing to defend Daleiden and Merritt as journalists who did nothing wrong since the government  uses the same techniques  for catching criminals all the time.Here s the video via YouTube.Clearly, Napolitano has lost his damn mind and demonstrates why he shouldn t have ever been allowed to be a judge in the first place. These CMP employees do not work for the government nor are they employed by a media organization. They are activists who forged government documents and tried to buy fetal body parts that Planned Parenthood was never actually trying to sell. Therefore, CMP broke the law, not Planned Parenthood. In addition, just because the prosecuting attorney is a Republican, it doesn t mean Planned Parenthood isn t entitled to a fair investigation. Napolitano is whining because he thinks there should have been an automatic indictment just because the attorney is Republican and the investigation took place in Texas. In fact, it took place in the very city CMP conducted the sting operation. The true political hit job would have been if Napolitano had his way.However, the bottom line is that the Grand Jury did their job based on the evidence presented to them and they chose to indict CMP and exonerate Planned Parenthood. The legal system worked despite how much Napolitano and other conservatives want it to be rigged.Featured image via Fox News screenshot",0
8524, Carly Fiorina LOSES IT After The ‘Baby Parts’ People Are Indicted Instead Of Planned Parenthood (VIDEO),"You have to admire conservatives  ability to commit to the lie. After David Daledin and Sandra Merritt, the slimy, lying taint-barnacles who produced the fraudulent, heavily-edited Planned Parenthood  baby parts  videos that took the conservative world by storm, were indicted on multiple felony charges  a surprising event that took place during the course of an investigation into Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast ordered by Texas Governor Greg Abbott   one would expect conservatives to turn their anger toward those who lied to them. Unfortunately, these are people who still think Hillary Clinton was responsible for Benghazi.The indictments against the perpetrators of these agregious lies, ones that inspired Robert Dear to engage in an act of terrorism against a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, were enough to throw 2016 hopeful Carly Fiorina into a fit of delusional panic and rage.On Monday, Fiorina joined conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt to share her outrage   not against the people whose lies caused her to spout off crazy talk about  baby parts  for months, but against anyone remotely interested in the truth. Asked for her reaction, Fiorina explained that she is furious that Planned Parenthood s  trafficking in baby body parts  did not lead to prosecution: Yes, well, this is why it s a fight for the character of our nation. We know for a fact that because of Planned Parenthood s own announcement that they would no longer accept payments for what they call  fetal tissue,  and they were in fact trafficking in baby body parts. So guess what? I m not going to sit down and be quiet as I said at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Friday before the snowstorm descended. I will not sit down and be quiet, I know the value of life, we know what s going on, and I will continue to stand for the character of this nation. From what I read, somehow the charge is that they falsified government identities because that s true obviously, that s not good, but I only know what I read at this point, but I think it s pretty clear that we now know what goes on in Planned Parenthood clinics,  Fiorina told Hewitt, explaining that the indictments for  Tampering with a Governmental Record  and  Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   very serious charges   were an outrage because despite all this, she considers the heavily-edited videos to be legitimate: Here s what I know: Planned Parenthood has been trafficking in body parts. Planned Parenthood has been altering late-term abortion techniques to this specific purpose of harvesting body parts. In President Fiorina budget, there will not be a single dime for Planned Parenthood. Fiorina isn t the only GOP candidate who is immune to reality. Marco Rubio told CNN that he is  disturbed  because Planned Parenthood,  who are the ones that were actually selling off these (body) parts were found having done nothing wrong, the people who tried to expose them are the ones that are now facing criminal charges. It s interesting what happens when people focus on the facts, isn t it?Mike Huckabee called Monday a  sick day in America  because  those who expose evil w/ a cellphone  are being punished for their criminal actions, but Planned Parenthood was found to have done nothing criminal. Ben Carson s campaign promised retribution against Planned Parenthood, which has been cleared in every single politically-motivated investigation against them to date. Carson s Communication Director told CNN: He is equally shocked that they instead decided to indict the individuals that exposed Planned Parenthood s heinous and illegal activities. As President, he will use the full weight of his office to not only cut off all federal funding for this organization, but also prosecute them for crimes against the unborn. Unfortunately, conservatives simply don t care about the truth   and the truth is that the only criminals are the ones who made the fake videos that prompted the Stupid Part of America to lose their sh*t.Listen to Carly Fiorina lose her mind below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbuAU-9QX8A?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via YouTube",0
8525, The End Of The Republican Party In One Simple Graph,"After getting crushed in the 2012 election, the Republican Party realized that they needed to appeal to more than just old angry white men. But they didn t do that. Instead, they doubled down on anti-Latino sentiment. Then they tripled down. Then they played their Trump card and that was the end of the GOP s Latino outreach. Now, Pew Research Center has released a study that confirms the Republican Party is doomed. Not only is the fastest growing group of voters Latino, Millennials (who already dislike the GOP intensely) make up the fastest growing segment within that already critical demographic.In other words, the people the least likely to vote for Republicans are going to be one of the most powerful voting blocks in just a few years. Just to make it a little more clear, here s what the growth of Latino voters looks like by the millions:And almost half of them are Millennials. If I were a Republican, this graph would make me wake up screaming every night. It s like the Grim Reaper showed up on my doorstep and said,  Hola, Gringo! I d feel bad for the GOP but they really did bring it on themselves. A few years ago, they MIGHT have been able to appeal to Latino voters. But the last two years have seen a repeat of the exact same short-sighted stupidity that drove the black community away from voting Republican for the last 50 years. Trump sped up the process considerably but it was already happening. You cannot tell an entire group of people that you hate their very existence and then be surprised when they vote against you.Republicans have painted themselves into a corner with no chance of escape. In order to rally their aging base, they demonized Latinos by pretending immigration was an existential threat of America. They were so successful in this that they cannot, in any way, appeal to Latinos without immediately alienating the old angry white people that keep them in office. But without the Latino vote, Republicans cannot possibly continue to compete at the national level for much longer.It s the most delicious Burrito of Electoral Doom imaginable and I can t wait to dig in!Feature image via Pew Research",0
8526, Oregon Cop Convicted Of Shattering Biker’s Collarbone With Kick Forgot Dashcam Was On (VIDEO),"In a baffling fit of rage, an Oregon State Police officer has been convicted of ramming his car into a stopped motorcyclist then kicking the dazed man so hard in the chest that he would need a metal plate and screws to repair his shattered collarbone and ribs. What State Police Captain Rob Edwards didn t know was that his department have installed a functioning dashboard camera. It captured the entire shocking scene.The 2012 incident with a chase that the victim says he didn t know was happening. The first he learned of Edwards  presence was when the cop was running directly into the back of his motorcycle, spilling the man from his bike. The man gets up with his hands raised only to find Edwards rushing at him with his pistol held sideways, probably imitating something he saw in a movie. The biker, identified as Justin Wilkens, barely had time to say  What did I do?  before Edwards kicked him square in the chest with such force that Wilkens would later learn he broke his collarbone and several ribs.[youtube https://youtu.be/7Uuo_CiiPk8?t=3m32s]Edwards would later say that he was  frustrated  with Wilkens for not complying to his demands sooner (how?), and that he didn t realize his car was equipped with a functioning dashcam.What Edwards didn t know was that the unmarked car he was driving was equipped with a functioning dashboard camera.So when Edwards eventually struck Justin Wilkens  motorcycle with his car, then pulled his gun and kicked Wilkens in the chest, he did not know that the whole episode would be played   again and again   before a U.S. District Court jury.It s not hard to see why the dashcam was a bitter pill for Edwards   thanks to the footage his trial lasted all of three days and he was promptly convicted. He and his department will now have to pay $180,000 in damages. Bizarrely, Wilkens could have received more but the jury decided that a cop pointing a pistol at his head didn t constitute psychological damages. How militarized has law enforcement become in America?A cop aiming sideways guns at complying suspects is now considered so routine that courts are suggesting people just get used to it.In the past year, the conversation over police cameras has consumed the debate over police abuse. Some critics have pointed out that cameras didn t lead to justice for victims of police abuse like 12-year-old Tamir Rice and in the horrific death of Eric Garner. But on the other hand, it s hard to imagine cops like Edwards receiving any sort of punishment without them. For instances where cops cross the line, video of them doing so can be a godsend to the victims. Juries tend to err on the side of the police, but even they can t ignore what they see with their own eyes. Usually.Cops know this as well as anyone. It s no surprise that Edwards lamented his dashcam. Under the impression it wasn t working, he felt at ease shattering a man s collarbone because he was  frustrated. Feature image via YouTube",0
8527, Stephen Colbert Gets Donald Rumsfeld To Admit The Iraq War Was All A Lie (VIDEO),"Donald Rumsfeld is in full damage control mode after a declassified memo from 2002 making the rounds revealed that he lied about Iraq s  WMDs.  Like anyone desperate to sway public opinion and keep himself out of jail, Rumsfeld is giving interviews to tell  his side.  Why he decided to go The Late Show with Stephen Colbert is unclear. Colbert is a screaming liberal, very smart and very well-informed. Perhaps Rumsfeld thought he could outmaneuver the comedian? Maybe he thought Colbert would go easy on him? Maybe Rumsfeld is suffering from dementia?Needless to say, the interview did not go well for Rumsfeld:The talk show host said this showed Bush administration officials believed there were weapons of mass destruction   but they had no hard evidence of their existence. I believe that sincerely   I don t think anybody made up the belief that there were weapons of mass destruction,  Colbert said, as Rumsfeld insisted those beliefs were sincere.  That is cynicism beyond what I would ever want to think of my government. I believe that everybody believed that they were there, but there was no hard proof that they were there,  he continued.  And yet it was presented to the American people as if there was. So there was an unknown known for the American people. It was known that there was not hard evidence, but we were presented a partial picture   and that s the unknown known that we were denied. Do you think that was the right thing to do? In this, Colbert is far nicer than I would have been. We already know that Bush and his neo-con administration wanted an excuse to invade Iraq. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Bush demanded that the intelligence community  find  a connection between Iraq and the attacks. When they couldn t find a connection, one was manufactured for the sole purpose of selling the American people on the war. In this  known known  context, it takes very little to imagine Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld fabricating their  belief  in WMDs from whole cloth.But the best moment came when Colbert got Rumsfeld to admit, out loud, that the utter certainty about WMDs that we were sold was, in fact, total bullshit: Were there things that the administration or you knew that we didn t learn about out of the best possible intentions   which is, there were things that would undermine the case for a war you thought was necessary to save the United States,  Colbert said.At last, Rumsfeld delivered a straight answer. The president had available to him intelligence from all elements of the government, and the National Security Council members had that information,  Rumsfeld said.  It was all shared, it was all supplied, and it s never certain  if it were a fact, it wouldn t be called intelligence. Translation into non-weasel speak: We lied when we said we  knew  for a fact that the WMDs existed.If you ll recall, the made up connection to 9/11 and WMDs were the entire basis for the Iraq War and Rumsfeld just admitted they lied about them.For the revisionists out there, a quick history lesson. Rumsfeld didn t say he  thought  Iraq had WMDs. Or that we were pretty sure or even very confident. He didn t equivocate in the slightest. He said we knew where they were. STEPHANOPOULOS: And is it curious to you that given how much control U.S. and coalition forces now have in the country, they haven t found any weapons of mass destruction?SEC. RUMSFELD:  We know where they are. They re in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad and east, west, south and north somewhat.-ABC s This Week, 3/30/03If the American people had been told that our intelligence on WMDs was as shaky as it actually was, no one but the most bloodthirsty among us would have supported it. Americans are more than happy to bomb people that attack us or a friend, but preemptive war is not, and has never been, a part of our DNA. Rumsfeld and his co-conspirators knew this so they lied through their teeth. It took a comedian to finally get one of the blood-soaked architects of America s worst war since Vietnam to admit it.Bravo, Mr. Colbert!

8528, Maine’s Governor Refuses To Answer One Simple Question – Then Things Get Really Weird (VIDEO),"The Rachel Maddow Show attempted to reach out to Maine Governor Paul LePage s office to see if he would be delivering his annual State of the State speech this year (after threatening he wouldn t do it). Instead of getting a response to that simple question, the Governor s office decided to make things really weird. Not only did the Governor and his aides not answer the question, but they made complete fools of themselves in the process. It was a war of words, to say the least.Here is the question they thought was so horrible: Hi, wanted to see if the governor has made a decision about whether or not he will give the State of the State address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter. Do you have any information on that decision yet? Thanks! The very first message Maddow got back was: Why does Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage? Her neurotic fixation on his is kind of bizarre. What happened after that is just a back and forth of sheer awkwardness.While it is true that Maddow has reported on Governor LePage, and probably not in the most favorable light, that is the job of a national reporter after all. And   he s made a lot of stupid statements. Of course, a liberal show is going to laugh at someone like LePage for those comments. She reports on the news. It would have been very easy for LePage s office to say  we re not sure yet,  leaving Maddow almost nowhere to go with the exchange, even if she was trying to troll him.Surely the Governor and his aides must have known that this is precisely the last thing they would want to do to someone who commands an audience of millions. Not very smart. Then again, Tea Party Republicans aren t the brightest, either.Featured image via screen capture",0
8529, Snyder Gets Served Some Very Bad News From Court: It’s Time To Answer For Flint,"Michigan Governor Rick Snyder stood before the state legislature and declared that the  buck stops  with him. He said that the people of Flint deserve the truth and that they will get it. Hew said he takes full responsibility and that the government had failed the people.Then he refused to resign, denying the people the basic satisfaction of seeing their grossly incompetent  leader  step down.The hope for some kind of satisfaction isn t completely gone, however, as the lawyers in a class action suit filed for the people of Flint obtained subpoenas requiring the governor, his staffers, city managers and the Department of Environmental Quality to turn over all documents, records and emails pertaining the crisis in Flint.Lawyers are looking for anything dating back to 2011 referring to three specific items: The Flint River tapped for drinking water, the quality of the water in the river or the KWA pipeline, the main transfer route at the root of the problem.The bad news didn t stop there for Governor Snyder. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced that it was assigning the former head of the FBI s Detroit field office to lead a criminal investigation. What the citizens of Flint want, desire and deserve is what laws may have been broken,  said Schuette.The controversy surrounding Flint has been treated by Republicans like a simple  oops  moment. Jeb Bush has praised the governor for his handling of the situation that has already taken at least ten lives from Legionnaire s disease while calling for the head of Hillary Clinton on a pike over Benghazi. The entire situation has highlighted just how little republicans tend to think of the people when making decisions that could save a few dollars   or earn a few more.Hopefully, Governor Snyder will have no choice when the facts are presented but to step down. The people of Flint deserve no less.Feature Image via screen capture",0
8530, Neil DeGrasse Tyson SCHOOLS Rapper B.O.B Over Flat Earth Conspiracy (TWEETS),"If you were not aware there is a seriously old and debunked new theory going around the interwebz that the Earth is really flat after all. Yes, seriously. Recently, rapper B.o.B posted a bunch of  evidence  to support his belief that we ve all been lied to about the shape of our planet. Unfortunately for him, it got really embarrassing when astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson got involved and schooled him.A couple of weeks ago, singer Tila Tequila tweeted about the #FlatEarth movement, claiming that the Earth isn t really round because buildings in New York City are all straight.Why are all the buildings in NYC standing straight up? If earth was round then some of the buildings would have a slight tilt. #FlatEarth  Tila Tequila (@AngelTilaLove) January 7, 2016Apparently she isn t the only nutjob, because rapper B.o.B started tweeting  the same mind-boggling nonsense:A lot of people are turned off by the phrase ""flat earth""   but there's no way u can see all the evidence and not know  grow up  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016No matter how high in elevation you are  the horizon is always eye level   sorry cadets  I didn't wanna believe it either.  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016y'all be like  ""you're not high enough to see the curve keep going"" pic.twitter.com/dzgYpIIao3  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016how do you explain the horizon always being at eye level ? https://t.co/Kzuc4r77CK  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016There is tweet after tweet with this same crazy speak. About twenty tweets into his flat Earthfest, Neil deGrasse Tyson decided that he could no longer handle the dumbf*ckery and slapped down the rapper s loony conspiracy theory:@bobatl Earth's curve indeed blocks 150 (not 170) ft of Manhattan. But most buildings in midtown are waaay taller than that.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016@bobatl Polaris is gone by 1.5 deg S. Latitude. You ve never been south of Earth s Equator, or if so, you've never looked up.  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 25, 2016@bobatl Flat Earth is a problem only when people in charge think that way. No law stops you from regressively basking in it.

Instead of admitting that he had no idea what he was talking about, the rapper posted this:@neiltyson why can't the curvature of the earth be measured anywhere in nature? why does only NASA have photos of the curve ? r u a mason?  B.o.B (@bobatl) January 25, 2016He continued on like this for the rest of the day, convinced that he knows more than Tyson.Neil deGrasse must have realized that the rapper was completely bat sh*t because he just stopped responding.We don t blame him.Although many American children are taught that Christopher Columbus discovered the Earth was not flat, the belief that it is round dates back all the way to 6 Century B.C., but was proven by Aristotle. It was then reaffirmed throughout history.There are a lot of mindnumbing conspiracy theories out there, but this one is exceptionally stupid. Why B.o.B thinks he knows more than the scientific community is anyone s guess, but he really should keep his crazy off of social media sites before he embarrasses himself further.Featured image via Twitter",0
8531, Watch Michelle Obama And Conan O’Brien Entertain U.S. Troops In Qatar (VIDEO),"Conan O Brien and First Lady Michelle Obama teamed up in an hour long episode chronicling a trip they made to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as part of the first lady s Joining Forces initiative.With comedians Laurie Kilmartin, Brian Kiley, and John Mulaney, along with Grace Potter as his musical guest, O Brien performed stand-up for troops stationed at the base. During his monologue, he regretfully told the audience of his decision to forgo a stay at the posh St. Regis hotel to live on the base just like the troops do.  I said no, I want to live on the base. That s what I said, because I m a fu**ing idiot, that s why,  drawing applause from the crowd.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM5r-CJpajA]On his way to Qatar with the first lady, O Brien wasn t allowed to film the trip for security reasons so he decided to do the next best thing: Use 3D animation as a way to narrate the experience. The video shows the first lady having tomato juice on the plane while O Brien has dozens of bottles of vodka stacked on the table next to him.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxvCt34QCkw]It was midway through the episode that O Brien and the first lady are seen together. Obama told the host the reason why she s decided to  shine a light  on active service members and veterans. Obama said: Once you connect, you don t want to let go. You don t have to be first lady or one of the funniest men on the planet to get involved.  The first lady s Joining Forces initiative seeks to empower veterans and their families: Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sectors to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. The first lady s initiative is making a huge difference for the troops and their families.Featured image via screen capture",0
8532, POLL: Bristol Palin Wants To Know Whose Voice Sounds Like Nails On A Chalkboard- Her Mom Or Tina Fey,"Bristol Palin had something to say and pondered some questions after Tina Fey roasted her mommy on Saturday Night Live over the weekend.Last week, America s village idiot returned to the political stage to endorse Donald Trump in a rambling incoherent speech that has been lampooned repeatedly by comedians across the country.Frankly, Chris Hardwick s mockery of Palin s speech on Comedy Central s @Midnight has been my favorite thus far.But on Saturday, Tina Fey received yet another opportunity to mock Palin in what became an instant classic opening segment on the long-running NBC sketch comedy program.And of course, Sarah Palin s demon spawn couldn t resist taking shots at Tina Fey making fun of her looks and the way she sounds.Bristol Palin commented on the Saturday Night Live sketch on Monday by asking  Who wore it better- Sarah Palin or Tina Fey?  in reference to the jacket worn by both ladies. Anyway, I think it s funny that the producers of SNL couldn t get their hands on the same top my mom wore, because it was sold out,  the failed abstinence advocate wrote.  I have to admit, the shirt looked great. But I still think my mom wore it better. She then included a poll, which everyone should totally add their vote to, asking who wore it better.But that s not all.As mentioned earlier, Bristol also trashed Fey s impersonation of her mom and her looks. I m sure many of you saw Tina Fey, who sounds nothing like my mom, do a skit based on my Mom s endorsement of Donald Trump.I don t know about you, but hearing her fake accent is like nails on a chalkboard for me!I may be biased, but I think my mom trumps her in the looks department. (Especially for having three more kids and seven more years on Tina!)Saturday Night Live and Fey have been clinging to this impersonation a little too long. It s getting pathetic. Its been 7 years! Are they desperate for content? Or just desperate for viewers? In the interest of fairness- after all, Bristol did say she  may be biased - here s a poll asking who s voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard- Sarah Palin or Tina Fey? Be sure to vote and don t forget to vote on Bristol Palin s poll, too.Sarah PalinTina FeyFeatured Image: Distractify",0
8533, President Obama Is Putting An End To Inhumane Punishment In The Federal Prison System,"President Obama announced via an op-ed in the Washington Post that he will be enacting some major reforms in the federal prison system. He will be putting an end to solitary confinement for juveniles, and prohibiting the practice as a punishment for low-level infractions. The reforms were taken from a report by the Justice Department that listed recommendations for improving the system. It s estimated that approximately 10,000 individuals would be affected.Unfortunately, this only applies to the federal prison system and not to the majority of prison inmates that are incarcerated for state-level crimes. Even with that in mind, this is still a bold and very necessary step in reforming American prisons which can serve as a model for states to follow.President Obama made his case as follows:How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesn t make us safer. It s an affront to our common humanity.The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement   and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.Source: WaPoWhile acknowledging that sometimes solitary confinement can be required for certain individuals, President Obama made it clear that it s a punishment which is overused and ends up causing more harm than good in many cases.There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons   including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.Source: WaPoHopefully, this will be a first step in what turns out to be a long path of reforms to bring our prison system out of the realm of  cruel and unusual punishment,  as it was intended to be all along.featured image via The Georgia Straight",0
8534, Conservatives Are Going BONKERS Over the Indictment Of The Fake ‘Baby Parts’ Video People (SCREENSHOTS),"In case you haven t heard, after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into Planned Parenthood after disingenuous, heavily-edited videos were produced by the deceptively-named Center For Medical Progress. The videos, which claimed the women s health organization sold  baby parts  to the highest bidder, launched a wave of investigations nationwide   all of which turned up absolutely no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood.One such investigation in Texas involved Planned Parenthood of the Gulf Coast. Though a grand jury cleared the much-maligned institution of any and all wrongdoing, two indictments were handed down   against the producers of the anti-Planned Parenthood fabrications.David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt were both indicted for Tampering with a Governmental Record. In addition, Daleiden received an indictment for Prohibition of the Purchase and Sale of Human Organs   an incredibly serious charge. We were called upon to investigate allegations of criminal conduct by Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast,  said Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson.  As I stated at the outset of this investigation, we must go where the evidence leads us. All the evidence uncovered in the course of this investigation was presented to the grand jury. I respect their decision on this difficult case. The people behind this fraud lied and broke the law in order to spread malicious lies about Planned Parenthood to advance their extreme anti-abortion political agenda,  Planned Parenthood said in a statement.  As the dust settles and the truth comes out, it s become totally clear that the only people who engaged in wrongdoing are the criminals behind this fraud, and we re glad they are being held accountable. Nothing about today s announcement in Harris County impacts the state s ongoing investigation,  said Governor Abbott, who promised to continue to waste state money in fruitless attempts to smear the women s health group.  The State of Texas will continue to protect life, and I will continue to support legislation prohibiting the sale or transfer of fetal tissue. The horrific nature of these videos demand scrutiny and investigation. The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services will continue to examine the practices of abortion providers and whether state law adequately protects the sanctity of life,  Lt. gov. Dan Patrick added. I will never be deterred from standing up to fight to protect the unborn. Daleiden s supporters similarly don t care about the facts, with many demanding an investigation into the grand jury because they can t possibly think that laws were broken when the Center for Medical Progress illegally recorded privileged information and slopping edited clips together to give the impression of wrongdoing   no matter what the evidence says. On Fox News  Facebook page, they let their  thoughts  (we use that word loosely) be known:               It s important to remember that these people will be voting in November.Featured image via screengrab",0
8535, BET Actress Lays The Smack Down On Obama-Hating Fox News Pundit Stacey Dash,"Fox News pundit and co-host Stacey Dash attracted a lot of negative comments with her recent comments that BET and the NAACP shouldn t exist.Actress Gabrielle Union is the star of BET s Being Mary Jane, and at a recent appearance at the Sundance Film Festival she put Dash s ignorant comments in their place.When asked about Dash s comments at the Sundance Film Festival premiere of  The Birth of a Nation  on Monday, Union first replied,  Who s that? Who s Stacey Dash? Is she like related to Dame Dash? Was she on Roc-A-Fella (Records)? Union said the BET Awards remain necessary because of the lack of diversity in mainstream awards. The more that we focus on inclusion and a true representation of this country, I think that crazy lady will have less to say,  Union said of Dash.Dash s career hit its peak with her appearance in the 1990s comedy, Clueless, and since then she has been far more likely to appear in instantly forgettable direct-to-video movies than anything in the mainstream box office.A few years ago she discovered that there is a niche for her as a black pundit who is willing to attack black America, and began using her Twitter account to boost Mitt Romney s presidential campaign. As that attracted expected pushback from her followers, Dash parlayed that into regular pundit appearances on Fox News, eventually becoming a co-host of the network s rip-off of The View, Outnumbered.On that show, Dash is the reliable source of outrageous, ill-informed quotes, often at the expense of black people to the delight of her Fox News bosses. Sometimes, Dash has even gone to far for Fox, however, and she was recently suspended for saying that President Obama doesn t  give a sh**  about terrorism. Though in reality, the offense for Fox News viewers was probably more that she swore on-air and not that she lied about Obama.Dash has a book coming out this summer about her transition from actress to right-winger, which gives credibility to the suspicion that Dash is in it for the money.Featured image via YouTube",0
8536, Why Scared Misogynists Are Trolling Emma Watson (TWEETS),"Emma Watson has been in the news lately and it s not because of her acting. She s a staunch feminist and a human rights activist, taking a strong position on the rights of refugees. She recently made news when she gave an extraordinary speech at the United Nations, advocating for the rights of women around the world. She also recently tweeted in solidarity with the refugees coming to Europe in search for safety after years of war and torment in Syria.That was more than enough for anti-feminist and anti-refugee trolls to attack Thomson by using her humanitarianism against her.  There is a petition circulating that challenges Watson to live in a camp in Calais, France. Entitled  Spend one week in a Calais migrant camp for feminism (without bodyguards),  the petition states: In order to show how safe current migration is to Europe, particularly regarding the cause of feminism (I reject wholeheartedly the notion that North African and Middle Eastern migrants are unsafe, and rapists), Emma Watson should spend a week s holiday in a Calais migrant camp, without guards of course, to show how safe, and how pro feminism these migrants are. It all started with one simple humanitarian tweet:#refugeeswelcome  Emma Watson (@EmWatson) September 7, 2015The tweet has since garnered plenty of responses for and against Watson s stance. Some ignorant people have chosen to lump all the refugees into a single category by citing the attacks on France:Remember this @EmWatson? #RefugeesWelcome They killed innocent people in #Paris, Emma. How do you sleep at night? pic.twitter.com/LYqfoWuh4i  JEB DELENDA EST (@rsmccain) November 15, 2015Others however, have shown support:@rsmccain @EmWatson if we abandon the innocent refugees we abandon compassion and create more extremists  Chris France (@france_chris) November 15, 2015Since the petition was created a week ago, over 12,000 people have signed it with 15,000 being   the goal. Here s what a troll had to say about Watson: Ever since she was invited to give a widely praised speech at the UN on the topic, she has become a poster girl of modern feminism. Her simultaneous embrace of female equality, mass migration and the misogynistic non-western cultures brought with it, is widely seen as typical of left wing activists today. In this context, the petition can be interpreted as an expression of frustration with the contradictions of modern liberal feminism, rather than merely a personal attack on Ms. Watson. Watson, who is best known for her role as Hermione in the Harry Potter films, was made a Goodwill Women s Ambassador by the United Nations in 2014 and has been passionately using her platform to advocate for the betterment of humanity. At only 24 years old, she s already making a difference. We need more people like Emma Watson and we need to support her.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons. ",0
8537," Knowing They Have Idiot Viewers, Fox News Asserts Obama Won’t Be Running Again (VIDEO)","Sometimes in life you just need to state the obvious, especially if you re Fox News and your viewers still need to be reminded not to eat paste.It s pretty common knowledge that a president is only allowed to serve two terms in office, so either the folks over on Fox & Friends think that their viewers are stupid, they are reminding themselves, or this is brand new information to them and they think they are reporting breaking news for the first time.During the segment they showed President Obama explaining some of his biggest regrets as president, and how he wouldn t want to run for a third term even if he could, because it would be too big of a toll on his family. It was then that the hosts maneuvered their right-wing spin into saying that Hillary Clinton would be a third term of Obama.However, the most baffling part of the segment, alongside their love for George W. Bush, was when they were literally talking about a third term for Obama and what that would mean. Brian Kilmeade, while reading a tweet that read,  I believe he would beat anybody in the current GOP crop  decided to follow it up by saying: That could be the case. We ll see. Which is when Steve Doocy had to chime in and remind his cohost alongside viewers at home: But then again, he can t run. So, he wouldn t be running. Oh, Brian Kilmeade, there s a reason Bobby Moynihan portrays you as so scatterbrained and unintelligent on SNL, because you are.This really shouldn t be something that has to be explained to anyone in this day and age, but when dealing with Fox News and Fox News viewers, well, they seem to need a little bit more time to grasp facts and reality. Honestly, the look on Doocy s face as he explains to Kilmeade that Obama can t run again is priceless.Watch for yourself:  Video/Featured image: C&L",0
8538, Grand Jury Indicts Anti-Choice Zealots Who Produced Phony Planned Parenthood Videos,"Talk about blowback. Last Summer, Texas governor Greg Abbott initiated an investigation into Planned Parenthood following the release of a series of deceptively edited videos claiming to have caught the healthcare provider engaging in fetal organ harvesting and selling the parts to biomedical research facilities via some sort of grisly underground marketplace.But instead of catching Planned Parenthood red-handed, a grand jury has officially indicted the perpetrators of the videos, David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, while also exonerating Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing.The AP via Talking Points Memo:David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, was indicted on a felony charge of tampering with a governmental record and a misdemeanor count related to purchasing human organs. Another activist, Sandra Merritt, was also indicted on a charge of tampering with a governmental record. It s the first time anyone in the group has been charged criminally since the videos started surfacing last year.Texas becomes the eighth state to exonerate Planned Parenthood, while casting serious doubt on the veracity of the obviously deceptive videos. Yet most of the GOP presidential candidates, along with most of the conservative movement, continues to treat the videos as if they represent hard evidence of Planned Parenthood s allegedly evil motives and illegal activities. Congressional Republicans, along with state Republicans, used the videos as convenient excuses to vote in support of crushing the healthcare clinics.It s entirely likely that Republicans will continue to attach their reputations to the videos in spite of the indictment and the various exonerations.Adding to the irony of the indictment, Daleiden is being accused of attempting to illegally purchase fetus organs   the very practice he was attempting to expose, even though it didn t exist.In a statement announcing the indictment, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson didn t provide details on the charges, including what record or records were allegedly tampered with and why Daleiden faces a charge related to buying human organs. Anderson s office said it could not provide details until the documents charging Daleiden and Merritt were formally made public, which was expected later Monday.Get ready for the sound of anti-choice heads exploding, as well as the demagoguing of the grand jury itself as somehow an Obama/NARAL/PPFA conspiracy.Featured imaged via video screen grab.",0
8539, Watch This Bundy Militiaman Challenge Chris Christie To Sumo Match In Latest Bizarre Video,"It s been more than three weeks since a group of terrorists, led by Ammon Bundy, took over Oregon s Malheur Wildlife Sanctuary. Over that relatively short period of time, it appears the militia members have gone from mentally unbalanced to certifiably insane.Over the course of the terrorist occupation, various members of the group have posted various videos of themselves, including one that shows them taking down  hidden cameras  that are in plain site.The militants recently posted a video of themselves angrily  discovering  boxes of Native American artifacts in the basement of the wildlife refuge, which is exactly where they were left by the Burns Pauite Tribe that helped categorize them.Before that there was the video of militia member Jon Ritzheimer flipping his shit over an assortment of dildos and dicks that he got in the mail.But the most recent video to be published by a member of the group is the most insane yet.It shows a militia member named Kelly Gneiting challenging New Jersey governor Chris Christie to some kind of sumo duel. Gneiting is dressed in what appears to be nothing but his underwear.The video appears to be the group s attempt at a response to statements made by Christie earlier this month. Christie said  Laws matter,  and  Laws have to be enforced,  which in right-wing crazy language clearly means  Kill them all. In the video, Gneiting invites Christie to  put on a diaper  and  slap bellies  with him.There s been a lot of speculation about how the militia men have been spending their time over the past few weeks. Isolated from society, with no one to turn to for comfort but each other, the terrorists have spawned more than a few Brokeback Mountain spoofs.There s even a twitter-based homoerotic fiction story, thanks to Colin Meloy of the Decemberists.Gneiting no doubt thought that inviting the governor of New Jersey to  slap bellies  with him, while  wearing a diaper,  would be a good way to make people stop questioning his sexuality on Twitter.Watch the video below, via Kelly Gneiting on YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",0
8540, Bernie Sanders Asks One Question: The Response Is Both Chilling And Powerful (VIDEO),"During a campaign event in Iowa Falls, Iowa on Monday, Bernie Sanders asked the people in the crowd to hear their experiences on what it is like to live on a $12,000 dollar a year income. The response from one woman is both chilling and powerful.Here is part of one woman s response: It s so hard to do anything to pay your bills, you re ashamed all the time when you can t buy presents for your children it s really, really, really hard   and I work 3, 4, 5 jobs sometimes, always minimum wage, I have a degree, divorced and it s just I m waiting for disability to come through so my parents have to support me   it s just hard. Bernie Sanders responds, saying: It is not easy for people to stand up and say that but the truth is that until millions of people who are experiencing what you re experiencing do say that we don t make change. You can watch the entire exchange below:The right-wing has done everything in their power to make poverty shaming as acceptable as racism has historically been. Currently, the default attack on the poor is to claim that they only want free stuff. It s a slightly more de-racialized way of calling people welfare queens.That s why it can be extremely hard for poor people to come forward with stories of their personal struggles. They have been subjected to the dogma of homo economicus their entire lives. They have a tendency to see themselves as failures, rather than the people living in an economic system that was built for them to survive, not for them to prosper.In the same way that the movement during the queer liberation movement was largely successful because it encouraged people to come out of the closest and make some noise, so to the poor must tell their stories of struggle. They must demand that their existence and struggle be heard, and to refuse to allow themselves to be dehumanized by the forces that wish to exploit them.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore via Flickr ",0
8541, Tennessee Family Values GOP Leader Loses Job After Years Of Unsolicited Sexts To Young Women,"The Tennessee House of Representatives needs to find a new majority whip after their last one was exposed of having repeatedly sexually harassed young women while he trumpeted  family values  from his political office.State Rep. Jeremy Durham formally announced he would be stepping down from his leadership role (but not giving up his seat in the legislature) after an investigation by the Tennessean found that he had repeatedly sent sexual texts to at least three women, oftentimes late at night.One woman in her mid-20s, who worked in various capacities at the statehouse, said during the 2013 legislative session, Durham repeatedly sent text messages and Facebook messages, sometimes late into the night.One text message, after 10 p.m., says he misses her.In another text, at about 1:30 a.m., Durham asks her for pictures.Another of Durham s victims reported that the politician sent her  dozens  of texts in a similar vein. In fact, he seemed so persistent that it s a wonder he had time to work in between bouts of sexual harassment.A text from Durham, sent at about 1 a.m., asks the woman for pictures. For me, I was just trying to engage professionally, from one professional to another. And he crossed the line: You don t text and constantly message on Facebook and ask to meet up at bars in the evening,  the woman said. He would come up with these ideas and I would just be like,  Are you crazy?   All three women said they did not make formal complaints against Durham because they feared what he and his fellow politicians might do when they found out. When one victim finally did alert leaders in the Tennessee legislature, it became clear that their fears were well founded. Rather than immediately attempt to get to the bottom of it, the politicians quickly convened with lawyers and concluded that the best course of action was to silence her. When a colleague floated the idea of letting the victim address the Republican caucus, they dismissed it out of hand. I think the general response was that it would be a bad precedent, just to get somebody who shows up at a caucus meeting and goes after a member, without going through a formal process,  McCormick said.The  formal process  wound up accomplishing nothing. It took the explosive report in the Tennessean to kickstart Durham s downfall.This isn t Durham s first run in with scandal. Just two years ago, the Republican rising star was turned in by a pharmacist for trying to forge a drug prescription. When police arrived, Durham had a meltdown that was   in all its glory   caught on tape. (A grand jury later refused to indict him. Shocking.)Right on cue, Durham blamed the  liberal media  for his latest problems. Having been let off the hook before, it s looking as if Durham is expecting to weather this storm as well. He may have miscalculated. Adding to the bizarre spectacle happening in the Tennessee GOP, Durham appears to have been stripped of his post while he was busy watching football. When reporters called his house to ask about his resignation, it was all news to him. I m talking it over with my family but have not made a decision. Nothing should ve gone out. Watching Broncos game at the moment. Family values conservative getting caught doing anything but valuing families has become a painfully common hypocrisy for the Republican Party. While politicians of all stripes have moral failings, conservatives have long propped themselves up on the idea that they are ethically superior than their liberal counterparts. The concept, ludicrous on its face, has only become more absurd with every scandal.Feature image via WSMV Channel 4 screenshot",0
8542, Michigan Militia Vows To ‘Take Up Arms’ To Protect The People Of Flint From Further Poisoning,"You know the water crisis in Flint, Michigan is bad when a group of white, anti-government militiamen decide that they have to protect a minority community. Last week, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia (GCVM) put a call out for like-minded  patriots  to join them in a protest against the  tyrannical government  in Flint: To help our effort, The GCVM are requesting a show of support on Sunday, January 24, 2016 from Patriots and Patriot groups across the land as a united front, standing with all citizens of the City of Flint, MI. We ask Militia, Oath Keepers, III%, Home Guard, and all other like groups to wear your uniforms and insignia to this event. All others are welcome to join us as well! We ask that you only wear side arms and not long rifles, this is not about our 2nd Amendment, this is about the infringement on the good people of Flint. . God Bless the Republic. The Detroit Free Press reports that about thirty armed militiamen dressed in fatigues showed up for the event on Sunday and handed out clean water to the people in the community.Maj. Matt Krol, Executive Officer/Information Officer of the GCVM said that his group did not believe it was a  racial issue  and explained, We re here to defend this community. We re not going to allow (the government) to step on the people of Flint any longer.  He added: If it means having to take up arms in defense   we will do that as well. Okay, a couple of things here need to be addressed. First of all, thousands of people would not be sick and ten people would still be alive if Flint was a majority white, upper-class community. Race very much played a part in what happened, but so did their socioeconomic status. As we know, the two often go hand in hand.Secondly, arming themselves is not going to make the water in the community clean. That is just nonsense and it is the kind of insanity that makes the rest of us look at them and think that they are a bunch of nuts   even when they are trying to do something good.When this story first popped up across my Facebook newsfeed I thought, Ahhh here come the racist gun nuts trying to make a name for themselves on the backs of the minority community in Flint.  But as it turns out they were joined by African-Americans as well. Twenty-seven-year-old, La Mont Williams of Chicago defended GCVM and said: There s really no motivation other than the people of Flint need help and we re in the position where we can help People need water. You can t go three days without drinking water and if you can come out here and help, I ve been met with nothing but love, my little brother has been met with nothing but love and everyone seems to appreciate just two guys coming from Chicago and helping out. And I m pretty sure, the more the merrier. The militiamen definitely deserve to be commended for their work this weekend. While other groups like them often give the movement a bad name, they were really only interested in helping the desperate people in Flint.Bravo. Watch:Featured image: video screenshot",0
8543, Ben And Jerry’s Co-Founder Reveals Bernie Sanders Inspired Ice Cream (IMAGE),"Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders can now cool down with a pint of ice cream after they  feel the Bern. Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has created a special batch of the desert In order to show his support for Sanders  presidential campaign: Bernie s Yearning.Ben Cohen, one of the co-founders of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has for months talked about making a special flavor for his home-state senator. Earlier this month, Cohen told MSNBC that he would call the ice cream  Bernie s Yearning,  featuring a milk chocolate disk covering the top of plain mint ice cream. The disc is meant to represent  the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1% since the end of the recession. Beneath it, the rest of us,  reads the description on the back of the pint posted on the website.On the site promoting the ice cream, Cohen points out that this is his personal creation, and the ice cream does not have the official backing of the company (which has been a subsidiary of the conglomerate Unilever since 2000). Cohen writes,  Jerry and I have been constituents of Bernie Sanders for the last 30 years. We ve seen him in action and we believe in him. When we re out  speaking on his behalf people always ask if there s a Ben and Jerry s flavor. There s not. But if I were going to come up with one, this is what it would be. Cohen made 40 pints of Bernie s Yearning in his own kitchen, and said he would be donating 25 of those to the campaign. He has started a contest to donate the remaining 15 pints, numbered and signed by him.Cohen has been a long-time supporter of progressive causes, and has been a backer of presidential campaigns including Dennis Kucinich, Bernie Sanders, and Barack Obama. He also supports a campaign attempting to push a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed a flood of corporate money in elections.Featured image via Bernie s Yearning",0
8544, Trump Brags: Black People Are ‘Gonna Like Me More Than They Like Obama’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has an extremely messed up perception of his standing with minorities.After being wildly offensive when it comes to women, Hispanics, and Muslims, Trump seriously believes that African Americans will support him even though he s made it clear that he supports white supremacists. For years, Trump has boasted that he has  a great relationship with the blacks, and yesterday he made one of the most ridiculous claims in his campaign history (which is quite impressive, when you think about it). Trump believes he ll actually be more respected and loved by black people than President Barack Obama.In an interview with Fox News  Howard Kurtz, Trump was asked if he would reach out to minorities more. Forever-delusional Trump said he d be great with with Hispanics, Asians, and especially African Americans. Trump said: The African Americans love me, because they know I m gonna bring back jobs. The interview gets even more unbelievable as the Republican presidential front runner says: They re gonna like me better than they like Obama. The truth is Obama has done nothing for them. Kurtz actually looks very uncomfortable and confused as Trump is saying this, and asks The Donald if he in all seriousness just said that African Americans will like him more than America s first black president. Even in his column, Kurtz revealed that Trump s confident statement was so audacious  that he needed a moment before he could respond to the idiocy.Trump answered that although Obama has a  slight advantage  over him, once Trump completes his term of office, he ll be the clear favorite.Here s the video of the awkward video, which is almost too crazy to laugh at:Trump is in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s going to get the black vote   especially considering the fact that statistically, African Americans tend to vote Democratic over Republican by a long shot. Another statistic that Trump should really familiarize himself with before continuing to brag about how much more black people will prefer him over Obama is President Obama s approval rating. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, Obama s approval rating with black voters is 84%   which was actually the lowest of his entire time in the White House. If Trump thinks he can beat that, even when he proves that he is a racist bigot on an everyday basis, he s dreaming.Featured image is a screenshot",0
8545," WATCH: Creepy Young Ted Cruz Says He Wants To ‘Be In A Teen T*t Film, Rule Everything’","2016 Ted Cruz is a moralizing, holier than thou insufferable prick on a mission from Jesus to save America from liberals and Muslims and brown people. 1988 Ted Cruz, on the other hand, was an insufferable prick that wanted to be rich and powerful, rule the world and .be in a teen tit flick:Via Politico:The new clip was posted on YouTube under the name  Young Ted Cruz.  The operator of the account told POLITICO the video had been provided by a high school classmate of Cruz s who wished to remain anonymous. The video comes less than 10 days before the Iowa caucuses, where polls show Cruz at or near the lead.You might be saying that it s unfair to slam Cruz for being 18, but let s be honest here, if a video surfaced of an 18 year old Hillary Clinton doing anything even slightly embarrassing, we would never hear the end of it.For most people, this would just be an isolated incident from their past. Not so much for Ted Cruz. His college roommate, his classmates and pretty much everyone that s ever spent more than a few minutes with him have said pretty much the same thing: Ted Cruz is a smug, arrogant and thoroughly awful person with a reputation of  creepy  behavior around women. His time in Congress has been marked with an obsession with accumulating power at the expense of everyone around him.In this context, Cruz s aspirations as a teen seem less like a joke and more like an honest assessment, including his desire to be in a  teen tit film.  I have to agree with his father s attitude; when asked if Ted would one day rule the world, he simply says,  I hope not! So say we all.Featured image via screencap.",0
8546, ‘Making A Murderer’ Prosecutor Ken Kratz Finds Sickening New Way To Profit From The Avery Case,"This article contains spoilersThe District Attorney responsible for the questionable 2005 convictions of Steven Avery and his 16-year-old nephew Brendan Dassey for the murder of Teresa Halbach has found a new and sickening way to profit from his actions: He is going to write a book.Ken Kratz became infamous after the release of Netflix docu-series Making a Murderer. Produced over 10 years by film makers Moira Demos and Laura Ricciardi, the 10-part series details the harrowing plight of Steven Avery and his young nephew.First, Avery is falsely convicted of the rape of a woman and spends 18 years in jail before new DNA evidence clears him of the crime.Then, just two years after his release, and when he is on the verge of a $36 million settlement with the Manitowoc Sheriff s Department for their role in the false conviction and the failure of subsequent appeals, he is arrested for another murder. 25-year old Auto-Trader photographer Teresa Halbach disappears after an appointment at Avery s salvage yard, weeks later her car, and burned remains are found on Steven Avery s property.Despite the overwhelming physical evidence, questions linger in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Is the Sheriff s department framing him again? As the defense team start examining the evidence, it becomes clear that all is not right with this  evidence .But just as the prosecution s case is beginning to unravel, they obtain a confession from Avery s 16-year-old nephew Brendan Dassey. Katz holds a press conference which he opens like the title sequence of The Twilight Zone, warning viewers under 15 years of age to leave the room. He launches into a harrowing and explicit description of Teresa Halbach s murder.It later emerges that teenager s confession  was obtained after hours of interrogation, during which he had no attorney or legal guardian present. Much of the testimony appears to be fed to him by the investigating officers, and it is clear that Dassey (with an IQ of just 70) has very little idea of what is happening. Essentially, a false confession wrangled out of a mentally-disabled teenager.Regardless, Kratz milked the (later retracted) confession for all it was worth, holding no fewer than seven pre-trial press conferences in which he implicated Dassey and Avery in the crime.Legal experts have blasted Kratz for these tactics, which effectively ruled out any possibility of a fair trial for Avery and Dassey. Ben Kempinen, University of Wisconsin Law School clinical professor of law and director of the Prosecution Project, told the Post Crescent: To me, those press conferences would suggest a colorable violation of the (bar association) trial publicity rule. The risks of prejudice are magnified in smaller communities because of the pervasive nature of the publicity and the likelihood that virtually the entire community will have strong feelings about the case. The Avery case appeared to have captured the attention of the Fox Valley market   and you cannot un-ring that bell. Avery s lawyers filed a motion on this basis, asking the Judge to dismiss the charges against their client due to inflammatory and highly prejudicial  pre-trial publicity. However, Manitowoc County Circuit Judge Patrick Willis rejected the motion, ruling there was no legal precedent for such  drastic  action.Both Avery and Dassey were convicted in 2005, and have remained in jail ever since. It is hoped that the popular outrage mobilized by the doc-series will add new weight to their appeals process.Meanwhile, Ken Kratz was later caught up in a scandal of his own making. In 2009, married 55-year old Kratz was prosecuting a domestic abuse case on behalf of 26-year-old victim Stephanie Van Groll. However, Van Groll was forced to turn to police after receiving more than 30 sexually explicit texts from Kratz during the course of the prosecution. According to Radar, Kratz began with sexually suggestive messages: I know this is wrong. I am such an honest guy, and straight shooter but I have to know more about you  Are you the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected DA the riskier the better? However, when Van Groll refused to engage with his fantasies, he turned nasty, fast. Below are three of the many texts he sent her after she ignored his advances. Hey..Miss Communication, what s the sticking point? Your low-self esteem and you fear you can t play in my big sandbox?[sic] You may look good at first glance, but women that are blonde, 6ft tall, legs and great bodies don t like to be shown off or to please their men! [sic]  he wrote on Oct. 21. I m the atty. I have the $350,000 house. I have the 6-figure career. You may be the tall, young, hot nymph, but I am the prize Van Groll told police she was terrified. Kratz hinted he would throw her entire case out of court if she continued to refuse his advances, leaving her at the mercy of her violent partner.A year later, Kratz was divorced, and forced out of office over the scandal. Van Groll later filed a case of sexual harassment which was settled out of court in 2013.Now, Kratz is seeking to weasel his way out of the shadows with a book about the case, telling Action 2 news that he is Finally grateful to tell the whole story. Given Kratz s track record, we expect he is more grateful for the opportunity to cash in on the global attention generated by the success of the docu-series.If new evidence cannot be found, Steven Avery will remain in jail for the rest of his life, and Brendan Dassey is not eligible for parole until the year 2048. The fact that Kratz is still looking for ways to milk this injustice confirms what we suspected   this is a man without shame.Featured Image via Netflix/Post Crescent",0
8547," Conservative Leader Hears Tenant Speaking Arabic, What Happens Next Made Us Sick With Rage (IMAGES)","The case of a New York Conservative Party leader and her Muslim tenant has gone viral after people the world over were left stunned by perhaps one of the most horrifying cases of modern-day racism reported in the U.S.Last September, 33-year-old Morrocon-born woman Hasna Jalal moved into the $1,500 a month apartment in the Pompey Avenue building of MaryLou Shanahan, former chair of an NY branch of the Conservative Party. It was to be the beginning of months of racial abuse that would end with Shanahan facing felony charges of grand larceny, being in possession of $425,000 worth of stolen property of Jalal s, and a lawsuit for evicting Jalal because she was Muslim. It is however, the details of the harassment that take our breath away.Images via NY Post/SiliveThe suit alleges that the situation began on Sept 6 2015, when Shanahan overheard Jalal in the hall speaking Arabic to her Moroccan relatives. Shanahan reportedly screamed: I don t need anybody speaking Arabic in my house! The neighbors will think you re from Al Qaeda. From this day on, Shanahan launched a campaign of terror against Jalal. It seemed every time Jalal left her apartment, Shanahan would be there. As they passed, Shanahan would hurl insults such as  nasty Arab , and  slut! Next, Jalal would come home to find offensive notes pinned to her door. One read,  Get the f*ck out of my house. You re a f king nasty Arabic pig. This continued to escalate for nearly one month, before matters reached a horrifying climax.On Oct 4, Jalal returned home to find herself locked out of the apartment. The locks had been changed. She began calling on neighbors to try to establish what happened, and they told her they had seen Shanahan clearing the contents of the apartment with removal men earlier in the day. The landlord had emptied Jala s apartment and locked her out while she had been at work.All-in-all, Shanahan had confiscated $425,000 worth of Jalal s property.Jalal went to the police and Shanahan was arrested later the same day for grand larceny and possession of stolen property. But the conservative wasn t done yet. She took to Facebook to begin harassing Jalal all over again, posting: The police will not touch a sociopath, foreigner,  Moroccan, muslim. Jalal has since filed a lawsuit against Shanahan for evicting her on racial grounds, and the former Conservative Party chair will appear in court on the federal charges on Tuesday.This case comes amid a backdrop of hate crimes against Muslims in New York, which have risen sharply in the last year. Attacks against Muslim Americans and mosques in the state have tripled since the Paris Attacks and San Bernardino shootings. According to The New York Times:The spike includes assaults on hijab-wearing students; arsons and vandalism at mosques; and shootings and death threats at Islamic-owned businessesThese attacks have no doubt been incited by conservatives like Shanahan, who prey on the fear and prejudice of others for their own political ends. The same is playing out on the national stage, with the entire GOP clown car adopting a fundamentally racist, bigoted stance toward non-whites, and non-Christians. The result is the daily oppression and trauma suffered by the likes of Hasna Jalal and others, who simply want to get on and live the American dream.Featured Image via Flickr",0
8548, Matt Damon Did NOT Hold Back His Anger Against Rick Snyder Over Flint’s Water Crisis,"What s happening in Flint, Michigan is absolutely criminal. Not only is the water there poisoned and leading to children being diagnosed with lead poisoning, but those who are ultimately responsible are not being held accountable. This needs to change, and several people have been calling for Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (R) to resign. He s the man who put the officials in charge who changed Flint s water source. Officials who insisted the water was safe to drink.One person stepping up and demanding accountability is actor/producer Matt Damon. He has been involved, for a while now, in providing clean water around the globe and co-founded Water.org with Gary White. Both men are absolutely appalled over whats happening in Flint, because as they work hard to bring fresh water to third world nations, people in our own nation are going without clean water. Damon told the Daily Beast: At the very least he should resign! At the very least. Listen, everybody s entitled to a fair trial in the United States of America, but that man should get one. And soon. That s just my personal opinion In terms of the work that we do, to see it happening in Flint, every parent in America feels it on a visceral, deep level, because we ask the question,  What if that was my child?  It s unconscionable in Flint, and it s unconscionable that 663 million people around the world are dealing with that every day in the developing world. Those are the communities we interact with, and that s the mission of Water.org: to end that suffering for those children, and those parents. Gary White continued that sentiment, saying: We should be outraged about Flint. That shouldn t be happening in the United States, but it also drives home the point that it shouldn t be happening anywhere. Flint is the reality for many developing countries around the world. And knowing that race and socioeconomic status definitely play a role in how certain communities are treated not only here in the United States, especially in Flint, but also around the world, Damon added: My sincere hope for our country and our world is that this greater connectivity is going to lead to a greater empathy and an awakening to the plight of our fellow citizens. These are huge systemic injustices we re talking about that hopefully everybody is waking up to. The question then is, what do we do about it? It will be interesting to see where we go from here. The first step in doing that will be to hold those responsible for this outrageous neglectful act accountable, starting with Gov. Snyder. Many, including filmmaker Michael Moore are even calling for his arrest, and asking for a thorough investigation. Unfortunately, for the people of Flint, MI, the damage is done. The harm from the lead poisoning is irreversible. Justice must be served, and resources allocated to the people of that community to deal with any and all ongoing issues. We also need to make sure this never ever happens again, not only in Flint, but everywhere in this nation and around the globe.Featured image: Wikimedia/Wikimedia",0
8549, Congrats NRA: Man Who Shot Woman At Benghazi Movie Was ‘Afraid Of Mass Shootings’,"A couple of days ago a woman in Washington was shot while watching the Benghazi movie  13 Hours  and thanks to the United States  obsession with guns. We are now learning that the shooter, Dane Gallion, 29, had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting.According to the Seattle Times:Dane Gallion, 29, told officers he took the gun to Regal Cinemas 14 at the Landing on Thursday night because he was  concerned about recent mass shootings in public places,  according to a police account in a probable-cause statement released Saturday.That same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband, the statement says.Think about that for a minute: our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies, he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself.We all know that the  good guy with a gun  rhetoric that the National Rifle Association and Republicans like to spew is complete nonsense, but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws. A great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters.This, of course, doesn t excuse the shooting. It definitely should have never happened. A gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen. Frankly, Gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid; After all, paranoia makes people do reckless things.However, it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country. Personally, I have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time I go to the movies too, or when I drop my elementary school aged child off at school. How sad is that? We live in a country that prides itself on its  freedom,  but how free are we?Featured image: YouTube",0
8550, Donald Trump Promises ‘Christianity Will Have Power’ If He Becomes President,"We all know how much conservatives love to whine about how persecuted they are for their mainstream beliefs, and continue promoting their completely skewed perception of what it s really like to be discriminated against.On Saturday during a speech in Iowa, Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump revisited his previous comments where he d proposed that all Muslims be banned from coming into the United States, offering up a completely out of touch alternative scenario. Trump actually had the audacity to say that he would have had  less difficulty  if he had suggested a ban on Christians from coming into America instead of Muslims! The business mogul said to his audience at Dordt College, a Christian school: If I said that about Christians, and if I said  banned,  I m telling you I would have had less difficulty. And that s pretty sad, because we re Christians. I m Protestant. I m Presbyterian. Trump s faith has been questioned before   especially since he d recently said he doesn t like asking God for forgiveness. Now doing damage control, he s embracing the religious right full force. He said: I m a true believer. And you re many true believers   I hope all   is everybody a true believer in this room? I think so. But Christianity is under tremendous siege. The Donald also lamented that Christians weren t using their full power and political influence in the United States   and that they should step it up. The nonsense he s spewing is actually pretty terrifying: The power of our group of people together, I mean, if you add it up   it could be 240, 250 million. And yet we don t exert the power that we should have. Now, I think some of the churches are afraid of their tax status, to be honest.But you know the fact is that there is nothing the politicians can do to you if you band together. You have too much power. But the Christians don t use their power. We have to strengthen. Because we are getting   if you look, it s death by a million cuts   we are getting less and less and less powerful in terms of a religion, and in terms of a force. Trump pulled out all of the stops, even touching on one of the far-right s biggest religion-based complaints   the supposed  War On Christmas . Complaining that big department stores were not using  Merry Christmas  during the holiday season, he said: When they don t want to say  merry Christmas  in department stores anymore. I won t shop at places that don t say  merry Christmas.  Guess what? I don t too much shopping. No, no, it s true. When I see these stores, and they have a red wall and they have nothing on it. They don t want to say  merry Christmas  anymore. I say,  Why don t you say merry Christmas?' I ll tell you one thing: I get elected president, we re going to be saying  merry Christmas  again. Just remember that. And by the way, Christianity will have power, without having to form. And as if Trump being president wasn t terrifying enough, his promise to giving Christians more power should have everyone running out to the polls to prevent this nightmare from actually happening. He added: Because if I m there, you re going to have plenty of power. You don t need anybody else. You re going to have somebody representing you very, very well. Remember that.

8551, US Marine Puts Sarah Palin In Her Place For Blaming PTSD To Excuse Son’s Violent Behavior,"In an amazing open letter, a former US Marine slammed America s village idiot for having the gall to blame President Obama and PTSD for her son s domestic violence arrest.On the same day she incoherently endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, it was reported that Track Palin had been arrested on weapons and domestic violence charges.Rather than acknowledge that her son broke the law and is responsible for his own actions, Palin chose to blame President Obama and PTSD instead, even though Track Palin never saw combat during his one year in Iraq. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore,  Palin said. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? My son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened, they come back wondering if there s that respect for what it is their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have so sacrificially given to this country.So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. Needless to say, Palin instantly pissed off veterans across the country, including former US Marine Chris Mark, who also happens to be a Republican.In an open letter posted on his blog, Mark ripped Palin to shreds for using PTSD as a political attack and for using it to excuse her son s behavior. I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior,  Mark said.After reminding Palin that her entire family was involved in a drunken brawl that should have served as sign that Track has a problem, he went after Palin for stigmatizing PTSD even more than it already is by th media.Calling her statements  foolish and ignorant,  Mark wrote that he would prefer Palin  avoid public life and simply fade away.  But since she refuses to go away, Mark suggested she educate herself and then use her status as a public figure to help veterans.Here s the full letter via Global Security, Privacy, & Risk Management blog.Dear Mrs. Palin,I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican. I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD. I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD. Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior.In 2014 your entire family was involved in a late night  drunken brawl  at a party in which Track Palin (the accused domestic abuser) was involved in a bloody fight. While you publicly stated how proud you were at your children s violent actions, maybe this should have been a sign that Track has a problem. It is certainly curious that you did not feel the need to reference his supposed PTSD in this situation and instead stated:  my kids  defense of family makes my heart soar!  Maybe, instead of encouraging Track s violence, you should have taken the opportunity to get him help. Maybe, instead of being the result of PTSD, your son was simply trying to uphold the stated Palin family values and  make your heart soar  by abusing a woman.PTSD is stigmatized in the media and not well understood by the general public. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day in the United States. This is nearly 8,000 veterans who take their lives every year. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) stated:  Every day in the United States, 22 veterans succumb to suicide   losing their personal battle to invisible wounds of war.  Veterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements.While I do not propose to speak for all veterans, I am clearly not alone in my views regarding your unfortunate statements. They were unfortunate for the many veterans who face further disdain and discrimination based upon your inaccurate and ignorant portrayal of those who suffer with PTSD as well as the causes of the condition.While I would personally prefer that you simply avoid public life and simply fade away, if you insist on trying to use your  celebrity status  for a cause, please educate yourself on the facts of PTSD and try to help veterans by using your significant influence in a more productive, and less political manner. There are a number of veteran s organizations to which you can donate time, money and energy to make a difference.Regards,Chris MarkAnd there you have it. Sarah Palin made an ass of herself in public again and this Marine called out her stupidity, much like another veteran did during a rally in 2013 after Ted Cruz managed to persuade his fellow conservatives to shut the government down. Palin attempted to use veterans to criticize President Obama for not bowing down to Republican demands when one veteran reminded everyone that she s an idiot.But Palin really stepped in it this time around and now she has to answer to veterans across the country who actually deal with PTSD every day. She owes all of them a huge apology.Featured Image: Fox News",0
8552, WATCH: This Is What Happens When Media Asks Bernie Sanders Idiotic Questions (VIDEO),"During an on interview on This Week, Bernie Sanders had to deal with some seriously weak interview questions. The interviewer, Martha Raddatz brought up an allegation that Sanders  surging campaign has been  unsettling the markets.  That accusation is as ridiculous as it sounds.Here is how the interview went.Martha Raddatz: Senator Sanders, you said something to your supporters yesterday that caught my ear, you quoted with pride a Wall Street Journal article calling you a viable candidate, saying it appears that we are making Wall Street a little bit nervous and that s a good thing. The article was quoting Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman who said the markets are unsettled because of you, a slowdown in China and geopolitical risks. You re laughing, but I want to know why is it a good thing that the markets are in turmoil? People have their pension funds in the market? Lots of middle class people have their 401(k)s invested in stocks. It s not just Wall Street. Everybody is affected by this. Bernie Sanders: The reason that I am laughing is I fully admit to having a big ego, like many other politicians. But the idea that Bernie Sanders  candidacy, because it has growing support all over this country, is unsettling world markets is absolutely absurd. The point I was making is we are getting the attention of Wall Street. Wall Street s greed and recklessness and illegal behavior drove this economy into the worst recession since the Clutch Plague. Millions of people lost their homes, their life savings and their jobs. And yes I believe that we have to break up the major financial institutions. We have to reestablish Glass-Steagall. And that we are now gaining the attention of Wall Street tells me that our campaign is doing very well. Here s the interview:For those not in the know, the Blackstone Group is one of the largest and most powerful private entities on the planet. They currently manage over $300 billion dollars in assists. Stephen Schwarzman currently has a net worth of $9.8 billion dollars. If anyone has been a beneficiary of the deregulation of Wall St., it s Schwarzman. It isn t surprising that he, the WSJ, (who notoriously published a completely debunked hit piece on Sanders) and the mainstream media would be pushing this kind of nonsense. They just want to make it sound like Sanders is coming after people s 401(k)s, etc.Which couldn t be further from the truth. As Sanders pointed out, people lost everything under our current system of Wall Street-take-all finance.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube  h/t Egberto Willies",0
8553," Man Wearing Turban Kicked Out Of Trump Rally, Then Things Get Even More Racist (VIDEO)","At this point, it seems like Donald Trump cannot hold a rally without there being a protest. Some of those protestors have a tendency to be beaten, and or forcefully removed from the event. On Sunday, during a campaign rally in Muscatine, Iowa, a man wearing a red turban was forced to leave the venue.He was with a group of people protesting the event. He was carrying a sign that said,  Stop Hate.  That s a message completely antithetical to the values of Trump and his supporters.A video shows the crowd at the event was ecstatic about the man being forced to leave. Hundreds of people can be heard cheering and shouting,  U.S.A! U.S.A.! U.S.A!  It s a pretty good symbol for where America s racism is at. That s when Trump says: He wasn t wearing one of those hats, was he? Protesters escorted out of @realDonaldTrump rally ""He wasn't wearing one of those hats was he?"" Trump asks crowd pic.twitter.com/Aow23SHZAN  Josh Haskell (@joshbhaskell) January 24, 2016People quickly jumped Trump, thinking that he was referring to the man s turban. Apparently Trump was asking if the man was wearing a  Make America Great Again  hat that Trump supporters use to identify each other with. It s the 21st century equivalent to the white hood the KKK wears. In Trump s America you do not need to cover your face to be openly racist.It isn t hard to believe why people are protesting Trump. Just last week he retweeted @whitegenocideTM, a Twitter account known for putting out images like one that shows Donald Trump pulling the lever on a gas chamber with Bernie Sanders inside. Bernie Sanders being a Jewish man, who embodies everything that Trump and his supporters are against.  Values such as, equality, tolerance, and the idea that everyone deserves a chance to succeed. Donald Trump has brought out the worst of the United States and exposed the Republican for what it is. A party built out of white supremacy.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via Twitter",0
8554, Civil Rights Hero Nearly Killed By KKK Has A Warning About Donald Trump,"Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) was nearly killed by the Ku Klux Klan while helping to lead the Freedom Rides in Alabama in 1961. He knows the destructive power of racist hatred first hand, and he is now warning about the forces that have been stirred up by the divisive presidential campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump. I ve been around a while and Trump reminds me so much of a lot of the things that George Wallace said and did,  Lewis said in an interview with The Times after speaking at Cal State L.A.  I think demagogues are pretty dangerous, really.   We shouldn t divide people, we shouldn t separate people. Sometimes I feel like I am reliving part of my past. I heard it so much growing up in the South,  he said.  I heard it so much during the days of the civil rights movement. As a people, I just think we could do much better. Trump launched his campaign with a divisive message of racism, accusing Mexicans of being criminals and  rapists.  Since then, it has gotten worse. Trump-inspired thugs have attacked Latinos. His campaign supporters have   on multiple occasions   attacked black demonstrators at Trump s own rallies, sometimes egged on by the candidate himself. And Trump has also proposed a ban on Muslim travel to the United States.As former chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Rep. Lewis is the last of the  big six  leaders of the Civil Rights Movement still alive (the others are Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young).Lewis was attacked by the KKK while participating in the Freedom Rides, buses of young activists that went to register black voters in segregated Alabama. The Klan deflated the tires of the bus he was on and forced it to stop. They attacked Lewis and the other riders, beating them for trying to accomplish their peaceful mission. Speaking about the attack years later, Lewis explained,  It was very violent. I thought I was going to die. I was left lying at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery unconscious. Lewis was also beaten by Alabama State Troopers on Bloody Sunday as civil rights marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. His skull was fractured after he and others were hit with night sticks.For his role in the civil rights struggle, Rep. Lewis was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama in 2011.Featured image via The White House",0
8555, SNL Parodies All-White Oscars In Brutal Smackdown (VIDEO),"Last night, Saturday Night Live delivered a brutal blow to Hollywood s diversity issues, calling the Academy Awards out for overlooking minority actors in favor of all-white nominees.The Academy s diversity problem came to light when nominees were announced for the 88th annual Academy Awards  revealing that no black actors were nominated for individual acting categories. If you look at the Awards  entire history, a mere 31 of over 2,900 Oscars have been awarded to African American actors, and it s been two years since a non-white actor has been nominated.Once the nomination lineup was released, many celebrities and directors spoke out against the seemingly racist ceremony, and SNL added its voice to the controversy in a powerful parody. Although SNL never once mentioned the Academy Awards, the show s intention for their  Screen Guild Awards couldn t be more clear as cast member Cecily Strong announced all-white nominees for best actor films representative of Creed,   Straight Outta Compton,  and  Beasts of No Nation. It isn t long before you notice that the  Best Actor  winners are all-white nominees with little to no on-screen or speaking roles. You can watch the video below:Many celebrities such as Jada Pinkett Smith, director Spike Lee, Danny DeVito and Viola Davis have called Hollywood out for its racism and lack of diversity. In no time, #OscarsSoWhite was trending on social media. On Instagram, Lee wrote: We cannot support it and [I] mean no disrespect   But, how is it possible for the second consecutive year all 20 contenders under the acting category are white? And let s not even get into the other branches. Forty white actors in two years and no flava at all. We can t act?! WTF!! Amid the controversy, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has made emergency changes to ensure that more diversity is included in the future. These changes in rules include increasing the number of nominees in every category, expanding the number of films for  best picture  to ten and adding new members to its committees to help make important decisions about membership and governance.Featured image is a screenshot",0
8556, Florida Governor Rick Scott Tax Cut His Way Into Massive HIV/AIDS Comeback,"Rick Scott has been governor of Florida for just over one term but already the state is feeling the effects of his conservative fanaticism. While the rest of the country continues to combat the spread of HIV and the number of people dying from AIDS drops, Florida is seeing the reverse.In a comprehensive review of how Scott s war against government led to his deep slashes in public health funding, the Miami Herald discovered two disturbing facts: Florida now leads the nation in HIV cases, and its biggest county, Miami-Dade, is ground zero.New cases last year totaled 6,240, the highest since 2002. Miami-Dade and Broward together account for 38 percent of that total.Although Florida is among the nation s fastest-growing states, Scott has pushed every year to trim the state work force, and nearly one quarter of those reductions have been in the Department of Health.The 67 county health departments, largely funded by the state health agency, have declined to 10,519 positions compared to 12,759 in the year Scott took office. It s indicative of the neglect of this administration across the board in social services,  said Sen. Oscar Braynon, D-Miami Gardens.  We have a rise in AIDS and we have a reduction in public health spending. We re now cutting just to be cutting. Indeed, Scott is often cited as one of the conservative movement s standard bearers. He s a tax-cutting superstar in the same vein as Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (who imploded his state s economy) and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder (whose neglect poisoned an entire city).However, he differs from his fellow conservative tax-slashers in that he doesn t even seem remorseful for the negative impact he s had. At least Brownback had the decency to break down in tears after destroying his state s job growth. In a disturbing reminder of the Reagan era, when conservative politicians intentionally ignored the AIDS epidemic contributing to the deaths of thousands by their apathy, Scott appears to be unconcerned about this surge in HIV cases. Or perhaps he s just grown used to it. After his first year in office, the number of HIV cases has grown hand-over-fist.Making matters worse, Scott has routinely fought against working with Obamacare in his state. For years. All the while, HIV cases piled up as his budget cuts took hold. This spells disasters for the victims of HIV because the best and only way to prevent it from turning into the much deadlier AIDS illness is careful health management. You can t get that if your governor has refused to expand access to health insurance to spite the President.As we ve seen around the country, Republicans who have grown used to screaming about the  tyranny  of big government are met with disaster when they attempt to get rid of it. Far from the freedom of living a life of liberty and self-determination, states that try to cut government spending only cause misery for the citizens they are trying to  liberate.  It s easy to say as a concept that  government is bad,  but harder to accept that you can no longer get healthcare or build safe roads without it.Florida is learning the hard way that government spending isn t always  wasteful.  Oftentimes it is being used to keep the real threats like illness and poverty at bay.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8557, Superhero Cop Shows Us All What A Good Police Officer Looks Like (IMAGES),"It s not often enough that we see a story about a good police officer who goes above and beyond the call of duty, which is why this story is so awesome.It s true that police officers around the country have developed a bad reputation. There are bad apples in every department who can t keep their guns holstered, and they end up killing unarmed individuals for no reason. The fallout has been swift. And rightfully so.But there are good cops out there who not only do the right thing at work, they do extraordinary things off the clock as well which should be newsworthy, too.Take Damon Cole of the Fort Worth Police Department in Texas, for example.When he isn t fighting crime as a police officer, Cole takes two weeks off every year and spends it traveling the country visiting cancer-stricken children in hospitals dressed as different superhero characters. And he does this on his own time with his own money. I dress up as different Superheroes (Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Captain America and Baymax) and I travel the country seeing children with cancer on my own time and money,  he explained on Facebook. After winter is over I will take 2 weeks off from work and I will go through 20 states in my custom 2012 Superman Dodge Charger to all the children s hospitals. If anyone on here knows of any children who are sick or have cancer, PM and I will go see them. I do NOT charge anything, I do all this on my own time and money. I will go anywhere to make a child happy. I also go to schools or any community functions to talk to kids about being a police officer then a become a Superhero for them. Back in October I took a week off from work and I drove to Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York City and Tennessee to see children with cancer. Here are several photos of Cole in action.Cole even started a non-profit organization called Heroes and Cops Against Childhood Cancer.Here s the full post on Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;This guy is the kind of hero every police officer should aspire to be both in and out of uniform.Featured Image: Facebook",0
8558," Trump’s Billionaire Neighbor Could Enter Race, And Split The Vote For A Trump Win","A fellow multi-billionaire from New York and neighbor to none other than Donald Trump has already laid the groundwork for entering into the 2016 presidential race. That person is Michael Bloomberg   and this time, he s not only flirting with the possibility, but he s also considering throwing in $1 billion of his own money to make it happen. While that may be a lot of dough for the Donald (a sizeable percentage at least) for Bloomberg, it s practically nothing.The former Mayor of New York is no stranger to politics, either, having served in the position for 11 years, and he s worth an estimated $37.2 billion. That makes him the 12th richest person in the world today, according to Forbes. If anyone could make a dent in the race, it s him.He would have to run as an independent, for sure, and while the chances of him winning would be slim to none taking that path, here s what s more important: Bloomberg entering the race would be a straight-up disaster for Democrats, to say the least. And, it makes you start to think along these terms; is a billionaire going to buy the presidency this go around, for a fellow New York billionaire?Mr. Bloomberg says he would be in it to win it, but let s look at the numbers: The Washington Examiner did a poll already on this and had Trump winning in a three-way race if Clinton gets the nomination. Trump would receive around 37 percent of the vote to Clinton s 36 percent while Bloomberg would only tally 13 percent. While it s possible there could still be a Clinton win within the margin of error, it opens up a path for a Trump win, period. Just giving Trump a possible win is enough to make this scary.The elections department at the Huffington Post has a vast array of polls pitting Clinton against Trump, going back months. Guess what, Clinton has won in a head to head matchup against the Donald in 23 out of the last 28 conducted. That s an overwhelming amount. It s safe the say that having an independent of Bloomberg s stature running is something Democrats would rather end up avoiding.Why Bloomberg thinks he would have a chance in this thing, other than to hand the presidency over to the GOP is beyond us. But   according to several sources in his camp, he s apparently hoping that Bernie Sanders takes some key early states, at which case he could step in around an early March time frame. If Bernie takes momentum away from Clinton, Bloomberg thinks he has a chance. Here s what that tells us: Bloomberg could take even more votes away from the Democratic Party   he thinks anyways   than he would from the Republican Party were Sanders to win the nomination. That doesn t look good, either.His record backs that up, too: he s pro-gun control, pro-abortion, recognizes climate control is a huge problem, is for immigration reform; in practically every social view he leans to the left. The only thing that hurts him with Democrats is the fact that he has close ties to Wall Street and has a lot of business views that aren t exactly great for poor people.Even Trump wouldn t mind Bloomberg jumping in. The New York Times even made it the title of their latest article announcing the news: Donald Trump Would  Love  to See Michael Bloomberg Run. I would love to see Michael run   I would love the competition. I d love to see what would happen. (We run) different kinds of business, it s a very different kind of business, but I would say that if he ran, I d be very happy about it. He s not the only one either who sees Bloomberg running as a gold mine for Trump. Alan Patricof, a financier and longtime donor to the Clintons, said it would be a  terrible thing  for the Democratic Party if the former Mayor decides to run as an independent. If it was President Trump or President Bloomberg, I d certainly rather have President Bloomberg. But, it certainly can t help the Democrats. Mr. Patricof might prefer Bloomberg, but that doesn t mean Bloomberg would come out ahead. Ari Fleischer, a former White House Press Secretary for President George W. Bush says this would be a godsend for his party. Bloomberg s entry into the race would be a dream come true for Republicans. He would draw mostly from the Democratic column.  I hope he runs. If there s one thing we know, Bloomberg is no idiot. If he enters the race, he must know he d only be doing a favor for Trump. And, that on the face of it, doesn t make him an enemy of Donald Trump. If anything, it would make them best friends, no matter what they d like voters to think of their relationship to one another.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
8559, Elizabeth Warren Blasts The Entire U.S. Congress For Their Corruption (VIDEO),"On the sixth year anniversary of the Supreme Court s Citizens United v. FEC decision that granted billionaires, millionaires, and special interests the ability to essentially buy U.S. elections by donating virtually unlimited amounts of money to superPACs, Elizabeth Warren wanted to make a statement, and it wasn t pretty. She not only blasted the Supreme Court for the decision, but the entire U.S. Congress, as well. This is what we ve come to expect and love Senator Warren for, and she didn t disappoint. It was brutal, to say the least.Here is what she had to say, in part: Six years ago today the Supreme Court overturned a century of established law. And, in doing so, unleashed a secret flow of corporate money into our political system. The Supreme Court created a big problem, but that does not mean anyone with any integrity must just roll over and play dead. No, it is time to fight back.This Congress doesn t lack for workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics, this Congress just lacks a spine to do it!

Warren does have the courage to stand up to the super wealthy. Would you be excited if Senator Warren was Bernie Sanders choice for Vice President?Posted by Viva Bernie 2016 on Thursday, January 21, 2016She called on Congress to pass three measures to end this none sense once and for all:Pass The Fair Elections Now Act. This will create public funding for congressional elections matching the contributions of small donors so working families would have a louder voice and begin to compete with the rich and powerful. This is a bi-partisan solution, at least outside of Washington. According to a recent poll, Democrats and Republicans both agreed strongly with the idea of citizen-funded elections. 72 percent of Democrats and 62 percent of Republicans said YES. This bill was first introduced by Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) back in 2014. As you may very well know by now, no actions have been taken on it. Take a look, HERE.Pass the Disclose Act. (This will) force super PACs out of the shadow and make them tell us where the money comes from. 91 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Republicans agree they need to disclose the source of their funding. This was re-introduced by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (MD-D) in January 2015 and referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice back on 2/5/2012. Since then, as you might be able to guess, nothing has been done with it. Take a look, HERE.Pass the Shareholder Protection Act. To force companies to tell their shareholders how much money they re giving to politicans and which politicians they re giving it to. This is the shareholders money and they have a right to know how it s spent. And, if they don t like how the money is being spent, they can put somebody else in charge. This bill was re-introduced, as well, by Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) also in January 2015. It was read only twice where it has since collected nothing but dust. Take a look, HERE.She really ended up giving seven ideas, including a constitutional amendment to solve the problem, but summed up the majority of her comments on those first three. Senator Warren decided to speak up on the anniversary of Citizens United because the majority of Congress just doesn t seem to care, and for that we thank her. If anything like this is ever going to get passed, the people will need to DEMAND it.Featured image via screen capture",0
8560, Two Dead After Father-Son Shootout At Gun Store,"An argument over a $25 gun repair charge led to a father-son shootout, at gun store in Mississippi.The shootout involved two different fathers and their sons. According to police, at around 3:00 pm on Saturday a man and his son went to the McLemore Gun Shop, located in Pearl River County. They were there to pick up a gun that had been dropped off for repairs.The man reportedly became irate after being told that the gun was not ready, and that there was a $25 service charge due.The wife of the gun shop owner, who was working the counter at the time, called her husband and son to deal with the angry gun-owner.A tussle broke out between the two fathers and their sons, which led to pushing and shoving, and then a hail of gun fire.WLOX reports that four people were shot during exchange. The 40-year-old owner of McLemore Gun Shop, located in Pearl River County, died from injuries sustained during the shootout. The owner s 17-year-old was also pronounced dead at the scene.The other gun-owner, a father in his 50 s, and his son, described as a man in his late 20 s, were seriously injured during the gun fight. Both men were taken by helicopter to local hospitals.At this time, it s unknown which of the four armed men fired the first shot.According to NRA propaganda, the only way to keep from getting shot is to surround yourself with lots and lots of guns. Yet somehow this gun shop owner and his 17-year-old son are both dead, in spite of the fact that they were surrounded by lots and lots of guns.We keep hearing that  Guns don t kill people. People kill people.  But arguments and shoving matches can not turn into full-fledged shootouts unless there are guns around for angry people to get their hands on.The right wing will tell you that fathers and sons bonding over guns is an  American tradition. Kids getting shot is also a uniquely American tradition. Every year at least 10,000 children under the age of 18 are injured or killed by guns in the United States. We can add another 17-year-old to the nameless statistics that we traditionally count at the end of each year.Featured image credit: Niels Noordhoek via Wikipedia, cc 3.0",0
8561, WATCH: Journalist Kicked Out Of World’s Largest Gun Show For Asking This Totally Valid Question (VIDEO),"Wednesday, January 22 was the day of the world s largest gun show. Held in Las Vegas, Nevada, the SHOT show (Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade) is where arms dealers gather to show off their best and newest instruments of death. Understandably, the event sponsors have to keep a tight grip on media at the event, lest journalists ask questions that might make people think just a little bit.That s why when The Guardian s Rupert Neat went to the show to ask people questions that are indirectly related to gun control, he must have known it would be only a matter of time before he would be thrown out of the event. Neat s experiences were documented on video, and then posted online.In the beginning of the video, Neat says that he was specifically asked not to talk about gun control with any of the more than 1,600 hundred exhibitors at the event. Despite this warning, Neat actually talked to many of the exhibitors and attendees of the event about questions indirectly related to gun control, before being kicked out of the show. Neat asked people what they thought was driving the huge boom in gun sales that were seen last year.They re answers were nearly identical   fear. Fear is what is driving the record sales of firearms in the United States. It has been well documented that mass shootings drive gun sales. So does talk of gun control, when President Obama is elected/reelected, and when minuscule actions on gun control are taken. In December of 2015, after President Obama announced he would be taking executive actions to slightly increase gun regulations, 1.6 million guns were sold. The only other month that has topped that record was in January of 2013, which coincided with both the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre, and Obama s second term.But those types of questions are not what get Neat kicked out of the gun show. While talking to an exhibitor with Smith & Wesson, Neat was shown a MP 1522 sport rifle. Neat held the gun and casually asked the exhibitor: So, is the same gun used in the San Bernardino shooting?  Neat asks.The exhibitor dodged the question, simply answering that the gun is MP 1522 sport rifle. He then promptly removes his microphone. At that point Neat gets an e-mail asking him to come speak to the communications director at the event. Neat and his crew are told multiple times to stop filming, and refused to answer any questions while the camera was rolling. Neat then left the gun show.The truly disturbing   and important   aspect of the encounter between the journalist and man from Smith & Wesson is that it shows how dangerous breaking the fantasy that the NRA and other lobby groups sell, is to gun manufacturers. The goal of public relations is to sell a credible version of reality. The reality that weapons manufacturing industry wants to sell is that their weapons are tools to fight dangerous people, not tools used by dangerous people   or toddlers. Any questioning that can potentially unravel the credibility of their meticulously crafted version of reality must be silenced, or disregarded as the deranged ramblings of lunatics.You can watch the video, in full, below.https://www.facebook.com/GuardianUs/videos/1264293813597683/Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via Facebook/Guardian US",0
8562, WATCH Tina Fey’s Triumphant Return To SNL As Crazy Sarah Palin Endorsing Trump,"Tina Fey once again took on Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, and as always, it was a gutbuster.Fey opened the January 23 edition of the comedy show with the  cold open,  appearing as Palin next to Darrell Hammond s always-on-point rendition of Donald Trump. The two were re-enacting Palin s bizarre endorsement of Trump from earlier in the week.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDKKe04sBQIntroducing her, Trump said,  I hope nobody s allergic to nuts, because we got a big one here. Palin then launched into a monologue eerily reminiscent of the real thing, freestyle rhyming about the Americans she supposedly is representing as part of the Trump trainwreck.Palin explained,  I belong in [Trump s] cabinet.  Cause I m full of spice, and I ve got a great rack. In a moment made for social media, Fey/Palin also spoke in tongues, shooting off her finger guns:Speaking for most of America, Trump noted,  She s crazy, isn t she? Fey of course also appeared in a version of Palin s blinding blouse from the event, and many observers on social media pointed out that in addition to the shocking visual similarity between the two women, Fey had once again nailed Palin s accent and bizarre language.In 2008, Fey s impression of Palin set the comedy world on fire and SNL s ratings skyrocketed. The failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor was repeatedly a source of material for the premiere satirical program in America, with her assertion that she read  all  of the media, and that Alaska provided a vantage point for oversight of Russia s Vladimir Putin.Palin recently tried to return the favor, appearing as Fey in a sketch for a conservative website, but despite the visual similarities, the skit mostly fell flat. Instead of going for the joke, as Fey has on SNL, Palin chose to promote a political message about  political correctness  and  safe spaces. Featured image via Twitter",0
8563, Dixie Chicks’ Natalie Maines Dusts Off Infamous Quote To Thoroughly Troll Ted Cruz (TWEET),"It s hard to believe that it s been nearly 13 years since Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks perfectly spoke her mind in reference to the impending Iraq war. If you don t remember what she said, let me remind you: Just so you know, we re on the good side with y all. We do not want this war, this violence, and we re ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas. This, of course, sparked a huge backlash against not only Maines, but the Dixie Chicks. People everywhere couldn t believe that she d have the perfect audacity to speak up against an unjust war and against the president who was leading the charge into Iraq. Dissent is usually considered patriotic, but apparently not if the dissenting voice is against a warmongering conservative president.Well, dusting off her infamous quote on Twitter, Maines just completely roasted Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz. Another Republican from Texas who loves war and wouldn t think twice about send our troops anywhere he thought there was a need, necessary or not. Diplomacy be damned.Maines tweeted:Just so you know .I'm ashamed Ted Cruz is from America;) pic.twitter.com/QU39ERnAzN  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016And mind you, the quotes are absolutely perfect that she chose. The first being from former President Eisenhower, a man who knew the dangers of war, because he lived through the worst we ve ever had. Then paired with Sen. Cruz, a Canadian born chickenhawk, and far from the Republican that Eisenhower was, who claims he ll  carpet bomb  the enemy to make them  glow in the dark. Maines reminds America of the stupidity of electing yet another senseless fool to the White House and the inevitable war it would cause. A war that would send thousands more of our troops to unnecessarily die. However, Maines does it with a perfectly sarcastic spin when she says: Just so you know .I m ashamed Ted Cruz is from America;) The wink is seemingly insinuating two things: that he s a repeat of George W. Bush, so the same quote was necessary, and also that he was born in Canada, which was confirmed with this tweet:I stand corrected Just so you know, I'm ashamed Ted Cruz claims to be American. pic.twitter.com/JUltNImOXH  Natalie Maines (@1NatalieMaines) January 24, 2016Cruz is definitely a person to be ashamed of, because not only is he dangerous, he s smarmy as hell and as greasy as a used car salesman to get what he wants done. Even if that means reading Green Eggs and Ham on the floor of the Senate to shut down the United States government.Good on you, Maines.. Well frickin  done. Never EVER stop speaking the truth.Featured image: YouTube/Twitter",0
8564, Michigan Government To EPA: ‘You Can’t Tell Us What To Do’,"On January 22, in response to an emergency order issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the Flint water crisis, Michigan s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) Director, Keith Creagh, wrote that the state is questioning whether the EPA has  legal authority  to  order a state and its agencies  to act to protect the health of its citizens.The order, issued by the EPA on Thursday, states: The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) provides the US Environmental Protection Agency with the authority to order actions when an imminent and substantial endangerment exists and the actions taken by the state/and or local authorities are inadequate to protect public health. EPA has determined that the city of Flint and the state of Michigan s responses to the drinking water crisis in Flint have been inadequate to protect public health and that these failures continue. As a result, the EPA is issuing this emergency order to make sure that the necessary actions to protect public health happen immediately. Under the order, the state of Michigan is required to  promptly  provide the public with  necessary information,  in a  clear and transparent way to assure that accurate, reliable and trustworthy information is available to inform the public and decisions about next steps. That includes an order to create a public website where the state is required to post all reports, sampling results, plans, weekly status reports and  all other documents required under this order. As many people already realize, the Snyder administration is not fond of transparency. Michigan is one of only two states in the country in which the governor is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Emergency managers and other members of Snyder s administration have conducted business behind closed doors throughout Snyder s two terms as governor, leading to repeated battles over violations of the state s open meetings act.Aside from releasing relevant information to the public, the EPA order requires the Snyder administration to provide the Flint EPA Task Force with all of the information it has been trying to get from Michigan officials since November. You can view the long list of items that the state has refused to turn over to the Task Force here. The state now has ten days to produce all of that information.The Snyder administration must also bring in qualified professionals to deal with the situation, something else the state was instructed to do, but has not done. The state has 15 days to comply.The EPA s order provides a detailed overview of the ongoing failures of the state, Snyder appointed emergency managers in Flint, and Snyder appointed officials at the DEQ.As Addicting Info reported here, the state supplied the EPA with documents that were altered and test results that were purposely skewed to make it appear that the water in Flint was fine.During the annual State of the State address, Michigan s governor Snyder told the citizens that he was very sorry for poisoning the residents Flint.He went on to say: You deserve accountability. You deserve to know that the buck stops here with me. Creagh s unbelievable two-fold response to the EPA order can be read as  we haven t done anything wrong,  followed by  you don t have the authority to make us do anything right. How s that for accountability?Creagh states in his response to the EPA that the state will comply with the EPA s order, but intends to  fully outline the state s legal and factual concerns  as to whether or not the EPA has the  authority  to issue the order.On Wednesday the state of Michigan received $80 million from the federal government, in addition to the $5 million that was granted to the state earlier this month, following the declaration of state of emergency in Flint. So every U.S. taxpayer is now paying the bill for Snyder s corruption and incompetence.Yet the Snyder administration has the audacity to claim that the EPA doesn t have the authority to tell the state what to do.It s disgusting and infuriating that Snyder s administration has to be forced to do what it should have done months ago. These are basic things, like getting the necessary information to the public, cooperating with the EPA Task Force and bringing in trained and qualified professionals who can address the situation. These are things the Snyder administration should have done without an order from the federal government, but they did not.In the midst of all of this, the people of Flint are struggling to cope with a crisis that most of us cannot even fathom.Featured image credit: Duncan Creamer via Flckr cc 2.0",0
8565, Bundy Terrorist Dragged His Little Girls Out Of School To Serve As Human Shields In Oregon Standoff,"What kind of man would pull his daughters from the safety of their school and place them in the middle of an armed standoff? A Bundy terrorist.On January 2nd, Ammon Bundy and his deranged band of gun-toting marauders seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in an effort to force the federal government to release two idiot ranchers who illegally set fire to federal land. The pair were sentenced to five years in prison, which is the mandatory sentence for such a crime.Of course, Bundy and others who dare to call themselves a  militia  decided to takeover the wildlife refuge in protest and are hoping to spark a war with federal law enforcement. But they arrived abysmally unprepared and began begging the public to send them supplies to aid in their lawbreaking, which thus far includes treason, domestic terrorism, illegally carrying firearms on federal property, property damage, threatening law enforcement, disturbing Native American artifacts, and being total douchebags.And now we can add child endangerment and abuse to the growing list.According to Oregon Public Broadcasting, a terrorist within Bundy s camp actually pulled his little girls, 8 and 9 years of age, out of their school and brought them to the wildlife refuge:OPB is not naming the kids, nor their parents, to protect the identity of the children, but the mother and father are active and vocal militants in the armed occupation. Both parents have been involved in the incident since its start Jan. 2.The children were visible inside one of the buildings Thursday evening. One of the little girls asked to come outside by a campfire but was not allowed. The kids were also seen playing and wrestling together in a hallway in their pajamas.The kids are from out of state and have been at the refuge since early this week. They spend most of their time out of sight of reporters and visitors.So these little girls have basically been held hostage for the last three weeks and have not been allowed outside all this time. They are surrounded by loaded firearms and by assholes of questionable character.They have also missed significant school time and they probably aren t receiving proper nourishment either. And as you ll recall, the last time the Bundys had a little standoff with federal law enforcement, they were cowardly and used women and children as human shields.This is child endangerment and abuse and it s time to arrest these monsters before something terrible happens to these little girls. Federal authorities have allowed this dog and pony show go on long enough and we all know that if this were an armed group of Muslims or black men, there would be no hesitation to shoot them on site whether they are armed or not. But for some reason, these white rednecks have been given free reign while the Justice Department looks the other way. Two little girls are being forced to stand in the crossfire while Ammon Bundy gets to come and go as he pleases.Enough is enough. Bundy and his minions have had their fun. Now it s time for them to face the consequences of their stupidity.Featured image: Babble",0
8566, That Time An Ohio Ammosexual 2nd Amendmented Himself In A Chik-Fil-A Bathroom,"Ammosexuals also tend to be anti-gay bigots, so it s no surprise that this particular unfortunate victim of his own love of his penis extension gun would shoot himself in the bathroom of a Chik-fil-A location.While most of us boycott the Christian chicken chain out of sheer principle, but not the 45-year-old victim of his own hubris. He was apparently pulling up his pants in the facilities of the locations (hey, even gun nut heroes have to use the john now and then, right?) when the Glock pistol went off. Luckily for the unnamed miscreant, the bullet only grazed his leg. Hardly a fatal injury, of course, but still quite unfortunate and dangerous.Local station WHOH tweeted the story, but, at this time, there is not much information. The victim was able walk out of the Chik-Fil-A location and transport himself to a local hospital for medical care. The injury is not serious, and, of course, no charges will be filed.BREAKING: Fairfield Twp police and medics say a man accidentally shot himself in the bathroom of the Chick-fil-a. pic.twitter.com/GwXHFz12MI  WMOH Newswire (@WMOHNEWSWIRE) April 28, 2015That s the real rub, though. This guy luckily only shot himself. However, how many incidences have there been of  responsible gun owners  injuring or even killing other people where the law decides that it was just an accident? Too many to count, really. This is just evidence of the fact that we need tighter laws regarding firearm ownership. Not everyone who is eligible to buy, own, and conceal carry a gun should be able to do so.This guy likely was another nutjob who couldn t bear to be anything but fully locked and loaded, even in a public restroom in a self-proclaimed family restaurant, and he was injured as a result. What about next time, though? And, believe me, there will be a next time. No one who is irresponsible enough to have an  accident  like this is a one-off shooter. In fact, if  he were any sort of normal, responsible gun owner, he d have never been pulling his pants up in a Chik-Fil-A bathroom with a fully loaded gun in the first place.Featured image via video screen capture from NY Daily News",0
8567, Cher Goes On Yet Another GLORIOUS Twitter Tirade About Flint’s Poisoned Water (TWEETS),"Cher has certainly used her power, money, and influence to help the people who are suffering from their water being poisoned by Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder. She has already gifted water to the residents of Flint, and now she is using her influence on social media to remind the whole world just what a travesty the whole situation is.First, the superstar singer-turned-activist reminded everyone of her own humble beginnings. You see, Cher wasn t always rich and famous. She was, in fact, quite poor, as she reveals in one tweet. However, she also says that no matter how destitute they were, her mother was never afraid to let her drink or bathe in the water flowing from their taps:I remember my mom crying because she couldn't make ends meet,I was sick & she couldn't afford Dr  BUT..SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF OUR WATER  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016She also posted picture of the water that the residents of Flint  had been assured was  safe  until this scandal broke, and they are nothing short of absolutely horrifying. It looks more like mud than water, and is clearly unsafe. However, considering that Flint s residents are mostly destitute African Americans, we can be assured that their situation didn t matter to the right, white GOP governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management people who made this nightmare a reality.How would U like 2 wake up Tomm & have nothing but  water 2 give your kids 2 DRINK,BATHE IN WASH CLOTHES IN pic.twitter.com/lxhkhSAB72  Cher (@cher) January 23, 2016Cher then tweeted a photo of the water running into a washing machine to wash a family s clothing. It is nothing short of deadly, and that is why people are dying and children who have been drinking and bathing in that water have elevated lead levels in their young bloodstreams, which will likely affect them for the rest of their lives.Cher, Flint s own native son Michael Moore, and many other people in positions of power and influence are just as outraged by this as the rest of us. Luckily, they have the money, power, know-how, and resources to actually do something about it. And they are.Hopefully, the next step will be to get this disgusting excuse for a human being and a governor, Rick Snyder, out of office, and into the dustbins of history with other rightfully disgraced politicians.Featured image via Cher Twitter",0
8568," Jeb Bush Cherishes A Secret Ambition — And No, It’s Not Being POTUS (VIDEO)","Jeb Bush was, once upon a time in a land far, far away, assumed to be the shoo-in for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Then, Donald Trump happened, and Jeb s dreams of presidential glory were crushed. In fact, Jeb s campaign is in such trouble now that he had to get his mommy to appear in a political ad reminding everyone that her son should be the GOP s annointed one, and that Trump is just a big bully.Well, it s a good thing that as Jeb s campaign circles the drain and dies, he has other dreams to fulfill. Bizarrely, it s to be a G-rated killer on the hit fictional drama about the U.S. government, Homeland.Apparently, the series The Circus caught Jeb admitting on camera that he d like nothing more than to kill people on television. The thing is, though, Trump is right about one thing. Jeb Bush is a lackluster dork who would be nothing more than a laughingstock on that series. In fact, he very presence would likely make it jump the shark. Nevertheless, it s highly entertaining to realize the revelation that acting in a television drama is the next best thing to really being POTUS in Jeb s feeble mind.Give it up, Jeb. You ll never appear on Homeland, and you ll never be POTUS. No worries, though. You have plenty of time and money. I m sure you ll find something constructive to do.Watch the video of Jeb s confession below:Featured image via video screen capture.",0
8569, Trump Spokesperson Upset At Lack Of ‘Pure Breeds’ Running For President (TWEETS),"It gets more outrageous by the day for the Trump campaign when it comes to racism and racists. It appears Trump has assembled a political team and a fan base of individuals who are racist to the core. Take for example current Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson. Back in 2012, Pierson took to Twitter and lamented at the lack of  pure breeds running for president in reference to President Obama, who has a father of Kenyan descent, and Mitt Romney, whose father was born in Mexico.Perfect Obama's dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney's dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate  Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 20, 2012In her tweet, Pierson implies that having a parent born oversees somehow makes someone less American, or to put it in more eugenical terms, less pure.  That s interesting, since Donald Trump s mother was actually born in Scotland. One can easily infer why she would find Scotland more acceptable to be born in than Kenya or Mexico.Pierson is in agreement on all of Trump s policies, including supporting the ban on Muslims from entering the United States. She also advocates using America s nuclear arsenal in some capacity against perceived enemies saying,  What good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you re afraid to use it? Katrina Pierson is not without a checkered history. She s been accused of collecting thousands of dollars in welfare benefits while working.  She also made a recent appearance on CNN where she wore a necklace made of bullets. After anti-gun advocates called her out, she promised to wear a necklace made of fetuses. Pierson also has an arrest record for shoplifting.  Ironically, four years before her wacky tweet, Pierson sued her previous employer for racial discrimination.Donna Pierson s antics and her checkered history shouldn t be surprising. After all, she s helping steer one of the most racist and frightening presidential campaigns in American history. Let s hope that the country can find a few good laughs with these crazies and put them all in the dust bin of history when the time comes.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",0
8570, ‘Martyrs Without Causes’: Maher Calls Out Crazies On Both The Right And The Left (VIDEO),"Bill Maher is all about telling it like it is, and that is just what he did on his  New Rules  segment of Friday night s edition of his HBO show Real Time. First, the comedic host took the terrorists who are currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to task, and rightly pointed out that they really don t have a reason for being there. He zeroed in on notorious anti-Muslim nutjob Jon Ritzheimer, who infamously filmed a hilarious   goodbye  video to his children, saying  your daddy swore an oath,  and that s why he can t be there. Maher said of Ritzheimer and his video: Just listen here to one them,  patriot  Jon Ritzheimer, explaining to his kids in a video he posted from his truck, why he had to leave. After playing a clip of Ritzheimer, Maher said: Wow, seems like a lot of trouble to go to just to  get out of spending time with your family at the holidays Why not just drink like the rest of us. The host then went on to mock the  shopping list  of supplies the Oregon militants were requesting from the public so that they can continue their lawless occupation of federal property indefinitely.Maher didn t stop, there, though. After blasting the militants, he reminded those of us on the left that we have our own brand of crazy. He played a clip of a Yale student s expletive-filled rant regarding offensive Halloween costumes at a professor that was trying to make an argument for free speech.While microaggressions and cultural appropriation are definitely a problem, there are people who go too far in their opposition to such things. That kind of ranting behavior only makes the cause and its supporters look nuts, and makes everyone who shares the ideology lose credibility to seem just as crazy.In conclusion, Maher also pointed out that there s not much difference between the extremists of the two sides, and that s something everyone should think about, regardless of political ideology.Extremism in either direction   just not a good thing.Watch the hilarious, and oh so true, clip below:Featured image: screen capture",0
8571, Glenn Beck Endorses Ted Cruz In A Series Of BIZARRE Tweets Declaring Their Bromance,"It s a bromance for the ages. One that may go down in history. Glenn Beck, while on the campaign trail in Iowa with Ted Cruz, formally endorsed the Republican candidate. However, that s not even the half of it.For most of the day, Beck was sending out these cryptic love notes regarding his feelings towards Cruz. Even going so far as to imply that Cruz is the next George Washington. Althoug, George Washington was actually born in the United States, we can t say as much for Cruz.The tweets really need to be put into letter form, so that s exactly what I ll do for you here: This election is about more than someone who understands your anger; it is about those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with you. I used to worry folks would vote party over principle. This year is worse   it s paparazzi over principle. I need more than someone to vice my anger   I need someone to have my back. The George Washington we need will not be found in the garish light of gold. Do we really want another 8 years of a president who views his role as a Benevolent Dictator? The president does not create jobs. He helps create the conditions in which WE THE PEOPLE create jobs and change lives.I have prayed for the next George Washington   I believe I have found him. The presidency is not just a man, it is principles. That s why I stand with Ted Cruz. Our children deserve hope of a better tomorrow than our yesterdays; they deserve Ted Cruz. I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic president!Connect with truth. Connect with freedom. Connect with Cruz.No, one man makes America great. But each of us as individuals, living our own lives, believing in our own strengths. That makes the USA great. Well, actually Beck, you ve made it pretty darn clear that you believe Ted Cruz is going to be your one and only in making the nation what you want it to be. While your passion for Cruz can be admired, your facts regarding your beloved candidate aren t quite accurate. Ted Cruz is no George Washington. Not even close. However, keep believing in your heart of hearts that Cruz is the man of your campaign dreams. If it s something you can hold close, do it. It may be all you have this election season.Here s the full series of tweets with a few jabs thrown at Trump and Hillary Clinton as well:This election is about more than someone who understands your anger; it is about those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with you.

8572," Well, It Happened – Trump Proves He’s A Traitor In Favor Of A New Confederacy (TWEET)","Either Donald Trump doesn t ever look at who he is retweeting, or he does, and that s pretty damn frightening. Not only did he just retweet yet another white supremacist Twitter account, but now he s gone and retweeted an account that wants Texas to be its own country and to re-establish the Confederate States of America.""@TheSouthwasRite: @NRO cancelling my subscription- you people are idiots. @realDonaldTrump WILL be our next President. #Trump2016 #RNC""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2016The owner of the Twitter handle the Republican presidential frontrunner retweeted quite literally wants to leave the United States of America, saying in their bio: Texas alone could be its own country. Let s re-establish the Confederate States of America. Other states would join. As you can tell, this person clearly wants to split from the United States, and also clearly wants Trump as president.via TwitterAnd as a person that is running for President of the United States of America, you d think, maybe, just maybe, he wouldn t endorse such a tweet with a retweet of approval. By doing so, it reaffirms the position held by the person he s retweeting and makes it appear as though he also wants the nation to once again be divided. So much for making America great again.Sure, the tweet itself was in regards to this person wanting to end their National Review subscription, but holy sh*t, Trump couldn t have found a better person to retweet? Who the hell is working his social media campaign?What this really is indicative of is the sort of people responding to Trump s racist rhetoric that he s been touting since the start of his presidential campaign. His white pride attitude is drawing all the racists out from their holes, and they are feeling perfectly comfortable being openly bigoted in public. After all, a major party frontrunner is saying these things, so why can t they?The Republican party needs to put Trump in check or he will be their nominee, and if this is the sort of candidate they want to run, well, then we certainly know which party is the party of racism. And since you need the minority vote to win these days, thanks in advance from the Democrats.Featured image: Flickr/Flickr",0
8573, This Brutal Ad Exposes Donald Trump For Every Liberal Position He’s Ever Had (VIDEO),"An anti-Trump Super PAC has just released a new attack ad highlighting just how untrustworthy and flip-floppy the GOP presidential candidate has become over the years. It turns out that historically, the business mogul has supported more liberal positions than conservative ones.The main purpose of the ad was to get Americans to open their eyes and ask themselves, How much do we really know about Donald Trump? The ad was released by Our Principles PAC, which was founded by Katie Packer, a deputy campaign manager on Mitt Romney s 2012 presidential campaign. Packer told Politico: Our Principles PAC has focused on conservative principles and ensuring that voters have the necessary information to make a wise decision on Election Day. The ad contains back-to-back footage of Trump supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and praising President Barack Obama, while backing conservative no-nos like universal healthcare and abortion. In one part of the ad, Trump admits that he leans more toward the Democrat party and even says that Republicans are just too crazy right. At the end of the ad, the text reads, With a record like this, how can we trust Donald Trump?  Hillary Clinton s voice is also heard, saying that Trump is basically a Democrat.  She says: He was basically a Democrat and he was supportive of Democrats. He was supportive of a lot of the causes that I cared about and people I knew cared about. This anti-Trump video is called The Trump Tapes: Vol. 1,  which we hope means that the Super PAC plans to release more soon.Many people are aware that Trump has made some of these statements, but seeing all of this footage together really drives the message home. The fact that it came from conservatives makes it even better.TwitterOur Principles Super PAC has also created an accompanying website to the attack ads, called Trumpquestions.com, which is worth checking out   it s full of articles that highlight just how dishonest the current Republican front-runner really is.Featured image is a screenshot",0
8574, Michigan Militia Group Turns On Right-Wing Governor Rick Snyder,"As a general rule, militia groups do not side with liberals on anything. But as Michigan reels under revelations of conspiracy and collusion at all levels of republican Governor Rick Snyder s administration, militia members have added their voice to the chorus of citizens calling for Snyder s arrest.As reported by the Detroit Free Press, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia will be staging a protest in the city of Flint, demanding answers from state officials regarding the city s poisoned water. The protest will be held on January 23, just one week after filmmaker and activist Michael Moore staged a similar protest in the city.In a press release concerning the upcoming protest, the Genesee County Volunteer Militia stated: It is nothing less than shocking that our elected officials would try to hide the hazards that residents are being subjected to just by drinking a simple glass of tap water!!! On its Facebook page, the militia group has also issued a call for the state s emergency manager law to be overturned by the Michigan legislature. This echoes the sentiments of an overwhelming majority of Michigan citizens, many who voted to repeal the law in 2012.Following the voter repeal, the state legislature, which is almost entirely controlled by republican and Tea Party representatives, simply rewrote the emergency manager law and passed it again, this time with a rider to ensure it could not be repealed by voters.Image: scree capture, Genesee County Volunteer Militia, *names redactedLike other militia groups around the state, the Genesee County Volunteer militia displays the Tea Party flag on their Facebook page.This week it was widely reported that Governor Snyder has hired two out-of-state PR firms to try to help him with his public image.No doubt Snyder was hoping to paint the Flint water scandal as a  leftist  attack. The trouble with that narrative is that Michigan militia members are the furthest thing from  leftist  as you can get.When the pro-gun militia stands shoulder to shoulder with the producer of the anti-gun documentary  Bowling for Columbine,  you ve got the kind of problems not even two hundred PR firms can fix.Dave McKellar, a member of the Genesee militia group, told the Detroit Free Press that the group not only agrees with Michael Moore, but that they are trying to coordinate protests with the filmmaker, so that they do not stop.To be clear, we re not saying that we think the militia should bring out their weapons and march through the streets of Flint. To be clear, there hasn t been any indication that Sunday s protest will be an armed protest.Still it is very significant that even far-right groups like the Volunteer militia, which have consistently voted for and defended Michigan s republican/Tea Party legislature, are now turning against the people they helped put in office.Image credit: screen capture Genesee County Volunteer Militia",0
8575, Donald Trump Just Told His Fans They’re Stupid TO THEIR FACES – And They Cheered (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s heavily-conservative base is filled to the brim with stupid people. It s one thing for polls and studies to prove that TrumpFans are absolute morons, but it s another for the billionaire 2016 hopeful to actually admit it.On Saturday at an Iowa campaign rally, Trump told his fanatical followers to their faces that they are so stupid they would even support him if he shot someone in broad daylight, in front of a crowd of people. I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters, ok? It s, like, incredible. Yes, it is incredible. It s incredible in the first place that anyone regardless of political leanings could support a man who wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States (even if they are returning from vacation), waste taxpayer dollars to build a gigantic wall, make followers of Islam register in a national database and wear special badges to let everyone know their religion, and throw them in concentration camps as a  temporary measure. It s almost baffling.But what is more baffling is that Trump standing before a crowd and telling them they are so stupid they would continue to support him if he murdered someone in cold blood in a scenario in which there is no question of his guilt does absolutely nothing to dissuade them from supporting him.He is right   the loyalty of his fans is iron-clad, and it is clear that they love him no matter what he does or says, no matter how horrible.Trump is probably right: He could probably shoot someone in front of a crowd of people, and his followers would defend him   especially if the victim was black, gay, Muslim, Jewish, or anyone who wasn t a white Christian conservative. Even then, it is unlikely their support would waver Because they re f*cking stupid.Watch Trump tell his followers how stupid they are below:Featured image via screengrab",0
8576, That Constitution The Bundy Terrorists Tote Around Is A Perverted Version Of The Real Thing (VIDEO),"You may have seen the pocket version of the United States Constitution the Bundy Bunch carries around. The distinctive picture of George Washington on the cover is a clear giveaway that not only do these imbeciles not understand the laws of our land, they rely on the interpretations of a man whose thoughts on the hallowed document have been compared to  a warm bucket of spit. It s a convenient version for the right-wing terrorist; it retains the original spelling and punctuation from the 18th century, leaving it completely intact and just the way they like it. Read between the lines, however, and you ll find the thoughts and analysis of a man who once called President Eisenhower a Soviet agent. His name is W. Cleon Skousen, once referred to by TIME Magazine as  an exemplar of the right-wing ultras. Skousen s commentary has long been mocked as an attempt to connect the constitution to religion, making it a favorite among zealots and meatheads like the Oregon  patriots.  It holds dear the idea that America was founded as a  Christian Nation  and includes such revolutionary insights as this:-W. Cleon SkousenIt s not only his own thoughts added that make Skousen s pamphlet such a perversion of the actual constitution but the thoughts of some of the founders themselves, taken completely out of context and used as talking points to sell a disturbing message. For example, John Adams, who said,  Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,  was taken from a letter to militia intended to see them do more good deeds for the people.The pamphlet, available for 35 cents, has zero respect in the educated world. Scholars have repudiated its teachings for decades and its author ended up dying in obscurity without ever achieving his goal of convincing people who government was of the people, by the people, and for God.Ammon Bundy, who has been photographed both at the current occupation and at the Bundy  ranch  incident in 2014, had the principles of the Skousen Constitution ingrained in him by his father, Cliven Bundy, who told the LA Times:  It s something I ve always shared with everybody and I carry it with me all the time. That s where I get most of my information from. What we re trying to do is teach the true principles of the proper form of government. The proper form of government is apparently one discredited right-wing nutjob s distorted views of a document that has been proven time and time again to have nothing to do with religion. The modern conservative just loves it, however, because it embodies everything they believe in. With the Skousen atrocity of critical thought in their pockets, they are prepared to do whatever it takes to see that they can do whatever they want while denying actual constitutional rights to people who disagree with them.The terrorists in Oregon have decided to use one very specific portion of the pamphlet that pertains to  The Enclave Clause,  which they believe means that the federal government cannot own land. They believe that because it says it, right there in black in white, in the one and only Skousen mockery of the constitution.Here s Bundy Buffoon Jon Ritzheimer, making a ridiculous argument for the Enclave Clause, which he clearly doesn t understand, while holding his very own copy of this perverted pamphlet:https://www.facebook.com/scrappyphx.rider/videos/472699262917879/You can read about the ACTUAL meaning of the Enclave Clause HERE.It s absolutely amazing that so many people have decided to be influenced by one discredited man s interpretation of a document that is over 200 years old. While this is America and everyone is entitled to their opinion, Article 3 Section 2 pretty clearly reserves the right to decide matters of law and equity arising under the Constitution to the Supreme Court, who typically (though not always) rely on a couple of centuries of precedent, not the opinion of one asshole, to make their decisions. They sit in a really big building in Washington DC that is most definitely owned by the federal government.The bottom line is, these people have been seriously misguided by a strange and lonely man whose views have been circulated among extremists and laughed at by scholars since the 1960s.Featured image via screen capture",0
8577, Conservative Icon And National Review Founder William F. Buckley Loathed Donald Trump,"Donald Trump thinks conservative icon William F. Buckley would oppose the National Review s attack against him. William F. Buckley disagreed 16 years ago.Earlier this week, the National Review launched an all-out assault against Donald Trump, branding him a  charlatan  who isn t a real conservative. Virtually every Republican presenting himself to voters swears so-help-me-God that he is a conservative,  wrote Brent Bozell among multiple other writers for the publication. Enter Donald Trump, not just with policy prescriptions that challenge the cynical GOP leadership but with an attitude of disdain for that leadership precisely in line with the sentiment of the base. Many conservatives are relishing this, but ah, the rub. Trump might be the greatest charlatan of them all. In response, the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe took to Twitter to blast the National Review and he invoked its founder William F. Buckley, claiming that Buckley would be disappointed in his creation.National Review is a failing publication that has lost it s way. It s circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead.   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016The late, great, William F. Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2016The only problem with Trump s use of William F. Buckley as a defense is that Buckley actually wrote down what he thinks of Trump and the prospect of him running for office as a conservative candidate. As it turns out, Buckley slammed Trump 16 years ago and predicted this very scenario that Trump is playing out today. Look for the narcissist,  Buckley wrote in 2000.The most obvious target in today s lineup is, of course, Donald Trump. When he looks at a glass, he is mesmerized by its reflection. If Donald Trump were shaped a little differently, he would compete for Miss America. But whatever the depths of self-enchantment, the demagogue has to say something. So what does Trump say? That he is a successful businessman and that that is what America needs in the Oval Office. There is some plausibility in this, though not much. The greatest deeds of American Presidents   midwifing the new republic; freeing the slaves; harnessing the energies and vision needed to win the Cold War   had little to do with a bottom line. In the final analysis, just as the king might look down with terminal disdain upon a courtier whose hypocrisy repelled him, so we have no substitute for relying on the voter to exercise a quiet veto when it becomes more necessary to discourage cynical demagogy, than to advance free health for the kids. That can come later, in another venue; the resistance to a corrupting demagogy should take first priority.In short, William F. Buckley would be horrified that Trump is so far ahead in the Republican primary polls and would be disappointed that the conservative movement has become an anti-intellectualism and anti-science base of stupid people. And with Sarah Palin endorsing Donald Trump, it stands to reason that if Buckley were still alive, he d die of embarrassment, but not before using his command of language to tell the new conservative base to go f*ck themselves.Featured Image: YouTube",0
8578," The Last Time This Happened, It Signaled The Global Financial Crash Of 2008. Now, It’s Happening Again.","The last time this trade measure fell dramatically, it signaled the incoming global financial crash of 2007/2008. Now, it s happening again. Only this time, it s dropped to the lowest point in its history.The Baltic Dry Index tracks the cost of shipping  dry goods  around the world. Historically, it has served as a sort of  bellwether  for the global economy. Why? Well, if the prices fall, it means that trade is dropping. If trade is dropping, the economy is about to take a hit.Now, back in late 2013, the Baltic Dry Index was flying high at 2,330. And even last August, it was still at a healthy 1,222.This week, it crashed to just 354.Image via Business InsiderThe reason this should stop us all in our tracks, is that the last time this happened, it heralded the global financial crisis of 2008   from which many economies have yet to recover. And back then, it was still over 600.As Business Insider reports:There are several other occasions when the index has pointed to a big correction in the global economy. The Baltic Dry Index has existed in its current state since 1985, and it had its first big drop in mid-1986, just under a year before the Black Monday crash hit markets in 1987.In 1999 the Baltic Dry slumped to 12-year lows, very soon before the dot-com bubble burst. It slumped again to another massive low in 2001, around the same time the US economy fell into a recession that lasted until 2003.Does this mean we are definitely going to have a crash on the scale of 2008? No. It would be foolish to argue this test is infallible. But is it, together with other warning signs in the economy, something to which we should be paying serious attention? Absolutely.William White, former chief economist at Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements, has warned that an epic debt tsunami is about to wash over the global economy, and that: The situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up, The only question is whether we are able to look reality in the eye and face what is coming in an orderly fashion, or whether it will be disorderly. White is not alone. Banks like Goldman Sachs and the Royal Bank of Scotland have issued their own stark warnings about impending financial crisis. On top of that, Jeremy Penn, the Baltic Exchange s CEO, told The Telegraph: We are now at the stage where people are struggling to remember an era when it was this difficult, we ve gone through what it was like in the  90s, the  80s, and the  70s, so expressions like  living memory  start to apply, In short, we ignore these warnings at our peril.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",0
8579, White High-Schoolers Break The Internet With This Truly Racist Yearbook Photo (IMAGES),"A group of seniors from Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona posed for their yearbook photo this week. But instead of high fiving, or the lens snapping them mid-leap   they opted to spell out a racial slur with their t-shirts. The image has since gone on to break the internet.It s fairly common for Seniors to celebrate their photo day with t-shirts that, when they assemble for a group photo, spell out a word or phrase. It could be the name of the school, their social group, or so on. But as AZ Central reports, this one was different:A photo shows six smiling girls standing with their arms around each other, wearing black shirts with letters written on them in gold tape that, even with asterisks in the middle, unmistakably spell out the n-word.The photo has a small circle in the corner, indicating it was originally posted to Snapchat, where photos disappear after 24 hours.The image began appearing across Facebook shortly after: What appears to have happened, is that the girls assembled for their class photo with their lettered t-shirts. In a large group, they spelled out:  Best you ve ever seen, class of 2016 . Then, a group of six girls decided to pose in a smaller photo in which they used their letters to spell out the slur.Jill Hanks, Executive Director of Community Relations for the Tempe Union High School District, which oversees Desert Vista said: That was not a school photo, That was taken off to the side somewhere and I don t know who took it or who posted it. We found out about it when everyone else did, when it popped up on social media. They do not represent DV or the community as a whole. These are six students who made a really bad decision.

According to Atlanta Black Star:Tempe Union Superintendent Dr. Kenneth R. Baca released the following statement:The event that took place today at Desert Vista will not be tolerated. It is unacceptable for any racial slur to be used regardless of intent. We need to understand that words matter. I can assure you the appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.A letter also was sent home to Desert Vista students from Principal Dr. Christine Barela which read:Dear Desert Vista Families,We want to let you know we share your outrage and disappointment over the actions of a handful of our students today. We want to make it crystal clear those actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated at Desert Vista. Those actions do not represent who we are as a campus.

8580, Bill Maher Did NOT Disappoint In His Reaction To Sarah Palin’s Endorsement Of Trump (VIDEO),"There s really no better person to roast Sarah Palin than Bill Maher, and he most definitely didn t disappoint on Friday s edition of his HBO show. After the failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska endorsed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump this past week, it s been pretty much nonstop coverage of her idiocy. After all, the woman showed up, dressed in wind chimes, and was clearly either drunk or overly caffeinated. Any way you put it, no one put it better than Maher when he stated: Trump and Gump. Fatman and Little Brain  it was really something. Did you happen to see any of her speech? Oh my God. It was like a crazy drunk bridesmaid grabbed the mic at a wedding reception. This woman has a thousand stupid clich s in her head, and when she opens her mouth, it s like they re all escaping a nightclub fire. He then showed a clip of all her craziness during the endorsement, and said: You cannot put into words how much she cannot put something into words. Maher also brought up Palin blaming her son s domestic violence on Obama somehow not respecting the troops, saying:  and that s what makes the Republican party the party of personal responsibility  If Obama would just secure the borders, maybe Bristol would stop getting knocked up all the time. And that s really the truth of all of it. Sarah Palin wants to pretend that she s some high and mighty person, somehow morally superior to others, but the truth of the matter is, her son beats up women, and her daughter needs to learn where the condom aisle is. Palin is a walking and talking joke, and the sooner she realizes this the better.Kudos to Bill Maher for utterly annihilating Palin and her craziness.

8581, Chelsea Clinton BLASTS Charlotte Rampling’s ‘Anti White Racism’ Oscar Comments (TWEET),"Actress Charlotte Rampling really stepped in it when she declared that the boycott of the Oscars by black actors was nothing more than  anti-white racism.  Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that the fact that, for the second year in a row, only white actors have gotten Oscar nominations is highly suspect. Rampling, however, said the following of the controversy: Maybe this time, no black actor or actress deserved to make it to the final selection. Why should we always categorize people? I think nowadays we are living in easily offended societies. There will always be someone who s too beautiful, too black or not white enough. Well, there s one person who spoke out against the remarks: Chelsea Clinton. She took to her twitter account and roundly condemned the remarks, calling them  outrageous, ignorant, and offensive. Outrageous, ignorant & offensive comments from Rampling. https://t.co/h7r1HNND5E  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 22, 2016The problem here is that Rampling and those who think like her have absolutely zero understanding of systemic racism and the way it works when it comes to seeping into literally every crevice of our society and lives. Rampling, like many people suffering from white privilege, is terrified that she ll lose her throne if there s more space for others.Chelsea Clinton, however, understands just what this boycott is, and why it is so important. It should not have taken public outcry and boycotts for the Academy to change its rules regarding voting for these awards. That is what it took, though,and in 2016, that s a damn shame.I am just eternally grateful to Chelsea Clinton for speaking out against the likes of Charlotte Rampling and others who would squash this very important conversation. Racism is alive and well, even in supposedly  liberal  Hollywood. It is time   far past time, in fact   that we realized that racism didn t end with the signing of the Civil Rights Act.Thank you, Chelsea Clinton, for saying what needed to be said here.Featured image via Chelsea Clinton Twitter",0
8582, WATCH: Trump’s Insult To The Troops He Didn’t Want You To See,"Donald Trump has once again used images of non-American military in a campaign appeal. This time the former reality TV star used images of Communist soldiers in a web ad advertising his support of veteran s issues.The men were clearly Communists, as the detail on their medals read  CCCP,  the Russian initials for USSR   The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.Interesting choice for a photo of veterans in this @realDonaldTrump video: https://t.co/NdxdwpvMDD pic.twitter.com/PiagKGTP8H  Josh Perry (@MrJoshPerry) January 22, 2016After he was called out for posting the Communist soldiers as Americans, the Trump campaign pulled the video. But here it is.The incident is not the first time Team Trump has tried to pass off foreign soldiers as Americans. In July, Trump tweeted out a photo of himself embedded on the American flag with a photo of soldiers. The problem is, that photo was a picture of German Nazi soldiers. As in the photo of the Communist soldiers, a cursory glance at the picture would have revealed the SS eagle logo on the side of their uniforms.As he often has done during the campaign, Trump blamed the photo on a  young intern  and pulled the picture.It was the same excuse he used on Friday when he re-posted a complimentary Twitter image from an account called  White Genocide,  who turned out to be a Trump supporter who also is a backer of the white supremacist movement.Trump s campaign is a cult of personality, built of toadies who appear to have risen in the ranks based on how much they suck up to the former reality TV star. Actual competence doesn t seem to matter at all. Even more damning, it doesn t seem to matter to Republican voters, who appear quite fine with giving their support to Trump, even as he can t show the basic respect that is due to members of the U.S. armed services.But then again, that seems to be the mindset of most of the Republican establishment, so perhaps it shouldn t be so surprising or jarring.Featured image via Flickr",0
8583, Kevin Spacey Predicts What Would Happen If Frank Underwood Ever Debated Trump (VIDEO),"House of Cards star Kevin Spacey, who plays the fictional character President Frank Underwood, sat down with CNBC International on Thursday and just couldn t avoid getting asked questions concerning the 2016 presidential election. Chief among them was a question about what would happen if Donald Trump ever had to debate Frank Underwood.Here is the answer he gave, which drew quite a bit of laughter: He wouldn t (debate Underwood). There would be a terrible accident, on the way to the debate. It would be terrible, and very sad. If that wasn t funny enough, he followed that up with his best Trump impersonation: I m huuuge. I m too huge for this church. Spacey is currently making rounds across the globe promoting the new upcoming season of House of Cards, which airs in March. He was also asked this very same question at the annual SkyBridge Capital reception hosted at a piano bar just a day earlier. He says he often gets asked the question of what would happen if Frank Underwood had to debate Trump,  who would win? I thought about this and I said,  We must remember one important distinction, one of these characters is a fictional character, and the other is a fictional character.' It turns out he s used this line in the past often. Probably the best and most elaborate answer he s ever provided is from a Q & A session with CNN he did back in September. Oh, I think Underwood (would win). He (would win) because he would kill Donald Trump. Trump would never make it to election day. It d be over, done.I think it would be great if Donald Trump started a feud with a fictional character, because maybe for once it would be a fair fight. Perhaps Trump will appear in season 5 of House of Cards next year after he loses the real U.S. election this November. He is, after all, a TV personality. It s not too far-fetched that Trump could be a rival of Frank Underwood one day.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8584, Bill Maher CRUSHES Sarah Palin For Blaming Obama For Her Bad Parenting Skills (VIDEO),"When Sarah Palin blamed President Obama for her son s domestic violence charges pretty much everyone slammed her for it, including the veterans she referred to in her rant against the Commander-in-Chief. It s not only utterly inaccurate to blame Obama for the actions of her son, but it s actual pretty petty and a definitely a cheap jab at the expense of both the president and veterans.One person who has never held back from roasting Sarah Palin is Real Time host Bill Maher. On Friday s edition of his show, he and his guests discussed Track Palin as well as his mother s lame defense of him. Basically, Maher pointed out that she shifted blame from herself and her obvious horrific parenting skills. After all, she has one daughter with two different baby daddies, and a son who has a history of violent outbursts and run-ins with the law.Maher spoke directly about Palin s ridiculous defense of her son, and also discussed the way she s trying to somehow insinuated Post Traumatic Stress Disorder was the cause of all her son s problems. He stated: [She] just glossed over that. Like, we accept that now. We send our sons off to stupid wars and they come back a bit different, because he beat up his girlfriend, was talking suicide. And she blamed that on Obama. That s why I m sure his girlfriend was cowering under the bed   because of Obama. Her daughter has had two out-of-wedlock children. I mean, does it ever occur to anybody that the Obamas are just so much better parents? And the Obama s most certainly are. One look at the Obama girls and they are pretty much the embodiment of the near perfection. The Obamas keep those girls in check, and they are definitely well-behaved.Maher also pointed out that it probably won t matter what Palin says or does, because when it comes to the folks who actually find her as qualified to hold a valid opinion, they basically just look at religion: She s the worst  It s the most morally sloppy person going to Iowa to convince the evangelicals   the supposedly moral people   to vote? That s why faith sucks so bad. Because when you have the same faith as me, then whatever you do is off the table, right? Here s the thing, if Palin s son does suffer from PTSD, she definitely has the resources to get him help. PTSD also shouldn t be used as a political chew toy to throw around and take jabs at a sitting president because you have nothing else constructive to say. Palin was trying to shift blame from her son and herself to that of the president and the war. It s not just wrong, it s kind of sad.Video/Featured image: YouTube",0
8585," The Academy Just Showed The GOP How Diversity Is Done, Changed The Rules For Oscar Voting","The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences has come under serious fire recently for being, well   too much like the Republican Party. The voting members of the Academy, it turns out, average more than 60-years-old and are predominantly white males.As nominees for this year s Academy Awards were released, minority members noticed that the coveted Oscars were going to once again be a gathering of the Hollywood White Boys Club. This year, however, some of the most influential people in the industry decided to take a stand. After actors of the calibre of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee, along with many other highly respected minorities in the business boycotted the event, the Academy began looking fo a solution to the #OscarsSoWhite problem.That solution came today, as the Academy announced that they will be changing the rules of voting for members, which is expected to weed out some of those who havenb t been active for years yet still cast their votes for anyone who is white, male and heterosexual.The new rules, according to a statement from Academy  President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, are as follows:The statement also outlines other measures the Academy is looking to take to increase the diversity of its membership to better represent the work contributed by minorities and women.The Academy s proactive approach to solving a problem that wasn t going to just go away is a breath of fresh air. The Republican party could learn a thing or two from them.featured image via Indiewire.com",0
8586, Seizure Victim 2nd Amendmented A Fireman Who Responded To Wife’s 911 Call To Help Him,"Greg Pruitt s wife was awoken at approximately 5 a.m. when she noticed her husband was having a seizure. Quickly, she called 911. As help was on its way, Greg s seizure started to subside a bit, and he was coming out of it when help arrived.Twenty-nine-year-old Jason Adams, a volunteer fireman, was the first responder on the scene. When Adams was standing in the doorway of the room where Pruitt was, attempting to evaluate the situation, Pruitt promptly shot and killed Adams, thinking he was an intruder.Adams was a nearby neighbor who lived approximately a half-mile from the residence. A witness who entered the home after the shooting gave the same account of what happened. Adams was rushed to a local medical center in North Little Rock but was pronounced dead.Not very surprisingly, authorities do not know if there will be any charges filed in this  accidental  shooting.Please, can we admit yet that we have a problem with guns in America? This is a perfect example of why we do. I know when people are in an emergency situation, possibly panicking, they don t think about the gun that is in arm s reach of a seizure victim, or about what will happen because of it when a stranger suddenly enters their home. But, is that really an acceptable way to write off this sort of thing?The idea of  responsible gun ownership  is exactly what s in question here. Why are we living in such paranoia, in the  home of the brave,  to where we are shooting at every shadow we see? It s incredibly wrong for a first responder to have to second-guess rendering aid because they re afraid they will get shot just by showing up. The concept of  always shoot first because it s just an accident if you do,  that has been cultivated by the NRA and Republicans in America needs to come to an end.Watch news coverage of the incident below:featured image via twitter",0
8587, This Psychic Apparently Couldn’t Predict The Lawsuit She’d Face By Refusing A Gay Couple (VIDEO),"Some people in life still haven t grasped the fact that all people should be treated equally. Many still feel it is well within their rights to be discriminatory based upon personal beliefs. Such is the case with Deepika Avanti who lists herself as a  Holistic Therapist  and  Psychic Healer. Avanti, along with being a  psychic healer,  is also a property owner in Boulder, Colorado who leases out her property to renters. However, when one couple who sought to rent her property, Avanti flat-out rejected them. Why? Because she didn t want the  uniqueness  of the couple to harm her position within her community. What makes this couple so unique? They are a lesbian couple, and one of the women is transgender.Rachel and Tonya Smith, alongside their adorable child, are seeking legal action against Avanti with the help of Lambda Legal. According to the legal documents: Defendant suggested that the Smith family look for housing in a  larger town where the community would better accept them and intimated that she did not see them as a legitimate familial unit who could live together on her property. Rachel Smith said: We just thought it was a little bit ridiculous, particularly given that Boulder is known for being a more liberal, open-minded area. Honestly, if this was going to happen in Colorado, I would expect it maybe in Colorado Springs, but not so much out of Boulder, and especially not in Gold Hill. I thought it was more accepting. Good on these women for not backing down in the face of discrimination. The only way some of these bigots are going to realize they are, in fact, bigots, is by throwing their bigotry back in their bigoted faces. You d think this woman, being a psychic and all, would ve seen this lawsuit coming, but apparently she s as good of psychic as she is a landlord. Video: YouTube Featured image: YouTube",0
8588, Excited About ‘The X-Files’ Reboot? Here’s Something Concerning You Should Know,"While it s exciting to see a great television show finally make its way back to the small screen, it s disappointing to realize another aspect of old school TV was also rebooted. While David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are both equal partners on The X-Files, as it turns out, when Anderson was approached for the reboot she was offered half as much money as her costar. So much for equal pay for equal work. Apparently, having an extra appendage in between your legs makes you somehow more valuable.The characters Mulder (Duchovny) and Scully (Anderson) go together like peanut butter and jelly, peas and carrots, Bert and Ernie. You wouldn t pay Ernie less than Bert, would you? Well, of course not. They re both male, and puppets   we re getting off track.Here s the thing, back in the 90s, when The X-Files was originally airing on television, Anderson worked hard to make sure she was paid equally as much as her costar. When asked about the current pay disparity, Anderson said: I m surprised that more [interviewers] haven t brought that up because it s the truth. Especially in this climate of women talking about the reality of [unequal pay] in this business, I think it s important that it gets heard and voiced. It was shocking to me, given all the work that I had done in the past to get us to be paid fairly. I worked really hard toward that and finally got somewhere with it. Even in interviews in the last few years, people have said to me,  I can t believe that happened, how did you feel about it, that is insane.  And my response always was,  That was then, this is now.  And then it happened again! I don t even know what to say about it. It is  sad. According to the Hollywood Reporter, both Anderson and Duchovny were paid the same in the end, but the fact that they weren t from the get-go is, well, sad, as Anderson said.Unless a show features a strong male lead and other female actresses are quite obviously supporting roles, co-leads, regardless of gender, should be paid the same. They both bring the same amount of talent and equity to their performances and the show s success.This is still a battle not only women in Hollywood have to continually face, but women in every profession nationwide. So, while some conservatives like to tout that  women are already equal    actually, no, they re not  at all. It s important now, more than ever, to make sure we elect into the White House another person with the ideal of making sure equal pay for equal work happens once and for all. It s time. In fact, it s far past time. We need another liberal in the White House.Featured image: YouTube screengrab",0
8589, This One Image Reveals The Right-Wing Racism That Fueled Flint’s Water Crisis (IMAGES),"The human rights debacle that is being referred to as the Flint water crisis has just been summed up perfectly by political cartoonist Matt Wuerker, who found a brilliant way to express the true underlying issues behind this massive issue in one powerful image:Cartoon by Matt WuerkerThanks to the irresponsible, neglectful actions of Republican governor Rick Snyder and Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, a city with over 100,000 residents   the majority of which are African American   has been poisoned. Almost a dozen people have died from Legionnaire s Disease as a result, with dozens more becoming seriously ill.As more evidence surfaces, Snyder s disturbing role in the crisis has become crystal clear, adding to the outrage as many call for Snyder to resign and be held accountable for allowing this to happen to Flint. Among those speaking out is filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore, who called Snyder out for having  knowingly poisoned a black city  and  racial killing. Flint homeowners have been lied to and were told that their tap water   which in some areas is polluted enough to meet the EPA s standards for toxic waste   was safe to drink, even though it was discolored.Twitter TwitterThe damage that Snyder s carelessness has caused is irreversible, and it will take 10-15 years for the real damage of the lead-poisoned, highly corrosive water to be calculated. For the children of Flint, this could be deadly. It s not just homeowners that have been affected either   even hospitals are without safe water.TwitterWe cannot ignore the fact that Flint is a predominately black city with a large low-income population.Even as more evidence is gathered, many GOPers in Michigan (aside from Snyder) are calling the water crisis a hoax. Republican L. Brooks Patterson has even called reputable reports of the lead poisoning  false . Earlier today, Snyder said that race played no role in the water crisis when asked a question from a New York Times article that asked,  If Flint were rich and mostly white, would Michigan s state government have responded more quickly and aggressively to complaints about its lead-polluted water?  He s lying through his teeth.Featured image via Matt Wuerker",0
8590, White Man Terrorizes Black Shop Owner By Leaving Ku Klux Klan Robe (VIDEO),"Leona Coakley-Spring has only been running her consignment shop, Rags to Riches, for a few months. Coakley-Spring opened her dream business and settled into the ritzy Seattle, Washington suburb, only to  be made to feel unwelcome.The trouble comes as Coakley-Spring made a horrifying discovery: a Ku Klux Klan robe amongst the dresses dropped off by a customer. She considers the robe to be a threatening message, saying to local station Fox 13: You can t be a black business owner in downtown Redmond, you can t be her.  I didn t know what to do or what to say. It was just so horrifying. Coakley-Spring s son, Shane Coakley, documented the incident with photographs, which he then turned over to the authorities. A sketch of the man believed to have left the racist robe, alongside photos of the robe itself, are being released to the public. The cops are increasing their presence around the store, and consider what happened here a hate crime. Coakley-Spring has obviously been deeply affected by this: I can t change the way I look. But it makes me feel like I m not good enough. And that s a bad feeling to have, that you re not good enough. Hopefully, this wonderful woman realizes that it s these racists who have the problem, not her. She even considered closing down over this, but so far, is hanging on: We close the store, and they would win And I don t want to give them any satisfaction.

8591, This EDM Remix Of Sarah Palin’s Trump Speech Makes Her Screechy Voice Totally Worth It (VIDEO),"If you re like me, listening to the sound of Sarah Palin s voice alone, regardless of what she says, is like being stabbed through the skull with a series of high-school geometry class protractors. Only then do I begin to actually absorb the nonsensical content of what she s saying. But, of course, leave it to the internet to take the pain away.A YouTuber called Tronovitch assembled the first what will inevitably be many autotune remixes of Palin s incoherent Trump speech. This one is built around Palin s white trash tendencies, illustrated by the mashed-up use of the phrase  hee-haw  as well as the 1970s television show of the same name.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cs9jP2ILOw&w=560&h=315]While we re here, is there anyone else in politics who s less self aware than Palin? She seems to believe that liberals and the  lamestream media  are terrified of her because she goes rogue and challenges the establishment. She appears to be completely unaware of the fact that everyone outside of her retirement-aged fanboys are laughing at her   her and her Idiot Strength. Consequently, she doesn t seem to grasp that she s embarrassing herself by going Full Dumbstupid. (You never go Full Dumbstupid.)She seems to believe that her speaking style is a threat rather than a source of accidental self-satire. In other words, every time she appears in public, she ratchets up her act, thinking that it ll totally flummox liberals, but in reality it just comes off as Full Dumbstupid. Frankly, it s one of many tell-tale signs that she s totally ensconced in white-trashery, which is often indicated by poor judgment and horrendously bad taste.Suffice to say, she clearly doesn t know. And if she s been told how insanely ridiculous she sounds, she s not paying attention   which is yet another sign of being white trash. Besides, if she stops, the comedy ends. And that d be a tragedy.Featured image via video screen grab.",0

8593," White Hollywood Stars Say Black Actors Should Be ‘Patient’, And The Oscar Boycott Is ‘Anti-White Racism’","High profile back stars from Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith to Spike Lee will be boycotting this year s Oscar s ceremony in solidarity over the persistence of racism in Hollywood. But for one (white) nominee, this is all just a case of  racism against whites. First, veteran Hollywood star and Oscar-winner Michael Caine told black stars they must be  patient  and await the point where they are permitted full entry to the Academy.He was joined by actor Charlotte Rampling, who is nominated for Best Actress for her role in 45 Years, and will be competing against four other white actresses   Brie Larson, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan.Not only will there be no black actor in this category, but there will be no black actor in any category of the Oscars in 2016. Not a single nomination.However, like Caine, Rampling believes that black stars of Hollywood are making a fuss about nothing. Worse, that their calls for greater representation in Hollywood amounts to racism against her and her fellow white actors. She said during a radio interview on Friday: It s racist to whites. One can never really know, but perhaps the black actors did not deserve to make the final list.  Then, in a final fit of white privilege she added: Why classify people? These days everyone is more or less accepted, People will always say  Him, he s not as handsome  or  Him, he s too black  or  He s too white. But does that necessarily mean there should be lots of minorities everywhere? What does it mean that [black actors] still think they are a minority? It would be a much better world if Rampling was right, if black actors were being judged on their merits and simply fell short. But if she truly believes this, her disconnect from reality is profound. As Variety points out:In 1956, Variety ran a series of articles asking why there aren t better roles for black actors. Three decades later, the situation hadn t improved. On Feb. 19, 1982, Variety carried the front-page banner NAACP faults film employment. Last year, the hopes for diversity were based on one film, Paramount s  Selma,  which earned two nominations, for best pic and song (winning the latter). This year, there were more opportunities, including  Creed, Straight Outta Compton  and  Chi-raq,  as well as  Beasts of No Nation. This year, it s even worse.Surprising omissions from the actor race this year included Idris Elba for  Beasts of No Nation,  Will Smith for  Concussion,  Michael B. Jordan from  Creed  and the many young actors in  Compton. To add insult to injury, despite the fact that Creed featured a black actor in the starring role, and was written by a black man   the only nominee was a white man.Not only is Hollywood failing to acknowledge the black actors who have delivered breathtaking performances throughout the year, but the industry is also decades behind television in providing leading roles for black actors in mainstream movies which make them household names. As The Guardian discovered when they crunched the numbers:A 2012 Los Angeles Times study found that nearly 94% of Oscar voters were white. Some 2% were black and 2% were Latino. More than three quarters of voters were male. The median age was 62.So, let s be clear, this is not about hurt feelings. This about a very real, systemic issue. And as these figures show, it s not just on race where Hollywood fails to reflect the diversity of our societies.It is far better that white stars stand in unity, like George Clooney and Michael Moore, to help transform Hollywood for the better   than they stick their head in the sands and continue to ignore an unjust status quo. But for some, the reality of racial prejudice is an ugliness they would rather pretend doesn t exist.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons/Wikimedia Commons/Mod.Com",0
8594, Young FL Filmmakers Take On GOP’s ‘Ridiculous’ Islamophobia With Hilarious Spoofs (VIDEO),"Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States has been fraught with Islamophobia. But the 2016 Republican presidential candidates, coupled with the recent Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) attacks and the San Bernardino shooting, the hate has reached a fever pitch. In response to the rising tide of bigotry, a group of young filmmakers in Tampa, Florida called  Peace House  have started fighting back with humor instead of anger.Ahmad Hussan and Nick Amaro said that in the days following the arrest of Ahmed  The Clock Boy  in Texas, they decided to go into their studio and make a parody about the incident. Their video shows a frightened uncle calling the police because his nephew is holding a clock. Their brilliant mockery of the incident got nearly eight million views.Hussan told Fox 13 News that they want to expose the  ridiculousness  of people s anti-Muslim sentiments: When you are laughing at something, you are kind of exposing it for its ridiculousness. And when someone refers to me, just because of my faith, as a terrorist, that is ridiculous. In addition to the clock video, the filmmakers have made a video that showcases ignorant family members sitting around a table during the holidays; they called it  Happy Hatesgiving.  They also took on Ben Carson s comments that compared Syrian refugees to rabid dogs, and in another they interviewed people for jobs with ISIS. We are making things that are funny,  Amaro explained.  But ultimately, the goal is to make you think deeply about something, to help you understand an issue from a different point of view. The fact is, the GOP field has used people of the Islamic faith as punching bags for more than a decade. What s worse is that their constant fear mongering has put targets on the backs of innocent people who want nothing more than to live peacefully like the rest of us. It s nice to know that this group can laugh about it, but in reality they shouldn t have to. In 2016 there is no excuse for the rampant ignorance that is so prevalent on the right.Featured image: video screenshot",0
8595, Watch Steven Colbert’s Hilarious Summary of Trump’s Crazy Week,"For anyone who s been paying attention to Donald Trump, you can t help but wonder how in the world this individual is leading polls by a large gap for the Republican nomination to be president of the United States. After watching Stephen Colbert s analysis of Trump s week, one can only conclude that there are many not so smart Republican voters out there.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oo0RcL4PJw]Take, for example, Trump s visit to Liberty University to attract the Evangelical vote. During his speech, Trump misnamed a book in the Bible.  Trump loves the Bible so much he doesn t even need to read it, apparently because he had a little trouble with one of the names of the books of the Bible  Second Corinthians ,  said Colbert. Then he showed a clip of Trump calling it  Two Corinthians.   It s like two Corinthians walk into a bar  mused Colbert. Trump however did compliment the Bible, saying that it  blows away  his book, The Art of The Deal.Do these folks actually believe that Trump is religious or that he even pays attention to the Bible? If they do, they seem to be either quite delusional or not so smart. They re probably both.Then there s the apparent endorsement of the dead John Wayne. Trump was endorsed at the John Wayne Museum by the famous actor s daughter, who said that if her dad were alive today, Trump would be his guy. Colbert said: That s right,with Trump s new-found spirituality, Trump has reached through the veil of death and dragged back the endorsement of John Wayne. The unfolding Trump saga and his crazy support base is humorous when Colbert sums it up but it s also quite frightening that this guy leads in the polls.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",0
8596," Ted Cruz Forgets To Sign His Family Up For Health Insurance In Time, Blames Obama","There is arguably no other person in America who dislikes Obamacare more than Ted Cruz. He is the guy who quite literally shut down the government in order to make an inane point about it. But even for Cruz, his latest attempt to show America how much he doesn t like the Affordable Care Act is pretty pathetic.At a campaign rally, Cruz told the crowd that he and his family currently don t have any health insurance because  blah blah Obamacare. I ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me,  Cruz told the audience at a campaign stop New Hampshire on Thursday evening.  I don t have health care right now. Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face. (I wouldn t advise taking that literally, Ted. The hospital bills will be through the roof.) Cruz seems to have intentionally torpedoed his family s chance to get insurance so that he could tell conservative voters that Obama cost him his healthcare.You may recall that Fox News spent months trying to dig up people who lost their health insurance because of the ACA. Cruz cited  millions.  In all their searching they found only a few. Those, it turned out, were mostly wrong about losing their health insurance. One by one they discovered that they either hadn t actually lost their insurance or their new plan was more affordable because of Obamacare. They were simply ignorant of what they were meant to do to get a new policy. Thanks, no doubt, to Fox News and its relentless misinformation.As Think Progress explains, Cruz is in a similar situation. He didn t  lose  his health coverage, he just didn t sign up for a new policy in time:Cruz s family used to be covered through a PPO plan with BlueCross BlueShield of Texas. But for 2016, the insurer decided to eliminate PPO plans and move to offering only HMO plans on the individual marketplace (which is becoming a bigger trend in the insurance industry). The insurance company announced this decision last July.The July announcement gave people enrolled in BlueCross BlueShield s plans a full five months to select a new HMO plan if they wanted to maintain coverage into the new year. Ted Cruz s family apparently just didn t sign up in time.Like the rest of America, Cruz was expected to pick his new plan before the new year. The marketplace actually extended their deadlines in order to make it easier for busy families to find time to sign up. Millions of Americans managed to do so. In fact, more Americans have health insurance today than at any other time in the country s history. Just not Ted Cruz and his family.After blaming Obama, Cruz hinted that his family aren t happy with him. He told the crowd: By the way, when you let your health insurance policy lapse, your wife gets really ticked at you,  Cruz said.  It s not a good   I ve had, shall we say, some intense conversations with Heidi on that. Note that even Cruz seems aware that he simply dropped the ball. He also admitted that he s currently signing up for insurance (which will begin in March.)At most, this is a mere inconvenience. For many American families, a lapse in insurance can be a scary time. One slip on the ice or nasty illness and one s savings can evaporate. That s unlikely to happen with Cruz. His wife, a former Goldman-Sachs executive, and Cruz, a senator, probably have enough money in the bank that any hospital bill can be taken care of even without insurance.While Cruz has consistently run on the idea that he will repeal Obamacare, Americans are growing to like it. Healthcare in the United States is still an absolute mess, and more reforms need to be done to fully address the problems, but more people on insurance means less bankruptcies, healthier workers, and longer lives. You can t put a number on more time with a loved one who may have been saved with access to healthcare, but you can put a number on what these life-changing opportunities are doing to the economy. Obamacare was framed by Republicans as a  job killer  and a deficit bomb   it s proven to be neither.So stop complaining and sign up for health insurance, Ted. Then go apologize to your family for gambling with their health to take a dig at the president. That s just bad form.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8597, Christian Conservative State Bans Women From Testifying In Court Unless They Obey ‘Modesty’ Code,"A Christian Conservative  lawmaker in Kansas has used his position as a Senate Committee chairman to enforce a dress code for female witnesses in courts. The rules govern skirt length and cleavage allowance. There are no equivalent rules for men.Sen. Mitch Holmes is the Republican chairman of the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee in Kansas, and has included his new rules in an 11-point code of conduct. He argues that women in court, and in the Senate, dress provocatively to distract men   and he wants to bring an end to this.Women will not be permitted to give testimony if they do not abide by the rules.He told the Topeka Capital Journal: It s one of those things that s hard to define. Put it out there and let people know we re really looking for you to be addressing the issue rather than trying to distract or bring eyes to yourself. His bizarre rules and comments have prompted withering condemnation from female members of the committee and the Kansas legislature. Topeka Democrat Senator Laura Kelly responded: Oh, for crying out loud, what century is this? Meanwhile, even Republican colleagues were unwilling to defend Holmes. GOP Senator Vicki Schmidt (Topeka) sighed: Who s going to define low-cut? Does it apply to senators? In total, four of Holmes  female senatorial colleagues (two Republicans and two Democrats) have come forward to publicly condemn his comments, and stress that women should not be subjected to gender-specific dress codes.Another Republican Senator, Carolyn McGinn of Sedgwick, spoke to the fact that men and women in the Senate and our courts should be judged by their contribution, not their clothing, saying: I am more interested in what they have to say about the direction our state should go than what they re wearing that day, It is indeed hugely disappointing to see a lawmaker use his position to implement gender-specific dress codes that enforce his patriarchal religious codes onto the women of the state. This is the very reason the Founding Fathers separated church and state in the U.S. Constitution   because freedom of religion is not merely about the right to practice our own religion (or none) in peace, but to avoid being forced to follow the whims of anyone else s. The women of Kansas just lost that right.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",0
8598," Donald Trump Retweets One Of His Fans, A ‘WhiteGenocide’ Neo-Nazi Account (IMAGES)","Donald Trump woke up this morning, sleepily grabbed his phone off his nightstand, saw one of his supporters had tweeted an anti-Jeb Bush picture at him, and hit  Retweet. Unfortunately, that supporter happened to be a racist neo-Nazi with the account name  WhiteGenocideTM. Seriously.The love for Trump from racist xenophobes is startling, but not exactly surprising. Trump s current presidential run quite literally started with a racist screed against Mexicans, and has been sustained by a torrent of anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant smears. His rallies regularly feature his supporters beating people of color who come to protest his ugly rhetoric.You can almost feel the sense of excitement in the racist, Nazi-loving dark corners of the country: Finally, a candidate for us! And even better   if you happen to be a toxic racist   Trump won t hesitate to give you free publicity if you just tweet something to stoke his ego.It would have taken all of two seconds for Trump to realize that the man he was tweeting was a despicable monster. If the  WhiteGenocide  name   based on the racist belief that white people are being systematically edged out of American society by minorities   didn t give it away, the account s biographical details should have.Even worse, just scrolling through the account s tweets shows a pattern of racist filth. Some of it advocates for the deaths of political figures, particularly those on the left. Last week, for instance, he tweeted a picture of Trump in a Nazi uniform with Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders inside a gas chamber.As of this writing, and more than an hour after he retweeted this scumbag, Trump still has the tweet up, including a link to  WhiteGenocideTM s  account, giving him more exposure.Donald Trump has surged in the Republican polls, with even many of what we consider  mainstream  conservatives applauding his appalling comments. At the root of his support, however, is a thriving neo-Nazi and white supremacy contingent that believe Trump might be the leader they were looking for. Just hinting at racist ideology wasn t enough for them, they like a guy who will openly admit to it and never apologize.Certainly Trump will eventually excuse the tweet and, likely, blame a  young intern  for the mistake. We shouldn t let him get off the hook that easily. This is a pattern of disgraceful behavior that puts real lives at jeopardy. It is extremely telling that the most toxic, violent people in society are cozying up to Trump. Clearly, what he s saying is right up their alley. Trump may try to excuse his behavior, but his actions   and followers   speak louder than his words ever will.Featured image via Twitter",0
8599, The White House Sets Palin Straight — Her Bad Parenting Isn’t Obama’s Fault (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin is an idiot. While this has been commonly accepted ever since she slinked out of her slime pit and emerged on the political scene, Palin recently managed to be so utterly stupid that it prompted an official White House response. After Palin s son Track drunkenly beat his girlfriend and made threats with a semiautomatic weapon, Caribou Barbie did the only thing she knows how to do: she blamed that socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist dictator Barack Obama.Sure, the half-term, half-wit former Governor of Alaska could have had a moment of self-reflection, questioning her role as a parent and what she did wrong in failing to instill proper values in her precious little snowflake. She could have spoken out against domestic violence in general, and pointed out that it is an issue that faces many families, including hers. She could have said nothing at all. Instead, she told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally that Obama gave her son PTSD when he served in Iraq for a single year under Bush, and blamed Track s violent tendencies the President s blatant attempt to deprive veterans of medical and psychological treatment (failing to mention that  it was actually Republicans who slashed the budget for veterans  care): I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Earnest said that while it s easy to mock Palin   really easy   the topics she discussed are not a joke: The reaction of some people I think is to make light of some of the rhetoric that we see on the campaign trail, particularly from Gov. Palin. But the fact is domestic violence is not a joke. Gun violence is not a joke. Problems with addiction are not a joke. The consequences, or I should say, the sacrifices that many of our men and women in uniform make for our safety and security are not a joke. We take [those issues] very seriously and there are many communities and families that are dealing with these very difficult challenges in a way that is sometimes difficult to talk about publicly,  he said.Classy   something one would never expect from someone who would fling herself on top of a dogpile in a drunken brawl her family started at someone s birthday party.Watch Earnest eloquently destroy her below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHuDTaEGJ2s&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab (1,2)",0
8600, Pathetic: Jeb Bush Gets His Mommy To Take On Bully Donald Trump (VIDEO),"One of the hallmarks about Jeb Bush s failing presidential campaign has been just how pathetic it has turned out to be. His latest campaign ad won t help that perception of the Republican once spoken about as a shoo-in for the nomination.The ad features Jeb Bush s mother, Barbara Bush, and she takes a swipe at Donald Trump.The former first lady says Jeb Bush wants to be president for the right reasons, unlike some other candidates in the field. Rather than talking about how popular they are or how great they are, he s doing it because he sees a huge need and it s not being filled by anybody,  Mrs. Bush says, likely referring to Trump, the GOP front-runner.After months of being depicted as out of touch and a wimp, it probably won t help to have your mother now fight your battles for you. It s an approach that is sure to attract the derision of Donald Trump and other, more pugilistic Republicans.It has been startling how the Bush campaign and its affiliated super PAC has made so many mistakes throughout their campaign. Starting with a candidate with very strong name recognition and a $100 million-plus war chest that reportedly scared off a campaign from Mitt Romney, by this point Bush was supposed to be on the verge of accepting the nomination.Instead, he is polling in single digits, behind Trump and Cruz. He s served as the poster boy for the impotent Republican establishment, while his super PAC has been lighting money on fire on things like nonsensical ads making fun of Marco Rubio s boots.Bush himself has been a dud of a candidate, leading some to comment on how his brother and father seem to have had far more natural political talent. Bush has been awkward on the campaign trail, showing quirks more often associated with a political rookie rather than someone elected to govern in a populous state like Florida.Featured image via YouTube",0
8601, Oops: Ammosexual Playing With Gun During Benghazi Movie Shoots Woman (VIDEO),"Thinking about going to the movies? You might want to avoid 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, and not just because of the film s poor reviews.In case it s not obvious from the title, the film was created in hopes of drawing in a crowd of delusional right-wing nuts, whose hatred for Hillary Clinton is only surpassed by their passionate love for firearms. In that respect, at least, the film seems to have done what it set out to do.To illustrate the point, on January 21, as the Benghazi film flickered on the screen, a drunken ammosexual playing with his substitute penis handgun while seated in The Landing Cinema in Renton, Washington,  accidentally  shot the woman sitting in front of him.According to Renton police: Preliminary accounts indicate that an intoxicated suspect entered one of the theaters and was fumbling with a handgun he had in his possession when it went off, striking another patron seated in front of him. The victim was rushed to Harborview Medical Center, where she was listed in critical condition.The unidentified 29-year-old shooter ran out of the building, likely fearing a theater jammed full of  good guys with guns,  locked, loaded and ready to fire at anything moving in the darkened cinema.David Grushke, who was in the theater at the time of the shooting, described the shooting to KOMO News in Seattle, saying: There was a gunshot and we thought it was a light bulb exploding in the theater, so no one really reacted. Grushke said by the time he and other patrons realized that the woman was shot, the shooter was already disappearing through the exit.Grushke told KOMO News that it appeared the woman had been shot in the upper chest.The shooter s father later turned him into the police. He was arrested at his family s home in Newcastle.Considering how badly this incident might have turned out, the fact that only one person was shot, and no one was killed, seems almost fortunate.Here s more on the story from KING5.Featured image credit: video screen capture KING5",0
8602," Anonymous Declared War On MI’s Gov. Rick Snyder, Now Cyber Attacks Have Been Confirmed (VIDEO)","Not long ago, the hacker collective known as Anonymous declared war against Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder in a new campaign called #OpFlint. The declaration came, as they always do, in the form of a slick YouTube video, where they called for Snyder s arrest. Less than 24 hours after Anonymous released the video, a major cyber-attack has been confirmed in Flint.Anonymous did not make any specific details on what action(s) they will take in order to help the people of Flint. They say in the video, that  We must remind the city officials of Flint we do not forget and we do not forgive,  the spokesperson in the video says.  The crimes committed by Gov. Snyder as well as other city officials will not go unpunished. The next day a cyber-attack rocked the Hurley Medical Center. That s the hospital where Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha first noticed there were elevated levels of lead in children s blood in Flint.Here s the video: Hurley Medical Center has IT systems in place, which aid in detecting a virus or cyber-attack,  hospital spokeswoman Ilene Cantor said.  As such, all policies and protocols were followed in relation to the most-recent cyber-attack on our system. Patient care was not compromised and we are closely monitoring all systems to ensure IT security is consistently maintained. It hasn t been confirmed that the cyber-attack is connected to Anonymous. However, it would be a pretty big coincidence for Anonymous to make this threat, and then for a completely random hack to occur. I think it is pretty safe to assume that if it was Anonymous who did hack the Hurley Medical Center, it was in an effort to get info on the situation. Not to actually harm the hospital. Or at the very least, to let the Snyder administration know that they mean business.Speaking of Snyder, he should be very concerned about the potential threat of a massive data breach. In his State of the State address on Tuesday, Snyder promised he would release all of his e-mails in a show of transparency. That promise just turned out to be another slap to well, at this point, the entire nation, who is watching him like a hawk. Here is an example of what  transparency  means to Snyder:That s not the kind of bullsh*t you want to be pulling with a hacker group breathing down your neck. With all things Anonymous, it is important to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism. That being said, it will be interesting to see if they escalate their fight with Snyder and the rest of his cronies in the near future. Especially since his administration has landed Michigan s government the honor of being ranked worst in transparency.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube ",0
8603, Cruz Campaign Donates Water To Flint–But Only To People Who Qualify For Their ‘Generosity’,"Ted Cruz is fast approaching Donald Trump as the most hated man in America. As GOP insiders and long-time public figures denounce Cruz as someone nobody in congress would work with, he continues to take his campaign in directions that guarantee that Democrats and Independents will despise him even more. Apparently, Cruz thinks he can get elected with the votes of the extreme-right only, which is where his platform is and will always be directed.In what may be the worst case of discrimination and idiocy ever by a presidential campaign, Ted Cruz 2016 donated an undisclosed amount of bottled water to residents of Flint, restricting their  generosity  to people with the  right  frame of mind. Cruz s campaign staff took to the streets to get much-needed water to those working and visiting the fraudulent  pregnancy crisis centers  that dupe women into believing they re going to receive medical advice and treatment but are instead cornered and fed anti-abortion rhetoric and religious indoctrination.Cruz s Michigan state campaign director, Wendy Lynn Day, announced in a Facebook post begging for donations that the campaign had worked with anti-abortion group Flint Right to Life to coordinate this absolutely idiotic and ridiculously ignorant plan.  The water is for  expecting moms and moms of little ones. Cruz state director @WendyLynnDay: Donating water to #Flint babies both supports the city and shows ""the pro-life values of Senator Cruz.""  Chad Livengood (@ChadLivengood) January 20, 2016The  pro-life values  of Senator Cruz apparently include denying children who have already been exposed to massive amounts of lead from Republican incompetence water they so desperately need because their parents aren t currently seeking anti-choice counseling from a place where zealots wear lab coats to make people think they re physicians.The malfunctioning moral platitudes of these people are astounding. While most of the GOP field feigns ignorance to an issue they want nothing to do with, Cruz 2016 has taken a proactive role in alienating an entire city in the middle of a crisis unless they conform to the beliefs of Ted Cruz. Pro-life  Ted Cruz, who thinks carpet bombing whole villages full of innocent people is OK as long as you kill some terrorists along the way, hasn t personally commented on the issue, but his campaign works directly on his behalf.Certainly the several people who work at these madhouses are appreciative of the clean water donations while tens of thousands of others line up to receive actual charity from people who care about the already born.Featured image via tedcruz.org, altered",0
8604," Skip The Flowers, Just Don’t Vote For Trump, Asks PA Man’s Obituary","Jeffrey Cohen was a man who believed The meaning of life is  OOPS!'  according to his obituary. The 70-year-old Pennsylvania man passed away Sunday morning at his childhood home in Squirrel Hill, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He was a person who  took pride in being the only Jewish cowboy that he knew of,  and an accomplished chiropractor   one who treated Gold Medal-winning Olympians, members of the Pittsburgh Ballet, professional boxers, and many of the Pittsburgh Steelers throughout his career. Even  Weird Al  Yankovich stopped by to see him.He is described as  compassionate and kind    someone who would  always put others before himself, happily and without hesitation.  His love of dirty and  groan-inducing  jokes was legendary. He also has one final request of those who love him and all who read his obituary   don t f*ck up the next election, or at least do some good in the world:Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump. (Also acceptable   donations to the Nimmo Educational Foundation   www.nimmoed.org   or a charity of your choice .)That s right   to honor his memory, Cohen asks one simple thing: Don t vote for Trump. Don t throw away our future.His obituary does not indicate whom he would choose as president, but he doesn t want people to vote for someone who would ban Muslims from entering the United States, throw them into concentration camps (after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special badges, of course), or any of the multitude of horrific ideas the brain-gerbils that reside beneath his hairpiece suggest. Cohen doesn t want a  big beautiful wall  running the length of our (southern) border, nor does he want someone who would allow Sarah Palin to speak.This request is the opposite of an obituary request that popped up earlier this month when a Virginia man asked,  in lieu of flowers please vote for Donald Trump.  The billionaire tweeted the obituary, declaring thanking the deceased man and declaring him to be  a great person.  It seems as though Cohen made this request as a light-hearted retort to the Trump fan s suggestion that Americans vote for someone who would later be endorsed by Sarah Palin.Thank you so much. Earnest must have been a great person. https://t.co/2DZp7YOadj pic.twitter.com/2YtLlEwceB  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2016It is highly doubtful that Trump will say the same of Cohen.While no thinking individual would vote for Trump anyway, if you are considering voting for Trump, think about honoring this Cohen s dying wish instead. We don t need to  make America great again.  America is already great.But we can make it better by voting Blue in November.Featured image via Legacy/YouTube",0
8605, Third Grader ROASTS Trump With Hilarious Letter Obliterating His Deportation Rhetoric (IMAGE),"Since the start of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, he s gone after pretty much every minority group there is. Along with his obvious and seemingly deliberate racism, he s also declared that he will deport all undocumented immigrants, mainly the ones he can tell by skin color. In other words, Latinos and Muslims. His words have been horrendous and have reached far and wide all across the United States.His words have even reached a young third grader, who seems to be taking an ESL (English as a Second Language) course, and their teacher in Ohio posted a letter the child wrote concerning Donald Trump to Facebook for all the world to see. Why? Because it s AMAZING.The letter reads, in its original grammar: I have a dream 2016!I have a dream that Donald Trump will not be president. But if he does all Asians, Africans and Mexicans have to go back to their contry. Without them the U.S.A. population will go down to 12,0000 people only.

8606, JFK’s Grandson Obliterates Ted Cruz’s Fantasy That JFK Would Be A Republican Today,"Ted Cruz would like us all to believe that John F. Kennedy would be a Republican today if he were alive. JFK s grandson not only disputed Cruz s claim, he torpedoed it.In an op-ed for Politico, Jack Kennedy Schlossberg repeatedly demonstrated that the Republican presidential wannabe and JFK fanboy is full of bullshit.Cruz has referenced JFK on several occasions throughout his presidential campaign insisting that the late former president would not be a Democrat today, but would instead join the Republican Party. JFK campaigned on tax cuts, limiting government and standing up and defeating Soviet communists,  he said in New Hampshire earlier this week.  JFK would be a Republican today. He stood for religious liberty, and he would be tarred and feathered by the modern Democratic Party. Not so fast, says Schlossberg. As Kennedy s grandson, and as a student of his life, legacy and administration, I find this notion and the suggestion that Ted Cruz is somehow taking up his mantle absurd. Were my grandfather alive today, he d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since 1963, he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a Republican. Indeed, according to Schlossberg and the historical record, John F. Kennedy was, and still is, a liberal hero who stood in stark contrast to the conservatives who have overrun the GOP in the present day.For instance, here s Schlossberg on Kennedy s record on science versus Cruz and the GOP. Kennedy gave science and technology the highest national priority with his expansion of the space program. Most of the Republican Party denies climate change and has fought all efforts to address it. And here s Schlossberg on what religious liberty meant to JFK. Kennedy believed in religious liberty and the separation of church and state. He did not believe in the right of elected officials to impose their religious views on others. And considering how JFK was attacked because of his Catholic faith, Schlossberg pointed out that  he would be horrified by the attacks made against Muslim-Americans by leading Republican candidates for president. Schlossberg didn t stop there either. He continued to obliterate Ted Cruz s fantasy of a Republican JFK even further.On voting rights: He championed legislation to ensure that all Americans could exercise their right to vote. He did not spend his time devising ways to disenfranchise certain segments of the population. On immigration: As a senator and president he supported immigration reform that would welcome more hopeful men and women to America s shores. He did not try to close our borders, demonize foreign nationals or separate families by deporting parents with American children. Even JFK s stances on foreign policy differ from Cruz s by a wide margin.When it came to projecting American strength and power around the globe, JFK  didn t substitute bluster and bombast for statesmanship and resolve,  and he certainly  did not propose a perpetual war footing or unilateral displays of force. JFK would be particularly pleased about how President Obama has used diplomacy to reach common ground with Iran and Cuba and Schlossberg called out Cruz by name for irresponsibly forcing a government shutdown in 2013 and leading the constant obstruction in the Senate as things his grandfather would despise. Kennedy believed government could help organize the best of America s energies and skills. He created new federal programs with ambitious goals, such as the Peace Corps. He did not spend his years in the House and Senate devoted to obstructing the opposition. He certainly did not lead an effort, as Cruz did, to shut down the federal government to score political points and deny health insurance to millions. And in a final knockout blow to Ted Cruz, Schlossberg described how if the Texas senator had listened carefully to JFK s nomination speech in 1960, he would know that his claim about Kennedy being all about lower taxes, talking tough to the Soviet Union, and supporting limited government is totally wrong. As it turns out, Kennedy admitted that taxes would not always be low because it would take everyone chipping in their fair share to make government work better for everyone and promised that he would not deliver harsh rhetoric against the Soviets.  Clearly, Cruz hasn t read that speech,  Schlossberg wrote.In conclusion, Schlossberg said,  Today, my grandfather would be 98 years old. He d have no idea how to use a cell phone, and he d be shocked by just how far the Republican Party has lost its way. It s safe to say that Ted Cruz should probably keep his damn mouth shut the next time he thinks about bringing up John F. Kennedy as an example of a president who would be a Republican today.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
8607, Trump Supporter Gets What He Deserves After Attacking Peaceful Protester At Rally (VIDEO),"Folks, violence is never the answer. Certainly not in situations like the one that you re about to read about and watch.Two peaceful (and silent) protesters attended the infamous Donald Trump and Sarah Palin rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Tuesday. As you ll be able to see in the first four seconds of the video, a Trump supporter pushes them when all they were doing was standing there. For one, that s not their job (let security be the dicks). Secondly, it was completely uncalled for no matter who it was, even if it was security that did it.Later in the video, a guy in a cowboy hat attempts to drag them out around the same time a uniformed cop arrives. Instead of being retaliated against in a violent nature, the protester knocks the guy s cowboy hat off. It wasn t exactly the most professional response, but hey, he was being dragged out by a man who had no business putting his hands on him. He could have responded in a whole host of other ways that would not have been preferable, such as throwing a fist. In any case, the cowboy deserved it.The cop that showed up didn t get violent and merely escorted the two guys out. That, for once, was the correct way to do things. Kudos to that man. It s possible that the guy in the cowboy hat was, in fact, affiliated in some way to the event, but we re not sure as of this writing. If he was, he certainly wasn t dressed for it.Just to show the ignorance of Trump supporters, you can hear a guy nearby say that the protester was the  violent  one for merely flipping off the guys hat. It s absurd, and everyone that watches the video will know better. Here s what he had to say, in full: Good job, buddy. You f*cking idiot. Get this mother f*ker out of here. He s violent. He must not have been paying attention until the very end. Somehow we highly doubt that. Trump s supporters aren t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed   this is just further proof.Featured image via screen capture",0
8608, Chris Hardwick Lampoons Sarah Palin By Comparing Her To The Perfect Cartoon Character (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin went full Looney Tunes on Tuesday and @Midnight host Chris Hardwick knows exactly which character she channeled during her speech.During Wednesday night s episode of the Comedy Central program, Hardwick kicked off the show with footage from Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican billionaire presidential wannabe Donald Trump.While not denying that her whole speech was a rambling incoherent rant, one particular part of the speech caught Hardwick s attention. Yesterday, Donald Trump received a significant endorsement from feral snow-MILF Sarah Palin,  Hardwick began.  Sadly, no one could really understand it. Hardwick then played a clip on a Vine showing a piece of Palin s crazy speech, the full transcript of which you can read here. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right. It was an attack on President Obama s past statement about bitter conservatives who cling to their guns and religion, but Hardwick couldn t resist mocking Palin. You betcha!  Hardwick said imitating Palin s voice.  You gosh-darn betcha! What with the flim-flammin , sock-darnin  every kinda woof-wrestlin , moose cobbler coolin  on the windowsill, baseball chuckin , flag-wavers, troop salutin , country lovin  anthem hummers, and no to the gays. But somehow, that nonsense sounds kinda familiar,  Hardwick continued before playing a clip of the gun-slinging mustachioed Looney Tunes character Yosemite Sam throwing a temper tantrum in the same way Palin said her line about right-wingers, which drew laughs from the audience.Hardwick then asked the three comedians standing in front of him to define what  bitter clingin , proud clingers  are. I have no clue but I m sure they re uncomfortable around black people,  James Davis replied, drawing a chuckle from Hardwick.Jen Kirkman ended the segment by saying that it s  a lizard that clings to a tree during a hurricane and blames Mexicans for everything. Here s the video via YouTube:This is an absolutely perfect comparison. It could also be said that Palin and conservatives like her could be compared to Elmer Fudd or Wyle E. Coyote as well. Regardless, Sarah Palin s drunken incoherent rants are comedy gold and Chris Hardwick hit the jackpot.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
8609, Reality Check: New Iowa Poll Shows Bernie In The Lead; Second Iowa Poll Shows Hillary Leading,"The news media thrives on political drama, so whenever a new poll drops in the increasingly heated Democratic primary contest, you can expect the everyone to lose their minds, and the sensationalistic headlines will be frantically shared all over social media.The latest CNN/ORC poll is just another example of this phenomenon. The headline from The Hill is indicative of headlines on this story throughout the political internet on Thursday:  Poll: Sanders overtakes Clinton in Iowa. That d be excellent news for Sanders if it held water:A CNN-ORC poll released on Thursday found Sanders receiving 51 percent support in Iowa to Clinton s 43 percent. Clinton led by 18 points in the December version of the poll.Again, seemingly great news for Bernie. But the next two paragraphs completely undermine The Hill s headline and lede.Reality check:But among Iowans who participated in the 2008 caucuses, the survey found, Clinton leads Sanders 55 percent to 38 percent.The difference between the first part and the second part is the difference between  voters  and  likely voters    the latter being a more accurate measure of Democratic preferences. The next sentence is even more sobering.Clinton still leads in the RealClearPolitics average of Iowa polls by 4.7 points, but recent surveys show the Democratic presidential race has tightened considerably since the fall, when she appeared to be pulling away.So, yes, while the race might be tightening, the polling average shows Clinton in the lead.Meanwhile, a second poll dropped on Thursday showing Hillary Clinton leading in Iowa, contradicting the CNN/ORC poll.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a nine-point lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) among Iowa Democrats, according to a poll released Thursday by the Emerson College Polling Society.Clinton has the support of more than half of Iowa Democrats, with 52 percent of respondents intending to vote for her. By contrast, support for Sanders stood at 43 percent and support for former Maryland Gov. Martin O Malley at 3 percent.So, which poll is correct? Perhaps neither. All we need to do is reference the gold standard for polling, Nate Silver, whose algorithm still shows Clinton comfortably in the lead in Iowa, according to both the odds and the polling averages. According to Silver, Clinton s chances of winning Iowa have increased in the last 24 hours to 83 percent. Silver s polling average, by the way, shows Clinton leading 47.7 percent to Sanders  40.9 percent.To be abundantly clear: this isn t intended to take the wind out of the sails of Bernie s momentum or to crap all over his supporters. It s merely both a reality check as well as an illustration of what we can expect from the political press as the primary season heats up. Bottom line: read everything with a critical eye before sharing or retweeting.Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8610, Church That Has Never Paid Taxes Demands Taxpayer Money For Playground,"Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Missouri has never paid a dime in taxes. But it seems church officials still believe that they are entitled to get free stuff, at the expense of those of us who do pay them.In 2012, the church applied for a grant from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The taxpayer-funded grants allow qualifying organizations to purchase recycled materials, used to resurface playgrounds.The DNR denied the application, citing the state s Constitutional barrier against taxpayer funds being used to support a religious organization.The exact wording of the state Constitution reads: No money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion .and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship. Trinity Lutheran church responded to the denial by filing suit against the state, claiming  religious discrimination. The trial court ruled against the church, upholding the state Constitution and the validity of Missouri s  No-Aid  Clause.But the church really, really wants Missouri taxpayers to pay for its playground resurfacing material. So much so that it appealed the decision, taking the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Arguments were presented this week.The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU), the ACLU of Missouri and Americans United for Separation of Church and State filed a 44-page brief in response to the church s allegations that Missouri s No-Aid Clause is discriminatory.As stated in the brief, which can be read in full here: By barring government aid to religious schools and other religious institutions, these provisions (1) ensure that no taxpayer is forced to subsidize religion or religious exercise, bolstering religious liberty for all and (2) safeguard the integrity of (and financial support for) free public schools which, unlike many religious schools, are open to children and families of every faith, sexual orientation, and economic class, as well as children with disabilities. All churches and religious institutions in the United States are tax exempt organizations.How often do we hear the  Christian  right talk about freeloaders and people who want something for nothing? Yet these  religious  institutions cry discrimination because they are barred from taking money from coffers they never paid into.We see this happening across the United States, as Charter schools and religious schools and private school voucher programs suck money out of the public school system in states like Michigan, Florida, Texas and elsewhere.On the bright side, Colorado courts upheld the U.S. Constitution in June of last year. The state s highest court struck down the use of public funds for private school vouchers, a move which protected the state s Constitutional barrier against public money  controlled by any church or sectarian denomination whatsoever. Then in September of 2015, in what was also seen as a major victory for public education, the Washington State Supreme Court found Charter schools to be unconstitutional.And here again in Missouri, we see yet another religious organization lusting to get its hands on public dollars, while pleasantly enjoying the benefits of a tax exempt status.The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet ruled on the Trinity Lutheran case. As Bloomberg reports here, the case could unhinge the Separation of Church and State clause that has long kept the government from controlling or being controlled by religion.Americans United for the Separation of Church and State is tracking the case and will publish the outcome on their website here.Featured image credit: Pixabay CCO",0
8611, Oregon Ranchers Who Started Bundy Occupation Threatened To Kill Refuge Employees And Their Kids,"By now, everybody knows that the two ranchers who inspired the Bundy militia standoff fiasco in Oregon are no innocent victims of the big bad federal government. However, new details were given by current and former Malheur Wildlife Refuge employees about the family which reveal a long and very serious criminal history.Dwight and Steve Hammond have had friction between the federal government and themselves for decades. Forrest Cameron, who served as Fish and Wildlife Service manager from 1989 to 1999 described how the conflict with the Hammonds goes all the way back to the 1980s when they made death threats against refuge employees. Cameron explained that  one way or another the Hammonds were violating their permit  for grazing on refuge lands, to where there was never a time when there was not some problem occurring. Cameron went on to say,  They ve done so many illegal activities that never got to a courtroom. Some violations were not significant, and we figured we could correct it by talking to them. A biologist employed at the refuge reported that the Hammonds engaged in aerial hunting of coyotes on the refuge, which is illegal. Cameron said that the Hammonds had an airplane at the time.  They were flying to shoot coyotes on their land, and we didn t have a problem with that.  However, the biologist allegedly saw the Hammond s plane flying over refuge property, which the Hammonds denied.In August 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service was trying to fence a waterhole used by waterfowl, because the Hammonds were also using it for their cattle. Fish and Wildlife wanted to protect it solely for waterfowl use. As the fence was being constructed, the Hammonds disabled a Caterpillar vehicle, sabotaging the construction of the fence. Dwight and Steve Hammond were arrested and charged with felonies for impeding, intimidating, and interfering with federal officers.Before the 1994 fiasco with the waterhole, Cameron said that there were death threats being made against his family, as well as other staff members and their families as well: My wife would take these phone calls, it was terribly vulgar language. They said they were going to wrap my son in barbed wire and throw him down a well. They said they knew exactly which rooms my kids slept in, in Burns. There were death threats to my wife and two other staff members and their wives. My family went to Bend rather than be in the community because it was so volatile at the time. The families of my biologist and my deputy manager family had to relocate as well for a short time. At the refuge headquarters, one of the Hammonds said they would tear my head off and shit down the hole. One of the Hammonds told my Deputy Manager, Dan Walsworth, they were going to  put a chain around his neck and drag him behind a pickup. Source: RawstoryThese are the people that right-wing America are holding up as both heroes and victims. They are neither. Personally, I will admit that at first the idea of five years for burning grassland sounded like an excessive sentence. Perhaps all alone it would arguably still be one (although the details of the case appear much worse.) However, these people have been engaging in bad behavior   to put it extremely mildly   for decades now. They earned what they got, and to defend them is to defend nothing short of good old home-grown domestic terrorism. Period.",0
8612," SICK: Colorado School Wants To Teach Little Girls To Be Christian, Submissive, And Pure For Future Husbands (VIDEO)","A Colorado public school is facing the wrath of parents after they received an email urging them to bring their daughters to an event designed to turn them into pure Christian wives who submit to their husbands.Mesa Valley School District 51 sent an email to parents promoting an event called  Wake Up Sleeping Beauty: Worship At His Feet,  and includes a Bible verse from Luke 7:38 which seems to tell women and girls as young as 11-years-old to submit to their husbands. The event also aims to train girls to remain pure until they find a husband. In other words, indoctrinate them from a young age to hold strict religious views on sex, marriage, and gender roles. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. A video posted on Wake Up Sleeping Beauty Facebook page suggests that fathers keep an eye on their daughters to make sure they remain virgins until marriage, and features a creepy image of a father watching his daughter put on makeup.A girl then praises the event  Especially going through the time that I was, being cheated on. That was really hard for me but it also made me realize a lot that I needed to forgive him and he didn t have the qualities I was looking for in a husband. The image of a woman crying at a man s feet before wiping the tears dry with her hair was of particular concern to one parent. The idea of a woman or girl crying at a man s feet, then using her hair to wash his feet, then kissing his feet, seems pretty demeaning to me. Apparently the irony of this imagery used to promote an event which purports to strengthen or support girls/women is lost on all involved. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, it s also a violation of the Constitutional tenet of separation of church and state, because school officials used the district mailing system to promote a religious event.But District 51 Communications Specialist Jeannie Smith made a bullshit claim about the email not being religious at all. Having reviewed the flyer and KHB-R per your request, we do not find that the flyer promotes a religious organization or demeans a person or group on the basis of gender,  she wrote in an email to an angry parent.But the flyer did actually promote a religious event and a religious organization. The program is put on by Wake Up Ministries, which is a religious organization.So, Mesa Valley School District 51 flat out lied to parents.Schools are supposed to protect our kids from religious organizations, but Mesa Valley school officials allowed their own email system to be hijacked for religious purpose in an effort to indoctrinate young girls to their beliefs. It s outrageous and sickening. Someone needs to lose their job for this. At the very least, an independent investigation needs to be waged.Female students already have to put up with enough sexist bullshit from school officials as it is, particularly from unfair dress codes that blame teen girls for how boys act around them. The last thing they need is a school that shoves religion down their throats.Featured Image: Pixabay",0
8613, Watch This Profusely Oblivious Billionaire Question Why People Are So Unhappy (VIDEO),"There are people in this world who are willfully ignorant, or just unabashedly uninformed and out of touch with reality. Many of these people are in positions of great wealth and power who really don t have to deal with the everyday problems that life may throw at those who are not at the same level as they are. One of these people is billionaire Stephen Schwarzman, the Chairman and CEO of Blackstone Group, and investment firm currently with $333 billion in assets and revenues of $7.6 billion. Schwarzman himself is worth $9.3 billion, and was listed #62 on Forbes  list of most powerful people in 2015.Schwarzman is so out of touch and greedy that he actually wants poor people to pay more in taxes and make sure rich people pay less, even going after Warren Buffett for saying the rich should pay more. He seems to be the living embodiment of Ebenezer Scrooge.So, it wasn t at all surprising that during an interview with Bloomberg, Schwarzman had absolutely no clue why people are so upset and angry at our current economic structure, and why it s the centerpiece of many political debates.The oblivious billionaire stated: What s remarkable is the amount of anger. Whether it s on the Republican side, or the Democratic side. Bernie Sanders to me is almost more stunning than some of the stuff going on on the Republican side. How is that happening? Why is that happening? What is the vein in America that is being tapped into across parties that s made people so unhappy? Here s some advice for Schwarzman: walk into one of your many bathrooms, close the door, walk up to the mirror, and stare at the face you see. It will be there that he will see what  is the vein in America  that has made people so greatly unhappy. Furthermore, the fact that he doesn t see himself, his cronies, and his business practices as the problem is yet another issue in and of itself. The first step to solving a problem is realizing there is a problem, even if you are the problem.If you want to know why people are so unhappy, Schwarzman, listen. Listen to the anger and frustration in people s voices who work endless hours to barely make ends meet. Listen to the mother s who have trouble feeding their children because corporate lobbyists push for more tax breaks and subsidies while their paid for legislators also push to cut food assistance programs. Listen to the countless people who just want to make a living wage while you sit atop billions of dollars and refuse to recognize the reality of the working class. Listen, Schwarzman. Listen. It will be there where you could finally figure out why people are so unhappy. And why people are rising up to fight greed and injustice where it stands.

8614, These Veterans Have Some VERY Choice Words For Palin Blaming Obama For Her Son’s Behavior,"The reason Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump decided to bring  Sarah Palin back into the limelight is still unclear. She was the poison pill for John McCain in 2008, and has made a career off saying wildly moronic things.The latest wildly moronic thing she said happened when she decided to blame President Obama for her son s domestic violence arrest. She said: They come back wondering if there is that respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have given so sacrificially to this country, and that starts at the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. She s more than implying that President Obama doesn t currently respect our troops, which is just an outright lie. And it is also not the president s fault if her son may suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Nor was it his fault her son was arrested. Knowing this, and calling Sarah Palin out for this uncalled for and vicious attack, is the head of the New York City-based veteran s organization Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA). Paul Rieckhoff said: It s not President Obama s fault that Sarah Palin s son has PTSD. PTSD is a very serious problem, a complicated mental health injury and I would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular. Also stating: It s important to recognize that Track may need help like many veterans. This is a great opportunity for Sarah Palin to sound the alarm about PTSD. Now that she has endorsed Mr. Trump, I would encourage her to talk with him about it. Mr. Trump s campaign is pretty light on specifics about what he would do for veterans. Adding: I hope this doesn t become a political chew toy in a political campaign. Reickhoff seems to really hope that Palin chooses to discontinue her efforts of politicizing PTSD. Hopefully, Palin can recognize that she is a public figure and can use her position in politics to not just become famous, but rather promote positive change in the lives of veterans nationwide. Outright blaming the president for PTSD is petty and wrong, and thankfully she was called out on it.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr) ",0
8615, Patton Oswalt Just DESTROYED Sarah Palin In This Hilariously Accurate Impression (TWEETS),"Nothing captures the sheer absurdity of the Republican 2016 presidential primary more than the Donald Trump phenomenon   especially now that he has gotten the support of the worst element of American politics   Sarah Palin.Palin s endorsement speech of Trump was nothing short of amazing, and that isn t intended to be a compliment. The amazing part is that someone didn t send out the hook to pull her away from the microphone and off the stage.Palin s speech was the equivalent of putting a huge can of alphabet soup in a paint mixer, letting it run at its highest setting for about three hours, then taking small handfuls of it and hurling them at the crowd.Here are just a couple examples of the many truly epic statements she made:How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution.And you quit footin  the bill for these nations who are oil-rich, we re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries. Where they re fightin  each other and yellin   Allah Akbar  calling Jihad on each other s heads for ever and ever. Like I ve said before, let them duke it out and let Allah sort it out.Source: BuzzfeedYeah, she said  squirmishes. If Sarah was holding a giant flashing neon sign during the speech that said  Please mock me,  it couldn t have invited ridicule more than she already had within the first one minute of speaking. Needless to say, some of our more liberally bent comedians took to it like wolves to red meat.Patton Oswalt took notice of her shenanigans and decided to deliver his own blistering impression of an average Sarah Palin speech, which you can read below:Just saw @SarahPalinUSA's speech and was really moved.

8616, What Will Rick Snyder Tell Congress About Poisoning The Water Of Flint’s Black Children?,"Michigan governor Rick Snyder is being called to appear before a congressional hearing about how the city of Flint s water supply was poisoned with lead.Snyder, a Republican, made the call on changing the city s source of water in order to save money. As a result, thousands in the mostly black city have been affected.A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately return a request for comment on the hearing, which would be the first congressional inquiry into the crisis. President Barack Obama signed an emergency designation for Genesee County and Flint last Saturday and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is supplying water and water filters to residents.Lawrence, D-Southfield, a week ago sent a letter to leaders of the committee, of which she is a member, asking for the hearing, saying it s Congress  responsibility to address  a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials. Snyder s office was pushed by national criticism to release internal emails about how they responded to the water crisis, and though some of those emails were redacted to the point of absurdity, they also reveal that early concerns about the water were downplayed and ridiculed:A top aide to Michigan s governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint s water as an  anti-everything group.  Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a  political football.  And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as  data,  in quotes.Hillary Clinton dispatched officials from her campaign to go to Michigan to speak to local officials about the water problems, while Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Governor Snyder to resign.While visiting Michigan, President Obama said the damage to the community was  inexplicable and inexcusable. By contrast, Donald Trump refused to speak about the water issue.Featured image via Twitter",0
8617, Carly Fiorina Ambushes Preschoolers On Field Trip To Prove Point About Abortion (VIDEO),"It gets weirder and more exploitative with the Republicans on a daily basis. This time, a party of preschool kids on a field trip to the Greater Iowa Botanical Garden unwillingly served as a backdrop to Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina s anti-abortion speech. One parent said: The kids went there to see the plants. She ambushed my son s field trip. The former Hewlett Packard executive embarked on a day of campaigning in Iowa in an attempt to save her ailing campaign. The ambush occurred when Fiorina  hosted a  right to life  forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. She entered the rally before a crowd of about 60 and directed 15 kids to a makeshift stage. The problem, according to one parent, is that Fiorina did not get permission from any of the parents to sit with her in front of a huge banner bearing an image of an unborn fetus while she talked about the harvesting of organs from aborted babies. Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, said: Taking them into a pro-life/abortion discussion [was] very poor taste and judgment. I would not want my four-year-old going to that forum   he can t fully comprehend that stuff. He likes dinosaurs, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers. The discussion about abortion and the vivid images are difficult for adults, but such a heavy topic with its images weighs more on young kids.  During the rally and with children present, an anti-abortion activist carried a scale model of a four-month-old fetus sucking its thumb.  This is the face of abortion,  said the activist as Fiorina looked on.Fiorina s campaign apparently doesn t see anything wrong with what she did . A campaign spokeswoman said:  We were happy that these children chose to come to Carly s event with their adult supervisor. So four-year-old children  chose  to come to an event to hear about abortion? Is she nuts? It s no surprise that Fiorina s campaign is foundering, polling at 1.5% in Iowa. Her opportunist approach to using little kids for political purposes, exposing them to pictures and rhetoric they don t understand, all without permission from their parents, is alarming and tells us a lot about her.Watch the video below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giv4p1HXyhE]Featured image via YouTube screen capture",0
8618, Disgrace: Ted Cruz Using Anti-American Propaganda In Campaign Ad (VIDEO),"Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said it was terrible that the sailors detained by Iran were videotaped putting their hands up and surrendering. But now Cruz is using that same footage shot by Iran in a new campaign ad.The ad,  Have Your Back,  uses the footage of U.S. Navy sailors created by the Iranian regime as a backdrop for a promise from Cruz to stand up for them if he is elected president.But if Cruz believes the video is enemy propaganda, why use it in a crass television commercial?It once again hollows out the conservative message that they are the one, true, source of support for the military between the Democratic and Republican parties.The ad also reminds voters just how wrong Cruz was about the initial capture of the sailors. As the situation unfolded, Cruz ran to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt to complain that the incident showed weakness on behalf of the Obama administration. Our prayers right now are with the sailors and with the families of the sailors,  Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday night.  I think what the president should say is that the sailors are coming home and they re coming home right now.  Cruz continued: Now, I don t know that he will say that, and the fact that Iran feels emboldened enough to capture two U.S. Navy ships and to take 10 sailors into custody is really a demonstration of the unbelievable weakness of the Obama-Clinton foreign policy. We have a Commander-in-Chief where the bad actors of the world have learned that he will not stand up to them. Remember this is the same Barack Obama who is trying to send Iran 150 billion dollars. A few hours after Cruz stamped and whined his rhetorical feet, the sailors were free. Not because Obama followed  the lead of Cruz and other Republicans with a bellicose posture towards Iran, but because the Obama administration has opened up lines of diplomacy between the two countries   lines needed in order to avoid conflict. The sailors were home without a single shot fired, without an American put in harms way or an innocent Iranian civilian having to suffer.While Obama was bringing the soldiers home safely, Ted Cruz s ad men were analyzing the situation and looking at the optics for the best way to position their right-wing candidate.Featured image via YouTube",0
8619, WATCH: The Media Gives MI’s Gov. Rick Snyder The Tongue Lashing He Deserves (VIDEOS),"Michigan s governor Rick Snyder is desperately trying to retain some credibility by increasing his presence in the media. It isn t working. All he is doing is proving to the world that he is as much a scumbag as the world thinks he is.In an interview with Fox 2, Snyder said that he would let his grandchildren be bathed in Flint, Michigan. During the interview, Charlie LeDuff asks Rick Snyder: Would you have your grandchildren bathe daily in that water coming out of those pipes, now? Yeah, because again, that s the advice I ve gotten,  Snyder says. I wouldn t let my child chew on a Chinese made toy, I don t think I d let my child, as just as person, a rational person that doesn t know that much, bathe in water what we know there s high levels of lead,  LeDuff responds.  You would let your grandchild bathe in that? Snyder then tries to squirm his way out of the gaffe he just made by giving this poor explanation for his claim: We don t know that there s necessarily high levels of lead in every bath tub. But again, there could be this risk. But we ve been told by the experts  by itself You just don t leave them by themselves. you need to monitor that to make sure they don t drink the water. Here s the interview.It really sounded like Snyder was trying to make the contamination of Flint s water sound safer than it is, didn t it? That s really weird because just hours earlier, Snyder went on CBS for an interview where he said that they don t want people to assume that the water in Flint is safer than it is.During that interview, Snyder was again, completely hammered for his utter incompetence. Snyder failed to answer even basic questions about what people desperately want to know.The interviewer, Scott Pelley, asks Snyder: Governor, is the water in Flint safe today? Snyder responds, saying: We don t want to consider it safe, Scott. I think we ve seen progress in terms of improvements in the water testing. But until it s been thoroughly tested, including third-party verification, we want people to assume that they should be using filters, or bottled water as an interim measure. Pelley presses Snyder: So fair to say you don t know what the lead content is in the water? Snyder responds, saying: Well, again   we don t want people to believe it s safe. Extensive testing is going on, has been going on for some time. At that point, Pelley seems to have had enough of Snyder s evasiveness. He grills Snyder, saying: I don t understand why you can t give us the latest testing data and what it shows for the water in Flint. What is the number? Snyder, still trying to down play his incompetence, says: I don t have the number at the top of my head of the very latest data. And it varies by parts of the city.

8620, Bundy Terrorists Disturb Native American Artifacts Stored At Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy and his band of gun-toting domestic terrorists are living up to their Vanilla ISIS nickname.As you ll recall, the international community has condemned ISIS for destroying archaeological sites and artifacts during the organization s rampage through the Middle East. They are literally destroying history and heritage.Well, that s kinda what Bundy and his pals are doing now at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.In addition to being a wildlife refuge, Malheur is also a storage place for thousands of Native American artifacts, many of which are associated with the local Paiute tribe.And instead of leaving the artifacts alone and undisturbed, the tantrum-throwing white rednecks decided to search through the artifacts, thus putting them at risk of being damaged or stolen or destroyed entirely.The militants even posted a video of themselves doing this, and they accused the Bureau of Land Management of not storing the artifacts properly.Here s the video via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;SHARE! BREAKING UPDATE BURNS OREGON BLM LEFT NATIVE ARTIFACTS TO ROT IN MICE DROPPINGS!Posted by Bundy Ranch on Wednesday, January 20, 2016The Y all-Qaeda militants claim that the artifacts were left to rot in mouse droppings, but the video really doesn t offer much evidence of this. Instead it appears to show artifacts wrapped in plastic and placed in boxes that are organized neatly on shelves.In fact, the Paiute tribe isn t as worried about the federal government handling the artifacts as they are about the militants handling them. We are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there,  said Burns Paiute tribal chairperson Charlotte Roderique. The tribe has also demanded that any barbarian militant who even so much as disturbs an artifacts be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and they have the legal statutes on their side.According to Indian Country Today: The tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service demanding prosecution of Ammon Bundy and other armed militants occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge,  If the occupiers disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property.There are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding. The occupation is entering its third week.The tribe is demanding federal action under both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a  protection against bad men  provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the United States in 1868.Under ARPA, a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land, removing artifacts is a felony offense. First time offenders can be fined up to $20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Second time offenders can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. It s not like the militants actually respect Native American culture either. Not too long ago, Ryan Bundy said that Native Americans have no claim to the land and that current culture (a.k.a. white culture) is more important. We also recognize that the Native Americans had the claim to the land, but they lost that claim. There are things to learn from cultures of the past, but the current culture is the most important. In short, Bundy and his boys are acting like ISIS. They have no respect for Native Americans or the artifacts of their culture. By all rights, they should prepare to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, which they would have to pay from behind bars if the Justice Department actually did their damn job by arresting and charging these assholes as the criminals they are.Featured Image: Facebook",0
8621, Donald Trump Goes Full Racist On Oscars Boycott: ‘The Whites Don’t Get’ BET Nominations (VIDEO),"The Oscars have been experiencing some well-deserved backlash since January 14, when the show announced an all-white group of nominees for the 2016 Academy Awards. Chris Rock, who is hosting the show this year, called the show the  white BET Awards  while other celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith and director Spike Lee said they would not be attending the show. Since the uproar, many other celebrities have spoken out against racism in Hollywood and have supported the call to boycott the Oscars.But someone else has given their unwanted opinion   Republican presidential front runner and infamous racist Donald Trump. Never one to disappoint when it comes to being offensive, the business mogul went on Fox & Friends to share what he thought about the Academy Awards  lack of minority nominees. Actress and Fox contributor Stacey Dash set the stage when she criticized Black Entertainment Television (BET) for not giving out awards to white people. She said: I think it s ludicrous, because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you re only awarded if you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It s a double standard. Trump followed Dash with his own awful take on BET and the Oscars controversy: I saw somebody on your show today say,  Well, what do we do with BET?  The whites don t get any nominations, and I thought it was an amazing interview, actually. I ve never even thought of it from that standpoint. Later in his rant, Trump added: I mean, I ve watched over the years where African Americans have in fact received Academy Awards and have in fact been represented. And this is not one of those years, but over the years I ve seen numerous black actors and African American actors receive awards and I think that s great. This doesn t happen to be one of those years.   It s a difficult situation. Trump also slammed Al Sharpton s push to tune out the A-list event, saying  Give me a break.

8622, A Picture Is Emerging: Everyone Who Has Ever Known Ted Cruz Grew To Hate His Guts,"Sen. Ted Cruz may be seeing a surge in the Republican primaries, but that s probably just because voters don t know him well enough yet. If ever there were a more unlikable person running for president, you d be hard pressed to find him, just ask anyone   literally anyone  who has ever had the misfortune of knowing Ted Cruz on a personal level.While it s not surprising that most Democrats view Cruz and his right-wing policies as morally abhorrent and intellectually idiotic, members of his own party are sounding the alarm as well. This week, former presidential candidate Bob Dole broke ranks and very publicly went after Cruz, dropping some uncomfortable truth bombs. I question his allegiance to the party,  Mr. Dole said of Mr. Cruz.  I don t know how often you ve heard him say the word  Republican    not very often.  Instead, Mr. Cruz uses the word  conservative,  Mr. Dole said, before offering up a different word for Mr. Cruz:  extremist. I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress,  he said.  Nobody likes him. Dole is being a bit too kind to Cruz, though. His allegiance isn t to Republicans or conservatives   it s to Ted Cruz. This is the man, after all, who almost unilaterally orchestrated a government shutdown to prove an insane political point about Obamacare. It cost the country billions, destroyed America s financial credibility overseas, and ultimately accomplished nothing   but it did get Cruz s name out there. Would Cruz do it again? In fact, he s already tried.But it s not just fellow politicians   on both sides of the aisle  who despise Cruz. His past is littered with people who are eager to publicly dish on how awkward, weird, and misanthropic Cruz was when they knew him. His former roommate at Princeton, the now legendary Craig Mazin, has spent much of the past few years relentlessly mocking Cruz on social media. He paints a very disturbing picture of his former Princeton peer.I have 30k followers now, and all I had to do was be stuck in a room with Ted Cruz for a year. I'm sure you're all nice, but SO NOT WORTH IT  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) January 18, 2016@GaucheFilms He s not my buddy. I loathe him, and I loathe what he stands for.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) October 27, 2012My freshman year college roommate Ted Cruz is going to be elected Senator. In case I hadn't made it clear, he's also a huge asshole.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) October 26, 2012But maybe Mazin has a personal beef with Cruz. Maybe Cruz was a messy roommate or something? Nope. Another former classmate recently backed up Mazin s assessment.People might think Craig is exaggerating. He's not. I met Ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour. https://t.co/2ZrbTdjHJh  Geoff (@gacohen) January 20, 2016Hilariously, The Daily Beast decided to track down more of his classmates to see if their stories matched Mazin s. What they found was an almost universal feeling that Cruz was a creepy, politically extreme asshole.In addition to Mazin and Leitch, several fellow classmates who asked that their names not be used described the young Cruz with words like  abrasive,   intense,   strident,   crank,  and  arrogant.  Four independently offered the word  creepy,  with some pointing to Cruz s habit of donning a paisley bathrobe and walking to the opposite end of their dorm s hallway where the female students lived. I would end up fielding the [girls ] complaints:  Could you please keep your roommate out of our hallway?'  Mazin says.Cruz exuded such creepy vibes that even in stories that are ostensibly not about how much he s loathed, people can t help but suggest it. The New York Times recently ran a story about Cruz s time working as a law clerk for Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. The story quickly devolved into former colleagues uncomfortably noting Cruz s sick fascination with murder. It freaked everyone out.In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges.But don t worry, it s not just co-workers, roommates, politicians, and pundits that dislike Cruz. Average people do as well. In 2014, ABC News decided to take a novel approach to judging a politicians popularity: See what people were saying about them on Facebook. What they found was that 61 percent of the mentions of  Ted Cruz  on the social media site were unambiguously negative.So how does Cruz survive in politics despite being hated by everyone? It s not as hard as you d think. For one thing, he s backed by a small but powerful group of millionaires who like his anti-government policies. Secondly, he s a power-hungry, shameless opportunist who seizes the spotlight any time he can. For politicians there is no such thing as bad publicity. The more Cruz s mug shows up on Fox News, the more conservatives learn to live with his inherent creepiness.It s hard to imagine that particular set of skills translating to an effective presidency, however. At this crucial time in America s relations with other nations, having a man who oozes unlikability in the oval office could be a disaster in the making. It s also clear that Cruz will use any opportunity to glorify himself, even if it is at the expense of the good of the country. (See: Government shutdown.)The fact that everybody hates Ted, and that the hatred only grows once you get to know him, should be a MASSIVE warning sign that something is not right with the guy. Is that someone we want running the most powerful nation on Earth?Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8623, Responsible Gun Owner Shoots Himself After ‘Accidentally’ Killing Friend (VIDEO),"On the night of January 7, 2016,  responsible gun owner  Justin Lowrie decided to skip the AA meeting he was scheduled to attend, so he could get drunk with friends.According to the Leader-Telegram, Lowrie was  experienced with firearms.  The 32-year-old alcoholic had been given a concealed carry permit by the state of Wisconsin two months before. The permit made it perfectly legal for Lowrie to take his 9 mm handgun to a drinking party.Around 10:30 pm, as the party was winding down, Lowrie and a group of friends were gathered in an apartment building in Rice Lake. He was holding his handgun.Two friends, Laura Polichnia and Cheri Fullarton, were standing  arm-in-arm  nearby. That s when Lowrie  accidentally  shot Fullarton in the face, killing her.Melissa Leland, a resident of the apartment building where the shooting took place, described the scene to WQOW. We heard a gunshot and all of a sudden people just started screaming and crying and after a couple of minutes went by, I went out of my apartment and checked to see what the heck was going on. One of my neighbors just came running at me crying,  He shot her. He shot her.' Someone from the apartment complex called 911. Before authorities arrived at the scene, Lowrie left the apartment where the group had been gathered. He returned to his own apartment, located two doors away from the apartment where Fullarton was shot.That s where he put the gun to his own head, pulling the trigger and ending his own life in a moment of drunken despair.The Leader-Telegram describes Lowrie as  a man with a troubled past and a drinking problem.  During an interview here, Lowrie s father said his son had been  troubled  due to his wife leaving him and his mother dying of cancer in 2014.The NRA says that everyone has the right to own a gun, regardless of mental and emotional health. Any attempt to prevent a tragedy like this is portrayed as an evil liberal plot to take their guns away and put them in FEMA camps or something equally as ignorant.Cheri Fullarton was a 37-year-old mother of three.During an interview with the Leader-Telegram, her brother, Roger Miller, said the family is struggling to deal with the loss. We try and remember how she loved her children, was pretty and intelligent,  he said. We re just mad as hell about how he was screwing around with a gun, even if he thought it was unloaded. Lowrie s distraught father told the Leader-Telegram, All I know is that Justin made the choices that he did in a drunken state and he s not here for me to ask why. During the same interview, Justin Lowrie s dad also said, I believe the Lord is going to save other people through this. We all wish he could take it back, but he can t; we don t get do-overs, but we can acknowledge the things that have happened and learn from them  to make better choices. Maybe this will change someone else s life. That would be great. But the gun-totin Jesus of right-wing Christian fantasy would never allow such a thing to happen.Here s more on this story from WQOW.WQOW TV: Eau Claire, WI NEWS18 News, Weather, and SportsFeatured image credit: Alice Taylor via Flckr cc 2.0",0
8624, One Of The Bundy Idiots Is A Very Dangerous Man Who Could Cause Them Serious Problems,"When the Bundy Moron Militia first took over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, Ammon Bundy put out the call for  Murican  patriots  to come and join the  fight.  In essence, a man who advocated for armed idiots to aim their assault rifles at federal agents because his father is a freeloading government leech called on the worst America has to offer to join him in doing it again, this time as aggressors.His call was answered by the likes of Jon Ritzheimer, whose insatiable appetite for attention couldn t resist and a slew of other unfavorable imbeciles who decided a patch of forest in Oregon was more important than their wives and children.The Oregonian, a local publication that has been covering the occupation, has uncovered that (at least) one of the men who showed up isn t just dangerous because he follows right-wing terrorists, he s actually a convicted murderer:Courtesy of the OregonianNiel Sigurd Wampler, circled above, was convicted in 1977 of the second degree murder of his own father at 29-years-old. After denying that he is the same Niel Sigurd Wampler that the Oregonian uncovered a murder conviction on, they confirmed his identity from his unusual name and a matching date of birth as well as a positive ID from a former prison guard who remembered him from when he was locked up.The details of the murder reveal an extremely disturbed individual. According to court records, Wampler killed his father while was sleeping by clubbing him in the head with an 18-inch steel eye bolt while he was in bed. Wampler apparently called the police and told them,  I have just killed my father. The leaders of the Bundy Bunch have distanced themselves from Wampler, denying that they know who he is, but as you can see from the picture above, he s been out and about and in plain view, often seen talking to other terrorists as well as the press.Wampler was also one of the men who appeared at the Bundy Ranch incident in Nevada, where The Las Vegas Review-Journal quoted him saying,  I myself am willing to be shot and killed for constitutional rights and principles.  He was also present at the Sugar Pine Mine confrontation last year in southern Oregon. For the leaders of the terrorists to refuse to acknowledge shows a great deal about his character, or lack thereof.That poses an interesting question: How is a man who is a convicted felon part of an armed occupation? According to a spokesman from Wampler s home town of San Luis Obispo, California, Wampler is forbidden from owning or possessing a firearm due to his felony murder conviction. When asked by the Oregonian if he was armed, he answered,  Oh, yes,  but refused to show his weapon.The serious problem this man poses is that if it is confirmed that he is or has been carrying a weapon in violation of Oregon law, will law enforcement continue to allow him to walk free? We re not talking about just guns here, either. Oregon law prohibits a convicted murderer from possessing  any instrument or weapon having a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force or any blackjack, slingshot, sandclub, sandbag, sap glove, metal knuckles or an Electro-Muscular Disruption Technology device (taser), or who carries a dirk, dagger or stiletto. There is a 15-year statute of limitations for those laws, unless the felon in question was convicted of murder. There s no word yet from law enforcement about action against a particular individual at the refuge, but clearly this man, who admitted to being armed, poses a direct threat not only to the local, state and federal agents he comes in contact with but also to the press covering the stupidity and the children the terrorists are using as a shield.Things just keep getting worse. Not only for the Bundy Terrorists but for the entire right-wing extremist movement in general.Featured image via the Oregonian",0
8625, Watch Stephen Colbert’s Hilarious Response To Sarah Palin’s Crazy Speeches (VIDEO),"No one is happier to see Sarah Palin back in the news than Stephen Colbert. Following the former Alaska governor s endorsement of Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, Colbert now has plenty of material to make fun of the woman he called  the original material girl. God I have missed you. It s like a magical eagle made a wish on a flag pin and it came to life,  Colbert said of Palin s reappearance.  Which is great, for me,  he said,  because while Trump, admittedly, has given me so much material to make jokes about, nobody compares to the original material girl. Colbert played some of Palin s so-called  greatest hits,  referring to bizarre statements Palin made about  community organizer  Obama,  drill, baby, drill  and  we re gonna kick ISIS s ass!  Colbert said:  Sarah Palin just guaranteed Donald Trump the Evangelical vote, because I think she was speaking in tongues! While Donald Trump has been a frequent target of Colbert, no one has come close to the original  material girl.  Palin was a primary target of Colbert s during his 10-year run of his Colbert Report on Comedy Central.There s truly lots to make fun of. It seems that Palin has gone off the deep end lately more so than ever before. She even had the nerve to blame the president for her son s delinquency and her rambling speeches give a clear impression of someone that doesn t seem to have things together.In any case, Trump, who apparently is excited about Palin s endorsement, said that he would have a position for her in his administration, possibly vice president. It all sounds quite frightening. But for now let s laugh at these two.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",0
8626, Donna Brazile DESTROYS Palin For Blaming Her Woman-Beating Son’s Arrest On Obama (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin did something entirely expected of her, yet so irrationally stupid that it is almost baffling following the arrest of her son for drunkenly beating his girlfriend and making threats with a semiautomatic weapon: She found a way to blame President Obama.At a Trump rally, where nonsensical bullshit is accepted as fact without question by the vapid, racist buffoons that make up the billionaire s base, Palin said that PTSD and Obama were the true culprits in her son s woman-brutalizing, ammosexual ways: I can talk personally about this, I guess it s kind of the elephant in the room. My son like so many others, they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military so sacrificially have given to this country. And that starts from the top. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to wonder, if they have to question, if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question though that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder, do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of some PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with,  Palin said.  And it makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of Americas finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them. Track Palin served with the Alaska-based 25th Infantry Division s 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team for a single year in 2008, while George W. Bush was still President.Palin s nonsensical claim didn t sit well with veterans   or with CNN political commentator Donna Brazile, who put Palin on blast Wednesday. You have known me for a long time, so I m just gonna say it: she s a liar,  Brazile told Anderson Cooper.  That s a damn lie.  She pointed out that House Republicans slashed $1.4 billion (with a  b ) from President Obama s requested budget for veterans  services, which included a $690 million reduction  for medical care   the sort of thing that would help veterans with PTSD: I care for all veterans   I am the daughter of a veteran. And to go out there and to insinuate that the president of the United States is trying to hurt veterans when in fact he is trying to put more resources so that we can give our young and old veterans the care we need, that s just a damn lie. You can say Donna Brazile said it. I approve this message. Of course [Track Palin] should be held responsible for his own personal behavior,  Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord contended when asked if Palin was right to blame Obama.  But we have been told time and time and time again that there is a serious problem within the VA treating veterans. And I think that s the point she s trying to make.  He did not explain how in the world blaming Obama brought attention to any issues with the VA. Drink the water, Jeff,  Brazile shot back.  Drink the water.

8627," Conservative Convicted Of Trying To Assassinate Obama With A Slingshot — Yes, A Slingshot (SCREENSHOTS)","A Wisconsin man who believed it to be his  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY  to kill the President was convicted last week of two counts of threatening Barack Obama. After four hours of deliberations, a jury of seven men and five women found 55-year-old Brian Dennis Dutcher guilty of writing a Facebook comment about assassinating the President upon learning of an upcoming visit, and of telling a security guard he would shoot Obama the day before POTUS  arrival in Tomah.In comments under a Facebook post in which he informed people that  all members of the fed gov have targets on their foreheads,  and that they should be shot on sight, Dutcher gleefully remarked that  the upsurper is coming HERE. saving me a 800 mile trip.  Dutcher explained that he planned to kill the President so his daughter can  live free. That s it! Thursday I will be in La Crosse. Hopefully I will get a clear shot at the pretend president,  he said in another post that was deleted before we had a chance to snag a screenshot in June.  Killing him is our CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY! In numerous other posts, Dutcher discussed killing the President, even expressing a desire for the Secret Service to  step out of the way long enough for someone    like him    to take the shot  so the President could be  exucuted.   Dutcher also said that he had a stockpile of fully automatic weapons and ammunitions, as well as plastic explosives, mortars, and other things that would make any NRA member s pants tighten a bit.With all that heavy equipment, it was shocking that Dutcher was arrested with After Tough Guy s arrest on July 2, Dutcher told Secret Service that he meant what he said, and he absolutely intended to use the slingshot to kill the  usurper. Dutch  was detained for 24 hours at a mental health facility in La Crosse, where he threatened the staff and accused them of   helping the tyrant.  He was then moved to Dane County Jail. He said he was very accurate with a slingshot,  Secret Service Special Agent Jeffrey Ferris testified.  His true intention was to circumvent security and figure out how to shoot (Obama) with a slingshot.  Dutcher told police that he had hunted animals with the slingshot and that he could kill a human with it. He also referenced the Biblical story of David and Goliath, with Obama apparently being the latter in the tale.Dennis the Menace Dutcher is due to be sentenced for his crimes in March. He faces up to five years in prison for each count, so he may have a long time to sit in the corner and think about what he did.Featured image via Wisconsin State Journal/Wikimedia Commons",0
8628," Obama Visits Michigan, Blasts Republicans For ‘Short-Changing Basic Services’ (VIDEO)","On Wednesday, President Obama took a trip to North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, but while he was there he took time out of his itinerary to talk about the water crisis in Flint   and he didn t mince his words.During a speech, the president let the people of Flint know that he hears their cries: I am very proud of what I ve done as president, but the only job that s more important to me is the job of father. And I know if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself if my kids  health could be at risk. That s why over the weekend I declared a federal emergency in Flint. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) has identified at least twenty-seven kids with elevated levels of lead in their blood. However, that number is likely astronomically higher when you consider how long the people of Flint were drinking the contaminated water Governor Rick Snyder assuredthem was safe   even when he knew it wasn t. Unlike Obama, Snyder didn t think about how terrified parents must be for their children. His main concern was  balancing  a budget, safety be damned.The president also blasted Republican lawmakers for  short-changing  the people of Flint: It is a reminder of why you can t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people and that we together provide as a government to make sure that public health and safety is preserved. The horrifying thing about all of this is that if it were up to the GOP, this would happen a helluva a lot more often. The Republican Party absolutely despises regulations that they believe are unnecessary   that includes clean water and air.  As a matter of fact, last week while the Flint water crisis was raging on, Republicans in the House voted to overturn provisions of the Clean Water Act that protects streams. Last June, Senate Republicans voted to repeal the very same thing.Think about that for a minute. Lawmakers on both a state and federal level have known about the crisis in Flint for more than a year, and the GOP voted to repeal laws related to clean water at least TWICE in that time. These pro-life lawmakers didn t care at all that tiny humans were literally being poisoned, the only thing that mattered was sticking it to Obama because they didn t like his new provisions for the Clean Water Act.While Republican representatives in the federal government were trying to gut the Clean Water Act, Governor Snyder was busy ignoring the crisis in Flint. He knew that people were drinking dirty and instead of fixing the problem he just allowed children to continue to ingest lead. Not only did he know it was happening, he didn t care enough to stop it!The Flint water crisis a perfect example of what happens when Republicans are left in charge of anything   and it s terrifying.Watch:Featured image: video screenshot",0
8629, BET Had More Than A Few Things To Say To Stacey Dash About Her Hypocrisy (TWEETS),"By now you ve probably heard about the remarks Clueless  star and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash made about race, segregation and BET. However, if you haven t they went something like this: I think it s ludicrous. We have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you re only awarded it you re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms, it s a double standard there shouldn t be a black history month. We re Americans. Period. Well, as you can only imagine that didn t go over so well. The twitterverse had her name trending within hours and pretty much everyone had something to say regarding Dash s ridiculous remarks. In fact, BET responded themselves.

She really and truly seems clueless as her former role suggests.It s clear why Fox News hired her. Dash will say the things that clearly don t make sense to appeal to the audience that Fox has built up over the years   old, white people who are angry and scared of anyone who doesn t look or sound like them. It s too bad, really, because she s in a role where she could reach out to that audience to offer some much-needed clarity, but instead she caters to their myopic minds by agreeing with them and telling them what they want to hear.Featured image: Twitter ",0

He suggested that America has hit a dangerously slippery slope in regards to Americans being held abroad in prisons, because the fact we did something to get our people home would only invite more and more demands in future incidents.Poe agreed that it was a very sad state of affairs for the nation. The  price  as he put it, that America had paid was simply too high. What price is acceptable, he didn t say. He only continued on to lament the fact that the days of Ronald Reagan and not negotiating with terrorists were gone from the country.Since he brought up Ronald Reagan and his policy of not negotiating with terrorists, let s take a closer look at that.During Reagan s second term, officials of his administration and very likely Reagan himself secretly and illegally sold weapons to Iran. Iran was under an arms embargo at the time because they were considered a terrorist state. The sale was done in order to bribe Iran to help facilitate the release of American hostages in Lebanon.The Republican revisionism and selective memory, when it comes to the legacy of Ronald Reagan is nothing short of amazing. The Iran-Contra scandal happened when practically every establishment Republican was alive and old enough to be able to watch the news or read the newspaper. It s like Germany insisting World War 2 never happened, and instead the entire nation was on vacation for 6 years.President Obama did everything right, getting our people home, not firing one bullet to do it, while not sending more weapons into the hands of those who can do us harm, and the first reaction from the right is to attack him for it.I m sure Republicans wish the prisoners were still being held so they had a political football, but can t they just try to repeal Obamacare again?[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242909973  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]featured image via YouTube screen capture",0
8631, Millionaire Palin And Billioniare Trump Beg Gullible Supporters To Pay For Sarah’s Travel Costs,"If you ve ever noticed how Donald Trump brags more about how much money he s made than how much he s given away, that s because he s notoriously uncharitable. Apparently that same level of pennypinching applies to the people who come out to endorse him   even conservative celebrity Sarah Palin.According to a new fundraising email sent from Sarah Palin s controversial Political Action Committee (SarahPAC), Palin needs her supporters to break out their checkbooks and give as much as they can to the one time vice presidential candidate so she can attend  political events to support endorsed candidates  like Trump. The email, captured by Politico reporter Ken Vogel shamelessly tells Palin s loyal fans to visit the PAC s website to  [contribute] what you can  because Palin  went all in for Donald Trump. As bizarre as it is for Trump to not offer to cover travel expenses for his new best friend and political ally, it s downright offensive to suggest Palin herself can t afford to pay her own way, either. This is the same person, after all, who recently put her $2.5 million Arizona mansion on the market. She s also the person who quit her job as governor in order to cash in on a book deal and a Fox News gig that earned her around $12 million. She may not be Donald Trump rich, but she s wealthy enough to buy a ticket or two from Travelocity.Longtime followers of Sarah Palin s grift machine won t be surprised by this latest moneygrab. SarahPAC has consistently operated like a personal bank account for Palin. The millions of dollars pulled in by gullible conservatives rarely go to meaningful political campaigns. Instead, the  fiscal conservative uses the money to fund her lifestyle and promote her brand.As political watchdog group Open Secrets noted in 2014:What did SarahPAC spend most of its money on, then, in the third quarter? Many of the same consultants she has used all along   for speechwriting, fundraising, logistics and research. There s even someone paid to consult on  coalitions.  Travel, presumably for Palin, is part of the equation; a PAC like this is useful for keeping a high profile nationally without having to pay those pesky airline and hotel tabs out of personal funds. And the PAC sent $10,885 to HarperCollins   publisher of all three of Palin s books   for  books for donor fulfillment.  That wasn t the only book purchase by the committee: A lump sum of $13,000 was listed as being spent for  lodging, SUV rental, books for donors. In other words, Palin s SuperPAC is designed exclusively to (legally) steal money from conservatives hoping to get involved in the political process. Instead of using that money to fulfill her commitment, she spends it on  SUV rentals  and buying her own book in bulk to boost her sales. Now she says she needs more to keep up with Trump s traveling circus.In the interest of transparency, let s consider what one would get should they decide to give Palin some traveling money:It s been less than 24 hours Featured image: screengrab ",0
8632," Stacey Dash Weighs In On The Oscars, BET And Racism In America, And It Is ABSURD (VIDEO)","Never has a movie role so perfectly described a person as Stacey Dash s character in  Clueless  describes her. Dash, the newest token multi-racial person hired by Fox News, was asked for her opinion on the current controversy over the lack of minority representation at the Academy Awards and the Oscar boycott by prominent black actors and directors.Working for Fox News means you have to be a total sellout, and Dash is no exception. It s clear that the only reason she s being asked her opinion on the issue is to persuade the 68-year-old white men who dominate the network s demographics to believe that racism has in fact been cured in America, and here s a black woman who proves it.Dash goes on a tirade about the difference between segregation and integration, asserting that the only reason America sees any racism or segregation at all is because BET and the Essence Awards exist. She takes it one step further into absurdity by declaring we shouldn t have Black History Month.These are all the typical arguments of institutional racism, of course, and Fox must be awfully proud to be able to drop a woman of color in a chair opposite Steve Doocey to declare such myth as fact. The arguments are so transparent and weak. If white people had their own network, black people would lose their minds? White television dominates the networks, from the major players right down to Field and Stream TV, where the only black person you ll see is during a commercial break.For black people to hold their own awards show is reverse racism? Have you considered that there s a possibility that black people feel as though they re excluded from oh, say the Oscars? It s pretty obvious that all those poor white actors who are discriminated against by the jerks at BET have a show or two they can clearly call their own.The most ludicrous is Dash s contention that Black History Month is somehow promoting segregation. Yes, February   the shortest month of the year, mind you    is set aside to honor the contributions of African Americans. To racists and clueless idiots like Stacey Dash, that somehow gives Fox News hosts license to proclaim an unfair advantage to the black community, which is perhaps the most laughable sentiment of all time. April is Autism Awareness Month. Are we somehow discriminating against people with Down s syndrome by prioritizing autism for 30 days? How about March? March is Women s History Month. Are we being disrespectful to half of the population because we decide to celebrate the achievements of women?It s ludicrous. Where s the outrage over Italian-American Heritage Month? How about Polish-American Heritage Month? Why are they not on the radar for a good shellacking at Fox News?I think we all know why. Racism is NOT an issue America has solved; not by a longshot.Watch Stacey Dash make the standard arguments of institutional racism below:https://www.facebook.com/AndrewRamosTV/videos/473698129488396/Featured image via screen capture",0
8633, Why We Should All Be Aware Of Ted Cruz’s Creepy Obsession With Murder And The Death Penalty,"Some people have a passion for writing or for music and the arts. Others make sure they stand up for human rights for all and/or the impacts of climate change on our global economy. Then there are the folks who you already thought were creepy and just became a lot more creepy when you find out that they re  obsessed  with murder and the death penalty.Enter: Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz.While it was thought that Cruz took a particular interest in the death penalty because his mentor s father was killed by a carjacker, he also obsessed over the details. As a Supreme Court clerk he was preoccupied with the details of murders, many say so that he could push for the death penalty. And while some were impressed that his passion was deep for this form of justice, others felt very differently.According to the New York Times: Other clerks, however, had a less admiring view of his interest. In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges. In Cruz s own words within his book  A Time for Truth,  he wrote, I believe in the death penalty,  and he thought it was his job to  describe the brutal nature of the crime,  because  liberal clerks would typically omit the facts; it was harder to jump on the moral high horse in defense of a depraved killer. His obsession with the death penalty derived from his passion for conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig, and came through the death of Luttig s father. The New York Times describes their relationship as such: Judge Luttig engendered enormous loyalty from his clerks, who sat behind him as he wrote multiple drafts of an opinion over 20-hour days. But the ideological and intellectual connection between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Luttig also had an emotional element. The emotional element was intensified by Cruz s reaction to the murder of Luttig s father via carjacking. A carjacker who was, in fact, executed in 2002 for his crimes.Cruz brought his passion to the Supreme Court when he began his clerkship for Chief Supreme Court Justice at the time, William Rehnquist. It was there that he schmoozed his way through and got his feet wet in the world of national politics. His ardor for the death penalty continued and according to the NY Times: Mr. Cruz usually reserved his enthusiasm for his unsparing death penalty memos or the late nights when a prisoner from the appeals circuit under Chief Justice Rehnquist s oversight was slated for execution. On those nights, when he was responsible for addressing the flurry of 11th-hour motions from defense lawyers, he would rouse the chief justice at home, give his recommendation, get the chief justice s vote and then write up a memo that explained why the chief justice had voted to deny an emergency postponement of the execution. One would think, as the supposed Christian that Cruz says he is, he would err on the side of compassion and responsibility to ethics and reasonable doubt instead of pushing so hard for people to die. After all, according to the Bible, Jesus was killed via the death penalty.His passion for the death penalty is one that may show more than just his supposed love for justice, but rather about his character. It s odd, to say the least. Concerning, to be brutally honest. Is this the sort of person the United States needs as a Commander-in-Chief? One that is so eager to rush to judgment and push for people to be killed in some form of vengeful act? It truly explains his fervor for war and  carpet bombing  the Middle East to make the Islamic State  glow in the dark. To answer those questions, no, we don t need that sort of unstable person in office making critical decisions about foreign policy and national security. It wouldn t only be devastating for the nation, but for the entire world.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8634," Trump Has BIG Plans For Sarah Palin, And It’s Really, REALLY Terrifying (VIDEO)","If you re one of the people who saw Sarah Palin endorse Donald Trump for president and thought to yourself,  oh, God, she s back  with utter misery in your soul, you re most definitely not alone. She was the poison pill for John McCain s career. No, not just his presidential run in 2008, his career. He will always be the guy who put Palin on the national stage to torture all the world.Trump, being the bombastic person that he is, and not caring what anyone really thinks of him (even though he s obsessed with polls) thought it wise to bring Palin back into the spotlight after her failed attempts at everything from being a governor to a reality star, and propped her up embracing her endorsement. However, the endorsement isn t even half of his plans for her, and we, as a nation, should be f*cking mortified.Trump has now declared that there will be a role for Palin within his administration if he were to win the White House this upcoming November. He doesn t think she d actually want a role, which may actually be true considering that would require actual work and follow through, but he said the door is open to the possibility. He told NBC Today host Savannah Guthrie: She never made a deal, like so many people want to try and make deals. I mean, she just said: I really like what s going on, it s an amazing thing, I ve never seen anything like it in politics. Trump even insinuated that he may consider her as a potential vice presidential running-mate, saying: I haven t discussed it with her. No, I haven t discussed anything with her about what she d do, but she s somebody I really like and I respect. And certainly, she could play a position if she wanted to. The real estate mogul also took the chance to rub in the fact that he got Palin s endorsement over other candidates when he said: It s such an honor, because as you know, very badly, so many people are so disappointed that she didn t support them. Is it really, though? I mean, come on, look what she did to McCain.However, to drive the point home that a Trump win in November equals Palin in his administration, he said: But certainly there d be a role in the administration if she wanted, and I m not sure that she does want that. But there d certainly be a role. If Trump being the orotund racist with no policy experience wasn t enough for you to vote against him this November, his saying Palin will have an open spot in his administration should be the icing on the cake. It s more important now, than ever before, to make sure a Democrat wins the White House this fall.Would @RealDonaldTrump consider @SarahPalinUSA as a running mate?

8635, This Bible Study Leader’s Crimes Against A 14-Year-Old Girl Will Make Your Skin Crawl (VIDEO),"Yet another victim of sexual abuse can thank a church for introducing her to her assailant. The Calvary Christian Church in Del City, Oklahoma was the scene of a brainwashing that led to more than 50 counts of sexual abuse charges against 45-year-old Donnie Ray Shultz.Shultz, who has a history of sexual abuse, was allowed to volunteer to teach a class on church doctrine, in spite of his sordid past. While the class was supposed to be for adults, a spokesman said ,  apparently some participated in the class before they were eighteen. In this case, four years before. Even though the church was aware of Shultz s past when he joined 19 years ago, they are still  shocked  at the allegations. The girl told police that she had intercourse with Shultz 20-30 times and engaged in oral sex several times as well. Police are investigating Shultz for the possibility that there are other victims.You have to wonder how things like this continue to happen. The Catholic church, plagued by arrests and lawsuits over molested altar boys, still manages to let a priest or two through the cracks every now and then. People like Josh Duggar, who consider themselves to be of a higher moral fiber than the rest of us because of his relationship with Jesus, astound us with incredible acts of hypocrisy that can somehow be explained away with  a moment of weakness  and set aside because with enough prayer God forgives you.Does God sign some kind of a hall pass for depravity or is it merely implied?This church in Oklahoma most likely allowed a sick individual with a past that told a tale of immorality to volunteer to teach a class because he  repented.  They say he wasn t an employee and wasn t paid for his work, but that certainly doesn t excuse them or release them from liability for the hell an innocent 14-year-old girl went through because a serious lack of judgement.Watch the news report, courtesy of KOCO, below:Featured image via screen capture ",0
8636, Palin Blames Son’s Domestic Violence Arrest On Obama (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin has marked her return to the national stage as part of the Trump campaign with another doozy. Palin s son Track   a combat veteran   was recently arrested on domestic violence charges. He had a fight with his girlfriend, who told police that he threatened to kill himself with an AR-15 rifle.At a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Palin blamed her son s arrest on Obama. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander in chief who will respect them and honor them,  she said.President Obama has made the care and security of military members a priority since he was first elected. At the top of that agenda was his decision to end the war in Iraq, which took thousands of American lives and permanently injured and disabled so many serving in the military.Obama has also sought to cut down on gun violence   specifically the problem of soldiers driven to suicide who use guns to end their lives.By comparison, Palin was in favor of the invasion of Iraq, and was part of a failed presidential ticket that promised to  bomb Iran,  a proposition which would have put more American soldiers in harm s way, and in her rambling incoherent speech with Trump she attacked Obama for proposing gun safety measures.But this is the Palin technique. A word salad with almost no meaning, combined with lies and deceptions in order to further the right wing s mission.Featured image via YouTube",0
8637, You Won’t Believe What GOP Lead Poisoning Truthers Just Said About The Flint Water Crisis (VIDEO),"The GOP never ceases to amaze with its consistent insanity. This time the insanity has to do with the water contamination issue in Flint, Michigan. A Michigan Republican said that the Flint water crisis may be overstated and another said that it s actually a  hoax.  L. Brooks Patterson, an Oakland County executive said that the water crisis had been  vastly overstated. However, blood testing of Flint s children has found dangerously high levels of lead after the cash strapped city stopped buying water from Detroit and instead drew corrosive water from the Flint River beginning in April, 2014. Despite the tests, Patterson is skeptical. He made the statement after  GOP political analyst Bill Ballenger had opened a debate on the issue during a radio interview.  I think, well, that s the other side,  Patterson said.  Let s wait and see what the facts show. On the radio show, Bill Ballenger said that tests on his own blood had found no elevated levels of lead: This has been a vastly overblown crisis, perpetuated by a lot of politicians with an axe to grind and, for that matter, the news media, and some national figures, some political, some entertainers who don t know what they re talking about. I had my blood tested just yesterday, and I have no elevated blood-lead level   it s way down there. The idea that the entire population of Flint has been poisoned and that we all have elevated blood-levels because of this is just a total canard. It s just a crock, and for this to be perpetuated as a story is doing a lot of damage to Flint as a community. The evidence or lack of evidence cited in Ballenger s rant has given Patterson reason to doubt whether the children of Flint, who don t have any access to fresh drinking water, were contaminated despite the tests that were done. Patterson said that Ballenger was  adamant that he lives in Flint, he drinks the water, he showers in that water.  Ballenger even described the water crisis as a  hoax. Ballenger s evidence is at best anecdotal. Whether he drank Flint s water or not, it s children who are much more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. Eden Wells, Michigan s chief medical executive, said that all children who drank the city s water since April of 2014 have been exposed to high levels of lead. That is at least 8,657 children. The long term effects of elevated blood levels can lead to many health complications: The long-term effects of elevated blood lead levels in children may include slow development, reduced Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores, learning disabilities, hearing loss, reduced height and hyperactivity. Very severe lead exposure (blood lead levels greater than 80  g/dL) can cause coma, convulsions and even death. It boggles the mind that the Republicans would rather talk about ISIS or repealing Obamacare, while they dismiss an unfolding tragedy in an American city that s affecting thousands of American kids.Feature image via screengrab",0
8638, This Deranged Michigan Congressman Thinks Disaster Relief For Flint Is Unconstitutional: Here’s Why,"Representative Justin Amash (R-Mich.) thinks that providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, Michigan is unconstitutional (Full Disclosure: Amash is my current representative). Amash is a libertarian, and a Constitutional Originalist. That means that he takes the extreme view that the Constitution should be interpreted as the original framers would have. He s besties with Rand Paul, and a darling of the Tea Party. I have been to many of his speaking events. No matter what the topic is, his supporters mostly only want to know the latest news on Benghazi.Amash s extremist view, that is shared with the likes of Justice Scalia, has led him to be very vocal in his opposition to giving federal assistance to the people of Flint. Here is Amash s reasoning for his opposition: While the U.S. Constitution does not authorize the federal government to intervene in an intrastate matter like this one, the State of Michigan should provide comprehensive assistance to the people of Flint. The residents who were harmed deserve an independent, nonpartisan investigation, and the persons responsible for this crisis must be held accountable. Michigan needs federal assistance. That s the bottom line. It is estimated that it will cost $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. It is tragic that Republicans can rail against the government, working to dismantle the effectiveness of its apparatus on every level, only to have their failed schemes be bailed out by the government. However, we are the United States. We come together in times of crisis. Man-made, or otherwise. 10 people have already died from legionaries disease, people need help now.There is absolutely no Constitutional argument against providing disaster relief to the people of Flint, outside of the mad imaginings of what these loons think the Constitution is. Fortunately, Amash and similarly minded people in Congress don t have the collective political power to actually prevent disaster relief funds to places that need them.That s why the Hurricane Sandy spending package of $9.7 billion dollars was approved of, despite Amash s and other Republicans votes against the package, in 2013. Yeah, he voted against disaster relief for those hurt by Hurricane Sandy too. At least Amash is consistent in his world view, even if that world view is a complete departure from reality.By Gage Skidmore from Peoria, AZ, United States of America (Justin AmashUploaded by AlbertHerring) [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons",0
8639, Viral Video Captures The Importance Of Investing In Children,"Released in September 2013, this short video about the power of Giving instantly went viral. Once you ve seen it, you ll understand why.Produced by TrueMove H in Thailand, the three-minute video reminds us of how taking care of others comes full circle, touching our own lives in ways that we cannot begin to foresee.It s especially relevant in today s political climate, where the conversation is too often dominated by Ayn-Rand-worshiping right-wing politicians, accompanied by a choir of religious leaders who feed the masses a poison concoction of fear and hate, served up in a glittering bowl of egotism and self-righteousness.At the beginning of the video, a young boy has been caught stealing. An outraged, unmerciful shopkeeper is in the process of shoving him around in the street, screaming and ranting as she does so.But the owner of a nearby cafe intervenes. He gives the shopkeeper money out of his own pocket to cover what the boy stole. He then sends his young daughter into his own store for vegetable soup, after learning the boy s mother is sick.For those who haven t seen how the video ends, watch it below, courtesy of Elon Iva on YouTube.(*You may want to have a box of tissues nearby.)In a larger context, the story told on this video is one of social responsibility.For those on the right who are constantly asking  Why should I have to Whether we re talking about giving to the poor or investing in public education, there s a message in this video that we all should pay attention to.The right promotes the false idea that a society full of Ayn-Rand individualists can be healthy and functional. According to that way of thinking, other people s lives aren t our responsibility. We don t need to invest healthcare or support programs that  enable the freeloading poor.  The only person that matters is  me, myself and I. What the right consistently fails to understand is that when you live in a society, every person is connected in some way or another.The video especially speaks to the need to invest in public education. While it was once seen as a  Christian mission  to make sure that every child has equal access to education, today s right wing Christians view education as an  evil.  Yet, just a few decades ago the Christian church believed that every child should learn to read and write. How else can a child read the Bible?But the church is now a corporation, and as we can clearly see by examining  Christian corporations  involved in things like educaAs the video shows, investing in a child s future is anything but a  waste.  It s an investment in our own future, and in the future of our society.The school to prison pipeline that we ve set up in the United States is costing our society hundreds of billions of dollars every single year. Instead of investing in the future of our country s most vulnerable citizens, we cut funding for the programs that benefit kids the most.At the same time we create more and more laws, with harsher and harsher punishments, pouring more and more of our tax dollars into the prison industrial complex, while taking more and more away from public education.What we see in our society today is the result of our decade s long experiment with right wing  tough on crime  policies and Ayn-Randian ideals of individualism. It doesn t work.We have fewer and fewer students graduating with the skills needed to become doctors or Scientists or mathematicians. The number of students enrolling in college is also consistently declining. At the same time, every year in the U.S. more than two million young people enter into the juvenile justice system. The majority of these  criminals,  95 percent, are not arrested for violent crimes.Last week teachers working for the Detroit Public School System released shocking pictures of the deplorable conditions inside the city s schools. If we need a vision of America under the influence of right wing ideology, we can look to Detroit to see the future.Educating and caring for children used to be a priority to Americans. But that system has been replaced with a new system which prefers mass incarceration.This video is an important reminder that when we invest in our society s children, somewhere down the road we will reap the benefits. On the other hand, when we throw children away because of petty crimes, we re throwing away possibilities that we may not even be able to imagine.*Featured image credit: video scree capture TrueMove H via YouTube",0
8640," Bundy Terrorists Attend A Community Meeting, Get Chewed Out By Angry Residents (VIDEO)","Ammon Bundy and his band of armed domestic terrorists attended a meeting of Harney County residents on Tuesday night, and discovered they are universally loathed.During the meeting held in the gymnasium at Burns High School, residents took turns telling Bundy and his pals to get the hell out of their home as they looked on in silence.The militants had made an unexpected appearance, which is why residents made the most of the opportunity to slam them to their faces.Since the beginning of the month, Bundy and friends have occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge after seizing a federal building on park grounds and turning it into their own personal compound from which they have threatened law enforcement, used federal vehicles as their own, and torn apart federal property.Bundy claims his group is doing all of this to force the government to reverse the five-year prison sentence of Dwight and Steven Hammond, who were convicted of setting fire to federal lands. Five years is the minimum mandatory sentence for committing arson, something a resident angrily pointed out while also noting that minimum mandatory sentencing affects everyone and were put in place by Republicans. It has been around for 20 years and it was the Republicans who put them in place,  resident Isabelle Fleuraud said.  For 20 years mostly inner-city, poor, minority men have been unjustly jailed for endless sentences  The Hammonds committed the crime, and they got the sentence that was appropriate for that crime. And it is very sad, but it is sad for everybody in America who has an unfair sentence. Not just the Hammonds. She went on to blast Bundy for invading the community and told him he belongs in a jail cell.On woman told Bundy to give them back their home so people will stop stressing out over the occupation.Indeed, the local area has been basically on lockdown since the standoff began. Schools have been closed and area businesses have taken a hit.Ed Brown told Bundy that he agrees that the government is too big but even he wants the gunmen to leave.  But the same hand, get the hell out of my yard. Look what you did to this county,  he said.And when Oregon judge Grasty stood toe to tow with Bundy and told him to get the hell out of his county to his face, the residents cheered and chanted  Go, go, go, go. It is time for you to go home,  Grasty declared.  I don t care if it s Utah. Go home will you? We got families. We need to move on. Here s the video via YouTube.Bundy and his armed band are unwelcome by the local community they claim to be fighting on behalf of. That alone should be enough to convince them to leave with their tails tucked between their legs. But so far, they have refused to budge. And frankly, their treason is tiresome and would have been put to a swift end if they weren t white rednecks. That being said, it s time for the Justice Department to arrest all of the members of this group and throw the book at them, something one Oregon lawmaker has already ripped them for failing to do during a speech on the House floor.Featured Image: Twitter",0
8641, 2015 Broke A New Climate Change Record And It’s Bad News For The Planet,"Every year without fail, the first major snowstorm to hit the Northeast is greeted by Fox News as  proof  that global warming is a myth. It doesn t matter that the claim is nonsensical, it s picked up and mindlessly repeated by their viewers and reinforced by Republicans in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. But this year might be a little different as scientists announced that 2015 is officially the hottest year on record, not just beating the record set in 2014, but smashing it:Scientists reported Wednesday that 2015 was the hottest year in recorded history by far, breaking a record set only the year before   a burst of heat that has continued into the new year and is roiling weather patterns all over the world.In the continental United States, the year was the second-warmest on record, punctuated by a December that was both the hottest and the wettest since record-keeping began. One result has been a wave of unusual winter floods coursing down the Mississippi River watershed.Those floods have negatively impacted millions and killed dozens, if not more. And don t forget the bizarre spat of unseasonable winter tornadoes that have been ripping through parts of the country, destroying communities and costing more lives. But it s going to snow this weekend so everything is A-OK!Unfortunately, it doesn t matter what we do now. We re locked into some of the worst effects of Climate Change for the next couple of centuries. Our children and their children will be thanking us for the gift of wild and unpredictable weather. Even worse, doing nothing will guarantee that the planet will become completely incapable is sustaining human civilization as we understand it. Yet, Republicans are still fighting even the mildest of measures tooth and nail in pursuit of the short term profits of their fossil fuel masters.Let s hope that future generations will have the luxury of examining the past and not be forced to focus on simple survival in a climate rendered inhospitable to human life.Featured image via the New York Times",0
8642, Man Who Threatened To Shoot Muslims Uses The ‘Fox News Made Me Do It’ Defense,"A California man who by his own account spent much of 2015 binge watching Fox News and getting progressively more angry about Muslims says that the only reason he repeatedly threatened to kill Muslims was because he had a toxic mix of alcohol abuse and Fox abuse problems.In 2015, after months of watching Fox News air thinly veiled hate speech regarding Muslims, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations activist group in particular, California resident John David Weissinger began leaving voicemail messages for the employees of CAIR in which he threatened to shoot them. Even more disturbing, Weissinger had already been known to linger around the front of the CAIR office.Apparently, Weissinger could have made good on his threats as well. After police went to arrest him for his threats, they found he possessed an illegal assault rifle. (In at least one of his voicemails, Weissinger insisted that he had enough guns and ammo to come and  kill all of you.  He wasn t kidding.)In many ways, Weissinger s story bears a striking resemblance to that of the right-wing terrorist who went on a mass shooting at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood that same year. Like Weissinger, the man charged with the crime gave verbatim right-wing talking points as justification for his murder spree. Also like Weissinger, he had plenty of guns and ammo to make his threats turn into a massacre.Weissinger pled guilty to hate crime allegations, making a criminal threat, and possession of a illegal assault rifle. At his sentencing hearing, his lawyer tried to diminish his culpibility by suggesting Fox News had whipped him up into a hate-fueled fury and alcohol had lowered his judgment. He barks when he s drunk,  Malowney told a judge during the Tuesday sentencing hearing, as quoted by KFMB.  He was reeling from depression and anxiety. Between Fox News, Donald Trump, and other conservative politicians, the most fanatical right-wing extremists have plenty of material to stoke their paranoid racial and social anxieties. In at least one analysis, Fox News was found to lie to its audience on a consistent basis  over 50 percent of statements made by Fox News pundits were found to be blatantly false  and many of those lies center around stereotypes of groups conservatives hate. Fox has always been a network built by and for conservatives, but increasingly, it has become a gross manufacturer of smears against minorities meant to confirm pre-conceived biases of its old, white audience.The results of all this hate-mongering is as disturbing as it is clear: Instances of hate crimes, particularly against Muslims, have skyrocketed. Mosques and other Muslim owned buildings are being vandalized. Many are being burned to the ground in a national outbreak of arson cases.And if there is any question as to who is stoking these acts, just listen to the right-wing terrorists themselves. They ll tell you. Weissinger has told you.  Fox News made me do it. Feature image via Fox News screengrab",0
8643, Sarah Palin And Donald Trump Are NOT Going To Like Today’s NY Daily News Cover (IMAGE),"The New York Daily News is becoming well-known for its political, controversial and not-so-subtle covers, especially when it comes to the Republican party. So when former Alaska governor and ex-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed GOP front runner Donald Trump, the Daily News certainly didn t disappoint.TwitterOn its front page, the NYDN blasted Palin for endorsing such an imbecile, showing a photo of the two conservatives with enormous text that read,  I M WITH STUPID. Implying that it was a match made in heaven, the smaller text read,  Hate minds think alike: Palin endorses Trump.  Judging from the reactions on social media, there were a lot of people who felt the same exact way.TwitterTwitterTwitterWhen you consider the things Palin has said in the past, as well as her more recent comments when she announced her support for Trump as president, the  I m with stupid  reference makes absolute sense. Especially when you consider this statement, in which Palin talked Trump up: He builds things, he builds big things. Things that touch the sky. Big infrastructure that puts other people to work. He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard hats and the steel-toed boots and the work ethic that you all have within you. He, being an optimist, passionate about equal opportunity to work. This self-made success of his, you know that he doesn t get his power, his high, off of opium  other people s money   like a lot of dopes in Washington do. They re addicted to opium, where they take other people s money and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right? The NYDN has never been a fan of The Donald   when the real estate mogul announced that he was running for the White House, the Daily News published a cover that said  CLOWN RUNS FOR PREZ  with Trump s face covered in clown makeup.While Palin has put in her completely nonsensical endorsement of Trump, it s probably safe to say that NYDN won t be.Featured image via Twitter",0
8644," Ted Nugent Calls For The Death Of President Obama, Goes Off On Racist Rant (VIDEO)","Ted Nugent woke up on the wrong side of the bed Wednesday morning. Pretty soon the Secret Service will be knocking on his door. Not long after 7:00 a.m. central time, Nugent was already in the mood to call President Obama a  chimp ass punk  that needed to be  tried for treason and hung,  along with Secretary Clinton for their handling of, you guessed it, Benghazi. He must have made his coffee a little bit too strong, sending him into a caffeine-filled rage. That, or he s just the same Ted we ve all come to know over the years.We get that the right-wing is all rattled up about the new  13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi  movie that just hit theaters. Nugent must have stayed up all night watching it on repeat judging from his post. Immediately after threatening the life of President Obama, Nugent goes into a long rant detailing what he considers to be evidence that Clinton and Obama are just the worst two people on the face of the planet. What s funny is that even though he comes to the conclusion that they need to be  hung,  he resorts to lighter language in the very next paragraph saying instead, this  raises dramatic new questions.  There really is a difference. Either it s convincing, or it s not, Ted. Which one is it?Pic via Facebook.We won t even attempt to go into the subject of Benghazi, because it s been talked about too much already, and we re not trying to get into the business of entertaining this guy any more than he already is. The fact is, this guy s blinders are truly on. We don t recall Ted getting all huffy puffy at George W. Bush and Co. for his handling of the Iraq War. There were too many failures to mention. Nevermind that, though, right?Here s a video of Nugent from a few years back where he said,  I m not going to call people names anymore.  He actually repeated it TWICE, when the interviewer called him out on it, not thinking he would commit to it. So, he doubled down. At the time, he sounded serious, but as you can see, we all know how that ended up.Oh, and that Benghazi movie Ted was all worked up about? It tanked at the box office. It was a total, abject failure. So much for that bogus message gaining any steam.Featured image via Flickr",0
8645, Bristol Palin Points Out She’s NOT A Graduate Of Harvard – Gets Roasting Of A Lifetime (IMAGES),"Bristol Palin didn t go to Harvard Law School like President Obama or her frenemy Ted Cruz did. She wants us to know this, apparently. Someone, please get ahold of Bristol s personal assistant, email inbox, whatever she uses to keep in touch with the vast worldwide community she tries to communicate with on a daily basis, and tell her: WE ALREADY KNOW THIS, PRECIOUS.Pic via PatheosNevermind the fact that she forgot to use the word  be,  thereby automatically rendering her sentence structurally unsound. That s less important. Let s soak in for a moment the gist of what she s saying, that is, if it s even humanly possible.First, here s some context. In a nutshell, Bristol is glad her mom has decided to endorse Donald Trump. She s mad that Ted Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler issued the following statement when rumors first started circling that Sarah Palin would throw her support behind the Donald: I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on partial-birth abortion. She then went on a long diatribe of how she  likes Cruz  after meeting him, but that this statement was just way over the line. Cue the inspired  I didn t go to Harvard Law School  quote. In other words, she s saying she knows a few things despite not knowing other things.Okay, we re done trying to understand Palin logic. Our heads are starting to hurt. Cue the internet reaction where she s currently getting the roasting of a lifetime for making the comment.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.In all fairness, we finally do get what Bristol was trying to say: She s not that bright but is still going to speak up regardless. In that respect, the apple doesn t seem to fall too far from the tree. Perhaps next time she can say something like:  I didn t get married, but I still know how to teach abstinence and make babies at the same time. Featured image via Flickr",0
8646, GOP Strategist: Trump Supporters Are All ‘Crazy’ Nazis ‘Who Masturbate To Anime’ (VIDEO),"When one searches for the perfect way to describe supporters of Donald Trump, many things come to mind. Many are white supremacists. They re almost all Islamophobic bigots. They re definitely uneducated cretinous taint barnacles. They re violent people who express their discontent in the form of beatings. But no one, no one, has described Trump fans so perfectly as GOP strategist Rick Wilson.Responding to a question about Trump s massive white supremacist following on MSNBC s All In With Chris Hayes, Wilson let his frustration with the sort of people Trump is attracting fly loose. I think that there is definitely still a very significant portion of the party that is a limited government conservatism based faction of the overall coalition,  Wilson said.  Now the screamers and the crazy people on the all-right as they call it, you know, who love Donald Trump, who have plenty of Hitler iconography in their Twitter icons and names They sure do,  Hayes interrupted.  I can back that up.  Wilson continued:Yes, he went there: Donald Trump s supporters are basement-dwelling neckbeards who possess a strong sense of ethnic nationalism and are brought to climax by pictures of cartoon characters. Wilson says that, despite Trump s wide appeal among conservatives, he doesn t think  this other stuff that Trump is toying with is really a part of the mainstream conservative movement by any stretch of the imagination. The question to me is, this is all going to be tested, right?  Hayes replied.  I agree with you: there are large parts of people who are avowed Republicans and conservatives who genuinely care about limited government. But what we re seeing right now is this sort of electoral test. And that s what makes today so fascinating, this fight so fascinating. Watch the segment below:Featured image via IGN/Vocativ",0
8647, WATCH: This Hilarious Video Is The Only Way Palin’s Trump Endorsement Word Salad Makes Any Sense,"Sarah Palin s horrific word salad of an endorsement of Donald Trump on Tuesday evening didn t make sense in any language resembling English, but a viral Vine video puts Palin s praise in the only context where it works: In the mouth of Iggy Azalea.In the video from Lindsey Bieda entitled  Iggy s freestyle has gotten quite a bit weaker,  the words from Azalea s rap breakdown have been replaced by audio of Palin from the Trump announcement.Instead of the Australia-born Azalea s  Fancy,  we hear Palin s eardrum piercing rhyme:  Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions. In case you feel like the creator of the Vine took poor Palin out of context, this is the entire paragraph from that section of the speech, which would probably make the most epic rap video in history if it received the same treatment:Well, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny, but now, what they re doing is wailing,  well, Trump and his, uh, uh, uh, Trumpeters, they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious. What the heck would the establishment know about conservatism? Tell me, is this conservative? GOP majorities handing over a blank check to fund Obamacare and Planned Parenthood and illegal immigration that competes for your jobs, and turning safety nets into hammocks, and all these new Democrat voters that are going to be coming on over border as we keep the borders open, and bequeathing our children millions in new debt, and refusing to fight back for our solvency, and our sovereignty, even though that s why we elected them and sent them as a majority to DC. No! If they re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell us that we re not conservative enough in order to be able to make these changes in America that we know need to be Now they re concerned about this ideological purity? Give me a break! Who are they to say that? Oh tell somebody like, Phyllis Schlafly, she is the Republican, conservative movement icon and hero and a Trump supporter. Tell her she s not conservative. How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. Tell us that we re not red enough? Yeah, coming from the establishment. Right.Got that?At least with the Azalea video you don t have to watch Trump off to the side, leering as he watches the grotesque display go on and on and on.Featured image via YouTube/Vine",0
8648, Racist Joe Arpaio Extorts Money For Re-Election By Threatening To Retire (SCREENSHOTS),"Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a vile creature. The 83-year-old has reigned over the Arizona county for more than twenty years, much to the dismay of the Hispanic community, and he s running for office again. But, the way he is soliciting donations from his scared, xenophobic supporters this time around is absolutely infuriating.In an email sent out to supporters recently, America s Most Racist Sheriff extorts money from his ignorant voters by threatening to retire. The email s subject line is: Announcement: I ve made a difficult decision  and begins by calling on his  patriots  to support him or else: After hours of prayer, and countless frank discussions with my wife Ava and other trusted advisors, I have decided my time as Sheriff is over, unless I can count on you to stand with me this election. Arpaio then goes on to blame  left-wing elites,  his immigration stance,  Obama s political machine,  and  Hollywood leftists  for the tough road he has ahead of him should he decide to run for re-election. He tells his supporters that they need to empty their wallets and help him defeat the scary liberals who want to see him out of office: For some of you $5 is all you can spare today. But for others $500 or even $1,000 is a sacrificial gift you are willing to make. My team has told me that because our reserves are almost completely drained I will need to raise at least 5 million dollars to have a fighting chance, so every single dollar helps. To be clear, this is absolutely, 100 percent extortion. The definition of which is  the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats. He is threatening that he will retire and not bother to run again unless his faithful, immigrant-hating supporters shell out money for him. He doesn t just tell them he d like to be their sheriff again, he threatens them. And this isn t the first time he has duped voters.In 2015, he sent an email out with a similarly deceiving subject line: They re trying to recall me.  Nobody was trying to recall him at the time. I mean, we always want to recall him but there wasn t a concerted effort to remove him from office.It s not surprising that he would stoop to such levels. This is, after all, the man who can be blamed for countless deaths in his jail and has made the lives of Latinos in his community a living hell. He was Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump. His bombastic, hate-filled rhetoric garnered him the support of many top Republicans   including former-Governor Jan Brewer.Since 1993, he has unleashed hell on brown-skinned people in his Phoenix. And sadly, every time he is up for re-election he wins because people just don t vote or they have become complacent. For whatever reason, he continues to sail to victory each time he runs.Hopefully, Maricopa County voters will be so turned off this newest extoruion plot and they ll vote for someone else   but, I won t hold my breath.See the full email below:   And here s a video to remember why we hate this guy so much: Featured image via Facebook",0
8649, These 10 Seconds Of Sarah Palin’s INSANE Trump Endorsement Perfectly Capture The Crazy (VIDEO),"Pretty much all of Sarah Palin s endorsement of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was definitely off the wall. You weren t sure if you were watching a circus performance by a lady dressed in wind chimes, a piece of visual art that you might find at the Museum of Modern Art, or a person just before they get a psych evaluation.Nonetheless, there Palin was in all her glory. Watching her speak, you really couldn t tell if she was just really excited or maybe just really drunk. However, her enthusiasm for Trump was most definitely spirited and could be felt through television sets across the nation by people who were dumbfounded at what they were actually witnessing.However, if there was one moment of all the crazy moments that could perfectly sum up the embodiment of Palin s long-winded endorsement of a man who shouldn t even be allowed on a tour of the White House, let alone be president, this was it:Sarah Palin s poetry to describe Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/Hl2OmGIxZT  Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) January 20, 2016If you need a translator to figure out what the hell she just said, it went something like: How  bout the rest of us? Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution. In all honesty, that s really all she needed to say. That pretty much wraps up the modern-day Republican party full of extreme right-wing, bitter people clinging to their guns and religion and pretending to follow the Constitution. It s also the perfect summary of her entire speech. Everything else, along with that jumbled sentence, sounded like drunken jibber jabber to the point Donald Trump looked extremely uncomfortable standing next to her with a look of  oh sh*t, what did I just do?  However, now he s stuck with her and all her unhinged glory. Hopefully she ll bring the same luck to Trump s campaign that she brought to John McCain s.Featured image: Twitter",0
8650, Michigan Gov. Poison Gets Humiliated By Mark Ruffalo After Admitting Flint Disaster Is His Katrina,"Governor Rick Snyder should probably stay off social media for the rest of his life.During an interview on Monday, the Republican governor admitted that the Flint water crisis was mishandled; however, he didn t quite go so far as to blame himself. After all, he s a Republican. Everyone else is to blame. The checks and balances that theoretically could have been there didn t work. This is a mess. I mean, I feel terrible about all this happening. And that s why I m working hard to do everything I can to repair the damage and then actually work to strengthen Flint and the citizens. After being asked if this is his Katrina, Snyder said that  it s a disaster. So far, ten people have died and the entire community has been forced to deal with a calamity that never should have happened in the first place. In a lazy attempt to save money, the state switched Flint s water supply from Lake Huron a the river which has been undrinkable for decades due to lead and other industrial chemicals. In short, the state provided the residents of Flint with poisoned water.Snyder has taken a lot of criticism since the disaster gained national attention, especially from Rachel Maddow, and many have called for his resignation and prosecution, which is why he posted an ill-advised tweet on Sunday. Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis,  Snyder wrote in the hopes of keeping people from blaming him.Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.

Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) January 18, 2016The bottom line is that it is a well known fact that the Flint River was abandoned as a drinking water source for a damn good reason back in 1964 after industrial pollution made the water unsafe for consumption. So it s been public knowledge that Flint River has been contaminated for 50 years now, but officials appointed by Snyder made the switch anyway and ignored history and the facts.That is why kids are going to have problems in the coming years are they become adults and it is why 10 human beings are dead and it is why an entire community is in crisis. A crisis that only third-world countries usually have to deal with. And that is precisely why Rick Snyder should resign in disgrace and face prosecution. People are dead because of his irresponsible leadership, so he should have to pay the price for it.Featured Image: Flickr",0
8651, We Watched Sarah Palin’s Trump Endorsement Speech So You Don’t Have To (VIDEO),"Sarah Palin made her first campaign appearance with Donald Trump on Tuesday, and it featured all of the authentic frontier gibberish we ve come to expect from the half-term governor and professional grifter.Let s dive into Shrieky McJutty s official endorsement of the GOP frontrunner, shall we? Mr. Trump! You re right! Back there in the press box, heads are spinnin . Media heads are spinnin . Nah. It s not that big a deal other than the fact that Sarah Palin single-handedly managed to make Trump s campaign even less serious than it already was. Put another way, Trump already acts like he s in the throes of dementia, and Palin s endorsement is like Trump getting bonked over his bewigged head with a cartoon-sized mallet. It s like a Twitter troll suddenly being defended in a flame war by the Twitter troll s drunken babysitter. Palin simply doesn t realize that everyone outside the GOP bubble watches her because she s stupid and says stupid things   not because she s any sort of political threat. Obviously.I was told, you know, warned left and right, you are gonna just get so clobbered in the press. You are just gonna get beat up. Chewed up n  spit out. N  you know, I m thinkin  And?Again, she s going to get clobbered because she has no business on a national stage discussing serious political matters. Why? Not just because she speaks as if she used Google Translate to transform her remarks into German, then translated from German back into what can only be described as horribly fragmented English, but chiefly because her speeches are mainly about her   how she always goes rogue and how the  lamestream media  hates her.To wit: When I was on stage nominated for veepee, and I got to say, [in creepy whisper voice] Yeeaaah  I ll go  Send me  You betcha  I ll serve Yes, she has a stellar record of serving   for part of her term, then quitting. And then when the McCain campaign tried to get her to stay on message, she  went rogue  and helped to doom her ticket. Good job.And now, I challenge you to sentence-diagram the following passage. Warning: it gets particularly gibberishy by the end.I m in it because just last week, we re watchin  our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage, at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law because a weak-kneed capitulator-in-chief has decided that America will lead from behind. And he who would negotiate dills [sic] uh kinda  like with the skills of a  community organizer maybe organizing a  neighborhood tea. Well, he deciding that no, America would apologize and, uh, as part of the dill [sic] as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow and we apologize and then we bend over and say  thank you, enemy? The sailors were hastily released unharmed. If Trump were president, the sailors would be dead because we d already be at war with Iran. If Palin were president, the sailors would be dead and we d be at war with the Hamburglar. [Trump] is beholden to no one but We The People. This is Trump she s talking about? Trump. Who s all about Trump, and who puts the name  Trump  on everything he touches? That Trump? Is beholden to the people? That s rich. No more pussyfootin  around. Our troops deserve the best, you deserve the best. Pussyfootin ? He is from the private sector, not a politician. Can I get a  hallelujuah!  Where in the private sector where you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize to keep the main thing the main thing. And he knows the main thing. Hallelujah? Did that just happen at a Trump rally? Jesus. Also, no, balancing budgets isn t about keeping the main thing the main thing, whatever the fuck that means. Oh, and yes, Trump is a politician. If one runs for president, one is a politician by default. Sorry. And then funny. Haha. Not. Funny. But now what they re doing is wailing,  Trump and, uh, uh, his trumpeters, well they re not conservative enough.  Oh my goodness gracious, what would the establishment know about conservatism? It s at this point when Jay P. Morgan, Jamie Farr and Rip Taylor would simultaneously gong her off the stage.How about the rest of us? Right-wingin , bitter clingin  proud clingers of our guns, our God, our religion, and our Constitution.How is it possible to be both resentful of Obama s  clinging  remarks, while also being proud of it? It can t be both. By the way,  bitter clingin  proud clingers  is my new favorite Palinism, right up there with the time when she said the role of the vice president is  position flexible. All told, this is an odd alliance Trump has formed here. Palin s favorability rating among Republicans hovers at around 27 percent. Again, among Republicans. I m not sure how this helps Trump, other than to further purge any remaining support he enjoys among serious Republicans. I m not sure that standing side-by-side with this bitter clingin  proud clinger is a smart move. But it s absolutely the funniest thing that s happened to Trump s campaign since he did this.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyfUu_fNQfM&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8652," Republicans Tried To Kill The Clean Water Rule, But Obama’s Veto Pen Said ‘Hell No’","On Tuesday, President Obama s Veto Pen  got some exercise when he dashed Republicans  hopes of gutting clean water rules   a curious mission, given the fact that Republicans in Michigan literally murdered 10 people and poisoned hundreds of kids with the state s disgusting water supply  water their Governor assured them was safe to drink.The resolution, introduced by hog-castrating waste of flesh Joni Ernst, had one goal: to block the EPA s enforcement of the Clean Water Rule and to prevent similar measures from being taken to protect our nation s water in the future. Fortunately, President Obama stepped up to kill the GOP s dream of unregulated waterways teeming with dangerous bacteria and other nasty stuff. In his veto message, the President explained:I am returning herewith without my approval S.J. Res. 22, a resolution that would nullify a rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Army to clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of the Clean Water Act. The rule, which is a product of extensive public involvement and years of work, is critical to our efforts to protect the Nation s waters and keep them clean; is responsive to calls for rulemaking from the Congress, industry, and community stakeholders; and is consistent with decisions of the United States Supreme Court.We must protect the waters that are vital for the health of our communities and the success of our businesses, agriculture, and energy development. As I have noted before, too many of our waters have been left vulnerable. Pollution from upstream sources ends up in the rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and coastal waters near which most Americans live and on which they depend for their drinking water, recreation, and economic development. Clarifying the scope of the Clean Water Act helps to protect these resources and safeguard public health. Because this resolution seeks to block the progress represented by this rule and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty and clarity needed to invest in projects that rely on clean water, I cannot support it. I am therefore vetoing this resolution.Republicans attempted to use a rarely invoked law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn the rule, but the President s veto ended all that, as they lack the votes to overturn the President s decision. Ernst says that she intends to find other ways to curtail the EPA s ability to regulate our waterways. We all want clean water,  Ernst said in a statement following the veto. This rule is not about clean water. Rather, it is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land. This is exactly why we need to vote BLUE in November   do you think a Republican President would have protected America s water?Featured image via White House ",0
8653, Meghan McCain: Ted Cruz Is ‘The Thinking Man’s Trump’ Because Bible Stuff (VIDEO),"There are many, many things I would call Senator Ted Cruz, but  a thinking man  would never come to mind   but apparently, that s exactly how Meghan McCain.During a conversation on Tuesday s episode of  Outnumbered on Faux News, Weekly Standard columnist Stephen Hayes commented that he believes Cruz is winning his battle with Donald Trump because the frontrunner is not a true conservative. And Ted Cruz looks like he just waking up to that fact after having tightly embraced Donald Trump,  Hayes said.  I think that s the risk for Cruz even if I agree with him on his substantive critique of Trump. Host Andrea Tantaros wondered out loud if Cruz has made a mistake by not fighting harder against Senator John MCCain and seven other lawmakers  comprehensive immigration bill. Because, you know, the party of  family values  must never, ever support a bill that would keep families together.  After Tantaros  musings, Meghan McCain made her silly  thinking man  statement: That s red meat for conservatives in Iowa,  Meghan McCain agreed.  What I think is fascinating is Donald Trump was at Liberty University yesterday, Jerry Falwell s school, very religious school obviously. He quoted Corinthians wrong and now it s become this meme all over the Internet. Ted Cruz, in many ways, is the thinking man s Donald Trump,  she asserted.  He s a religious man that I think a lot of people especially in the hardcore evangelical parts of Iowa can digest as being much more religious. And I think that s going to play really well for Ted Cruz. What?First of all, being able to quote the Bible does NOT make him a  thinking man,  it makes him a parrot. Secondly, if Ted Cruz were a  religious man  his policies would be ones that help the poor, accept immigrants, promote peace   instead he believes in the exact opposite of all of those things.Meghan McCain used to make some sense when she spoke, but now it seems that the Fox stupidity has seeped into her brain and made her as ignorant as everyone else on that network.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screenshot",0
8654, Teens Get Creeped Out When Republican Lawmaker Asks If They Are Virgins During Statehouse Visit,"Can you imagine if Republicans interrogated every constituent about their sexual activity? Well, these kids don t have to imagine it, they experienced it.During a visit to the offices of several lawmakers on Teen Lobbying Day, a group of students chaperoned by Planned Parenthood employee Rachel Todd were absolutely stunned when Washington State Rep. Mary Dye interrogated them about whether or not they are virgins and began offering them unwanted marriage and sex advice.The teens were there to advocate in support of expanding insurance to cover birth control, but when they got there, Dye gave them an  unprompted  lecture instead about the choices she thinks teen girls should make. After she made the statement about virginity, all of my teens looked at me and I said,  You don t have to answer that. You don t have to answer that,  Todd told the Seattle Times.Soon after, Dye delivered a prepared apology: I shared with them that I did not support the issues they were advocating for. Following a conversation they initiated on birth control for teenagers, I talked about the empowerment of women and making good choices   opinions shaped by my mother and being a mother of three daughters. In hindsight, a few of the thoughts I shared, while well-intended, may have come across as more motherly than what they would expect from their state representative. If anything I said offended them or made them feel uncomfortable, I apologize. Todd, who is an education specialist with the women s health organization, said that she has never witnessed such inappropriateness during a meeting. I ve never been in any type of meeting, especially with teens where an adult, especially an adult legislator, was so incredibly disrespectful and inappropriate,  she said.One student in the group, Alex Rubino, thinks Dye was insane. It seemed kind of insane for her to say that, especially on the record, to constituents,  he said.Indeed, lawmakers should be acting like lawmakers instead of trying to parent other people s children. These teens came to talk to her about a serious issue and ended up being questioned about their sex lives and told what choices they should make.Considering Dye is an anti-birth control conservative, it s assumed that she preached about the virtues of abstinence-only as the only choice these teens should make when it comes to sex. However, it is increased access to and knowledge of birth control that is responsible for the dropping teen birth rate and abortion rate across the country.Perhaps Dye and other Republicans should stick to facts and reason next time they meet with constituents instead of prying into their private lives and giving out unwanted opinions.Featured Image: CSPAN",0
8655," Flint’s Mayor Knows Which Candidate Has Their Back, Makes GLOWING Endorsement","Governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management team have literally poisoned the water in Flint, Michigan. The city is literally in the middle of a public health emergency, and Snyder is being roundly criticized for his actions that could have permanent effects on the lives of the children living there who have been drinking and bathing in lead-poisoned water.Politicians and emergency workers around the nation have been gravely concerned about the situation in Flint, and many are doing what they can to bring an end to the water crisis and aid those poor residents affected by it. One such politician is Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She sent two of her best and most trusted campaign staff to the suffering city of Flint, to do whatever they could to help in this time of dire need. Clinton s proactive response has earned her the endorsement of Flint s mayor, Karen Weaver. The mayor said of Clinton s response to the crisis: If this was a test, she has really come to the forefront and passed it because we in Flint need some help and we need it now. The statement came during a conference call that was the work of Clinton s campaign. It seems as if the endorsement wasn t part of Weaver s planned press releases from the call, but, nonetheless it happened. She said, when asked if she was giving Clinton her endorsement: Yeah it does sound like it, doesn t it? I want Hillary. Weaver went on to mention that others had expressed outrage and concern over what was going on in Flint, but action was what got Hillary her endorsement. We do want some accountability. But as far as what Hillary Clinton has done, she has actually been the only candidate, whether we re talking about Democratic or Republican, to reach out and talk with us   We want a friend like Hillary in the White House. This is a very important endorsement from a mayor who has suddenly found herself thrust onto the national stage because of reckless decisions by a GOP governor who doesn t give a damn about the people he is supposed to serve.Whether it s Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, hopefully both would work to get Rick Snyder and those like him out of positions of power before they can ruin anymore lives.There have been at least three class action lawsuits filed on behalf of those living in Flint who are affected by the poisoned water. According to attorneys for the city of Flint s residents, the consequences for what Rick Snyder has done could be dire, and those responsible must be held accountable, and taken from their positions: Public officials must never again be permitted to give assurances to the public about public health conditions when they know the assurances are false. Public officials must never again be permitted to ruin the lives of our children by remaining silent in the face of a public health emergency. That is exactly right. Hillary and other Democrats, thank you for doing what you are doing. These people need your support so much right now. This isn t about politics, it s about people s lives. Hopefully others follow in Clinton s footsteps and send desperately needed AID to Flint, Michigan.Featured image via Twitter",0
8656, Ted Cruz Writes Heartfelt Break-Up Tweet To Sarah Palin (TWEET),"Ted Cruz is not handling Sarah Palin endorsing Donald Trump very well at all. Although, he s trying. He probably thought he had her support in the bag, but she took her endorsement elsewhere. After all, the reality television star loves screen time, and Donald Trump has definitely been getting the most out of anyone running from either party.Tuesday morning when the Palin s endorsement seemed imminent, Cruz s communication director Rick Tyler made a comment on CNN that may have really shown how Cruz was feeling at the moment. Tyler said of Palin endorsing Trump: I think it [would] be a blow to Sarah Palin, because Sarah Palin has been a champion for the conservative cause, and if she was going to endorse Donald Trump, sadly, she would be endorsing someone who s held progressive views all their life . Bristol Palin didn t take kindly to that at ALL.I like @TedCruz, but maybe THIS why people don t? https://t.co/1cCwjRYjMt @RealDonaldTrump @SarahPalinUSA  Bristol Palin (@BristolsBlog) January 19, 2016She wrote: After hearing what Cruz is now saying about my mom, in a negative knee-jerk reaction, makes me hope my mom does endorse Trump. Cruz s flip-flop, turning against my mom who s done nothing but support and help him when others sure didn t, shows he s a typical politician.  How rude to that he s setting up a false narrative about her!America doesn t need that.  We need someone who has a vision for economic prosperity, who won t let us get kicked around in the world, and who will fight for our future.I didn t go to Harvard Law School, but I know this:  You can like two people in a race, but there will only one president.The audacity to suggest that because she chooses one over the other will somehow  damage  her just shows arrogance. However, once the sad wore off a little bit and the shock of the break up wasn t so raw, Cruz took to Twitter to let Palin know that even though their romance is no longer, he ll still think of her fondly from better days.Cruz tweeted out sans heart emoji: I love Sarah Palin. Without her support, I wouldn t be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan. I love @SarahPalinUSA Without her support, I wouldn't be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 19, 2016It s got to be tough to see someone who you thought you could rely on run to another. Maybe Cruz s crazy wasn t enough for her. Maybe she needed the added splash of extra racism. Racism that Trump is all to eager to dish out at every rally. Who knows, really? All we can hope for is that Palin brings the same luck she brought for John McCain.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr/flickr)",0
8657," These Americans Actually Believe Martin Luther King, Jr. Endorsed Trump (VIDEO)","Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. will always be remembered as one of the most revolutionary civil rights leaders and someone who made a tremendous impact on America and the movement to end legislated racism. On Monday, we honored King s life, which was taken far too soon.Despite King s fame and place in history, not everyone knows as much about him as they should   as late night host Jimmy Kimmel discovered when he interviewed people on Hollywood s Walk of Fame. For his show Jimmy Kimmel Live on Hollywood Boulevard, Kimmel had a camera crew interview pedestrians and see what they thought of King (falsely) endorsing Republican front runner Donald Trump. The results are seriously too depressing to actually be funny.Out of the several people interviewed, many were completely unaware that King had been assassinated in 1968   therefore preventing him from making any type of endorsement to the GOP candidate. Unsurprisingly, those very same people were oblivious to what King actually stood for, and were also unaware that Trump had made tons of racist comments that King would have never stood behind. These people had seemingly been living under a rock for the past several months, and probably didn t even know that Trump has been endorsed by King s opposites   modern-day white supremacists.One woman seriously said, I figure if he s going to endorse Donald Trump for president, then maybe he thinks he will be a good president.  And that wasn t even the worst response. You can watch the frightening interviews below:It is mind-boggling how ignorant many people in America still are   and it isn t much of a stretch to say that anyone who believes someone like Martin Luther King, Jr. would endorse such an imbecile is probably going to end up voting for him.If King were alive to hear these responses, it would certainly be a nightmare for him. Especially since this has basically been Trump s response to people who aren t white like him:Featured image via Gage Skidmore",0
8658, Track Palin Faces Assault And Weapons Charges After Domestic Violence Report,"It s no secret that the Palin family are fans of drunken hijinks after a well-publicized drunken birthday brawl in 2014. Shortly after it became news that Sarah can see a Donald Trump presidency from her house, more news surfaced   something regarding one of her children. No, it has nothing to do with Bristol for once. According to Gawker, Track Palin, who reportedly broke his ribs during the aforementioned drunken brawl, faces weapons and assault charges after he drunkenly interfered with a report of domestic violence.According to online records, Track was charged on Sunday with assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.It is unclear who was filing the domestic violence report when the armed and drunk Palin got violent with an unnamed female, but we can be certain more details will surface. For now, Wasilla police said in a statement: An investigation revealed Track Palin had committed a domestic violence assault on a female, interfered with her ability to report a crime of domestic violence, and possessed a firearm while intoxicated. Palin s ex-wife, Britta Hanson, says she was not involved in the incident. The unidentified victim was found with  bruising and swelling around her left eye  and complained of pain in her right knee.At one point, Track was   holding onto a gun, yelling  do you think I m a p y?  and  do you think I won t do it?  apparently threatening to kill himself. [The woman] was concerned he would shoot himself and ran outside and around the house,  according to reports. She ultimately hid under a bed.On Tuesday, Sarah Palin announced that she is endorsing Donald Trump for President.  I am greatly honored to receive Sarah s endorsement,  Trump said in a statement following Palin s decision to endorse him.  She is a friend, and a high-quality person whom I have great respect for. I am proud to have her support.  Fortunately for Palin, Trump likely won t care about something like a little domestic violence, given his own track record.Palin was held without bail until his arraignment on Tuesday, police say.It s so nice to see  family values  people show exactly who they really are. Unfortunately, this will do nothing to change how conservatives feel about the Palins, their opinions, or even about those who eagerly gobble up their endorsements. They believe in Jesus, after all, and that s enough to convince most conservatives to look past quite literally anything.Featured image via People ",0
8659, Colbert’s Fear And White Privilege Confession To DeRay MeKesson Is Absolutely Perfect (VIDEO),"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert had a very special guest on to celebrate MLK Day   Black Lives Matter activist DeRay McKesson. Nothing could be more appropriate, and the two sat down and talked about something about 70% of white people refuse to talk about: Race.The conversation began with Colbert s telling McKesson of the reaction to his wearing a  Black Lives Matter  bracelet on the air. He says that with the way his white counterparts acted,  you would have thought I d slapped a baby. McKesson s frank response was, of course, spot-on: I think that people are uncomfortable talking about the racist history of this country and what we need to do to undo the impact of racism. People would just like to act like we don t have a legacy of racism here. I think people get really uncomfortable with it, but we know that we can t change it unless we address it, right? He went on to remind Colbert and the audience what most of us have known all along: that the  All Lives Matter  crowd just want to distract from speaking about the real issues surrounding race. If  All Lives Matter  was true, we wouldn t have to be out in the streets. The police have killed 26 people just in 2016. Indeed. McKesson then addressed the  blue code of silence,  which everyone is aware of. Cops don t squeal on cops   even if it means covering up murder. Across the country it has been so similar, we know that it s not just isolated events. It is actually a systemic problem. He also reminded everyone of the responsibility that comes with the power of policing, especially the power to kill: That means they have a different responsibility and accountability that is not present right now. So true. They have a responsibility to serve first, and be rational, rather than militant and trigger happy.McKesson was them asked about Dr. King: People misremember King today. They remember, like, the safe King   they don t remember, like, the radical revolutionary King. He talked about redistribution of wealth and economic justice   he was more aggressive than the dream that people remember. McKesson, who rose to fame through Twitter, then pointed out how social media is important to today s activist, though, at the root of it all,, nothing has really changed: The issues are the same. We didn t invent resistance, we didn t discover injustice, but technology has allowed us to amplify these issues in ways that we couldn t before and has accelerated the pace of organizing in ways that are really powerful. After speaking about the Democratic candidates and his experiences with them, the conversation turned to the issue that is at the root of all of this: White privilege. Unfortunately, that is something most white people will never want to speak about. However, Colbert is definitely not afraid, and he asked McKesson how to understand his own privileges from being white. McKesson responded: It s about role, and it s about access   and what you can do is extend that privilege so that you can dismantle it, right? You can create opportunity for people, you can amplify issues in ways that other people can t and you can use your resources to create space for people. Colbert then made the ultimate confession, which is that privilege also comes with fear. I can t speak for other white people, (but) I feel guilty for anyone who does not have the things I have. That includes black people or anyone, because I am so blessed   I think there s always a fear that it will be taken from me. And that is the very essence of why so many white people fear the breaking down of the system of white supremacy. They fear that their wealth and societal position will be taken if black people get so much as a crumb of the pie, much less a slice. But, they should fear not, for giving other people rights is not their oppression.Such a basic concept that so few understand.Watch the absolutely perfect video below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8660, Chris Christie Is REALLY Mad Michelle Obama Is Forcing Fruits And Veggies Down Kids Throats,"Republican presidential candidate Gov. Chris Christie is mad. He is so mad, in fact, at Michelle Obama for wanting kids to eat healthy, that he has just openly come out against her initiative for healthier children. Sound crazy? Because it is.Never mind the fact that it was only a few short years ago when Christie lauded the First Lady on her healthy eating agenda when he said: I think it s a really good goal to encourage kids to eat better. You know, I ve  I ve struggled with my weight for thirty years and it s a struggle. And if a kid can avoid that in his adult years or her adult years, more power to them. And I think the first lady is speaking out well. I mean, I don t want the government deciding what you can and what you can t eat. I still think that s your choice. But I think Mrs. Obama being out there encouraging people in a positive way to eat well and to exercise and to be healthy, I don t have a problem with that. Now he s trying to run for president and knows that the people he needs nationally to vote for him don t want some commie agenda of healthy eating. After all, Eve ate the forbidden apple, but there is NOTHING in the Bible against eating Twinkies for dinner.While campaigning in Iowa on Monday, Christie told a young child in the crowd that he ll be able to eat whatever he wants if Christie were to be elected. He told the kid: The First Lady has no business being involved in this. Using the government to mandate her point of view on what people should be eating every day is none of her business, it just isn t. I want people to eat healthier. I ve been trying to eat more healthy. We all should be trying to do that. It makes us better, makes us living longer, better quality of life, all the rest of it. But in the end, it s your choice. I don t care what you re eating for lunch every day. I really don t. I want you to eat whatever your mother wants you to eat and your father want you to eat. And if your parents want you to eat gum drops and Mountain Dew as a balanced meal, go for it. Who cares if kids get sick from malnutrition or get diabetes and raise health costs nationwide? At the end of the day, fruits and vegetables are yucky, and if you don t want your kid eating yucky food, vote for Chris Christie! (please note the sarcastic tone before angry commenting)Let s get to the point here, folks. First Lady Michelle Obama and her push of healthy eating isn t a forced agenda, it s a suggestion. Her Let s Move campaign is also just a suggestion. Just like former First Lady Laura Bush promoted reading, and Nancy Reagan was a against drug use, it s not a communist plot to take over the minds of our youth. It s to suggest and promote positive actions in the lives of children. That s all. Calm down. And Christie, really? This pandering is just outright pathetic.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8661, Trump Supporter ADMITS To Being Racist After Black Reporter Confronts Him (VIDEO),"We all know that the only reason Donald Trump is so popular among the Republican base is because he is because of his racist rhetoric. His Trump Hate  is very appealing to the vile voters the GOP panders to, and every single time he says something bombastic his poll numbers go up. However, if you ask one of these Trump supporters if they are racist they ll assure you that they are not   most of the time.Steve Bowman of Omaha is a different kind of Trump supporter, because when he was confronted with a truth bomb, he actually admitted that he was wrong.WOWT reporter John Chapman, an African-American, approached Bowman and asked him if  he thinks a sign in his front window that said, Ni***r Obama  was racist. Bowman responded: Well, I grew up in the 60s. I remember racial riots. I know Martin Luther King. I m 57 so I grew up in the late 50s early 60s and I know what it s like the water guns the racial riots and Birmingham. You know the south, I know all about it. I have a master s degree in history It might be a little racist. A little? No, it s A LOT racist and apparently it s not the first time. According to his neighbors, an African-American family, he often puts up racially charged signs: He s been putting up stuff like that constantly. Constantly putting up stuff like that and I ll bring it up to him gently, you know,  take that down please you know this is not the neighborhood for that  neighbor Regina Wright told WOWT.  He understands and he will take it down after I mention it to him, but then he ll put something else up. Bowman took the sign down after the reported confronted him, but whether or not he puts one up again is anybody s guess. What s really ridiculous is that he tried to use the Civil Rights Movement as some kind of explanation for his sign. It was almost as if he was saying, I lived through that, so I can t possibly be a racist  If anything, the fact that he remembers the horrific treatment of the African-American community should be even more of a reason not to have something like that in his window.But as we know by now, common sense and inclusiveness do not grow in Trump supporters  gardens.Watch:  Featured image via video screenshot",0
8662, ISIS Terrorists Forced To Screw Over Their Own As Obama’s Game Plan Tears Them To Pieces,"During the State of the Union Address, President Obama made the remark that our enemies aren t getting stronger. If you listened carefully, you could hear the grunts and groans from the Republican side of the aisle, where doom and gloom aren t just political talking points, they re a way of life.The President, briefed daily on the status of the Islamic State, knows better than anyone exactly where the enemy stands, yet Republicans still try to sell fear of a domestic attack by people half a world away like it s as certain as the sunrise. As it turns out, even Fox News is better informed than the people it stumps for, reporting Monday that ISIS announced it had to cut salaries for its terrorists by half:In a sign the Islamic State terror group could be pressed for cash, a new report claims its leaders slashed the salaries of all its fighters in half.The  Treasury Ministry  of ISIS blamed  exceptional circumstances, The Jerusalem Post reported.They also reported that the pay cuts were announced well before a massive money stash in Mosul, Iraq was announced, meaning not only were Obama s tactics working, he managed to follow-up with a crushing blow to the treasury as well.ISIS says regardless of the pay cuts, fighters are still responsible for their taxes. The lunatics have decided to not only twist the Koran into something that allows for indiscriminate killing and world domination, but as a way to keep more of the money they owe the jihadists they ve brainwashed.It s clear that the president was right to call out the political hot air of the Republicans in his most-watched SOTU speech to date, as the rhetoric they spread defocuses the country from domestic issues in desperate need of more attention. Fox, while reporting the truth in this case for some reason, felt it necessary to include an older video with the article about how strong ISIS has gotten and how impressive their weapons are:Screen capture from Foxnews.comIt doesn t matter what the propagandists at Fox News, the Republican party or even ISIS have to say about what s going on in Syria. The fact is, the JV team the president spoke of was underrated at first, but are now showing their inexperience and lack of playing time. On top of being shunned by the majority of the Muslim world, they re being pushed back geographically and decimated financially.That doesn t matter to the right. Fear begets votes.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
8663, ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Threatens To Shoot Two Men In Bizarre Fight Over Roadkill,"The Clampetts are at it again! As usual, the  responsible  gun owning population can t make it a single day without shooting or threatening to shoot someone over something nonsensical. On Saturday, one brave patriot decided that two men waiting to harvest the meat from an animal someone hit along a Montana highway were getting just a bit too greedy   so he proposed a Second Amendment Solution to the problem.An elk had been hit by a car earlier in the day, and two men stopped to wait for it to die so they could grab it, take it home, and salvage the meat from its corpse. Sure, eating roadkill is something one would not expect to create an issue in 2016   but a third man apparently got a bit jealous over the bounty of road splatter.As the men waited, somehow unwilling to put the elk out of its misery, 52-year-old Kenrick Workman drove to the scene where the two men were eagerly awaiting an opportunity to have themselves some roadkill. After arguing with the gentlemen who were patiently awaiting dinner, Workman pushed one of the men and retrieved a handgun from his car. He then threatened to shoot them.The men called police, who arrested Workman on existing warrants for a DUI, resisting arrest, and assault with a firearm.The NRA regularly assures us that gun owners are exactly the people who will save us from oblivion. While they draw a distinction between  good guys  and  bad guys with guns,  the problem is that in the eyes of the NRA everyone is a  good guy with a gun  until they commit a crime. In other words, everyone should be trusted with a weapon until it is too late   even someone who would rush out of his home to threaten people in a bizarre argument over who gets to eat the animal someone left on the side of the road.It is unclear if anyone got to eat the elk.Featured image via ",0
8664, You Won’t Believe What Rubio Said About The Flint Michigan Water Contamination Crisis (VIDEO),"We all know the GOP is out of touch with the public, but when there s a major crisis unfolding in the United States, one would expect even the Republicans, especially presidential candidates, to keep up to date with what s happening. Not so with Marco Rubio. When asked about the lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, Marco Rubio said that he has not  been focusing  on it.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi77s6CjZRE]The contamination has left tens of thousands of residents without drinking water and the lead in the water may have caused irreversible damage to many more who have been drinking it. Yet, Senator Rubio did not feel that it was important to read up on the issue. Rubio said: I d love to give you a better answer on it. It s just not an issue we ve been quite frankly fully briefed or apprised of in terms of the role the governor has played and the state has played in Michigan on these sorts of issues. Rubio continued, saying that he s unable to give: A deeply detailed answer on what the right approach should be, other than to tell you that in general I believe the federal government s role in some of these things [is] largely limited unless it involves a federal jurisdictional issue. Whether he thinks the federal government s role is limited doesn t mean he shouldn t pay attention to a crisis affecting tens of thousands of Americans and especially when Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) asked the Obama Administration to declare a state of emergency and send millions of dollars to help alleviate the situation.It s not just Rubio who s been both silent and ignorant on the issue. Other Republicans haven t commented on or mentioned the tragedy at all. However, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have condemned the negligence that led to the crisis, not only framing it as a health problem, but one that is a racial justice issue. Clinton said: I think every single American should be outraged. We had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways, and majority-African American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. He had requests for help that he basically stonewalled. I ll tell you what: if the kids in a rich suburb of Detroit had been drinking contaminated water and being bathed in it, there would have been action. Gov. Snyder, who s a Republican just like Rubio, is facing a class action lawsuit from Flint residents.Sen. Bernie Sanders  added that he thinks Gov. Snyder should resign:  There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign. Officials fear that some children in Flint who drank and bathed in the water may have brain damage and other long term health problems. Yet, Rubio and the Republicans don t see the importance of addressing and taking the initiative on an unflolding tragedy in an American city.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",0
8665, Seth Meyers: GOP ‘Sh*t All Over’ President Obama’s Successful Iran Prisoner Swap (VIDEO),"President Obama has been working for months to bring home four American prisoners held in Iran. It finally paid off with a deal that saw Iran and the United States exchange prisoners. The president showed that diplomacy instead of war is the right course of action to take.However, that wasn t good for the Republicans who started complaining as soon a  the president announced the deal. It s typical of Republicans to play the partisan card even when what happens is good for the country. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, Meyers said: Of course, a good day for Obama only lasts seven minutes before Republicans shit all over it. Which they did, because Republicans were outraged Obama traded seven Iranian prisoners to get the Americans back. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utJKElxYHPY]Donald Trump was apparently upset that the US gave up seven prisoners while Iran gave up just four. Yet, clips show that Trump called it a bad deal yet also took credit for it. Meyers summed it up well. Imitating Trump s accent, Meyers said: It s a terrible deal we should be ashamed of   and not to brag, it was my idea and you should thank me for it. Trump also denied that he ever said the prisoners would never be released even though the video shows that he did.  Another contradiction from America s favorite contra-dickhead,  Meyers said.It s typical fashion for Republicans to go after the president even when the results are good for the country.",0
8666, Photo Woman Posted Of Unsuspecting Target Cashier Goes Viral (IMAGES),"A Target employee in Indiana has just gone viral for showing the utmost care, patience and kindness to a customer who was struggling to pay for her items.Ishmael Gilbert was an employee at the Glendale, Indiana Target store and had only been a part of the store s team for a short time when the 19-year-old had to ring up an elderly woman. Gilbert had no idea that what happened next would make him an internet star.When it came time to pay for her items, the woman revealed she d be using coins to pay. Gilbert didn t hesitate to help the woman add up her change and remained patient, even as some customers huffed off to find a shorter line. Gilbert said: She was all worked up because the line was getting longer and she was moving so slow. She was shaking. Behind the elderly woman was 35-year-old Sarah Owen Bigler, who was watching Gilbert s encounter with his elderly customer. Bigler was originally annoyed that her trip to Target was now going to be longer than planned, but she decided to stay when her young daughter took an interest in what Gilbert was doing. When Bigler s daughter asked Gilbert about the change he was counting, Bigler knew the wait would be worth it. She said: Part of me, the part that had a long day at work, the part of me who had a 1 1/2 year old having a melt down in the cart, the part that had set an unnecessary timeline for Target and getting home, was frustrated with this woman and the inconvenience she had placed on me.BUT then I watched the young employee with this woman. I watched him help her count her change, ever so tenderly taking it from her shaking hands. I listened to him repeatedly saying  yes, mam  to her. When she asked if she had enough to buy a reusable bag, he told her she did and went two lines over to get one for her and then repackaged her items. Never once did this employee huff, gruff or roll his eyes. He was nothing but patient and kind.As I was watching him, I saw that Eloise was too. She was standing next to the woman, watching the employee count the change. I realized I hadn t been inconvenienced at all. That my daughter was instead witnessing kindness and patience and being taught this valuable lesson by a complete stranger; furthermore, I realized that I too needed a refresher on this lesson. Bigler was so blown away by what she witnessed that she took a photo and posted it on her Facebook page, where it quickly went viral. The post has now gained over 25,000 shares.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Yesterday Matt was sick.

He said: I was asleep at home and everyone was texting me,  check Facebook, check Facebook.' When he finally realized that his moment with the elderly woman had gone viral, he was stunned. I never thought it d blow up this big. Her post, I guessed it touched a lot of people.  On Friday, Bigler and her daughter came back to the Glensdale Target to meet with the media and see Gilbert again. Gilbert said: It just feels good to be recognized for good work. But this isn t something new. I treat all customers the same, the way I want to be treated. And it turns out, Gilbert s lesson on patience and kindness to Bigler s daughter wasn t lost on him. Gilbert has a daughter of his own, who just turned one. It felt like a daddy-and-daughter moment a little. She asked,  what s that? I said that s a penny.  It felt good because that s the kind of example I want to be for my daughter. Since his overnight fame, Gilbert has been offered money and other job offers, although he plans to stay where he is for now. Glendale Target Store Team Leader Todd Davis has said that Gilbert s actions will have a positive impact on his career at the store. Davis said: Very rarely you get the opportunity to talk about something that s a positive impact in the community. You never know who s watching. Featured image via Facebook",0
8667, Rachel Maddow CRUSHES The GOP Fantasy That Reagan Was Stronger On Iran Than Obama (VIDEO),"Republicans have revived an old and overused piece of right-wing trash in an effort to try to invalidate the unmitigated success of President Obama s recent diplomatic victories with Iran.The myth that they have dug back out of their closet is that Ronald Reagan freed American diplomats and citizens held hostage in Iran, simply by becoming president. Republicans like to infer that Reagan was some kind of ultra-tough Republican cowboy, and this caused Iran to be petrified with fear causing them to surrender the hostages the moment Reagan was sworn into office. As Rachel so eloquently explains, nothing could be further from the truth.Watch Rachel completely destroy the Republican effort to try to deny Obama the legacy he earned below:If you want to look at who operated from a position of power in the negotiations, you need to look no further than the soft-spoken Jimmy Carter. He froze $11 billion in Iranian assets after they seized the hostages. Iran was engaged in a war with Iraq at the time. Suddenly the Iranian s had second thoughts. $11 billion in 1980 dollars was huge and they needed this for the war effort. The unfreezing of assets, plus an American pledge to not meddle in internal Iranian affairs and an agreement to work together to resolve post-revolution financial claims, were the only things we had to give them. To sum it up, Jimmy got virtually everything and Iran got nothing except being left alone.The ONLY aspect that Ronald Reagan played in the freedom of the Iranian hostages was coincidental at best. If Iran had not released them when they did, they risked Reagan nullifying the agreement, and in turn, they would lose everything that was already on the bargaining table. You could replace Reagan with literally any other person that existed on Earth at the time, and you would have gotten the same result. He did NOTHING except occupy space. It stands in a stark contrast to Reagan s true legacy on Iran. Remember the one where he illegally sold weapons to Iran in order to try to get them to facilitate the freeing of American hostages from Lebanon and using the proceeds of the sale to fund an illegal war in Central America? But, that s none of our business according to Republicans.featured image via MSNBC screen capture",0
8668, Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around. As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had. Trevor Noah and the team at Comedy Central s Daily Show were the first to hit an absolute home-run with a hilarious segment that includes brutal jabs at the GOP combined with some hilarious Democratic moments as well.Trevor Noah may be having trouble with ratings and people may still not be over the loss of Jon Stewart from their Daily Show fix, but he continues to show why he was Stewart s choice to move his beloved show forward.

8669, Racist Cop Suspended After Telling People To Run Over ‘Idiot’ Black Folks (SCREENSHOTS/VIDEO),"A police sergeant in St. Paul, Minnesota is enjoying a paid vacation has been placed on leave after a concerned citizen brought some of his more unsavory actions to the attention of Internal Affairs   specifically, suggesting that people run down Black Lives Matter protesters with their cars because, he says, they will get away with it.Andrew Henderson, a co-administrator of Minnesota Cop Block, first noticed Sgt. Jeffrey M. Rotheker posting under the name JM Roth on the cop watcher group s Facebook page. In fact, he explained while making his report to Internal Affairs, Rotheker was a regular dissenter. But one remark on an article about Black Lives Matter protesters stopping traffic went too far, prompting Henderson to take action. Run them over. Keep traffic flowing and don t slow down for any of these idiots who try and block the street,  Rotheker advised his fellow Facebookers. He explained that they should  continue to drive and if you hit someone make sure you call 911 to report the accident and meet the cops a block or two away.  Rotheker says that the stop farther away can be justified because  you feared for your safety since in the past people in this group has shown [sic] a propensity towards violence. Since they are trying to block the street and/or cross where there is no crossing you should not be charged with anything,  he added, explaining that even if  these idiots  attempted to sue you in civil court,  remember that it will be jury trial and so most likely it will come out in your favor. Henderson provided evidence to Internal Affairs that  JM Roth  is actually Rotheker. You know, a police officer shouldn t be advising people to run over other people for just standing in the road. That s not reasonable to me,  Henderson tells Internal Affairs investigators in a recording he made of the encounter.  I don t know if that s reasonable to you.   It wouldn t be reasonable to, I would think any person, any decent person, Sgt. John Wuorinen replies. Police Chief Thomas Smith says that the allegations are  of grave concern  given the then-upcoming Martin Luther King Day protest. In a statement the police department announced an investigation is underway and   swift, strong and decisive disciplinary action will be taken  if it is proven that Rotheker made the comments. The statement (posted) is offensive, disappointing, concerning and does not reflect in any way   or align with   the views, values and practices of the St. Paul Police Department,  the statement reads.Unfortunately, Rotheker s suggestion is uncomfortably close to reality. In 2014, a St. Paul man struck a 16-year-old protester in Minneapolis who was speaking out about Michael Brown s murder, breaking the teen girl s leg. He paid a $575 fine and was ordered to complete a traffic education course. No jail time was served. Jeffrey Patrick Rice claimed that he was attempting to  flee a mob  that  damaged his car.  After plowing through a crowd of people and injuring the girl, Rice attempted to flee the scene but was stopped by police about a mile away.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJiRoRtdiSg&w=560&h=315]St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman issued a statement Monday indicating that he is   outraged and disgusted by the post and (I) have directed the SPPD to investigate. Watch the meeting with Internal Affairs below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX2x19Mnz68&w=560&h=315] Featured image via screengrab ",0
8670, Racists Spew Hate All Over Facebook After Black People Hold Anti-Violence #BikesUpGunsDown Rally (VIDEO),"When the Black Lives Matter movement started gaining nationwide attention, racists across America were outraged. How dare the African-American community speak out against the institutionalized racism in this country! One of the most common statements from the hate-filled folks was, Oh sure, they complain about  white on black  crime, but ignore  black on black  crime!  And that sentiment is what makes the following story so ironic.On Monday, a group of predominantly black bikers held a rally called  Bikes Up, Guns Down. Hundreds of young men took to the streets on their ATV s and dirt bikes to promote peace in their communities. Rapper Project Stacks, who is involved in the movement, explained what it was all about in an interview with the Miami New Times in April:Bikes Up, Guns Down is strictly to stop the youth violence. Violence ain t cool. We re saying,  Let s stick together.  We already deep in population. Back then, when it was violence, it was probably one person droppin  every three months or every six months. Now you got two or three dropping every weekend. Or two, three, or four dead bodies every weekend So it s kind of different, and it done raise the stakes. But I know they like to ride them bikes. Give  em something to do. I ma buy as many bikes as I can, man.However, when dozens of riders took to the streets on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the white supremacists went wild on Facebook. Fox 13 Tampa Bay posted a video of the riders on the streets, some of them were driving like idiots, but for the most part is was just a bunch of bike riders   but the white folks were very displeased with this.         That s right, calling out his vile stereotypes makes YOU the racist.The sad thing about this entire incident was the completely predictable way that the racists responded. The people who participated in the rally were branded  thugs  even when they were trying to do something positive for their community. Yet, the same totally inclusive white people have nothing to say when hundreds of caucasian bikers hold rallies and disrupt traffic. Hell, they didn t even say anything when a bunch of bikers got into a gun fight outside of a restaurant.As a person who is so white I can guide the way in a dark tunnel, I am truly disgusted by the way my community continues to treat other people. It s not that difficult to be a good human being, I promise.If you are one of those people who still believes that we live in a  post-racial  America, all you have to do is log on to the internet to be proven wrong.Watch:Featured image video screenshot",0
8671, Perfect Match? Evidence Leans Towards Sarah Palin Endorsing Donald Trump At Iowa Event (IMAGE),"Donald Trump set tongues wagging with a tweet on Monday promising a special guest scheduled to appear with him at campaign event in Iowa on Tuesday, January 19. His campaign announced: He ll be making a major announcement & bringing a special guest. Now, after some sleuthing by some conservatives online, it appears that the guest may be none other than failed Republican presidential candidate and half-term governor Sarah Palin.Eagle-eyed campaign watchers found a flight on a private jet that left Anchorage International Airport, and five hours later touched down at Des Moines International Airport.Since her campaign flameout, Palin has kept her brand alive at the center of conservative politics. She has been a featured speaker at the CPAC conference and regularly has pumped out books targeted at conservative readers. A pay-per-view video venture of hers was less successful and recently shuttered. Palin recently put her gated Arizona mansion up for sale.Palin may be accused by some conservatives of being disloyal to Trump rival Ted Cruz, who she endorsed and campaigned for in the past.But Palin has also been a booster of Donald Trump. Last November she said his nomination was a strong possibility. I think it s a very real possibility because people are really tired of professional politicians who, you know, won t call it like they see it and maybe don t have life experiences that allow them to prove a track record of success,  the former vice presidential nominee said in a radio interview with WBT Charlotte s News Talk radio on Thursday. That s refreshing about Trump,  she said.  He s a fighter. We know he s gonna put America first, and he really nailed it early on what the main problems are in America right now, so it s a very real possibility. In 2011 when there was speculation Palin might challenge President Obama in 2012, she took her bus tour to New York City and had a weird pizza date with Trump and his wife, Melania.While mostly a laughingstock to the public at large, Republican base voters remain enamored with Palin, and may view an endorsement by her of the reality TV star as a signal to select him as their candidate as the Iowa caucus waits only a couple of weeks away.Featured image via YouTube ",0
8672, ‘Obama Mic Drop’ Is The State Of The Union Music Video You Have To See,"A new parody video from the Gregory Brothers shows a rendition of the 2016 State of the Union we all wish could be real. In autotune, President Obama sings about his accomplishments in  Obama Mic Drop. https://www.facebook.com/gregorybrothers/videos/vb.46060559283/10153884847629284/?type=2&theaterIn the song, President Obama notes that we ve had the strongest job growth since 1999, as Joe Biden and even Speaker Paul Ryan are forced to get out of their chairs and join along with the President s dance crew.The video then cuts to the audience and we see some Congressional figures not often known for their support of the President also get into the head-bobbing action, including Senator Lindsey Graham   fresh off of dropping out of the 2016 presidential race   and Senator Marco Rubio.Democratic Minority Leader and Senator John Kerry also get into the act as well, and everyone eventually gets on their feet for a standing ovation for the President s last hurrah.As the Gregory Brothers Facebook page notes,  A lot of emotion from President Obama for his final SOTU. Really can t believe he brought a dance team. So far the video has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube and Facebook and the song is now being sold on iTunes as a single.The Gregory Brothers are Michael Gregory (drums and vocals), Andrew Rose Gregory (guitar and vocals), Evan Gregory (keys and vocals), and Sarah Fullen Gregory (bass and vocals). The group is probably best known for their series of videos parodying current events called  Auto-Tune the News. Their most well-known video was the music video  Bed Intruder  featuring Antoine Dodson, in which an interview he did with a local news station was auto-tuned and set to music (the chorus was  Hide your kids, hide your wife ). It was the most popular YouTube video of 2010 and currently has over 130 million views. The single based on that video sold over 1 million copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA.Featured image via screen capture",0
8673," Muslims Respond To Republican Mess By Bringing 30,000 Bottles Of Clean Water To Flint Residents","Muslims care more about the people of Flint, Michigan than Republicans do.The Republican-caused disaster unfolding in Michigan is incredibly infuriating. In a penny-pinching scheme, Governor Rick Snyder and his emergency management henchmen decided to switch Flint s water supply from Lake Huron to the nearby river, which has been undrinkable for decades due to high levels of lead and other industrial chemicals.For well over a year, the residents have been forced to drink and bathe in this water all while Republicans insist that the water is perfectly safe.So far, Republicans have done very little to fix their mess. Instead, they been busy trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility, which is why President Obama stepped in to do their job for them. And now, Muslims are coming to the rescue as well. Who is Hussain?  is an organization honoring the memory of Imam Hussain ibn Ali, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad who was killed by extremists by speaking out against violence. He died by being denied water over the course of several days. The organization believes that denying water to any human being is unacceptable and bringing water to those who need it is part of their campaign.And the organization has already collected 30,000 bottles of fresh drinking water for the Red Cross to distribute to the residents of Flint, even though Republicans and conservatives across the state and the nation have demonized Muslims repeatedly. Despite the hatred and racism hurled against them, they have chosen to help anyway. Prophet Mohammad taught us  Your neighbor comes before your own household.  As a resident of Detroit this is not only a Flint problem this is a Michigan problem and I feel obligated to help to the best of my ability,  said Mohammed Almawla, who helped collect water for Flint. We saw what needed to be done and we decided to do it,  said event organizer Dr. Aziza Asakari.  We reached out to schools, neighbors, friends, mosques, anyone and everyone to help us by donating a case of water, or money towards a case. This inspiring story is the very definition of American values. A group of people coming together for the purposes of helping a community in need. No one would blame these Muslims for turning their backs on their fellow citizens for the way they have been treated recently, but they chose to come to their aid despite the discrimination they have faced by the right-wing in recent months.Republicans should be ashamed of themselves. They poisoned the citizens of Flint, Michigan and have failed to take responsibility. Governor Rick Snyder should have resigned by now but he refuses to do so. Now Muslims are working to provide clean water to the residents in an act of humanity that proves once and for all that conservatives are full of shit whenever they talk about Muslims. Muslims are helping the American citizens that Republicans willingly chose to harm. It s pretty easy to recognize that it is Republicans, and not Muslims, who are the real threat to our safety and security.Featured Image: Washington Times ",0
8674, Meet The AWESOME Couple Who Is Going To Heckle The Bundy Militia Until They Leave,"For more than two weeks now, the nation has watched in frustration as a band of wannabe  patriots  who are nothing more than domestic terrorists have continuously disrupted the lives of the good people of Harney County, Oregon with their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. Well, it seems that these fools may have met their match.Kieran Suckling, who is the Executive Director of the Center for Biological Diversity, says that there is a couple who is challenging the armed idiots in their own way, and it is nothing short of glorious. According the the Center s Facebook: Each night, these two tent camp in the rain and snow. Each morning, they wake up, warm up, and go down the road to protest the Bundy militia s daily press conference. They won t leave until the militants do, they say. They are here, they say, because our laws and public land deserve the dignity and protection of people standing up peacefully yet forcefully against those who would steal them at gunpoint. I love these people. We offered them a warm room at our hotel, but they declined, saying that the land needed people who love it to be present at all times. What this unidentified couple is doing is nothing short of heroic. It is certainly more than the authorities are doing. These fools have been disrupting lives, terrorizing the locals, destroying property and committing any number of felonies unchecked for way too long as it is. Kudos to these REAL patriots for standing up to them.Suckling said that on Monday, there was to be a celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, and expressed his thoughts on what Dr. King would think of this occupation, and how he would react: Dr. King understood nature deeply, teaching us  It really boils down to this: that all life is interrelated. We are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied into a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one destiny, affects all indirectly. But we ll also peacefully confront the Bundy militia at the buildings and land they have taken from us all by armed force. We believe that is what Martin Luther King, Jr. would do. We must bear witness to this great injustice and show the militia thugs that America won t be scared away from its public lands by guns and threats. So right. It really is great that people are finally standing up to the these militants, with or without the help of law enforcement.That couple deserves a medal for what they are doing.Featured image via Raw Story",0
8675, WATCH: Rand Paul’s Horrendous New Anti-Ted Cruz Cartoon Titled ‘Audit The Ted’ (VIDEO),"You know how we can tell Rand Paul s campaign for president is out of money and out of hope?He produced a  cartoon  that attacks his former ally in the Senate, Ted Cruz, which features ugly, simplistic animation and voices performed by a cheap online vocal processor, Xtranormal style.The  cartoon  shows two stick figures, a man and a woman, standing in a the middle of nowhere discussing how Ted Cruz borrowed money from Goldman Sachs, while also accepting huge donations from the financial sector and special interests to pay for his campaign for U.S. Senate.The title of the video?  Audit the Ted.  Get it? The characters suggest we should engage in a process similar to the conspiracy theory meme about auditing the Federal Reserve.Here s a typical exchange:MALE STICK FIGURE:  Does the Goldman Sachs want to audit the Fed? FEMALE STICK FIGURE:  I don t think so. They are the Fed. Huh?The male stick figure goes on to pitch Rand Pand, saying in his inexplicably British-sounding robot voice,  He is for individual liberty, the free market and auditing the Fed. Yes, Rand Paul is for  individual liberty    except for a woman s individual liberty to have a safe and legal abortion, or to acquire inexpensive birth control through Obamacare, which Rand Paul wants to repeal.The female stick figure, whose stick figure lady parts aren t included in Rand Paul s definition of  individual liberty,  replies,  Yes, I like this Rand Paul. And his hair. Maybe he should audit the Ted as well. Now we know for sure it s a robot voice. No living human being would say they liked Rand Paul s ridiculous wig.The cartoon is part of an  Audit the Ted  website being launched by the Rand Paul campaign, targeting Ted Cruz s failure to vote on an audit-the-Fed bill proposed just before the president s final State of the Union address. The whole thing is a huge pander to the Alex Jones wing of the GOP.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdxyDPl9Wl0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8676, Guess What UK Political Leaders Really Think About Donald Trump – Hint: He isn’t ‘Ace’ (VIDEO),"The British Parliament conducted what can only be described as a  national celebrity roast  when they took up the petition signed by more than 500k Britons, requesting that their government ban Donald Trump from entering the country based on the fact he  foments racial, religious, and nationalistic intolerance, which should not be welcome in the UK. The 3-hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions, and due to the huge number of signatures, rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him. However, it did give Parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant Trump bashing, which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate.Watch one of the compilations of what the UK really thinks of Trump below:If ONLY the Republican Party felt that way Even some Tory Party members (which are like the British version of Republicans, except that they are not insane) have come out against his comments, although not as strongly as Labour and Scottish National Party members had done.Some took a more serious stance on the idea of Trump not being permitted in the UK, by implying that allowing his presence would embolden the nationalistic and Islamophobic groups that already exist in the nation.Watch more footage of further discussion below:Ultimately, Trump will not end up being denied entry to the UK because there will not be a vote held at the end of the debate which would be required to enact a legitimate ban. However, members of Parliament felt that the 500k+ British citizens who signed the petition, deserved both an answer to it, plus a strong statement by their government against the sort of hate that Trump peddles daily.featured image via fox news screen capture",0
8677," THANKS, OBAMA: Gas Prices Have Plummeted To 47 Cents A Gallon In Michigan","Michiganders in Flint may be literally dying thanks to the GOP s horrific cost-saving measures, but people in nearby  Houghton Lake got to enjoy the lowest gas prices in more than a  decade on Sunday. Prices at two businesses dropped below a half-dollar per gallon, while another nearby station was pumping out fuel for less than a dollar a gallon. There have been long lines at the stations for most of the weekend, according to the three stations, with police officers directing traffic in the area due to the congestion,  CNBC reports. Prices at a Marathon station hit 46 cents per gallon, while the Beacon & Bridge gas station was as low as 47 cents. The third station dropped its prices to 95 cents a gallon.These drops were the result of a price war between the three stations, but thanks to the President s hard work with the Iran deal, fuel prices are reaching record lows. The Huffington Post reports that oil prices dipped down past a 2003 low of $28 per barrel on Monday as Iran prepares to flood the market after the lifting of sanctions over the weekend:Worries about Iran s return to an already oversupplied oil market drove down Brent crude LCOc1 to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003. The benchmark was down 12 cents at $28.82 by 1537 GMT.U.S. crude CLc1 was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, not far from a 2003 low of $28.36 hit earlier in the session. Iran s return to the oil market has been on the agenda for some time and therefore does not really come as any great surprise,  Commerzbank senior analyst Carsten Fritsch said of the situation. Nonetheless, prices were bound to react negatively in the short term in view of the negative market sentiment. It is expected that Iran will increase oil on the market by an extra 500,000 barrels per day in the short term, but Tehran says it will add 1 million barrels per day to its current output by the end of the year.While some, particularly investors in the oil market, may cringe at this new reality in the oil market, average Americans will enjoy not having to mortgage their homes to drive to work. Normally, it would be uncouth to blame a President for high gas prices (or credit one with low prices) but Republicans have repeatedly reminded us that President Barack Hussein Soetoro Obama, socialist dictator, owns the Iran deal.Watch a report on these historic prices below:Featured image via ABC/Fox News",0
8678, How Wounded Warrior Project Treated A Triple-Amputee Marine And His Family Should Enrage Us All,"This just goes to show that you should always do your research before donating to a charity.Despite being a charity that supposedly provides support to wounded military veterans and their families, the Wounded Warrior Project(WWP) failed one family so badly that it should anger every American who claims to support our troops.Courtney Leigh Schumacher was preparing to deliver her second child when her husband was severely injured. Jon Schumacher lost both of his legs and required major medical care at Bethesda Medical Center in Maryland. The only problem was the family was stationed in California and Courtney needs to figure out how to fly across the country and make sure her husband, her baby, and herself had everything they needed for the long recovery ahead.So she reached out to the Wounded Warrior Project seeking travel assistance, baby items, and other needs to get through the hardship. Wounded Warrior Project denied her requests. In fact, the only thing they managed to send her was a box full of merchandise including hats and stickers instead of what she and her family actually needed. Needless to say, Courtney Schumacher was angry, so she posted her story on social media.Dear Wounded Warrior Project,Please stop sending us merchandise.We do not want the hats, stickers, magnets, clothing and backpacks you send us throughout the year. I don t understand how you have the funds for these items, yet you can t help the countless Veterans who need it. You can show us your programs and have a few Veterans testify for you, but it means nothing. I m not a person who read a negative article about you and is now deciding to speak out. I am a caregiver who approached you in my time of need and I was told no.I was 3 weeks away from delivering our second son when my husband was injured. I flew from California to Bethesda to be by his side. I asked for baby items and assistance with travel for our immediate family so I could recover. I was told no. These were two of my dozen of requests that were all denied. I asked then what can help us with and you said  whatever you need.  Merchandise was the only thing we have ever received from you.Luckily, Courtney and her family found support from a charity that actually went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure they had everything they needed.Fortunately for us, an organization did support us and fulfilled our needs. They gave us a swing and a pack n play for my husbands hospital room so I could continue his care. They flew our family out in time for the birth and flew out our oldest son, who was 4, across the country to spend Christmas with us. This organization was the Semper Fi Fund.As for Wounded Warrior Project, Courtney refused to waste any more time supporting the organization.I will be sending an email today to be removed from your mailing list. I hate to see anymore of your donor s funds wasted. Sincerly, the caregiver of a triple amputee. @wwp @semperfifund  # wwpgear   # woundedwarriorproject   # semperfifund Here s an image of the post via NewsFoxes:Now, there is no denying that Wounded Warrior Project has helped many veterans. But what happened to this family is totally unacceptable, especially when you read an account of what Courtney went through in Bethesda for months, which she wrote after her original post went viral.We were stationed in 29 palms, Ca and made under $1900 a month for a family of three. When my husband was injured, I was flown to Bethesda, MD. I decided to leave our four year old son in California with my parents. I was expecting a swift return to San Diego and I didn t want him to see his dad in that condition. I had a automatic payment set up for my parents back home so all his needs were met.There was no savings for our needs in Bethesda. I was never looking for a handout or a check from WWP. I just wanted help.I had nothing to lay my newborn baby in while in the hospital room. I slept on a chair and my husband had MRSA. I asked for a bassinet, I was told no. I asked for someone to take my debit card to Target and buy me one. I was told no. I didn t have a vehicle or a car seat. I was desperate. I flew to Bethesda in October and stayed through January. I didn t own any warm clothing. I walked to and from the hospital through snow in flip flops until my family bought me boots during their visit. I never asked for things for myself.We couldn t afford plane tickets across country during the holidays. I was due to deliver our second son on December 17th. I knew we needed family bedside to continue my husbands care while I delivered our son. We were told no. Luckily, Semper Fi Fund flew our family out for two weeks. It made our hospital room Christmas morning much more pleasant. I had a hard time getting my husband dressed everyday for therapy. He was still connected to wound vacs in his legs and tubes throughout his body. We asked if there was a way to get some snap athletic clothing, we were told no. Luckily  Sew much comfort  provided Jon with velcro clothing. There were more requests I made and I was told no. I asked what do you do and they said whatever you need.Indeed, despite that declaration by Wounded Warrior Project, Courtney still only received a two-letter word that made it clear that her family wasn t going to receive help from that particular organization, and she ripped them a new one for it.If you only provide specific services, then make that information available. If you outsource most of your Veterans to other non profits, yet sue them for stepping on your toes, then state that.If you cant help my family then state that instead of keeping us hooked with false hope. I see organizations like Homes for our Troops who can put a Veterans family in a mortgage free handicap accessible forever home with a tiny portion of what WWP makes a month and it upsets me. All I ask, if you know of a specific need of a Veteran that you want to see happen, then donate to that specific organization.Here s an image of the family Wounded Warrior Project refused to help.Wounded Warrior Project may have began as a worthy cause that helped a lot of people, but it has since become a questionable charity that is struggling to make the grade.According to Non-Profit Quarterly, WWP received a  D  rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy, C+ by Charity Watch, and  three out of four stars  from Charity Navigator. In short, it s a mixed score that doesn t exactly inspire confidence.In addition, Wounded Warrior Project brought in $342 million in 2014, and only 55 percent of that goes to actually helping veterans in need while the other 45 percent is used for administrative expenses, $473,015 of which is the salary paid to CEO Steven Narduzzi. One has to wonder how it feels to get rich off the backs of veterans.In contrast, the Semper Fi Fund that Courtney and her family received help from has a spectacular rating. It has a four star rating from Charity Navigator, an A+ rating from Charity Watch. And unlike WWP, only 6 percent of the funds donated to Semper Fi Fund are used for overhead.This really shows which charity organization has their priorities straight. So, perhaps it s time for all of us to do research before we donate to an organization, especially when that organization claims to support wounded veterans and their families. If we really believe our troops and their families deserve the best, shouldn t they also deserve the best charitable organizations as well?Featured Image: News Foxes",0
8679, Ted Cruz Repeated His Truly Horrible JFK Impression And Got The Quote Wrong. Again! (VIDEO),"For the second time in the last ten days, slimy and loathsome Ted Cruz totally botched another painful impression of the late President Kennedy.You might recall how Cruz first performed a painfully awkward rendition of the  Miracle Max  scene from the beloved film The Princess Bride, thus nearly ruining the film for all time. There s something wrong in the universe when someone as repugnant as Cruz likes such a fantastic movie to the point where he can recite entire passages in the voices of the characters. The voices were, of course, terrible and he got many of the lines wrong, which once again verified that most conservatives shouldn t bother trying to be funny. They re never funny, even when the source material is stellar.Then, earlier this month, Cruz entertained a small crowd of Iowa yokels with a flop-sweat inducing JFK impression, just after suggesting Kennedy would be driven out of the modern Democratic Party for being too conservative. Regarding the latter, no. First, Kennedy was arguably more liberal than most Democratic leaders of 2016. Second, there are moderate and conservative Democrats who continue to be welcome in the party, including presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.It s also worth noting that Cruz fumbled the quote. The line he attributed to JFK was actually said by Robert Kennedy years after JFK was assassinated. RFK s line, which was cribbed from George Bernard Shaw, by the way, went:  Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not?  And this is the line Cruz used for his John Kennedy impression.He did it again on Monday.Cruz s verbatim line: During the 1960s, I will point out that one of the most powerful, eloquent defenders of tax cuts was John F. Kennedy. As JFK said,  Some men see things as they are and ask, Why? I see things that never were and ask, why not?  These are the principles that work. Once again, it was RFK who popularized the line. Not JFK. And no one noticed.Cruz also said that JFK was a champion of tax cuts. This, believe it or not, is mostly true. Kennedy proposed fairly deep cuts to the marginal tax rates at a time when the top bracket was nearly three times higher than it is today.But that wouldn t have forced him out of today s Democratic Party. How do we know this? President Obama is responsible for the biggest middle class tax cut in American history. That s no exaggeration. The infamous  stimulus  bill, which almost entirely helped to keep the economy from sliding into a Depression, included $282 billion in tax cuts. As a point of comparison, President Bush s tax cuts amounted to roughly $174 billion. Obama s tax cut was also larger than Reagan s cuts.So, Mr. Cruz continues to lie to his people, assuming they re too ignorant to know the difference between JFK and RFK, or the difference between Obama and Kennedy on tax cuts.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Rurnz8HuBE&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8680, Scholastic Yanks Children’s Book For Its Portrayal Of Happy Slaves (IMAGE),"On Sunday, publishing company Scholastic announced that it would be removing A Birthday Cake for George Washington from shelves over criticism that the book portrayed happy slaves.In a press release, Scholastic explained that the book needed to include more context on the  evils of slavery  and that all returns would be honored. The statement read: While we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator and editor, we believe that, without more historical background on the evils of slavery than this book for younger children can provide, the book may give a false impression of the reality of the lives of slaves and therefore should be withdrawn. We do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator. The book, which was released on January 5th, happens to be about an enslaved man and his daughter faced with the task of baking President George Washington a birthday cake. Here s the cover:Scholastic s description of the story reads: Oh, how George Washington loves his cake! And, oh, how he depends on Hercules, his head chef, to make it for him. Hercules, a slave, takes great pride in baking the president s cake. But this year there is one problem   they are out of sugar. Scholastic s reaction is a complete turnaround from its previous defense of the book, which claimed the topic of slavery had been approached with the  utmost care.  Scholastic also previously claimed the book depicted the slaves being happy because they were living in  near-freedom  and simply enjoyed cooking. Scholastic even allowed the book s author, Ramin Ganeshram, to explain the intention behind the book on the publisher s blog last week as public outcry increased. Graneshram insisted that his story was based on historical research and was meant as a compliment to the slaves  resiliency and resourcefulness. Graneshram wrote: How could they smile? How could they be anything but unrelentingly miserable?  Ganeshram wrote.  How could they be proud to bake a cake for George Washington? The answers to those questions are complex because human nature is complex. Bizarrely and yes, disturbingly, there were some enslaved people who had a better quality of life than others and  close  relationships with those who enslaved them. But they were smart enough to use those  advantages  to improve their lives. Even before Scholastic made its decision to pull it, the book had over 100 one-star reviews on Amazon. At the time the announcement was made, only 12 of those reviews were positive.School Library Journal called the book  highly problematic,  advising people not to buy it. Kirkus Reviews, another trade publication, said the book was  an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery. Featured image via Twitter",0
8681, Spike Lee Celebrates MLK Day By Announcing Boycott Of ‘Lily White’ Oscars (IMAGE/VIDEO),"The film industry wants us to believe that it is liberal, that there is no racism. However, nothing could be further from the truth, and the fact that for the second year in a row all of the Oscar-nominated actors are white. Yes, you read that right. Even with iconic films such as Selma out there, the Academy didn t see fit to nominate any actors of color.Well, this obvious bias didn t go unnoticed by powerful and successful actors of color, most notably Spike Lee. To that end, on the annual celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr holiday, the celebrated actor took to Instagram to tell the world that he would not be attending this year s Oscars, and why. Using the hashtag #OscarssoWhite, Lee said, in part, after acknowledging and thanking Cheryl Boone Issacs, President of the Academy, for giving him an honorary Oscar this past November:But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!!

I Would Like To Thank President Cheryl Boone Isaacs And The Board Of Governors Of The Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences For Awarding Me an Honorary Oscar This Past November. I Am Most Appreciative. However My Wife, Mrs. Tonya Lewis Lee And I Will Not Be Attending The Oscar Ceremony This Coming February. We Cannot Support It And Mean No Disrespect To My Friends, Host Chris Rock and Producer Reggie Hudlin, President Isaacs And The Academy. But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!!

For Too Many Years When The Oscars Nominations Are Revealed, My Office Phone Rings Off The Hook With The Media Asking Me My Opinion About The Lack Of African-Americans And This Year Was No Different. For Once, (Maybe) I Would Like The Media To Ask All The White Nominees And Studio Heads How They Feel About Another All White Ballot. If Someone Has Addressed This And I Missed It Then I Stand Mistaken. As I See It, The Academy Awards Is Not Where The  Real  Battle Is. It s In The Executive Office Of The Hollywood Studios And TV And Cable Networks. This Is Where The Gate Keepers Decide What Gets Made And What Gets Jettisoned To  Turnaround  Or Scrap Heap.

As The Great Actor Leslie Odom Jr. Sings And Dances In The Game Changing Broadway Musical HAMILTON,  I WANNA BE IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS .

(Cont d)A photo posted by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Jan 18, 2016 at 5:03am PSTSpike Lee is right, and he isn t the only actor who is upset about these gross and racially motivated injustices when it comes to recognition for achievements. Lee is just the latest person of color who also happens to be a member of the Hollywood elite to criticize the all-white Oscar ballots. Jada Pinkett Smith has made similar comments. She said of the entire situation: The Academy has the right to acknowledge whomever they choose, to invite whomever they choose, and now I think that it s our responsibility to make the change. Maybe it is time that we pull back our resources and we put them back into our communities, into our programs, and we make programs for ourselves that acknowledge us in ways that we see fit, that are just as good as the so-called mainstream ones. Begging for acknowledgement or even asking for it diminishes dignity, diminishes power. And we are a dignified people and we are powerful, and let s not forget it. In addition, Pinkett Smith made her views on the matter known on Facebook via a powerful video, also uploaded just in time for MLK Day, just like Spike Lee s Instagram post:  // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;We must stand in our power!We must stand in our power.Posted by Jada Pinkett Smith on Monday, January 18, 2016 They are both right. We have to realize that we are the ones who are going to have to create change. It won t be White America, and it sure as hell won t be Hollywood. It will be Black Americans with voices, especially those in positions of power and influence, who will stand up and say what needs to be said, and do what needs to be done. If it takes boycotting what is arguably the biggest film industry event of the year, then so be it.Thank you, Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith for telling it like it is.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",0
8682," Desperate MI Governor Tries Claiming Flint Poisoning Was ‘Natural Disaster’, Obama Slaps Him Down","Michigan Governor Rick Snyder is still desperately clinging to his job, but there are signs that his fingers are slipping.For weeks, the country has been learning with growing horror the depths to which Snyder s administration sank to save a few bucks. A startling picture has finally come into focus: Rather than listen to scientists and residents, Michigan s state government decided to simply ignore all signs that the water system in the city of Flint was beginning to corrode away. As a result, dangerous chemicals including lead had begun pouring into the drinking water. The fix to prevent a mass poisoning of residents from their tap water would have cost barely anything, but they gambled it all   and Flint lost.As early as October 2014, there were problematic signs. A local General Motors engine plant stopped using water from the Flint river because parts were becoming rusted, but officials nevertheless continued to reassure residents the water was safe to drink   a decision deemed  unconscionable  by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this week.Tests also revealed elevated levels of chemical compounds in the water supply that can lead to liver or kidney issues. Nonetheless, officials downplayed residents  concerns, saying   confidently   that the water was safe to drink.How bad was the lead poisoning in Flint s water? Ten people have died from drinking it. Doctors now warn that every child in Flint under the age of six   over 8,000 of them   must now be treated for lead poisoning. The long-term effects to their health and mental development won t be known for some time.It s gotten so bad that President Obama was forced to declare a federal emergency in Flint. National Guard troops have begun pouring into the state to help get water to people who can t trust their faucets not to kill them. Celebrities such as Cher and Michael Moore have flown in tens of thousands of bottles of water.Through it all, Michigan s Republican governor has spent almost all of his energy trying to spin this epic disaster as not his fault. Absolutely nobody is buying it.In a bold move, Hillary Clinton even used her time during the Democratic debate to put a spotlight on Flint and the failures of Snyder s administration. I spent a lot of time last week being outraged by what s happening in Flint, Michigan, and I think every single American should be outraged. We ve had a city in the United States of America where the population which is poor in many ways and majority African American has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn t really care. Snyder responded to this forceful condemnation of his pathetic actions by giving a more pathetic response.Political statements and finger pointing from political candidates only distract from solving the Flint water crisis.  Governor Rick Snyder (@onetoughnerd) January 18, 2016How convenient that the man that every finger is pointing to now believes finger pointing isn t important.Another person not buying Snyder s buck passing? President Obama. Snyder recently demanded the federal government give him $96 million in  natural disaster  aid money to help him pay for the fall out of his negligence. Obama, who has already pooled resources to help Flint residents out, said  No way. Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator W. Craig Fugate, in a letter to Snyder, said his request for a major disaster declaration was denied because the water contamination  does not meet the legal definition of a  major disaster  under federal law. The incident was not the result of a natural catastrophe, nor was it created by a fire, flood or explosion,  Fugate said.This wasn t a hurricane or a tornado or a wildfire, this was a Republican Party that was so interested in turning a profit that they gambled with the lives of their constituents. Calling this a natural disaster would be one of the biggest political lies ever told.It should also be noted that while Snyder would like nearly 100 million dollars from the federal government   hypocritical coming from a small government conservative, no?   his state just posted a $575 million surplus. Flint s lawmakers have asked that some of that money be used to help out the city. So far Snyder hasn t offered it. As we ve seen time and again, a Republican governor wants nothing to do with the government until he needs its help to clean up one of his screw ups. President Obama and federal agencies routinely serve as punching bags for Republican politicians who pretend that government equals tyranny. Now, with a man-made disaster unfolding on his hands, Snyder is mad that this very same  tyrannical  government won t do more to help save him from himself.If Snyder wants help he should take responsibility and confess that it was his actions that brought on this water crisis. He can clarify that this wasn t a  natural disaster  in his resignation letter.Featured image via Michigan Municipal League/Flickr",0
8683, Amy Schumer Rightfully Blasts Young Critic Who Snagged Photo Just To Bash Her (TWEET),"If there s one person that you don t want to mess with, it s Amy Schumer. She s a badass who will call you the f**k out no matter who you are. So, when one young critic decided he would bash the comedian in a tweet, needless to say, Schumer had the last word. In fact, the original tweet looks to have been deleted.However, the internet being what it is, the evidence remains.The young film critic took a photo with Schumer on the red carpet of the Critics Choice Awards. However, instead of just being proud of that moment, because getting a photo with Schumer is an honor in and of itself, he decides to try to be funny on Twitter and tweets out: Spent the night with Amy Schumer. Certainly not the first guy to write that. Seeing this, and obviously not amused, Schumer tweeted back: I get it. Cause I m a whore? Glad I took a photo with you. Hi to your dad. When misogyny starts young  pic.twitter.com/1pTNVdXILv  Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) January 18, 2016The young critic has since apologized because of the backlash that was thrown at him from all directions I truly apologize for the tweet I posted earlier. I'm not a comedian and it wasn't funny. @amyschumer  LightsCameraJackson (@LCJReviews) January 18, 2016  but the greater point still remains that this young man thought he was being funny by bashing a woman. This sort of humor is never thrown at men, and it is blatantly misogynistic. And to expand of Schumer s remark of  Hi to your dad,  she is likely implying  nice job raising a new generation of jerks. This sort of humor from, mainly men, who think they re being funny going after women isn t anything new. It s an age-old story that harkens back to the Bible when Eve was blamed for being tempted. Men have always gotten a free pass when it comes to sexual promiscuity, and women are always shunned or made fun of for daring to show they are human beings too. So while, sure, this kid apologized for his stupid joke, because he was likely forced to by to the power of social media, he still thought it was okay to say in the first place.Let s stop shaming women. Let s stop teaching young men that it s okay to shame women. Then this sort of thing will never happen in the first place, and there will be no need to apologize.Featured image: Twitter",0
8684, Republican Greg Abbott Picks Supporting Israel Over Obama – Plans With Bibi To Antagonize Iran,"Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu. While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas  leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation. Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran. He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran. The second part of that is particularly hypocritical. Republicans have always used terms like  free trade  and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals. However, when  free trade  conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu   a leader of a foreign nation   there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures. Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination. Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level  sanctions,  but the politics on this are clear. Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran. Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr",0
8685, Trump Messes Up BIG TIME At Liberty University When He Majorly Flubs Bible Verse (VIDEO),"If there s one quality Republican voters are looking for in a candidate, it s being a Christian. You don t have to know much about foreign policy, or domestic issues, or for that matter, the Constitution, but if you say you re a Christian, well, that s your golden ticket into the hearts of GOP voters everywhere. Knowing this fact, for the past several months Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a Christian, how much he loves the Bible, and even that it s his  favorite book. Unfortunately for Trump, his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great Christian who follows the Bible is all crumbling down. This was incredibly evident at a campaign event at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday morning.In front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their Bible verses, Trump says: We re going to protect Christianity. I can say that. I don t have to be politically correct Two Corinthians, 3:17, that s the whole ballgame. He then goes on to call Liberty University  Liberty College  and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say. Because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the Bible Trump is referring to is Second Corinthians, not  Two Corinthians.  However, if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd, but don t really know what you re talking about, it s going to read  Two Corinthians. The verse he s referring to is  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,  which does indeed sound like the perfect Republican slogan to try to pander to  freedom  loving  Christians  everywhere. However, too bad Trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about.And as fellow candidate Marco Rubio s faith outreach director said, so honestly:""Two"" Corinthians    It won't matter. Nothing seems to matter.

8686, Tea Party Official Banned From Schools After A Statement That Will Make Your Skin Crawl,"Liberals have been questioning the intelligence of Tea Partiers since the movement arrived on the national political scene complete with misspelled signs and idiotic conspiracy theories. Their leaders include such great minds as Michele Bachman and Ted Cruz, two people with impressive educational backgrounds who can t seem to stop saying incredibly dimwitted things.That mentality trickles down to the state and municipal level as well, as members of the crowds of tea bag wearing  patriots  decided to go home to seek public office and crusade for a return to 1789. Never has that been more obvious than in the case of Hampstead, NH Advisory Budget Committee Chairman, Jorge Mesa-Tejada.The school board in Hampstead was seeking approval for upgrades to the local elementary school, using the security of the students as one of their reasons. Looking to eliminate the use of remote classrooms outside of the main building, the board cited that the traveling back and forth of students may provide an opportunity for a sniper to shoot children.While that may seem a little bit extreme, it is nothing compared to the chairman s argument against the upgrades. In an open committee hearing broadcast on local cable access television, Mesa-Tejada outlined exactly how he would use his military training to wipe out children, killing them at recess from the woods behind them.  I would have a field day,  he said.Reaction from the school board was swift. Mesa-Tejada has had a no trespassing order issued against him, banning him from being anywhere near school property. Not only did he outline what could only be the delusions of a very sick mind, he also gave other lunatics the perfect plan of attack to pull off the next Newtown.The chairman has since apologized, but it s too little too late for the school board and the residents of Hampstead.  When I saw the recording, I had two first reactions,  said Caitlin Parnell, a mother of two children at the school.  One was disbelief that an elected official would be talking this way, and my second reaction was to feel sick to my stomach. You can watch Mesa-Tejada s despicable comments below:Featured image via Twitter",0
8687," Creationist Ken Ham Is Building A $101M Noah’s Ark In Kentucky, And He Wants You To Pay For It (VIDEO/TWEETS)","Australian-born Creationist Ken Ham and his fundamentalist Christian organization Answers in Genesis (AiG) are looking to build a $101m Ark Adventure in Kentucky, with the centerpiece of a reconstructed Ark. The problem is, they want you the taxpayer to pay for it.Ham, AiG and their so-called Young Earth Creationist movement believe in the literal interpretation of the Bible when it comes to the age and creation of the Earth and all life that ever inhabited it. They believe the Earth and all life was created in 6 days, by an omnipotent God, just 6,000 years ago. They believe dinosaurs and man inhabited the planet at the same time, because everything that is was created in those same 6 days. So yes, there will be a pair of dinosaurs on the ark.According to Newsweek, AiG purchased a 99-acre plot of land just outside Williamstown, Kentucky got the city for just a dollar five years ago. But since then, the project has hit one hurdle after another. Many of Ham s own making.The principal issue at stake now, is that Ham and AiG want the taxpayer to pick up the bill for around a quarter of the construction costs of the project in the form of tax rebates. The group sought to exploit subsidies provided by the state to boost tourism through the Tourism Development Incentive program. Projects of $1 million and upwards can recover 25% of project development costs by recouping their sales taxes.After much debate on their initial application, Kentucky approved the site for the scheme so long as AiG agreed to non-discriminatory hiring practices. This means, they could only recover the cash if they recruited people of all faiths and none. They could not specifically hire Creationists.A few bumps down the road later, and Ham and AiG had to significantly strip back their pans for the park. They were unable to gather together the funds and investment to create the full theme park. Due to the substantial changes to the plans, they had to resubmit their application to Kentucky for the tax rebate. This time is was denied. Why? Because apparently, honesty and integrity mean nothing to this group of creationists.Despite their reluctant agreements to get their hands on state cash, AiG had released a decidedly discriminatory recruitment policy for the Ark Adventure. The website demanded a salvation testimony  and a creationist statement of faith from all prospective job applicants   clearly ruling out non-believers.So now, Ken Ham and AiG are suing Kentucky for the money   claiming religious discrimination. Greg Lipper, senior litigation counsel for Americans United for Separation of Church and State points out the muddled-thinking that AiG is applying in this case. AiG is confusing what they have the right to do as a private organization with what taxpayers are required to fund, They re saying Kentucky taxpayers should pay for them to expand a religious ministry. That kind of argument would make Thomas Jefferson turn in his grave. No one is telling Ham as a private citizen, who or how he can hire. It is only as a recipient of state funds, which he is free to enter or not, that he is required to follow the stipulations that would be applied to any organization or individual doing the same. Just like chances of his theory of genesis being true, Ham s chances of getting his lawsuit through are slim to none.And his Ark hasn t escaped the attention of social media users either I just realised that America's immigration policy doesn't weed out Australian Ark Building Lunatics. #kenham  Gotapulse (@gotapulse) January 3, 2016If #KenHam could get a 500 yr old dude & his kids to build the Ark themselves w/o modern technology I would give the park more credit.  Uncle John (@azmoderate) January 18, 2016If Ken Ham wants to replicate the trials and tribulations of biblical Noah, then he should probably cease seeking to exploit tax loopholes to make up for his lack of fundraising skills. Religious freedom requires that if a man wants to spend $101 million of his own money to build a giant ark in Kentucky   he is free to do so. However, he has no right under religious freedom to expect you and I to pay for him to do so.Featured Image via YouTube Screengrab",0
8688, Ann Coulter Slips Up During Interview And Gives Us The Greatest Reason Ever NOT To Vote Trump (AUDIO),"Ann Coulter will be wishing she had the chance for a second take after a bizarre interview, during which she accidentally gave Americans the greatest ever reason not to elect Donald Trump: it will be the end of her career, and the Republican Party.Coulter became near-hysterical during an interview with the The Eric Metaxas Show last week. According to her, Trump is basically the second coming of Christ. He is an emissary, sent by God, to save the United States of America (and humanity) from destruction. And no, this is not satire, or an embellishment.First, she compared herself to Jesus. Asked about her reputation for being rather a  divisive  figure on the right of US politics, Coulter replied: Yeah, I m  divisive  because I say things I believe, generally. So does Jesus. But her delusions of grandure also extend to her favorite candidate, Donald Trump. We are talking about the future of not only of America but of the last genuinely Christian country on earth and thus the world. If we lose America, it is lights out for the entire world for a thousand years.It is like the fall of Rome but, thank God, and I am not using the Lord s name in vain, I mean that absolutely literally, thank God for raising up Donald Trump and giving us a chance to save the country.Unless Donald Trump is elected, we re never going to have another Republican president. So firstly, in the gospel according to Ann Coulter, it is prophesied that the failure of Donald Trump to win the GOP primaries would mean no Republican in the White House ever again. As good a reason as any for kicking the trust fund tycoon out of the race. But every cake needs a cherry on top, and this came in the form of Coulter s reaction when asked what she would do if Trump loses.She vows she would  stop wasting my time with politics.  That s right America, political commentary would be Coulter-less, permanently. Ann sees no point continuing her quest without the bright star of Trump to follow. What is the point of talking about abortion or anything else unless you get Donald Trump in to build the wall, deport illegals, end this  anchor baby  nonsense, stop importing 100,000 Muslims a year, in addition to two million Third Worlders per year, It s probably time to spread the word far and wide. After all, opportunities to kill three birds with one stone don t come along very often. America without Trump, Ann Coulter, or a Republican in the White House. Now, that really would be great.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons/Flick Creative Commons",0
8689," Oregon Militant Flips Over His Vehicle, Breaks More Laws – Guess What The Cops Do (IMAGE)","A man affiliated with the illegal occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in the Oregon standoff with police was out and about driving around town in his white 2003 Ford van, when he ended up crashing his vehicle into a barb-wire fence, completely flipping the car over in the process.We re not sure if he was out looking for snacks, but The Oregon State Police posted a picture of the crash on their Twitter page on Sunday. Now, get this   not only was he being an unsafe driver on icy roads (propelling the car more than 150 ft. away from the road), but he was also driving without a license! Fortunately, he wasn t injured (we wouldn t wish that on anyone) but safety issues aside, all the police did was cite him for operating a motor vehicle without a license. That s it. He wasn t arrested, as many would presume.State Police Spokesman Bill Fugate wouldn t provide more details about the incident, other than to say: Oregon only cites for No Operator s License, we do not arrest. Pic via Twitter.It looks like the police aren t too concerned with Mr. Burke s activities of occupying federal property. Perhaps one reason is that he wasn t driving a federal van from the property; it appears to be his own.Just a few days ago, another militant by the name of Kenneth Medenback left the compound for a  snack run.  State police decided to arrest him for theft of two government vehicles, not the occupation itself. And, that was the very first arrest of the occupation so far. At this rate it s going to take forever to arrest all these guys. So, while law enforcement doesn t appear to be taking an active stance of ending the illegal protest itself, they are still somewhat concerned with upholding some of the laws on the books. That s some good news, at least.Featured image via Twitter.",0
8690, Bernie Sanders Reveals His Full Health Care Funding Plan: The 1% Are Going To Hate It,"Just hours before the final Democratic primary debate, Bernie Sanders has finally released his full healthcare plan.On his campaign site, Sanders lays out how important the Affordable Care Act has been. He notes that he, himself, helped contribute to the huge piece of legislation that helped to provide 17 million people with health insurance.But Sanders believes that it is time to move forward with a national healthcare system that provides coverage to all. He writes on his site: All Americans can benefit from increased protections against lifetime coverage limits and exclusion from coverage because of pre-existing conditions, Sanders says. But as we move forward, we must build upon the success of the ACA to achieve the goal of universal health care. Twenty-nine million Americans today still do not have health insurance and millions more are underinsured and cannot afford the high copayments and deductibles charged by private health insurance companies that put profits before people. There has been some controversy between Democrats this week relating to the issue of Sanders  proposal to implement a universal healthcare system in the United States. Concerns over how this program would be funded have been of particular interest to the public. Sanders lays that out in plain detail for all to read.Most of the health care plan receives its funding from new progressive taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Some people in the middle class might pay a tiny bit more in taxes. According to the campaign website,  A family of four making $50,000 a year taking the standard deduction would only pay $466 this year.  That small increase in taxes isn t anything to what a similar family would save under Sanders  plan. They would save around $5,000 dollars a year. Last year, the average working family paid $4,955 in premiums and $1,318 in deductibles to private health insurance companies. Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year,  the site reads.It long past time that the United States join every other industrialized nation in the world and implement a national single-payer healthcare system. That s what the ACA was presented as a stepping stone towards. Regardless of who is the eventual Democratic nominee, the fight for healthcare as a right need to be at the top of the Democratic platform. Democrats should not have to apologize for wanting to live in a nation where every person can get the healthcare they need.Should a better proposal than Sanders  be presented, it should be adopted. There may be some strategic advantages to wanted to expand the ACA very gradually, but we are talking about people s lives. But there are some big cracks in the ACA. Cracks that 29 million people have fallen through.

8691," Bundy Militant Loses Foster Kids, Blames It On The Tyrannical Government","One of the Bundy  militiamen  has lost his sole source of income thanks to his decision to join the merry mob of marauding morons in their armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. Was he skipping work? Nah   he would have to have a job for that. Robert  LaVoy  Finicum tells Oregon Public Broadcasting that he lost his meal ticket   children.Over the past decade, Finicum and his wife s home has served as nothing more than a revolving door for foster children, with more than 50 kids coming through their home. The children, who often came from mental hospitals, drug rehabs, and group homes for emotionally distressed youth not only provided the happy couple with a steady income thanks to money they received from the state, but also with workers on his ranch (which barely makes enough money to stay afloat). My ranch has been a great tool for these boys,  Finicum said.  It has done a lot of good.  Unfortunately, when Finicum ran off to play terrorist with his friends and he left four young, emotionally disturbed boys home alone to be cared for by his wife, let s just say some flags were raised. Within four days of Finicum s departure, the Arizona Department of Social Services began to remove his meal tickets from the home. They didn t go out at the same time,  Finicum said.  One was there for a year, one of the boys was there six months, another eight months, and a month. I don t know where they ended up.  Rather than blame his involvement with a terrorist group or his own irresponsibility, Finicum says the removals resulted from  pressure from the feds : They were ripped from my wife. We are very successful (foster parents). Our track records are good, it s been a good relationship. (Federal authorities) must have gotten to the governor, who told the state to get them out of there. OPB reports that this is a staggering loss of income from the Finicums, who have depended on the between $22.31 to $37.49 per day they were paid to take care of the children. According to a 2010 tax filing, the Finicums received $115,343 in 2009. At the maximum rate, this means they  cared for  an average of 8 children per day that year. And it s exactly those dollar signs that concern Finicum, not the children he was tasked with caring for as his own: That was my main source of income. My ranch, well, the cows just cover the costs of the ranch. If this means rice and beans for the next few years, so be it. We re going to stay the course. Another of the Bundy militants, Blaine Cooper, also claims that Child Protective Services removed his children from his home. At the Facebook page All Your Base, Cooper claimed that the removal of his children, which can not be independently verified, was an attempt by the FBI to  draw him out,  blaming the removals on  bias media and asshole s like  the page owner. I hope people are seeing the sacrifices we re making here,  Finicum said.  I want to show what my government is doing. You need to understand the cost being paid by many people. Finicum has pledged to die in defense of the militants  armed encampment  proving that he is someone who should not be entrusted with the care of children. Watch him threaten violence against the government below:Featured image via NBC News",0
8692, GOP Debate Moderator: Facts Are TOTALLY IRRELEVANT During Republican Debates (VIDEO),"It s about time someone came out and said it directly. One of the moderators from the recent CNN debate, right-wing talk radio host Hugh Hewitt, finally blurted it out during a segment on CNN: Republicans don t care about facts or accuracy.The rest of us have been aware of this problem for quite some time now, but it s nice to hear it articulated by one of the most prominent Republican talkers from the conservative entertainment complex. GOP voters, he said, aren t concerned with fact-checking the candidates. All they care about is who managed to fire off the best zingers.While chatting about the Fox Business debate and fireworks between candidates Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Hewitt said:HEWITT: Using my boxing analogy, in the 15th round, Marco Rubio laid one on Ted Cruz. But here s the deal about fact checkers. Nick Kristof, a terrific columnist for  The New York Times,  tweeted out that Donald Trump said, in fact, in his hearing that he wanted a 45 percent tariff. Fact checking doesn t matter in these things. What matters is personality, an aura and your command presence. And of all those two, the best command presence last night was Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. And I keep marveling at how Donald Trump can dominate a television screen. He reaches through the screen sometimes, and you know, you re back on  Celebrity Apprentice.  It s an amazing skill set.So, basically, the Republicans can say anything they want with impunity   just as long as they say it with a commanding presence. Got it. Well, this explains a lot. By the way, it s not entirely unique to the 2016 race, either. Mitt Romney used this fact-free strategy against President Obama in 2012. You might recall how Romney more or less trampled Obama during the first debate. But it was only   and I mean only   because Romney blurted out any old nonsense that popped into his head, and he said it with authority, leaving Obama somewhat confounded as to the best way to counterattack Romney s fabricated gibberish.Knowing all this, and now that the cat is out of the bag, the next GOP debate should be especially chaotic.Watch the video below:Via Crooks & Liars:Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8693, The GOP Is Sharing Conference Space With PERFECT Metaphor For Republican Party (VIDEO),"There are seldom those moments in life that seem so poetic, but the people sharing the space where the Republican congressional retreat is being held is pretty much the perfect metaphor for the embodiment of the GOP party platform.It s all happening at the Marriott Hotel at the Baltimore Harbor, and right down the hall from where Republicans are trying to put together strategies for the coming year   that is where the Mid-Atlantic Monument Builders  Association is holding their annual summit. And within the room where the Monument Builders are meeting, there is a huge sampling of headstones.How is this the perfect metaphor for the Republican party? So glad you asked.The GOP has spent nearly the past thirty years trying to make sure people have a rougher go at life than they could if they had a government that actually worked in their best interest. Instead of fighting for people to have greater access to health care, they ve been mercilessly fighting against broadened access and affordable coverage. They ve also been trying for decades to privatize social security instead of strengthen our existing government pension program that guarantees income for senior citizens who worked hard all their lives. They d prefer a system that relied on an unsteady market where people could, quite literally, lose everything. The GOP has also consistently tried to make it harder for low-income citizens to have access to Medicaid and food assistance programs. Not to mention the GOP s love for war and lust for sending American lives to die for causes still unknown.So, to see gravestones just steps away from where congressional Republicans are talking about ideas is absolutely perfect. Their ideas and plans for the people of this nation would lead to the early demise of several citizens. Kudos to whoever chose that space to hold the event, it s very telling of GOP policy.

8694, Ted Cruz Birth Certificate Spawns Questions About Illegitimate Birth,"On January 17, Dallas News published a copy of Ted Cruz s birth certificate. The fact that the Republican presidential hopeful was born in Canada is really no big surprise to anyone who has been following the Trump/Cruz birther frenzy.While Cruz s Canadian birth is not a surprise, the fact that his mother is identified as Eleanor Wilson on the candidate s birth certificate, rather than Eleanor Cruz, is.According to Dallas News, Wilson was the name of Cruz s mother s first husband. The couple had been divorced for about seven years at the time Cruz was born.It gets even more interesting when you learn that the former Ms. Wilson gave birth to another child, Michael, approximately three years after her divorce and three before she supposedly married Ted s father, right-wing pastor Rafael Cruz.The baby s name was Michael Wilson. He later died from crib death.In his book, A Time for Truth: Reigniting the Promise of America, Cruz claimed his mother s divorce from Wilson took place in 1965, two years later than the actual date. He also claimed that Michael was born the same year, in 1965, and that the child s death was what ultimately led to the divorce.Unfortunately for Ted, Dallas News verified that the divorce took place in 1963 and that Michael Wilson was born and died in 1966.Dallas News contacted Eleanor Cruz s former husband, Alan Wilson, who was born in Forth Worth Texas,  but has lived in London, England since the 1960 s.During the interview, Wilson said he was not Michael Cruz s father, and he only learned that his ex-wife had given birth by chance. We were divorced and she was living on her own,  said Wilson. He said that Eleanor asked him if she could use his last name on the birth certificate. When Michael Wilson later died, he said,  I hadn t even met the baby. Alan Wilson said by chance he and Eleanor Wilson were being treated in the same hospital when she was pregnant when a nurse told his  his wife  was there   startling the Fort Worthian.  I didn t know she was pregnant. We were definitely divorced. It s interesting that while Rafael and Eleanor Cruz are reported to have married in Texas in 1969, the year before Cruz was born, the state s online public records site does not show a record of the couple s marriage. The exact date of Cruz s parents marriage remain a mystery.The couple divorced in 1997.As the drama over whether Ted Cruz is eligible to run for president began to unfold this month, numerous documents have been published, including Eleanor Cruz s (maiden name Darragh) birth certificate, showing that she was born in the U.S. state of Delaware.In addition to his mother s birth certificate, Talking Points Memo and Breitbart (among other media outlets) also published Ms. Cruz s Canadian voting records. Those records tell us two things. First they tell us that Ms. Cruz was registered to vote in Canada in 1974, a right the country reserves only for legal citizens. Second, the record tell us that the candidate s mother used the name of her second husband, Rafael Cruz on her Canadian voting record.So leaves us to wonder why she used the name of her first husband on Ted Cruz s birth certificate, if indeed she was married to Rafael Cruz at the time Ted was born.None of this would be considered fair game if the candidate wasn t running for the position of God s appointed King of America. It wouldn t be fair game if Ted and Rafael Cruz had not made ridiculous and insulting statements about single mothers and unwed mothers. It would not be fair game if Ted Cruz had not appointed himself as a spiritual dictator to the masses.Most importantly, though, the birther movement that viciously attacked President Obama throughout his first term as president used the word  illegitimate,  as a matter of routine, when referring to the leader of our country.Ted Cruz spent a lot of time catering to the right-wing extremists who viciously attacked the leader our country.Apparently he never expected any of that to catch up to him.But now a lot of people are not only asking if Cruz is able to be a legitimate president, they re asking if Cruz is even the legitimate son of the religiously insane Rafael Cruz.Maybe Ted should have read that Bible he likes to wave around in front of the crowd. After all, it does warn that eventually  you will reap what you sow. Featured image credit: Gage Skidmore, via Flckr cc 2.0",0
8695, Here Are Photos Of Detroit’s Public Schools That Michigan’s Governor Does Not Want You To See (IMAGES/VIDEO),"While much of the nation s attention has been focused on the horrors of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, there has been a revolt growing in the state of Michigan. Darnell Earley, is not only the unelected emergency manager who created the Flint water crisis, he also is in charge of Detroit s public schools. Earley has done to Detroit s schools, what he did to Flint s water system.The conditions of Detroit s school system are so bad, that teachers are on the verge of going on strike. They have been increasing their resistance to the attack and mismanagement of Detroit s schools over the past week. They have been engaging in a tactic called the  sick-out.  That s a protest where so many teachers call in sick, the school is forced to close.A picture is worth a thousand words. Here are some photos that show the deplorable conditions that students and teachers are being subjected to.Does your school look like this? #supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/jBGbkqoM4z  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016#supportDPSteachers pic.twitter.com/JJPDlBRPfG  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 15, 2016Mushrooms in a classroom. #SupportDPSTeachers pic.twitter.com/97FZ53fxxe  Detroitteach (@teachDetroit) January 12, 2016No empowered school board.

It shows what life is like for teachers and students in Detroit.Detroit s mayor, Mike Duggan recently went on a tour of DPS schools. He was  heartbroken  over what he saw. I saw 4-year-olds in a classroom where it was about 50 degrees,  he said.  They told me they usually wear their coats until lunchtime, when they warm up a bit   because there s a part of each day they actually expect to have to wear their coats in the classroom. It s nice to hear that Duggan still has enough of a heart left to be broken. The tour was nothing more than a publicity stunt created to make it look like the state is trying to do something to fix the problem. Now that the nation is watching the state of Michigan and the Snyder administration s corruption and incompetence that has infected the entire state on every level, they really, really need to convince people that they care.Even with the Flint water crisis, the Detroit water crisis, the shame that is the DPS, Snyder cannot even bring himself to criticize emergency manager Earley. Here is what Snyder had to say about Earley and the teacher protesters last week: He s been doing a good job. He s been working hard. If you think about it, our goal is to get the Detroit Public Schools to be successful. I ve proposed a package that involves an investment of over $700 million to improve education in Detroit. I m not sure why people would want to go out and protest against a solution like that. The state of Michigan has been in control of Detroit Public School system for almost seven f##king years. The cries of anyone who have spoken out against the Snyder administration have been meet with silence. Snyder s $700 million dollar proposal should, at this point, be seen as nothing more than a last-minute attempt to try to bribe his way out of being lynched by a growing mob.Snyder and all his cronies must be brought to justice for their crimes against humanity.Featured Image Courtesy: Detroitteach via Twitter",0
8696," Carlos Santana Praises President Obama, Says Trump Is Something He Saw At A Zoo Once","In an open letter to President Obama, legendary guitarist Carlos Santana praised the State of the Union Address and Obama s leadership before taking a significant shot at Donald Trump.Santana posted the letter on Facebook, but it has since been removed, perhaps due to so much hateful criticism from conservative fans of the music icon.He begins by telling President Obama how inspired he was by his speech the night before and thanked him being a true leader who strives to heal and unite the world. Santana then turned his thoughts to Donald Trump by telling the story of how the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe reminds him of a poop-throwing ape he once saw at the San Diego Zoo when he was a child. Santana concluded by urging leaders to strive for peace instead of what Trump and other Republicans stand for.Here is the full letter via Clutch Magazine.Dearest Mr. President Obama,I witnessed your speech last night. I am deeply inspired, encouraged and profoundly grateful for your words. Your consciousness soars with clarity and divine purpose. Your articulated your views, subjects and comments with compassion. You made me feel how blessed we are to share life with your leadership. Even more than any other President I have witnessed (including JFK). Your words of spirit and global healing, unity and harmony for the betterment of the world .not just the USA. I pray for your continued safety for you and your family. Regarding Mr. Trump .I remember when I was a child living in Tijuana I often crossed the border to visit the San Diego Zoo. I would hear loud screams and commotion in the distance. As I came closer to the sound, I noticed everyone was staring at an ape in a glass cage. The ape was staring back at the crowd that gathered. With an angry look of disgust, the ape defecated in his hand and threw it at the crowd. This is what I hear when Mr Trump speaks. He lacks consciousness as well as integrity. The Republicans and Mr Trump are selling hate and fear. That is the opposite of what our Country stands for. Let s go forward with light and love into the future. Global Peace is within our grasp in this lifetime. Pull humanity up, take the high road and look at the aerial view. Peace on Earth now, not later.With deep respect and admiration, Carlos SantanaThis is an epic letter by Santana, who hails from Mexico and is a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He must have been truly moved by what President Obama had to say and it must have felt especially good to smack down Donald Trump after listening to him offend the Mexican people over and over again since he announced his campaign for the presidency.If the Hispanic community shares Santana s feelings about Trump, the GOP could be in for a world of hurt on Election Day.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
8697, Watch Donald Trump Fail So Hard At Trying To Pander To Right-Wing Christians (VIDEO),"During an interview on CNN s State of the Union on Sunday, Donald Trump was questioned by host, Jake Tapper, on his religious beliefs and support among the socially conservative, right-wing Christians.Things have been getting heated between Republican primary frontrunner Donald Trump, and the runner-up Ted Cruz, to say the least. Cruz has been surging in the polls as Trump maintains his lead. While Trump s lead appears to be unshakable, his support is also static. So the two have been at each other s throats trying to win over voters. In order to win over those voters, they have to convince people that they are the true spokesman for god and the Christian religion.In that arena, Cruz has a major advantage over Trump.  During the Family Leadership Summit, last July, Trump made the mistake of saying something somewhat reasonable to a crowd of hardcore social conservatives. He was asked if he had asked God for forgiveness. Trump responded, saying: I m not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don t think so. I think if I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don t bring God into that picture. I don t. He tried to explain away the gaffe, but it was too late. For those not in the know, asking god, and or Jesus, for forgiveness for their sins is the first and most important thing you can do as a Christian. For many, Trump might as well have said that he is not actually a Christian.This was brought up early in the interview. Trump was asked the question again, to which he replied that he has  a good relationship with God.  Tapper then goes on to question Trump about his behavior that has been seen in tabloids for the past two decades. Trump says that, he has been living a  good life  now for the past few years, so that shouldn t matter.Let s compare that to Cruz, who has a  strap-on  set of God s armor. Whether is trying to take away the rights of LGBT people, or claiming that atheists should not be able to hold public office, Cruz embodies all the terrible qualities that are revered by right-wing Christians.Based on the sentiments expressed in the interview, I don t think Trump has any idea how these people work. Trump can stir up and exploit hatred towards minorities without it coming back to hurt him, but pandering and exploiting the Christian right takes both skill and experience. Two things Trump has neither of.If the Republican primary race was a 90 s boy band, Trump would be the bad boy of the group. Many conservatives might be attracted to him, but Cruz is the one they are going to invite over for Sunday dinner. They might even let him say grace.You can watch the interview, below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
8698," What Cher Just Did For The Residents Of Flint, Michigan Is Absolutely Incredible","What s happening in Flint, Michigan is beyond heartbreaking. Residents cannot drink their water due to lead contamination, but to add insult to injury, the water was originally declared safe. Then, as children began getting sick and the water was exposed as being toxic, government officials, including a slow to react Gov. Rick Snyder (R) finally thought they should do something about the toxic levels. To be blunt, what s happening there is criminal, and someone needs to be held responsible. President Obama has even declared a state of emergency.Stepping up big time to help the residents of Flint is none other than the legendary artist Cher. She has been very outspoken in her feelings about what s been happening. Now, she s not only voicing her opinion, but putting action to her words, she s bringing fresh water to the people there who so desperately need it.Partnering with natural spring water company Icelandic Glacial, Cher is donating 181,440 bottles of water to Flint. According to the press release: After reading about the catastrophic situation in Flint, a city of 100,000 people who have not had clean water in over a year, Cher contacted her friend Brad Horwitz, an investor in Icelandic Glacial, who reached out to the company s Chairman and Co-Founder, Jon Olafsson, about Cher s desire to purchase water for Flint s residents. Icelandic Glacial committed to doubling Cher s purchase which is being trucked in to Michigan beginning Monday, January 18th.The water will reach The Food Bank of Eastern Michigan (www.fbem.org) beginning Wednesday, January 20th. FBEM will immediately begin the distribution process to those who need it most for drinking, cooking and washing. The water will go directly to community centers, food banks and fire houses focusing in on low income housing areas where 40% of Flint s population is living below the poverty line. The bottles, once finished, will return to the food banks and will be recycled with money raised going right back into the food banks. Cher stated: This a tragedy of staggering proportion and shocking that it s happening in the middle of our country. I am so grateful that Icelandic Glacial has come on-board to help the city of Flint.  I cannot wait for the water to get there to help these people who have been poisoned because the water they ve been getting out of their taps has been polluted for so long and remains that way without the state or the federal government stepping in with any substantial plan to resolve this problem. While this doesn t solve Flint s horrific water crisis, it will definitely be a welcomed effort and is sorely needed. The citizens of Flint have been poisoned, and in the most horrible way possible   by the people who are elected to work in their best interests. However, thanks to the efforts of Cher and Icelandic Glacial, fresh water is on the way.Featured image: YouTube",0
8699," Grab The Popcorn, Trump Unloads On Ted Cruz: ‘Nobody Likes Him’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump continued to unload on rival Ted Cruz as the reality star once again went on the attack on Sunday.Appearing on ABC s This Week, Trump talked about just how unlikeable Cruz is. Nobody likes him, nobody in Congress likes him, nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him,  Trump said in an interview airing on ABC s  This Week. Trump also hit Cruz over his secret dark money loan that he secured from Goldman Sachs in order to win his Senate race. Cruz failed to disclose the loan on forms submitted to the Federal Elections Commission. He wants to look like Robin Hood,  Trump said.  That he s the one protecting the people from the banks, while he s actually borrowing money and personally guaranteeing it and not disclosing it, which is illegal. For months Trump and Cruz refused to directly attack each other, preferring to aim their arrows at other Republicans like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. But now as Cruz has started nipping at Trump s heels in Iowa polls, the front runner has begun to give Cruz the business.For his part, Cruz has also fired back. He accused Trump of having  New York values  a phrase that some have seen as a dog whistle to base Republican voters about New York s more diverse culture with is large population of Jewish people, gays, and minorities.Trump responded by pointing out that  New York values  are what terrorists targeted on 9/11. To add insult to injury, Trump received praise for those comments from both Hillary Clinton (who was New York s senator at the time) and current New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio.Additionally, Trump has been concern trolling Cruz about his eligibility for the presidency. Citing the fact that Cruz was born in Canada, Trump has been egging on Cruz to defend himself against possible challenges to his candidacy if he s the nominee. Trump has been a long-time promoter of the conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States.Over the course of the race, Trump has shown a propensity to dig in and go nuclear in his attacks on anyone who directly challenges him, and this latest salvo directed at Cruz seems to signal that the next two weeks ahead of the caucus could be immensely entertaining.Featured image via YouTube",0
8700, Was Martin Luther King Jr. A Republican? The Truth Will Make Conservatives Freak Out,"Conservatives and Republicans love to claim that Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of their own. They claim that the legendary clergyman and civil rights icon was a Republican, and sometimes even claim that he was a conservative.This is a lie.Dr. King had harsh words for both parties:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.  [The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr: Symbol of the Movement, January 1957   December 1958. University of California Press. p. 84]But he said in an October 1956 letter to a civil rights supporter that he had  always voted the Democratic ticket. And in his autobiography, Dr. King said he voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960 because he  felt that Kennedy would make the best president.  He also wrote that  had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964. As far as the Republican Party, Dr. King specifically attacked them for their hard turn to the right in 1964 with the nomination of conservative Barry Goldwater. King said that the party had begun pandering to racist elements, and as a result, he could not support Goldwater in the election versus sitting President Lyndon Johnson:The Republican Party geared its appeal and program to racism, reaction, and extremism. All people of goodwill viewed with alarm and concern the frenzied wedding at the Cow Palace of the KKK with the radical right. While not himself a racist, Mr. Goldwater articulated a philosophy which gave aid and comfort to the racist. His candidacy and philosophy would serve as an umbrella under which extremists of all stripes would stand. In the light of these facts and because of my love for America, I had no alternative but to urge every Negro and white person of goodwill to vote against Mr. Goldwater and to withdraw support from any Republican candidate that did not publicly disassociate himself from Senator Goldwater and his philosophy. [The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.]Similarly, the right s claim that Dr. King was a conservative is laughable. King was well to the left of even the Democratic Party, and opposed the party on key issues like the Vietnam War, to which King objected. King was also a big supporter of an increased minimum wage as well was worker s rights like unionization. Does that sound like a conservative?Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the most effective and dynamic leaders in American history. He was not a Republican, supported Democratic presidential candidates, and was a strong liberal on a host of key issues. Too often King is depicted as sort of a black Santa Claus, devoid of politics and ideology. But that isn t the true King. He was a man of the left, and he succeeded because of that political leaning combined with his faith and the hard work of millions committed to progress.Featured image via Wikimedia",0
8701, Ted Cruz Gets Burned By Fox News Host For War-Mongering Without Military Experience (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz got his ass handed to him on Fox News Sunday for calling President Obama weak because he hasn t carpet bombed the Middle East out of existence.It was not a good time to be Ted Cruz during his appearance on Fox with host Chris Wallace. Throughout the interview, the Republican presidential wannabe desperately tried to appear tough by talking about how quick he would be to wage total war against Iran and ISIS. I will apologize to no one with how vigorous I will be winning the war on terror,  Cruz replied when Wallace pointed out that former U.S. Army War College commandant Robert Scales dinged Cruz for his call to carpet bomb as  just one of those phrases that people with no military experience throw around. The Texas senator then attempted to describe what carpet bombing is by using the Gulf War as an example, whining about how the military has shrunk since 1991. And you want to know what carpet bombing means? Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Desert Storm. In 1991, we had roughly 8,000 planes. Today, we have 4,000. Our Air Force has dropped in half. In 1991, we had 591 ships in our Navy. Today, we have 272. It s dropped nearly in half. In 1991, we had over a third more soldiers in our Army. And we were launching 1,100 air attacks a day. We were carpet bombing them. And after 37 days of 1,100 air attacks a day, our troops went in in a day and a half and mopped up the remnants of the Iraqi Army because that s the effect of carpet bombing. Cruz made his initial carpet bombing remark in December, saying we should see if  sand can glow in the dark. Of course, carpet bombing is when the military drops hundreds or thousands of bombs over a large swath of land, hitting every thing in its path. It s indiscriminate destruction that kills civilians as well as military targets. In short, innocent people get slaughtered. It has also been a war crime since 1977.Chris Wallace, of course, knows quite a bit more about the Gulf War than Cruz does. Wallace covered the war from Tel Aviv as a reporter for ABC while Cruz was busy not studying nearly hard enough at Princeton. We did precision striking,  Wallace corrected Cruz.  In addition   if I may   the Iraqi Army was all massed by itself in the Kuwaiti desert. We re now talking about ISIS soldiers who are not massed, they are embedded in Mosul, they re embedded in Raqqa with civilians. Cruz then went on a rant about how we should be bombing every building and oil field we can find regardless of whether or not ISIS has a connection to them or not and said that he would do exactly that if he becomes president.Here s the video via YouTube.In another part of the interview, Cruz claimed that the only reason Iran detained American sailors earlier this month is because of  the weakness of President Obama.  In reality, Iran detained them and had every right to do so because the naval vessels went off course and entered Iranian waters. It wasn t intentional, but it happened. And Iran released the sailors 14 hours later after the servicemen apologized for the mishap and it was confirmed that a navigational error sent them off course. Also, Iran is helping us fight ISIS, which makes Cruz s next statement all the more harmful.Chris Wallace even informed Cruz of that fact, but nevertheless, Cruz declared that as president he would have punished Iran with  full force and fury  and that  any nation that captured our military officers, captures our soldiers, should face serious repercussions. Here s the video via YouTube.Ted Cruz would be a disastrous president if he were to win in November. He would start endless wars over the smallest disagreements and would stoop so low as to commit war crimes and kill innocent people to prove how tough he is. This is not the kind of president America needs. We already had a president who did these kind of things. President Bush sent thousands of American troops to their deaths fighting two wars and used torture as a method of interrogation despite it being a violation of the Geneva Convention.The fact that President Obama has killed many high-ranking ISIS leaders with precision drone and air strikes proves that we don t need to carpet bomb to achieve the same goals. The fact that President Obama secured a nuclear deal with Iran and the release of American prisoners they held as well as the quick release of American sailors also proves how diplomacy is effective at achieving our goals without firing a single shot or spilling blood.The only thing Ted Cruz demonstrated today is that he is dangerous and irresponsible and shouldn t be allowed anywhere near American foreign policy nor should he be given control of the military.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
8702, Trump Gets Destroyed On Twitter For Using 9/11 Image To Attack Cruz (TWEETS),"The Republican candidates continue to sink to newer lows on a daily basis. After Ted Cruz denigrated the people of New York by accusing Donald Trump of having  New York values,  Trump immediately saw an opportunity to score points. At Thursday s Republican debate, Trump condemned Cruz s statement by invoking the resolve of New Yorkers following the September 11th attacks. Sounds pretty good so far on Trump s part, right? That s until he milked the opportunity dry on Twitter by posting a picture of 9/11 to attack Cruz. However, some of the responses are not what Trump expected. Here is what he tweeted:Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? pic.twitter.com/rYGX9vazku  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2016People clearly knew what Trump was up up to. Here are some responses:.@realDonaldTrump See? I'll use some tragedy to further MY goals. I have no shame. I want to win this bitch and will do whatever it takes!  Fake Donald Trump (@TheFakeTrump) January 16, 2016Yes, as Trump would say:  That s disgusting! @realDonaldTrump You forget that the attack was on the USA, not just NYC. AND you forget we came to help!~  Judy Stines (@jstines3) January 17, 2016Indeed, the attack was on the United States and it was the country as a whole that came together with the necessary resolve. The people that died that day weren t only New Yorkers, but people from around the country and around the world. This was an American tragedy that was resisted with American resolve. Tribalizing it for political gain is not only silly and low, but it clouds the true picture.@realDonaldTrump And stop pimping out the worst terrorist attack in US History because your poll numbers are dropping.  Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) January 16, 2016Donald Trump has shown a knack for being very adept at finding the right moments to attack his opponents. Thus far, he s made a mockery of other Republican candidates, especially Jeb Bush. The media and many in the public have found his antics both humorous and outrageous and have tolerated him and even rewarded him: he s been the most covered candidate by the media thus far.However, we should be very careful with this individual. There will come a time (and that time is coming very soon) when America will have to make an important choice about Donald Trump: Does America want a president who attacks minorities, has clear disdain for women, and uses the worst attack on US history for political gain against his opponent?Let s hope that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and the rest of the Republican lineup continue to cancel each other out and show their true colors with their classless antics.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8703," This One Factor Determines If You’re A Trump Supporter, And It’s Not What You Think","Trump supporters have a lot in common. They lack education. They re a bunch of horrible racists. They want to  make America great again  by viciously beating African-American protesters and homeless people. The idea of keeping brown people out of  Murika appeals to them. His appeal to racists is so great that white supremacists are actively campaigning for him and terrorist groups are using his hate speech to recruit. But did you know that one factor you haven t thought of defines Trump support better than jingoism, racism, homophobia, extreme anti-Muslim sentiments, or a desire to build a gigantic wall so we never have to even look at a Hispanic person again?Politico s Matthew MacWilliams says he has discovered one factor that predicts whether or not someone is a Trump voter:In fact, I ve found a single statistically significant variable predicts whether a voter supports Trump and it s not race, income or education levels: It s authoritarianism.That s right, Trump s electoral strength and his staying power have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it s very possible that Trump s fan base will continue to grow.MacWilliams just finished conducting a national poll which sampled 1,800 voters across the nation.  I found that education, income, gender, age, ideology and religiosity had no significant bearing on a Republican voter s preferred candidate,  he writes.  Only two of the variables I looked at were statistically significant: authoritarianism, followed by fear of terrorism, though the former was far more significant than the latter. MacWilliams explains that Trump s pledge to make  America great again  as well as his horrific suggestions that Muslims be banned from the United States, wear special ID badges if they re already here, and be rounded up into concentration camps (as well, of course, as his Great Wall of Murika), all cater to authoritarian inclinations:Authoritarianism is not a new, untested concept in the American electorate. Since the rise of Nazi Germany, it has been one of the most widely studied ideas in social science. While its causes are still debated, the political behavior of authoritarians is not. Authoritarians obey. They rally to and follow strong leaders. And they respond aggressively to outsiders, especially when they feel threatened.This, of course, describes Trump supporters perfectly. Frighteningly, authoritarianism (while prevalent among Republicans) is not limited to the Right. In the 2008 Democratic primary, the political scientist Marc Hetherington found that authoritarianism mattered more than income, ideology, gender, age and education in predicting whether voters preferred Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama,  MacWilliams notes.  But Hetherington has also found, based on 14 years of polling, that authoritarians have steadily moved from the Democratic to the Republican Party over time  since they began to embrace civil rights, gay rights, and other hallmarks of liberalism that are common in the party today.MacWilliams notes that authoritarianism is not  a statistically significant factor in the Democratic primary race  thus far, but  it does appear to be playing an important role on the Republican side,  as 49 percent of Republicans score  in the top quarter of the authoritarian scale. MacWilliams  poll asked voters some simple questions about parenting to gauge authoritarianism:  whether it is more important for the voter to have a child who is respectful or independent; obedient or self-reliant; well-behaved or considerate; and well-mannered or curious. Based on these questions, Trump was the only candidate Republican or Democrat whose support among authoritarians was statistically significant,  he concludes. This, combined with the 52% of respondents who live in fear of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil, gives us something to fear. While it s easy to say President Trump  can t happen here    that Americans won t stand for the ideological reincarnation of Adolf Hitler being elected   MacWilliams points out that it s time that Democrats and all who oppose fascism begin taking Trump seriously.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8704, WATCH: Everybody Laughed After Watching This Bizarre Fantasy From Marco Rubio,"If you listen to Senator Marco Rubio, ISIS is outside your door and is about to attack your family, and the only way to defend against this threat is to buy a gun.Senator Rubio needs the support of diehard conservatives if he is to make any headway in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, and they are almost as suspicious of his conservative bona fides as they are of figures like Jeb Bush.So in order to get those voters on board, Senator Rubio has to do what he does so well   pander.That s why when he appeared on CBS  Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Rubio went into detail about the latest revelation from the campaign trail   his Christmas Eve purchase of a gun.Rubio told host John Dickerson that he bought a gun in order to defend his family from ISIS.Rubio explains why he purchased a fire arm recently. Explains that it is the last defense between his family & ISIS https://t.co/2AkdTHZ5yh  Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 17, 2016He explained: I m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us, in fact, if ISIS were to visit us or our communities at any moment, the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or from anyone else that seeks to do us harm. Rarely does a politician so blatantly pander to a constituency group that he or she needs to be viable, but Rubio has gone there.His rhetoric echoes the fevered donation-seeking fantasies of the NRA, who has recently told their followers that they need to have a gun in the house to defend against an ISIS attack just outside their homes.Of course, the unfortunate reality is Senator Rubio and other gun owners are far more likely to hurt themselves or members of their family than to engage in a fantasy shoot-out with an ISIS terrorist.But keeping this level of fear up continues to benefit the right in many ways. Telling people to go out and buy guns creates a false sense of security, and fills the coffers of the gun manufacturers who then donate to Republicans and help to keep them in office, resulting in lax gun legislation or opposition to new laws. Everybody benefits, except public safety and security.Marco s got a gun.Featured image via Twitter",0
8705, Victorious Obama Schools GOP War-Mongers: Breakthrough With Iran Based On ‘Smart’ Diplomacy (VIDEO),"While Republicans continue to reveal their true colors by openly complaining about the release of American prisoners in Iran, President Obama is using his latest diplomatic success to teach his critics a lesson in what effective leadership really looks like.Obama had deliberately waited to talk about the hostage exchange until the American prisoners were out of Iran and safe, but upon news that the swap was a success and that the United Nations had certified that Iran was upholding its end of a landmark nuclear disarmament deal, the White House held a press conference that quickly turned into a  teachable moment  for those who had irresponsibly advocated for war over diplomacy. This is a good day, because once again we re seeing what s possible with strong American diplomacy,  Obama said at the White House. Yesterday marked a milestone in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,  he noted.  Most of important of all, we achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East. And yet, somebody might want to tell the Republican Party that a victory like this without a single shot fired is considered a good thing. The friends at Fox and Friends were practically despondent when they had to tell their audience that the American prisoners in Iran were coming home.A good day for America is a bad one for Fox.Obama s negotiations were a massive blow to their narrative.For years, Republicans have insisted that the only way to get Iran to listen to the United States is through threats of war. Infamously, Republican Sen. John McCain ran for president on the platform of  bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran.  Even now, certain conservatives regret not being able to send troops into another Middle Eastern conflict. War is a tough addiction to kick.Nobody knows how much Republicans want war than President Obama. He s been boxing out the war-mongers for years. During his comments, he took a dig at those who say war is the only answer.Citing the cooling of tensions with Iran, Obama pointed out that his  smart, patient and disciplined approach to the world  has yielded results. America can do   and has done   big things when we work together,  Obama said.  We can lead this world and make it safer and more secure. But we can only do that if we stop listening to those who think threatening violence will make us look tough. America has tried that approach for decades and the situation with Iran had only been deteriorating. The change in recent months cannot be overstated.The nuclear talks have brought a sense of normalcy to relations with the U.S. and Iran, with top officials from each country in somewhat regular communication. While Obama emphasized that the U.S. continues to have deep concerns about Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East and its threats to Israel, he also opened up the prospect of Tehran working more cooperatively with the rest of the world.It s worth noting that those who want war with Iran represent a small minority of Americas   mostly Republican politicians and Fox News hosts. It s not a coincidence that McCain s  bomb Iran  campaign strategy contributed to his being absolutely smoked by Obama s  smart, patient and disciplined  one in the election. It s also not a big secret that Americans are tired of sending young kids off to die in intractable wars in the Middle East. With the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finally winding down, it s only those in the GOP who seem eager to embark on a new one.If accomplishing America s goals of neutralizing Iran s nuclear program while avoiding war was the goal   and for most of the country, it was   then this deal represents a massive success for the country. For the bloodthirsty, it probably stings a little. Obama s clearly not sorry.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xABl2Aeaycc]Featured image via White House ",0
8706, Michael Moore Tears Into Michigan GOPers For ‘Killing’ Flint Residents With Polluted Water (VIDEO),"Filmmaker Michael Moore, who was born in Flint, Michigan, recently ripped Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and other GOP lawmakers for keeping the city s unsafe water a secret not only from the predominately minority population, but the federal government.In an impassioned speech to reporters, Moore accused Snyder and Michigan Republicans for  killing  those 10 people. Moore said: This is not a mistake. Ten people have been killed here because of a political decision. They did this. They knew. Moore said that the state s GOP politicians had continued to provide Flint s citizens with polluted water from the Flint River to cut costs. As a result, the state Department of Environmental Quality had failed to call for corrosion control chemicals to be added to the water, resulting in lead entering the water from pipes. Moore insisted that what is being called the  Flint water crisis  is not actually a  crisis  at all   it was a planned, measured decision by lawmakers that are now trying to deflect blame. Moore urged the media and others to call the  Flint water crisis  what it really is   murder: We need to start using the proper words when we talk about this. Ten people have been killed in Flint because of Legionnaire s disease now that has broken out here. And I want the media to please use the word  kill.  If it was ten people killed in a tornado, you d say  ten people killed. Moore ripped Michigan s Republicans for making  political decisions  that put at risk the lives of people in a city that is majority African-American, where 41 percent live below the official poverty line. It s a crisis created by the Republican governor and is visited upon a city that is majority black and majority poor. Speaking over the angry chants of protesters in the background, Moore said: There are people who are very angry here, because their lives are at risk. They should be angry. We are all angry.

8707, Montel Williams To Republicans Criticizing Iran Prisoner Exchange: ‘Sit The Hell Down And Shut Up’,"Montel Williams took Republicans to the woodshed on Saturday for putting American lives in danger by criticizing the Iran prisoner swap.It was a gesture that Iran did not have to take. After all, it wasn t part of the nuclear deal reached with President Obama and other world leaders last summer. But Iran released four Iranian-American prisoners on Saturday, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former Marine Amir Hekmati, in exchange for Iranians imprisoned in the United States for sanctions-related violations.Republicans had demanded that the release of the Americans be a condition of the nuclear deal, and had President Obama listened both efforts would have been put in jeopardy. Six months after the nuclear deal was finalized, President Obama has now successfully negotiated an end to Iran s nuclear program and the release of the Americans the GOP used as pawns to sabotage the deal.But the good news didn t stop Republicans from whining anyway. Even though the released prisoners weren t even home yet, GOP presidential wannabes cried that there should not have been any swap at all. We shouldn t have to swap prisoners,  Christie said.  These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law and they should have been released without condition. Rubio claimed that the swap will embolden other nations to take Americans prisoner so that they can get something in return. Governments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama,  Rubio said.  It s an incentive for more people to do this in the future. Jeb Bush responded by saying he would have threatened Iran with war to get the prisoners freed. I would say . . .  If you do not release them, that there s going to be military action, that that s an act of provocation, an act of war,  he said.In other words, Republicans would have left these Americans in jail because they didn t get their way or they would have declared war on Iran and sent thousands of American troops to their deaths over the imprisonment of four people. That doesn t sound like responsible foreign policy. And former Marine and talk show host Montel Williams feels the same way.As reports trickled in that the four Americans were being released, Williams took to Twitter to blast Republicans who criticized the prisoner exchange before it had been completed.Beyond inappropriate for Republican candidates to criticize a deal to release hostages before they are home. Sit the hell down and shut up.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016 Dear Americans: Just for today, let s #StopWithTheStupid, just absorb that something monumental has happened. Leave politics till Monday.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016Only the tea party could manage to criticize a deal to bring hostages home before said hostages left where they were being held. #NotBright  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 17, 2016On Saturday evening, Williams continued ripping Republicans a new one on Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;It s beyond irresponsible that some of the Republican candidates criticized the swap that will bring our hostages home Posted by Montel Williams on Saturday, January 16, 2016Republicans have now given us a clear demonstration of how they would handle international affairs and it doesn t look good. The GOP would risk war and the sullying of our reputation around the world in a desperate effort to not look weak. Since when did peace and diplomacy come to equal weakness? Not only did diplomacy secure a nuclear agreement that will keep the world from being set ablaze for decades to come, it helped four Americans gain freedom. The fact that President Obama was willing to swap prisoners and make concessions makes him a strong leader, not a weak one. And the seven Iranians released in exchange were not even a threat to us. They simply violated the economic sanctions put in place to get Iran to the bargaining table. They weren t terrorists.The bottom line is that President Obama achieved success on both initiatives without having to fire a single shot or spill one drop of American or Iranian blood. That is true strength that Republicans will never have.Conservatives can either wake up and join the majority of the country and celebrate return of our hostages or be relegated to irrelevancy.

8708, Ted Cruz Gets Trapped In Elevator – Tells Hilarious Joke About Trump (VIDEO),"If you haven t heard by now, Ted Cruz was stuck inside of an elevator before he was scheduled to give a speech at the South Carolina Tea Party Convention on Saturday. Immediately upon being rescued, he wasted no time harping on Donald Trump, drawing immense laughter in the process: All right, so who put Donald Trump in charge of the elevator? While Cruz is a terrible candidate (he is a Republican after all), we have to say the joke wasn t too bad. But, we must add in one caveat: both candidates policy proposals are far more humorous than any joke either candidate could ever muster up..@tedcruz gets stuck in an elevator. Upon being freed Cruz jokes,   Who put Donald Trump in charge of the elevator!  pic.twitter.com/A6kj7dGH0L  Alan He (@alanhe) January 16, 2016Both candidates spent this week sucking up to Tea Party members, but it doesn t appear Trump was well received. A video has surfaced showing Trump getting booed after trying to say negative things about Cruz. For that video, visit HERE. Compare this to the cheers Cruz received when he took a dig at Trump. Doesn t exactly seem fair, does it? Hey, it s not supposed to be. This is politics. And, a lot of people have favorites. Cruz, by all appearances, seems to be their guy. The @tedcruz elevator fiasco, as told by Caroline Klein s Snapchat pic.twitter.com/wvmOOK6rDI  Betsy Klein (@betsy_klein) January 16, 2016South Carolina is important because it holds the nation s third primary contest, just after Iowa and New Hampshire. While the Tea Party doesn t encompass all voters, they still represent a significant voting bloc in the state   which is why both candidates were so eager to seek their approval.Things between the two are just heating up, though. Expect more shots to be taken, and a few jokes (or insults, rather) from the Donald to get back at Cruz for his elevator stunt.Featured image via screen capture",0
8709, NYC Cop Under Investigation After Being Busted With Instagram Account Full Of Violence (TWEETS),"New York City Officer Matthew Langone sure does love his Instagram account. It is also the reason he is now facing an investigation.While off duty, Langone moonlights as a producer of pro-cop merchandise. There would be nothing wrong with this, except for one little fact: the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community. In fact, at least one t-shirt is the very definition of fascism.The latest shirt from the Langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart, with the slogan,  I [heart] protesters.  The  OT  in protesters is in blue, clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever-increasing number of protests. Keegan Stephan, an activist against police brutality, discovered the photos on Langone s Instagram account and uploaded them to twitter. Here is the image:Officer Langone of the @NYPD103Pct doesn't think much of free speech, except of course as ""OT."" pic.twitter.com/SGODDv8Nwh  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. Suspecting more horrible content lay within the confines of Langone s Instagram, Stephan kept looking. He found it to be full of horrible memes and derogatory language directed at the very people this cop is sworn to serve and protect. Here are just a few:In fact, his whole instagram account is pretty unbecoming of an officer, imo, @NYPD103Pct. https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/xM1myPSziZ  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016To be clear, this appears to be an active duty cop w/the @NYPD103Pct posting this filth: https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/zq9bSlGfNB  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016It s the last meme, in which Langone refers to community members as  hoodrats,  that got the attention of Rory Lancman, of the Queens City Council. Lancman called on the 103rd precinct, at which Langone works as an active duty officer, for an investigation. Lancman said of the posts: I m deeply disturbed by the reprehensible Instagram posts of a police officer in the 103rd Precinct, which covers a significant portion of my district. It s completely unacceptable for someone who has sworn to protect our city to post messages advocating violence and referring to community members as  hood rats.  Such comments erode public confidence in our police and undermine our efforts to improve police-community relations. I urge the NYPD to take immediate disciplinary action and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. But of course, the Blue wall of silence is always more important, than, you know, keeping the community safe from a cop with fantasies of fascism and violence and who clearly has nothing but contempt for the people who live there. The cops at the precinct only had this to say: We want to make sure that the posts are his. How many fake Instagram and Twitter pages are out there? Someone may have been putting this out in his name. How convenient. Even more insidious is that they have now blocked Keegan Stephan from following their precinct on Twitter. Stephan posted the proof:Wow, way to deal with the problem, @NYPD103Pct. pic.twitter.com/Vtugh5V76i  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016I think, after this, it is safe to say that their  investigation,  will just be another in a long line of countless cases where they investigate themselves and determine that there was no wrongdoing.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8710, Obama Reveals What He Carries In His Pocket Everyday – Conservatives Freak Out (VIDEO),"President Obama carried out his annual YouTube interview on Friday and revealed what he carried around with him each and every day inside his pockets. While normally what s in a person s pockets might be self-explanatory (i.e.,. phone, wallet, etc.) the president is no ordinary person. And the items he carries around aren t ordinary, either. There s also an in-depth explanation for each one of them.Here s Obama in his own words: I stick these in my pocket to remind me of all the people I ve met along the way and the stories they ve told me. So, this is what I had in my pocket today: this is rosary beads Pope Francis gave me that obviously means alot to me cause I so admire him and it makes me think about peace and promoting understanding and ethical behavior. This is a little Buddha that a Buddhist monk gave me. This is a lucky poker chip that s metal that this biker gave me. This is a Hindu statuette of the monkey God Hanuman that a woman gave me. And, I ve got a coptic cross; this is from Ethipia. So, I ve got a whole bunch of this stuff but the reason I showed you these is because I carry them around all the time. President Obama says he s  not superstitious  and reiterated that the real reason he carries them around is because he likes to be reminded of the people who gave him the distinct privilege of being President of the United States.Even though President Obama clearly carries around both a cross and rosary beads from the none other than the Pope himself, the only thing religious extremists can focus on is the Hindu monkey God and little Buddha. Why is that? They somehow think this is evidence that he really is the Antichrist, after all.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Now compare this to what George Bush is known to have had in his pockets. In November 2005, at a roundtable with Latin American reporters, Bush was asked what he carried around with him. Here is how he responded, according to the Associated Press: The president stood up, fished in his pockets, then dramatically pulled his hands out holding nothing but a white handkerchief that he waved playfully in the air. He said:  Es todo. That s it. No dinero. No money. No mas. Nothing else. No wallet.' The joker that he was, he was also asked if he brought a watch, to which he replied: Si, Timex. But I m not supposed to be endorsing products. It s amazing how what s in a president s pockets can reveal what kind of commander-in-chief they are. Clearly, Obama has put a lot of thought into this, while Bush hadn t.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8711, Tim Allen Cracks A Joke About Obama – Would Be Destroyed If POTUS Made The Same Joke (VIDEO),"Self-proclaimed  fiscal-conservative  Tim Allen cracked a joke about President Obama at the conclusion of the show Last Man Standing on Friday, and let s just say, not only was it not funny, but it wasn t exactly substantiated in fact either.Here s what he had to say: So, if you re a young person not exactly sure where life is taking you, that s okay. We can t all be Barack Obama and have our first job be president. In case Tim Allen wasn t aware, here s a full list of every single job President Obama has had before being elected. We can assure you, being president wasn t his first, not by a long shot.Tim Allen may think he s funny, but unfortunately for him, his joke isn t even close to being even halfway true. But, while we re on the subject perhaps we should discuss one of Tim Allen s first jobs. Typically, we wouldn t bring up somebody s past in such a light, but Allen brought it up first. In 1978, Allen was arrested for cocaine possession and almost spent life in prison. And, it was no small amount   he had over 650 grams on him. That s a lot of Columbian snow. Does Allen really want to compare his list of previous jobs with the president? We didn t think so.This wasn t the first time Allen has used jokes on the show to make fun of President Obama, either. Back in October, he blamed Obama for not being able to have a pit underneath his car. We must admit, this joke, however, was kind of funny. It helped that Jay Leno was on the show, backing him up. You have a pit. I ve always wanted a pit. You can t have a pit these days  cause of zoning laws. (Because of) Obama. Tim Allen has repeatedly gone on television and proclaimed himself to be a conservative and every single time he has showed us how little he actually knows. One of his most recent talk show appearances was when he went on Sean Hannity and discussed his story on why he considers himself to be a conservative: I like problem-solving. And a lot of it is about how are we going to pay for this? In my neighborhood, we wanted to put in trees, (but) here in communist California it s difficult because there are so many regulations. Perhaps Tim should do some fact-checking first the next time he decides to talk about  fiscal-conservativism.  According to The Atlantic, a conservative publication, GOP presidents have been the WORST contributors to the federal debt. Just take a look at the chart below. The last four Republican presidents all significantly contributed to the national debt.Numbers don t lie, but people do.Pic via The AtlanticFeatured image via screen capture.",0
8712, SNL SAVAGELY Lampoons The GOP Clown Car In Hilarious Debate Cold Opener (VIDEO),"Once again, the comedic geniuses at Saturday Night Live proved their prowess when they lambasted the embarrassing quagmire of bullsh*t, hysteria, and jingoistic, nonsensical willful ignorance that was the first GOP debate of 2016. As always, Republicans failed to present a single workable idea at bettering our nation, but they did provide some downright hilarious soundbytes   like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump s hilarious attempts to out- birther  one another, or Carson s paranoid claims that ISIS hackers will down our electrical grid (even though squirrels are actually a bigger threat than any hacker).The SNL cast poked fun at Lindsey Graham s departure from the race (yes, we assure you he was running for President), Chris Christie s almost unredeemable unpopularity and terrible temper, Ted Cruz s supposed ineligibility for office (Let s face it   he s eligible, just awful), Christie s nonsensical desire to kick Obama out of the White House (which he will be leaving of his own accord next January no matter what),  Jebrah  Bush s stupid Clinton joke, and other  hits  from the real embarrassment to America that was the debate. They even translated Ted Cruz s  New York values  remark for us.Sure, we can laugh, but when you think about it one of the men who mainstaged the debate has an almost barely perceptible yet present chance of becoming the next President if Democrats don t get out and vote. Look what the GOP accomplished in 2014, after all.As you watch this, consider that the SNL cast didn t have to reach very far for their jokes   most of them were almost directly written by the Republicans  extensive cast of bigots, hatemongers, and monumental imbeciles from the 2016 field.For now, of course, we ll just laugh   and hope the joke doesn t become too real.Watch the hilarious video below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzysfuve9XM&w=420&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",0
8713, Trump Gets Booed Off The Stage In Front Of The Tea Party – Yells Back At Them (VIDEO),"Donald Trump practically got booed off the stage talking to a bunch of Tea Party activists on Saturday after he started talking about Ted Cruz in a negative light. Shortly after getting a taste of his own medicine (i.e. throwing people out of his events, simply because he doesn t like them) Trump suddenly called it a night and ended his speech. He must not have liked the booing very much.Here s what Trump started saying before the commotion started: You give a campaign contribution to Ted Cruz, you get whatever the hell you want. And he s a very nice guy but you have to get   right? As soon as these very words left the crevice of Trump s mouth, the booing immediately commenced. Let s just say this, Mr. Entertainer didn t seem to like it very much. He quickly snapped back, saying a lot of the same things over and over very nervously while trying to maintain his composure: Excuse me, excuse me. He didn t report his bank loans. Say whatever you want. He didn t report his bank loans. He s got bank loans from Goldman Sachs. He s got bank loans from Citigroup. And then, and then, he acts like Robin Hood. Say whatever you want but it doesn t work that way. Right now Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are locked in an intense battle for the top spot in the Republican party. Their so-called truce earlier on in the primary season is essentially over if the last Republican debate is any indication. But, that s to be expected. This is when the crazy season begins; the Iowa caucuses are only two weeks away.Trump plans on hitting Ted Cruz more on his alleged birther status, and Cruz will still pretend to like Trump as long as his poll numbers continue to rise. That s the thing   it all goes back to the polls. Republican candidates worship those numbers more than the Bible. They ll do whatever works to win this thing.Expect Trump to keep on saying negative things in an attempt to drive up his numbers. With Ted Cruz rising in popularity that only means the possibility of more booing for Trump.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8714, WATCH: We Found Donald Trump’s Campaign Theme Song (VIDEO),"Way back in 1998, when Fox s MadTV was still on the air, an actress/singer named Nicole Sullivan performed a three-minute comedy sketch that so accurately predicts the Donald Trump campaign, we just had to write about it.For the sketch, Sullivan adopted the character of Darlene McBride, a huge-haired country music singer, who is promoting her upcoming  Take Back America  tour.As the video opens, Sullivan s character can be seen strumming her guitar, while belting out the words to her new song,  Take Back America. Take back America to 1955,  she sings.  Take back America to when god was still alive. As the music fades into the background, McBride is seen sitting at a mirrored dressing table, dressed in camo, an American flag displayed proudly on the shoulder of her military fatigues. Truer words were never spoken, or sung,  she says.She then introduces herself. Hi, I m Darlene McBride. You know I love this country, the way it used to be, simple-minded, with simple values, simple people. But then the big government, the Supreme Court and those bleeding heart liberals just couldn t leave well enough alone. And now look at it? A big, ugly melting pot just boilin  over on what used to be a nice, white stove. From there, McBride goes on to talk about her upcoming tour, where she says she ll  be coming to a city near you, to sing traditional songs with traditional values. She then provides the audience with a few samples tunes that you can hear during the tour.For starters, there s a little ditty called The Lord Loves the NRA. The lord loves the NRA, he told me so the other day. He spelled it out in bullets in the sky. He s sitting up in heaven with his AK 47. He s a rough-and-ready, macho kind of guy. Then there s the song called The Back of the Bus.Leading into that one she says  Excuse me Mr. Negro, but I ve got a question to ask you. She then breaks into the song, asking in the lyrics,  What s so bad about the back of the bus? Next up is a song called Nothing Would Be Finer. Nothing would be finer than to drop a bomb on Chiner in the morning. She also has a song about illegal immigration called Hey Senorita.To be fair, all of the songs in this sketch would work for any GOP candidate, not just Trump. The NRA lovin , republican-Jesus fearin  racists and warmongers that vote for them would likely never realize they were listening to a musical parody of themselves.Watch the MadTV video below, courtesy of Migrainemaker on YouTube.While the sketch might seem like it was written to mock today s Teapublican Trump supporters, it s actually 18 years old.It goes to show, no matter how much time passes, the republican party does not change. It s the same today as it was almost twenty years ago, and will most likely be twenty years from now.Featured image credit: video screen capture, MadTV via Migrainemaker on youtube",0
8715, Wife Of Pastor Freed In Iran Just Demolished The Right-Wing Criticism Of Obama’s Actions (VIDEO),"Ever since President Obama made history with a groundbreaking nuclear disarmament deal with Iran, Republican lawmakers have tried to undermine the nature of the agreement by pointing to several American citizens who were still languishing in the country s prison. They argued that no deal can truly be reached until Iran released the imprisoned Americans. That all changed on Saturday, January 16, when the Obama administration pulled off yet another victory: Securing the release of five American prisoners, who will now get to return to their families.This is great news, right? Apparently, not if you are a conservative politician.Rather than celebrate, Republicans  still allergic to acknowledging Obama s accomplishments, no matter how uncontroversial   whined and complained. Donald Trump, the current Republican front-runner, even suggested the prisoners should have stayed in Iranian prison because it was a bad deal. They re getting seven people, so essentially they get $150bn plus seven, and we get four,  the billionaire said.Marco Rubio agreed with Trump that the prisoner swap was a bad idea. His disingenuous argument was that  swapping  made America weak  despite the fact that America has had no problem using the technique since the Revolutionary War.One of the main criticisms Republicans leveled at Obama was that he didn t care about the prisoners. Just days before the White House announced the release of the prisoners, Republican politicians and pundits were claiming Obama didn t care about them at all.You can t ask #JasonRezaian bc Obama did a deal with Iran thugs who have held Jason hostage for almost 600 days. https://t.co/jzd7EyzbI0  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 13, 2016Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay.  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) January 12, 2016In fact, we now know with certainty that nothing could be further from the truth. Secretary of State John Kerry has been working around the clock to get these Americans home. (Note: Obama isn t the only one who gets no credit. Not a single Republican thanked Kerry for his efforts, either. Ted Cruz did thank God though.)Praise God! Surely bad parts of Obama's latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home. https://t.co/rad1VcWUml  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 16, 2016This political posturing might play well with the fringe right who love to hear about Obama s  failures,  but the families of the victims are telling an entirely different story. According to the wife of one of the prisoners, Obama was dogged about getting these Americans home to their families.On CNN, Naghmeh Abedini, the wife of Christian pastor Saeed Abedini (imprisoned in Iran since 2012), said Obama assured her that he and his administration were doing everything they could to bring him home   even while Republicans screeched on Fox News saying the opposite. Speaking with Wolf Bltizer, Abedini said: It s been wonderful. Especially the last year. Constant communication. Constant updates. Of course last year, we met with President Obama. He was in Boise, Idaho, [and] we had a private meeting with [him]. The last  year has been the best support. They were continually updating us  talks they were having with Iran and the side negotiations. I had a feeling in the last few months that it was coming to a close, but I wasn t really sure and I wouldn t trying to get my hopes up. In other words, the Obama administration had been doing all the things you would hope a president would when wrestling with a tense negotiation with a foreign country that doesn t exactly love America.This has been a common theme during Obama s presidency. Fox News pundits and right-wing politicians hoping to score cheap political points take potshots at the president, because they know he can t respond. Obama s silence wasn t apathy, it was necessary in order to make the deal work. So rather than tank the negotiation for his own reputation, he took the punches and worked on in silence.It s worth remembering, particularly on a day like this, that the Republican alternative to these successful negotiations was to quite literally start a war with Iran. It s never been clear how exactly they reasoned that a new world war would help things, but then, war has always been an easy answer. Diplomacy takes more intelligence, and a heck of a lot more courage.Watch Abedini s interview via CNN below:Featured image via CNN",0
8716," Oath Keeper Leader: If You ‘Waco’ The Bundy Militia, There Will Be ‘Bloody, Brutal Civil War’","The occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Reserve in Harney County, Oregon, has now reached the two week mark, and there are no signs of a coming resolution. Many people want this over and done with, especially those whose lives have been disrupted by the presence of Cliven Bundy s sons and a bunch of other pathetic wannabe  patriots.  Well now, the founder of another militia group, the Oath Keepers, has a message for the authorities who are monitoring the situation.Stewart Rhodes uploaded his warning message to the group s website, and insisted that the government better watch out because there will never again be a free Waco,  and if they aren t careful there will be  a conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war. While Rhodes and his group are deliberately staying out of the Bundy situation, his message was no less threatening. In the piece, entitled Warning to U.S. Military and Federal LEOs: Do Not Follow Orders to  Waco  Ammon Bundy Occupation, or Risk Civil War, Rhodes said: This situation (Oregon occupation) must not be handled in a military or paramilitary fashion, using military assets, military rules of engagement, or otherwise attempting to end it suddenly by use of dynamic assault, resulting in catastrophic loss of life, as has occurred twice in recent American history, with horrific results (at Ruby Ridge in 1992, and at Waco Texas in 1993). If you do it  Waco  style here, you risk pushing this nation over the edge into a civil war, because there are  no more free Wacos. This is precisely why, frustrating as it is, these people are still being allowed to occupy this space unlawfully. The authorities have already suggested that another Waco is exactly what these idiots want. Rhodes went on to say: Despite that reality of there being no emergency here, we have very good reason to believe that ideologue leftist bureaucrats within the Obama Administration   such as within the D.O.J., and their politically minded  perfumed prince  puppets within the D.O.D.   are pressuring you to prepare to use military assets and military rules of engagement to conduct a dynamic raid. We hear things. We ll just leave it at that. After this warning, Rhodes went on to attack the Obama Administration, as well as President Obama, himself. We agree, and therefore we warn you to do this right, no matter what the Obama Admin overlords try to demand.  Do it right, or risk starting a conflagration so great, it cannot be stopped, leading to a bloody, brutal civil war. And do it right, because it is your duty to refuse those orders, under your oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And that includes the domestic enemies now  occupying  Washington D.C. Your brothers in heaven are watching.  Do the right thing.  Stand down, and refuse to obey evil, ghoulish sociopaths who salivate at the prospect of watching Americans die on camera, like they watched during Benghazi,   he stated.  Tell them that if they want American patriot blood, they need to strap on a plate carrier, chest rig, and an M-4 and go do it themselves. That s what these numbskulls don t get. These people are not patriots. They are criminals. This occupation cannot go on forever. Something will have to be done. While it is understandable that no one wants to see bloodshed, this cannot continue indefinitely.Then again, the Oath Keepers are a fringe group of lunatics much like these Bundy idiots, only much more organized, which also makes them more dangerous. Hopefully, the authorities aren t listening to a word they have to say, and will move to get these yahoos out of that wildlife refuge so that the local residents can get back to living their lives.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8717, Iran Proves Republicans Are Full Of Crap As United Nations Says Nuclear Deal Has Been Honored,"Iran is fulfilling their obligations under the nuclear deal reached with the Obama Administration, and Republicans can t handle being proven wrong by those they consider enemies.On Saturday morning, Iran released several Americans from jail. Among them included Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former marine Amir Hekmati. As you may recall, Republicans repeatedly used the imprisonment of these three men as a reason to oppose the nuclear deal and demanded that President Obama make their release a condition of the negotiations.But President Obama wisely refused to tangle the two issues, which kept the nuclear deal alive while preserving a future opportunity to bring the prisoners home.And on Saturday, President Obama s wisdom paid off, as all three men have been released just as the deal goes into effect. Not only that, but the United Nations has announced that Iran has honored the terms of the deal in a statement by International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Yukiya Amano.Here is the full statement via the IAEA.Today, I released a report confirming that Iran has completed the necessary preparatory steps to start the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The report was submitted to the IAEA Board of Governors and to the United Nations Security Council.It was issued after Agency inspectors on the ground verified that Iran has carried out all measures required under the JCPOA to enable Implementation Day to occur.This paves the way for the IAEA to begin verifying and monitoring Iran s nuclear-related commitments under the agreement, as requested by the U.N. Security Council and authorised by the IAEA Board.Relations between Iran and the IAEA now enter a new phase. It is an important day for the international community. I congratulate all those who helped make it a reality, especially the group of countries known as the E3/EU+3, Iran and the IAEA Board.In line with its commitments, Iran will start to provisionally implement the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. Together with other nuclear-related measures under the JCPOA, this increases the Agency s ability to monitor nuclear activities in Iran and to verify that they are peaceful.We have come a long way since the IAEA first started considering the Iran nuclear issue in 2003. A lot of work has gone into getting us here, and implementation of this agreement will require a similar effort. For our part, we are ready to get on with the job.In other words, Iran met their obligations and showed the world that Republicans were full of bullshit every time they demonized the deal or accused Iran of not cooperating.Even Secretary of State John Kerry took a victory lap around those who doubted the deal would succeed, calling the deal an  ambitious set of promises  that Iran is keeping, which makes the entire world safer. Iran has undertaken significant steps that many, and I do mean many, people doubted would ever come to pass. And that should be recognized, even though the full measure of this achievement can only be realized by assuring continued full compliance in the coming years. Today marks the moment that the Iran nuclear agreement transitions from an ambitious set of promises on paper to measurable action in progress. Today, as a result of the actions taken since last July, the United States, our friends and allies in the Middle East, and the entire world are safer because the threat of the nuclear weapon has been reduced. Clearly, the deal is working and Iran must continue to honor it since other sanctions won t be lifted for another ten years down the road. For now, however, Iran is working with the world and the world is rewarding them by lifting sanctions.This deal will go down in history as one of the greatest achievements of President Obama s time in office, and will go down as a humiliating defeat for Republicans. The GOP hoped to sabotage the deal in preference of war with Iran that would cost thousands of lives and add even more to our national debt. It s likely they are furious that they failed so badly, but they should really be embarrassed that they stood in the way of history and the diplomatic negotiations that brought the deal to fruition. They acted like little toddlers who didn t get their way while the Iranians and President Obama were the adults in the room. And the results make it absolutely clear that Republicans do not have what it takes to lead or make American foreign policy.Featured Image: Tumblr",0
8718, Bigoted GOPer Calls Obama ‘The Most Racially-Divisive President’ Since The Civil War (AUDIO),"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL)   a congressman who at one time cracked jokes about shooting undocumented immigrants   has recently called President Barack Obama out for being  the most racially-divisive president  America s had since slavery.Brooks, who happens to be the chairman of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s Alabama leadership team, made these comments during a radio interview on the Dale Jackson Show on Thursday. Commenting on the president s State of the Union speech, the Alabama Republican said, There probably has not been a more racially-divisive, economically divisive, president in the White House since we had presidents who supported slavery. Host Dale Jackson pressed Brooks to clarify what exactly he meant   considering that Obama is the nation s first black president   and Brooks  explanation threw Obama a bone for not being the absolute worst president in the entire history of the United States   just within the last 150 years: We did have presidents in the first 80 to 100 years of our country that supported slavery. You cannot say Barack Obama was worse than them. But he s probably the worst one since the Civil War and the passages of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. You can listen to the recording of the show below: Later in the show, Jackson commented on how much racial tensions have become a focal point in the political arena, and Brooks accused Obama and Democrats of using race and sex to divide Americans  to a level of perfection not heretofore seen. In true GOP fashion, Brooks chose not to give specific reasons why Obama was  racially divisive    but his Civil War comment means that he s forgotten quite a bit about history, and how racist some of America s presidents from the last 150 years were. To say that Obama is more racially divisive than post-Civil War presidents such as Andrew Jackson, Rutherford Hayes, Woodrow Wilson and even George W. Bush is absolutely ridiculous.Brooks should know a bit about being racially divisive himself   he s made several racist statements in the past. For example, there was that time he said Syrian refugees wanted a  paid vacation,  spread lies about Obama s childhood past in Indonesia, blamed a measles outbreak on  illegal aliens,  and stated that Obama s immigration policy was based on  skin pigmentation.

8719, Here’s What Happened When Black Protesters Did What The Bundy Terrorists Are Doing (VIDEO),"When the Bundy Moron Militia decided to illegally occupy the Malheur Federal Wildlife Reserve in Oregon, one of the things some people wondered about was what the government s response would have been had the perpetrators been black. As it turns out, there is a precedent for that very situation if you go back in time to 1979.The nitwits in Oregon are where they are under very different circumstances. They re taking a stand in a place where nobody wants them against an oppression that doesn t exist. In 1979, a group of 40 African-Americans took a stand at a wildlife refuge in Georgia under very different circumstances.In 1942, the federal government took a tract of land given by eminent domain to freed slaves in Georgia after the Civil War by a wealthy plantation owner. They came with bulldozers and destroyed churches, schools, factories and homes, paying black residents and landowners far less than whites were paid, giving them three weeks to leave.The town was called Harris Neck, and while it served as a military base during the war, it was never returned to its rightful owners; it was instead turned into a wildlife refuge. in 1979, the 40 protesters, descendents of families ousted nearly 40 years earlier, staged a protest at the property. It was almost like the protest the Bundy a**holes are engaged in, with a few notable differences.They showed up with backpacks and tents. They didn t destroy any property or break into any buildings. They were unarmed. Their protest was actually about something that affected them, not a desperate cry for social media attention. And last but certainly not least, they were black.The government responded a bit differently than they have to the Bundy debacle. They didn t leave them alone with free utilities to enjoy the comfort of a taxpayer-funded rebellion; they went to court and got an order to remove them   within 24 hours of their arrival. All but four of the protesters left when served with the court order. The government moved in and removed them by force.The Bundy terrorists are armed and have broken law after law, and still the feds haven t so much as cut their power. The circumstances are certainly very different, but still It doesn t seem very fair, does it?Here s a video of the struggle over Harris Neck, which is still going on today:Featured image via sott.net",0
8720, WATCH: The Damning Video That Will Utterly Destroy Donald Trump (VIDEO),"For months now, Donald Trump has been leading the polls for the republican party s presidential nomination. His devoted followers hang on his every word, while he promises to do impossible things, like build a wall across the Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States.Is Trump taking these voters for a ride?This twelve-minute video compilation, published by the non-profit foundation One World Voice, gives an interesting overview of Trump s many changing faces and contradictory political positions.The video includes clips of Trump praising Bill and Hillary Clinton, stating his pro-choice beliefs, supporting partial birth abortion, praising the Chinese, even giving democrats credit for creating a better economy than republicans have ever been able to create.After more than twelve minutes of video evidence that seems to contradict many of Donald Trump s recent statements on the campaign trail, the video s creators ask: Still think Trump is a true conservative? Why support him when we have other real conservatives?

He s been sued for fraud over everything from bogus real estate deals to his sham school, formerly known as Donald Trump University.It s likely Trump doesn t mean anything he says. Over the past several months what s become obvious is that he will say anything that is likely to get him publicity or attention, no matter how disgusting it is.Like Ben Carson s campaign, Donald Trump s bid for president is just another way to gain publicity and boost his bank own account.As Addicting Info reported here, Carson s campaign has been exposed as nothing more than a publicity stunt, designed to boost his book sales and increase the size of his own bank account. His staff began dropping like flies on New Year s Day, with more and more resignations rolling in all the time.Trump s campaign is not much different than Carson s. Donald Trump has been a money-grubbing attention whore for decades. A presidential bid is no doubt just a way to get his face on TV and his name in the press, all while bilking his devoted followers out of millions and millions of dollars.*Featured image credit: video screen capture One World Voice via Facebook ",0
8721," Obama Just Declared The Flint Water Crisis A Federal Emergency, Here’s What That Means For Flint","On Saturday, President Obama officially declared that the Flint water crisis is now a federal emergency. The President s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in Genesee County,  reads a statement from FEMA.Just two days ago, Michigan s Republican governor, Rick Snyder, requested that President Obama declare the Flint water crisis a federal emergency.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster.There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system.The statement from FEMA goes on to say that: Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. This emergency assistance is to provide water, water filters, water filter cartridges, water test kits, and other necessary related items for a period of no more than 90 days. This is great news for the city of Flint. The people of Flint are almost completely reliant on bottled water and emergency water stations. The National Guard and other governmental bodies, along with grassroots community groups, have been tasked with providing the residents of Flint those emergency water supplies. Now, they will receive funding and coordination from FEMA, which should alleviate some of the burden.Featured Image Credit:By The White House [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",0
8722, Why GOP Presidential Candidates Are Angry Iran Released Hostages,"The release of Americans being held prisoner in Iran comes as welcome news to most patriotic citizens, happy to see these people come home. Except for the Republican presidential candidates.The top tier of men seeking the GOP presidential nomination released messages about the hostage release on Saturday, but almost to a man they had to be mealy-mouthed in their missives, upset that once again under President Obama, an international situation has been defused and resolved without the world going to war and hundreds or thousands of people being killed.Donald Trump, the current front runner: Iran is  getting seven people, so essentially they get $150b plus seven, and we get four,  adding,  I m happy they re coming back, but I will tell you it s a disgrace they ve been there so long. Ted Cruz released a tweet:  Praise God! Surely bad parts of Obama s latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home Chris Christie: The prisoners  should have been released without condition, but you know, the Iranians have treated this president with disrespect for years and he continues to take it. Marco Rubio: Iran takes  people hostage in order to gain concessions and  the fact that they can get away with it with this administration I think has created an incentive for more governments to do this around the world. Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian is going to be home with his family, as will former Marine Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari and Matthew Trevithick. So will the Navy sailors who were detained by the Iranian government. Nobody has died. We didn t have to go to war or fire rockets. At the same time we have negotiated a deal   now underway   that will prevent Iran from becoming a dangerous nuclear state.All of these developments have come under the leadership of Barack Obama, who defeated the Republican candidate in 2008 who promised to simply  bomb Iran.  America chose a different path and it has worked out.And that is driving Republicans crazy.Featured image via YouTube",0
8723, The President Is Doing Something Amazing For Working Class Americans Who Lose Their Jobs (VIDEO),"The president s Saturday morning address is chock-full of good news for working class Americans. Unemployment is at the lowest it s been since before Bush tanked the economy. With 70 straight months of job growth, confidence that the American jobs market will reach full employment is high. As President Obama points out, however, it s never enough to stand on your laurels.One of the major problems with the recovery has been that when companies started hiring again, they hired at lower wages. It may have been out of fear that thew worst may still be ahead or it could be out of a need to recoup the losses they experienced from 8 years of Bush policies. Regardless, the working class American is the one who pays the price. Most of corporate America operates on bottom line numbers, not whether or not their employees can afford to eat. Passing on the losses to those who work their butts off to rebuild their companies has become standard operating procedure.The President has vowed to change that in his final year in office, starting with those who need it most. He s initiating a plan of not just improved unemployment insurance and job training for those who still can t find a job, but wage insurance for those people making under $50K per year who are re-hired for a job at a lower wage. The plan would cover up to $10K in wage replacement over two years to struggling families making less now for the same job they were doing before they were let go.The president says in his address: If a hardworking American loses her job, regardless of what state she lives in, we should make sure she can get unemployment insurance and some help to retrain for her next job. It s a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce   because we shouldn t just be talking about unemployment; we should be talking about reemployment, Moving the country forward has been the goal of this administration from day one. It used to be that we could be sure that Republicans would block whatever the president tried to do, causing him to move on to the next thing, but lately he s been taking matters into his own hands, not giving a sh*t what the Republicans think or want.That s the way we like it, Mr. President. Keep up the good work.Watch President Obama s full address below:Featured image via screen capture",0
8724, Fox News Seems SUPER Bummed They’re Forced To Report Iran Released Prisoners (VIDEO),"If there s one thing that conservatives and Fox News want more than anything, it s for President Obama and his administration to fail. This has been their narrative since he took office, and they d love for him to follow through with what they ve been saying. Unfortunately for them, that s just not the case. The economy has recovered, more people have health insurance, Osama bin Laden was killed, marriage equality is the law of the land, credit card companies are better kept in check, and a deal for a nuclear-free Iran was reached on top of countless other achievements.On the latest edition of Traitor TV, Fox News seems rather upset that Obama and his administration are actually getting the job done. Five prisoners have just been released from Iran, four as part of a negotiation. One of the prisoners released is Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian who was held for more than 500 days in Iranian captivity. According to CNN: The release was arranged as part of a prisoner swap involving seven Iranians held by the United States on sanctions charges, the officials confirmed. The deal comes after more than a year of secret negotiations. This is a huge development, and also goes directly against the narrative Republicans have been touting during debates, and Fox News has been delivering for years. They ve insisted that President Obama is going to get us into war with Iran, but more and more evidence to the contrary keeps making itself known.And because they re technically a news media outlet, and not officially the media branch of the Republican party, Fox News  Fox & Friends had to report these latest negotiated releases with Iran. However, by the looks on their faces, they don t seem thrilled to deliver the good news. After all, they ve just been proven to be the liars that they are, yet again. Video/Featured image: C&L",0
8725, ‘WHO’S SPYING ON US?’: Bundy Militia FLIPS Over ‘Hidden’ Cameras In Plain View (VIDEO),"The armed militants occupying federal property in Oregon still haven t been arrested   but they are absolutely continuing to do damage. Unsatisfied with tearing down fences and building roads, disrupting the delicate ecosystem, Y all Qaeda is on a hunt for something even more dangerous to humanity than a tyrannical bird sanctuary: cameras.The pretend militia chose perhaps the only person whose hands aren t covered with some of the 55 gallons of lube a good samaritan sent them to climb a ladder and investigate the creepy science box.The box itself, which has a sticker reading  SCADA CIRCUIT 10  on the outside, doesn t try to hide what it is.  SCADA  stands for   supervisory control and data acquisition,  as a simple Google search can tell you, but these folks apparently lack the computer expertise needed to do more than visit World Net Daily s website. There s also a blinking red light, an antenna, and a  WiFi in use  sticker.  In other words, it is very clearly a not-so-hidden camera.While most would expect cameras to cover a federal wildlife preserve, the Armed and Stupid were completely taken aback by this development. The  militiaman  up the pole struggled to open the housing, so he solved the problem in the traditional Bundy way   by hitting it with something. What s that look like to you,  he yelled to his posse.  This is United States federal government surveillance. Welcome to America. I m tellin  you! Who s spying on us?  a woman yelled, as though the cameras were in place simply to keep an eye on them. Your federal government,  Utility Pole Guy replied.  Wake up people. Ammon Bundy, a product of generations and generations of inbreeding, shared his thoughts on the matter: This tells me that, uh, the government wants to be oppressive. They gotta watch us, control us, and use these things to do that with. This is not what it means to be free. A free people does not need to be watched. A free people needs to be left alone. Wake up America,  Bundy said.  Let s get our freedom back,  adding that the cameras are a  sophisticated piece of equipment    though to be fair, a spoon is a sophisticated piece of equipment to Bundy.The Bundy terrorists then dismantled the cameras because they re  sick of being spied on  as they illegally occupy property that is nowhere close to theirs. Then, of course, they were off to hunt for more signs of government oppression.The footage of the Bundy idiots discovering that cameras exist is downright hilarious. Of course, there s always the possibility that the cameras are not government cameras at all.  There s also the possibility that the cameras belong to the electric company, since they seem to be pointed directly at a substation located near the property,  Winning Democrats  Charles Topher notes.  Wouldn t that be a hoot. In any case, this monumental display of stupidity is hilarious to see:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvCAxGmDq9k&w=640&h=360]Featured image via screengrab",0
8726, Bernie Sanders Releases Scathing Statement On Rick Snyder Over The Flint Water Crisis,"On Saturday, Bernie Sanders released a much-anticipated statement on Michigan s governor Rick Snyder and the Flint water crisis. In the statement, Sanders calls for Snyder to resign. There are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Gov. Snyder should resign,  Sanders said in a press release.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water.

So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water.One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.Just before the new year, Snyder released an official apology to the people of Flint and Michigan. Considering people are so angry at Snyder, that they are calling for his arrest, the apology has been almost universally lambasted. I want the Flint community to know how very sorry I am that this happened. And I want all Michigan citizens to know that we will learn from this experience, because Flint is not the only city that has an aging infrastructure,  Snyder said in the apology.Sanders, like so many others was critical of that apology. Because of the conduct by Gov. Snyder s administration and his refusal to take responsibility, families will suffer from lead poisoning for the rest of their lives. Children in Flint will be plagued with brain damage and other health problems. The people of Flint deserve more than an apology,  Sanders said.Sanders is absolutely right, Snyder should resign. It is the only move he could make that would leave him with a scrape of dignity. Every moment that Snyder continues to stay in office, is a slap in the face to residents of Flint and the rest of Michigan. Though, I am sure Snyder won t resign.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore via Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0)",0
8727, President Obama Humiliates GOP As Iran Releases WaPo Reporter Before Nuclear Deal Goes Into Effect,"Republicans have once again been made to look like the fools they are as Iran releases the Washington Post reporter they attempted to use as a bargaining chip in an effort to sabotage President Obama s nuclear deal.President Obama must have been laughing hysterically this morning after news broke of Iran finally releasing Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian and several others, including pastor Saeed Abedini and former marine Amir Hekmati, from their imprisonment in exchange for the release of Iranians who were imprisoned by the United States for violating sanctions.The release of these Iranian-Americans comes just before the nuclear deal goes into effect as the United States government prepares to lift economic sanctions that have been crippling Iran over the years.As you ll recall, Republicans shamelessly attempted to tie any deal with Iran to the immediate release of Rezaian and the others, demanding that President Obama make it a condition during the crucial negotiations. Marco Rubio even penned a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry in March 2015 with the same demands. It is unacceptable that as the United States engages with Iran, human rights violations at the hands of Iranian officials go unchecked and Americans languish in Iranian jail cells,  Rubio wrote. We urge you to discuss these imprisoned Americans and demand their unconditional release as you engage in discussion with Iranian officials.The Iranian government  is unjustly punishing Mr. Rezaian, Pastor Abedini, and Mr. Hekmati  Once again, Iran s government is showing they will spare no means to stifle dissent and use innocent Americans as political pawns. The letter was signed by 19 Republican senators, including Tom Cotton, who would go on to pen a letter of his own to Iran, warning them that Republicans would refuse to honor the deal if they gained control of the White House in 2016. 47 Republican senators would sign that treasonous letter and the incident has been seen as a major international embarrassment ever since.But the Obama administration refused to bow to such demands, insisting that making unrelated demands would endanger the opportunity to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and could hinder efforts to secure their release.And in the end, President Obama has once again been proven right. Not only did he successfully negotiate an end to Iran s nuclear program, which the Iranians turned over earlier this month, he has now secured the release of Rezaian, Abedini, and Hekmati all through the use of diplomacy without putting either effort at risk by tying them together. And he did it despite constant Republican efforts to sabotage him.According to The Guardian:Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, said the release of the prisoners was  a triumph of diplomacy that should be universally commended.  Now, the freed Americans can be reunited with their families and friends after an extraordinarily trying time for everyone involved. We hope that they find solace in their freedom from the turmoil that they endured. Parsi said their release was long overdue but that it was unlikely to have happened if US-Iran diplomatic relations hadn t improved as a result of the nuclear agreement. The US and Iran should deepen their engagement on the serious issues that continue to separate the two countries so that further pragmatic solutions can be reached. This is a humiliating defeat for Republicans and proves without a shadow of a doubt that the GOP is unfit to handle American foreign policy.Featured Image: Pete Souza",0
8728," Oregon Terrorist: Locals Want Us Gone, But We’re Staying Because U.S. Is A Republic (VIDEO)","The Bundy militia has now been making a nuisance of itself and terrorizing Harney County, Oregon with its armed occupation of Malheur Wildlife Refuge for two weeks now. It s been frustrating to sane people nationwide, but especially to the area s residents, whose lives have been disrupted by this nonsense. Unfortunately, though, it has been confirmed that these people have no intention of going anywhere. In fact, one of the militants, LaVoy Finicum, says they have a right to be there, even if the local residents want them to leave.Finicum said to the press that he knows that the people who actually live in the area want the militia to get out of dodge, and a third says we like what you re doing but not liking your method, appreciate it but we want you to go, and about a third saying don t go, stay.  However, the United States is a republic, so they aren t going anywhere. He went on to say: Let s talk about a republic. It s the right of an individual that we re looking at, not the right of the collective. You know if there is just one rancher that is saying please help me, please don t go, what about him? What about the Hammonds? What about that family that is in prison? Let them be released,  he said.  It is about the one family right now. Nevermind the fact that the Hammonds want absolutely nothing to do with this band of nutcases, and their attorney has said that these idiots do not speak for them. That matters not to these yahoos, though. This isn t about the Hammonds, this is about men wanting to play army and who are committing treason while fulfilling that fantasy. Arrest them all, now.Watch the video of Finicum s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture",0
8729, Oregon Congressman Rips Justice Department For Not Arresting And Prosecuting Bundy Militants (VIDEO),"Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio took federal authorities to the woodshed on the House floor over their failure to do their job and arrest the armed terrorists led by Ammon Bundy.As you probably already know, Bundy and his band of right-wing militants illegally seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge two weeks ago. Ever since then, they ve destroyed government property, snooped through government files, struck fear into the hearts of the local citizens, and have broken several laws in the process. But law enforcement has done very little to remove the armed occupation, which is a stark contrast to the way law enforcement treats unarmed black men in this country.And DeFazio wants that to change right now. The heat and the lights are on at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, illegally occupied by ultra-rightwing anti-government extremists, but you gotta wonder if the lights are on or is anybody home down there at the Justice Department,  DeFazio said.DeFazio then angrily demanded that federal authorities take down the militants and end the standoff so that people can move on with their lives. Hello! I don t think there s anybody there. I believe that this illegal occupation, this destruction of federal property was directly emboldened by the fact that their father of the two leaders, Cliven Bundy, stood down the government two years ago when he owed a million dollars   other ranchers paid their grazing fees, he refuses to do it. And he was grazing in areas that were prohibited. And he stood down the government at the point of a gun, and he s still grazing and nobody, nobody at the Justice Department has seen fit to raise a finger against him.He celebrated the anniversary of the takeover and said  this is how it s done.  And now his sons are replicating that in my state of Oregon, where we abide by the laws. Yeah, we disagree over a lot of federal policies, but we abide by the laws.It s time for the Justice Department to take some action. Wake up down there! Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, so far, the only militants who have been arrested were caught driving a federal vehicle to town in search of snacks. Meanwhile, the rest of the militants have been allowed to come and go as they please and they ve even been allowed to destroy federal fence lines and access government computers. Furthermore, the militants broke the law by carrying firearms on federal property and their seizure of a government building is an act of domestic terrorism that should not be tolerated.If this were a group of African-Americans or Muslims, law enforcement would have already shot up the place and killed every one of them by now. But because these gunmen are white rednecks, authorities are treating them with kid gloves, which perfectly demonstrates that law enforcement truly has different rules for different people. These militants are costing taxpayers millions of dollars, and they are interrupting the daily lives of citizens who do not want them there. Their actions are illegal and they should be treated like any other terrorist. It s time for law enforcement to do the job they are paid to do or they should resign in disgrace so that we can hire people who will actually do it.Featured image via screen capture",0
8730, FINALLY: Two Members Of Bundy Militia Arrested,"For the last two weeks, armed domestic terrorists have been wreaking havoc on an Oregon town in a treasonous occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. They have been able to come and go freely, and no move by law enforcement, local or federal, was made to round up and arrest these criminals. That is, until Friday.Two of the militiamen made the mistake of using federal vehicles to go grocery shopping. That s what got them arrested, but not the occupation itself.first arrest made of #bundymilitia   two fed vehicles from compound were driven to Safeway. vehicles now impounded pic.twitter.com/RM94eKj2Uh  John Sepulvado (@JohnLGC) January 15, 2016This is the problem with the whole situation: What these people are doing is absolutely illegal, and they should most definitely be jailed for it. Instead, the authorities have let them play pretend Army for the last two weeks unimpeded. Instead of arresting them right away, instead they waited until they stole cars and charged them with that crime. And even then, it s only two members, when there are more than a hundred others there as well.This insurrection has cost the taxpayers an insane amount of money as well, as federal workers have been put on paid leave until the situation is resolved. The situation isn t any closer to any sort of peaceful resolution than it has been since its inception though; in fact, if anything, it is getting worse. Ammon Bundy and his hillbilly partners in crime are actually planning to completely ignore the government (like they aren t already), and instead set up their own laws on the occupied land. They also reportedly have plans to arrest the Harney County Sheriff. It has even been suggested that they should take on the FBI station that is keeping tabs on them.All of these fools need to be in jail. NOW. This has gone on long enough. They have disrupted the lives of every citizen in the area on an absolutely ridiculous level at this point, and the whole thing should have ended long ago.Featured image via YouTube screen capture",0
8731, Concerned Adult Literally Pays Young Black Kids To Play Inside So Cops Don’t Shoot Them (VIDEO),"An unknown man saw some children playing on the side of a street with toy guns. This normally would be no big deal. It happens all across the nation more times than can be counted every day. However, in this case, the kids and the person talking to them were people of color. That really does change everything.The man approached the kids and pleaded with them to get off the streets and take their toy guns indoors to play with them. He was so concerned that he even offered them money to do it. The reason he was so worried is because he was afraid that the police would come by and shoot them. The man didn t seem to be trying to frighten the children, but when they heard what could happen the look on their faces said it all.Watch the look on the kids  faces when they hear what could happen to them below:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Man Pays Kids To Play With Toy Guns InsideThis is heartbreaking.Posted by The Peak on Wednesday, January 13, 2016What kind of statement does that make about our society? These are two kids who have no malicious intent and were not doing anything wrong, and they could have ended up dead due to aggressive police. White kids run around with toy guns constantly in America. Yes, it is possible that a cop might arrest or shoot a white kid with a toy gun, but we know that a cop will arrest or shoot a black kid with a toy gun. Tamir Rice is a perfect example of the  kill first, ask questions later  attitude that police have adopted towards people of color. Tamir was only 12 years old, but police shot him dead in under 5 seconds of arriving on the scene where he was playing with a toy gun. They didn t even pause to evaluate the situation. It is so bad that just walking down the street is enough to be shot 16 times if you are not white, in the case of LaQuan McDonald.It s great if this adult s intervention helped these kids on this day to keep them safe, but this is not the state in which we should make them have to live. Instead of them being required to lives in a way to be more compatible with raging, predator cops, how about we force our police to remember what protect and serve actually means.featured image via video screen capture",0
8732, Karma’s Latest Victim: Birthers Drag Ted Cruz To Court To Challenge His Eligibility For Presidency,"They say karma s a bi*ch, and it continues to be for the Republicans. First, it was Rubio who was dragged off to court by the birthers who claim that he s not eligible to be president. Now, birthers have gone after Ted Cruz in Texas.A Texas attorney has filed suit in federal district court saying that Cruz can t be president because he s not a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Cruz was born in Canada. One of the few requirements to become president in the U.S. Constitution is to be a  natural born citizen  of the United States. Attorney Newton B. Schwartz, Sr.. in a 28 page complaint, is demanding that the U.S. Supreme Court address the issue since  natural born  has never been defined. Schwartz said:  This 229-year question has never been pled, presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. Only the U.S. Supreme Court can finally decide, determine judicially and settle this issue now. Cruz, who ironically is an anti-immigration hawk, believes there is no issue. During Thursday s debate, Cruz went on the defensive against Trump, who s been at the forefront of questioning Cruz s eligibility. Cruz said:  There s nothing to this birther issue. Since September, the Constitution hasn t changed. But the poll numbers have. I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law are really clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen abroad is a natural born citizen. Not so simple says respected constitutional lawyer Mary Brigid McManamon at Widener University s Delaware Law School: The Constitution provides that  No person except a natural born Citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.  The concept of  natural born  comes from common law, and it is that law the Supreme Court has said we must turn to for the concept s definition. On this subject, common law is clear and unambiguous. The 18th-century English jurist William Blackstone, the preeminent authority on it, declared natural-born citizens are  such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England  while aliens are  such as are born out of it.  The key to this division is the assumption of allegiance to one s country of birth. The Americans who drafted the Constitution adopted this principle for the United States. James Madison, known as the  father of the Constitution,  stated,  It is an established maxim that birth is a criterion of allegiance. . . . [And] place is the most certain criterion; it is what applies in the United States.' Based on this interpretation, Cruz is disqualified. The irony in all this is that Cruz supports denying citizenship to children born in the United States, but whose parents are not US citizens.Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured image via Nation of Change",0
8733, Released Emails Show Carly Fiorina Illegally Working With Her Super PAC,"Carly Fiorina is going to be in a world of hurt for this one. Hillary Clinton s email  scandal  or whatever you want to call it, doesn t even come close to what Carly Fiorina and her super PAC have been doing.The International Business Times reported on Friday that they have email evidence proving that Carly for America (Fiorina s super PAC), has been unlawfully coordinating with campaign stops where Carly has been speaking. As everyone knows, it is a direct violation of FEC laws for super PACS to coordinate with campaigns for any reason. Yet, that doesn t appear to have prevented Carly or her super PAC from trying to work around that law.Up until this point, candidates have tried various measures to exploit loopholes in the law, the most popular one being waiting to announce their presidential runs formally in order to finance their campaigns early on. Carly has done this and taken it to the extreme. Her super PAC now handles all the functions at her campaign stops that a campaign normally would. It s practically unheard of. This by itself isn t a violation, though. The New York Times even said Carly s campaign s strategy of posting her schedule online to alert her super PAC of where she ll be giving speeches so that her super PAC can show up and set up shop, has been a brilliant a run around of the law. That way, they can claim they haven t  coordinated.  They can just show up and claim to be independent.New email evidence shows this not to be true. In fact, if anything, Carly s super PAC has even helped organize the events. The International Business Times reviewed a handful of emails between employees at Winthrop University in South Carolina (where Carly had a September event), staff for the Fiorina campaign, and Carly for America. They found that when an employee had trouble getting in touch with Fiorina about correcting details on an Eventbrite website for the event, that employee then decided to reach out directly to Taylor Manson, a super PAC employee, who coincidentally, was also listed as a person of contact on the Eventbrite page. The lines of campaign coordinating are being blurred more and more. I have a few questions about the location. What is the address of the building? Where should people park? Is there handicap parking available? Do y all plan on putting something out to your students to let them know she ll be there? It didn t take long for Manson to receive an advance walkthrough of the event location. While some might claim that it was the university that acted inappropriately, Larry Noble, a former FEC counsel who works for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, says this is evidence that proves that the law has been broken. It s known as an  in-kind contribution,  and super PACs are prohibited from doing so. This fits the larger narrative that the super PAC is basically running the campaign s events. The whole thing frankly makes a mockery of the law. When the super PAC gets there, they hand out flyers, collect voter information, everything campaigns are known for. And   wealthy donors can finance all of it since they can make unlimited contributions to a super PAC but only a few thousand dollars directly to a candidate.That s not the only instance though that will plague Carly s campaign going forward. An event at George Tech last month also appears to be entirely organized by her super PAC, as well, according to emails provided to IBT by the University.Reps for Carly for America have repeatedly stated in the past that the group hasn t coordinated with Fiorina s campaign, but this new information shows otherwise. At the very least, a formal investigation needs to be launched to verify these new allegations. It should be interesting to watch how the Republican party responds to an email scandal that affects their own party, especially when campaign finance laws are being broken. Double standard, perhaps?Featured image via Facebook.",0
8734, ‘Shoot Hillary In The F*ckin Head’: Conservatives Freak Out Over Benghazi Movie,"The new movie about the attack on the U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, is stirring up conservatives and their now legendary hatred of Hillary Clinton.Gawker writer Christopher Hooks went to the premiere of Michael Bay s 13 Hours at the Dallas Cowboys stadium in Arlington, Texas. After interviewing some of the attendees, he came back with a report on the intense Clinton hate that the movie had activated. It wasn t pretty.Certainly, the people who d come to the stadium because they didn t like Clinton felt fired up after seeing it.  She s a piece of shit,  said one man who declined to give his name and didn t make eye contact.  But I already knew she s a piece of shit. I hope it defeats Hillary,  said another, Don Lochran.  They covered the whole thing up.  It was Lochran who then suggested bombing them all.Others were less sanguine.  Oh yeah. I d shoot Hillary Clinton in the fuckin  head. I don t like the bitch at all,  said Len Toomey, who identified himself as a veteran of Desert Storm and Somalia. He d seen the movie with some VFW friends.  Choke her. She should be in the pisser and I should be pissin  on her every night. Whether you back Clinton or not, the abject misogyny and hate that base conservatives have for her is grotesque to behold. About the only thing rivaling it in intensity is their hatred for President Obama.To many factions of the right   and those are often the same people yelling the loudest for Donald Trump s white power presidential campaign   the former Secretary of State and First Lady is the absolute devil incarnate.In this go-around they erroneously believe she and the President left men to die in Benghazi, when in fact real life is NOT like an action movie and forces were constrained by the reality of time and space in how they could respond. Even so, they did eventually get on the scene, something conservatives leave out of their Benghazi storytelling.13 Hours is unlikely to change anyone s minds pro or con with Clinton, but it at least is serving a purpose in once again putting on display just how hateful the right can be without even trying that hard.Featured image via Paramount Pictures",0
8735, Did Hillary Clinton Seriously Criticize Bernie Sanders’ Grandchildren? (VIDEO),"The short answer? I don t think so, but it s possible.The other day on Morning Joe, the Democratic presidential frontrunner said the following during a phone-in interview with the MSNBC morning show hosts: I guess at the end of the day, for me   you know, people talk about their extraordinary grandchildren, but I actually have one   and we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities. And we re going to do everything we can to give her opportunities. But it s not enough.And I think too many people are forgetting what are some of the biggest determinants as to what happens to your children and grandchildren. The first being what kind of country we are and whether we re still providing the opportunities to realize your promise and potential and what kind of world s going to be out there waiting.And I feel passionately that just because we had it in the past, doesn t mean we re going to keep it in the future. You shouldn t have to be the granddaughter of a former president to have your American Dream realized. I think every kid should have a chance to live up to her god-given potential. A debate has erupted online in which Bernie Sanders supporters are suggesting that Clinton s remarks about how she actually has a grandchild is a not-so-subtle jab at the fact that Sanders has seven grandchildren through his current wife of 27 years, Jane O Meara Sanders, whose three children were from her previous marriage.To be clear, Clinton launched into a long answer to a question from Mika Brzezinski that began with something about the contrast between her and the other Democratic  candidates  plural. But there was a long section preceding her grandchildren remarks about what she intends to do and what her qualifications are. Then the thing about the grandkids. So, there wasn t an explicitly Sanders-oriented context for her remarks.But if this was, in fact, a cut at Sanders, it s confounding as to why she would make such an esoteric remark. What does she gain with Democratic voters by implying that her grandchild is legitimate, while Sanders  grandchildren somehow aren t? I mean, how many primary voters know that much about Sanders  family? I ve been following Sanders  career for ten years now, and I had no idea he was even married until recently much less that he had three step-kids and seven step-grandchildren. I also didn t know until today that three of his grandkids were adopted from China.One blogger, Shane Ryan, observed that Sanders, during his stump speeches, often refers to his grandkids as  extraordinary.  I tried to confirm this, but didn t turn up any transcripts or pullquotes to verify it. So, chances are   if true   very, very, very few people know that Sanders uses the word  extraordinary  to describe his grandkids, making Clinton s jab   if intentional   even more obscure.Is Clinton capable of lashing out when backed into a corner? Sure. Is it possible she intended to randomly criticize Sanders  grandkids via some sort of twisted political calculation? Absolutely. But it d be terrible politics. You don t mention families   much less criticize the origins of an opponent s children. The topic is off limits. By doing so, she d only make herself look like terrible human being.One thing enemies and fans alike can agree upon: she s smart enough and experienced enough to understand blowback. Seriously, what kind of Democratic primary voter would  get  her attack and then vote against Sanders because his seven grandkids aren t biological, while Clinton s grandchild is blood-related? It seems like there s more risk than reward in such a gambit.So  what do you think?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0iaI3YRCiw] Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8736, Watch Carly Fiorina Lose Her Damn Mind As She Keeps Shouting And Repeating Herself (VIDEO),"One really has to wonder why Carly Fiorina is still running for president. She s a failed CEO, a failed senate candidate, and seemingly just an awful human being. People haven t been drawn to her as a candidate, so much so, in fact, that s she s been booted down to the undercard junior debate, which is basically just a pity party for people who haven t realized no one likes them yet. All the candidates in the junior debate really should realize they, in no way, have a shot at winning, do themselves and the rest of the nation a favor, and drop out.However, there they still are. They re still there saying the stupid things that have made them unpopular in the first place, and clearly showing America why they shouldn t be in any sort of leadership role.During the most recent junior debate, Carly Fiorina decided that she would attack Hillary Clinton s marriage with former President Bill Clinton. She said: Unlike another woman in this race, I actually love spending time with my husband. That s a pretty awful and unnecessary thing to say about another candidate, and just seems like a pathetic, weird attempt at trying to diminish Hillary.Noticing this bizarre statement by Fiorina was MSNBC s Chris Matthews, and he held Fiorina to task asking her to explain herself. Matthews asked Fiorina if she thinks the Clintons have a  real marriage.  And every time Matthews tried to get her to answer, the failed HP head would reply, and awkwardly repeat: They ve been married for a really long time. Then, Fiorina lost her damn mind and launched a verbal assault on the MSNBC host: There are so many other things we could talk about like the fact that Mrs. Clinton wants to go to the White House   she s qualified for the big house  She should be prosecuted. She has not been prosecuted for things that took a great warrior out of office, David Petraeus So let s talk about that, Chris. Let s talk about how amazing it is that this woman, that cannot be trusted, who should have been prosecuted by now, has just raked in more money than any single candidate. Wow, bitter, party of one.Actually, Carly, if you re going to talk about a woman who has done horrible things in her past, let s talk about all the jobs you shipped overseas. Let s talk about how you took a once thriving company and lead it down the sh*tter. How about that? Let s not hyperbolize and make false accusations against Hillary Clinton, all while throwing some backhanded jab at her marriage. That makes you look no better than the mean girl in Middle School who is pissed she got picked last for dodgeball. Grow up, and while you re at it, drop out. .@CarlyFiorina and @hardball_chris get into a testy exchange over @HillaryClinton. https://t.co/NsOHREczLI  MSNBC (@MSNBC) January 15, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",0
8737," MI Gov. Dick Sends SEVEN National Guardsman To Help 100,000 Flint Residents","Earlier this week, as public outrage and media attention focused on his failed response to the Flint water disaster, Michigan s republican governor announced that he was calling in the National Guard to help deal with the escalating crisis.On January 13, those troops arrived in the city of 100,000 people. All SEVEN of them. Yes, seven. As in one less than eight.Doing the math, Snyder s response equates to one guardsman per 14,285.7 people.The city of Flint is experiencing a crisis of epic proportions, thanks entirely to the Snyder administration. Water poisoned with lead, and water that is potentially contaminated with the Legionella bacteria (which has already caused 87 serious illnesses and ten deaths) is just one aspect of what is happening in Flint.After the governor and his appointed emergency managers switched the city s water supply to the Flint River, they decided not to bother to treat it with standard corrosion control measures.According to researchers from Virginia Tech University, Flint is the only city in the U.S. that did not have these measures in place.As Marc Edwards of the Virginia Tech water study described to Michigan Radio back in October: What we discovered to our shock was that they switched to a new water source that was obviously very corrosive, meaning it would eat up the lead pipe and iron pipe and essentially put the metals into the water, without controlling the corrosion. And this is a horrible idea in a city full of lead plumbing and lead pipe like Flint. He went on to describe the standard practice for changing a water source. Before you switch to a new water source, six months to a year ahead of time, you are supposed to do laboratory experiments to determine the corrosivity of the water, and the chemistry   the pH, the alkalinity, and the phosphate that you need to make sure that the lead stays on the pipes and out of the water. Edwards explains that Flint s new water system had to have a  corrosion control  plan in place, otherwise the result is that you re  doing an uncontrolled human experiment on a city s population. The decision by Rick Snyder s emergency manager to just skip what was apparently viewed as an  unnecessary  corrosion control expense has basically been just that.  An uncontrolled experiment on a city s population. The amount of damage done to the city s infrastructure is just beginning to be realized.This photo from Flint Water Study researchers Ni Zhu and Siddhartha Roy shows the magnitude of the situtuation.Image credit: Flint Water StudyAccording to a new report released today, researchers believe that the damaged and corroded pipes that are transmitting water throughout the city are likely to become a breeding ground for bacteria, such as the Legionella bacteria which causes Legionaire s disease, along with a host of other potential pathogens.Because of the nature of the Legionella bacteria, which is transmitted through tiny droplets of water in the air, Virginia Tech researchers are recommending that vulnerable populations have minimal contact with the water. That includes people who smoke, the elderly, people with diabetes, people who have recently had surgery and others who might be at greater risk of contracting a waterborne respiratory disease.About 100,000 Flint residents are affected by this unmitigated disaster.In response, Governor Snyder put on a big show of  sending in the National Guard.  Now we know that only SEVEN guardsmen were actually dispatched to the city.After being forced to respond to questions regarding the number of guardsmen he sent to the city, the governor s office proclaimed that there could be as many as 30 or 40 National Guardsmen sent to Flint by the end of the week.During his PR conference on Tuesday, Snyder told the people of Michigan  As we work to ensure that all Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water, we are providing them with the direct assistance they need in order to stretch our resources further. The Michigan National Guard is trained and ready to assist the citizens of Flint. He neglected to mention that he was sending SEVEN guardsmen.As reported by Fox 2: The Governor s rhetoric is not doing much to quiet the growing fury in Flint. Gov. Rick Snyder called in the National Guard to assist those helping to get bottled water and filters to the people of Flint. Just seven members of the National Guard showed up to help the nearly 100,000 people in Flint. Watch this video on Governor Snyder s pathetic response to the Flint water disaster, via Fox 2.

U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell will temporarily cease giving out permits to new coal mining leases on federal land. This pause will take place while the federal government s coal program is brought under review. It has been about thirty years since major changes were made to the program. How do we manage the program that is consistent with our climate change objective? There is no short answer,  Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said during a news conference.  It is also clear that we need to take into account the science we have now on the environment and climate change. There is no certainty to how long this leasing pause lasts. Reuters reports that it could last as long as three years. This is not good news to the coal industry, which has been in substantial decline for the past few years. Due to a combination of regulations, and competition from other fuel sources, such as natural gas and the massive cost decrease in solar, and the hard work of climate activists, big coal has been forced to survive by exporting coal. We have an obligation to current and future generations to ensure the federal coal program delivers a fair return to American taxpayers and takes into account its impacts on climate change,  Jewell said.What does this mean for the climate? According to Climate Central, this is big deal. They report that: About 40 percent of all the coal produced in the U.S. comes from mines on federal public lands, mainly in the West. As of the end of 2014, there were 308 active coal mining leases on more than 464,000 acres of public lands in Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Montana and Colorado, with an additional 10,500 acres in Kentucky, Alabama and West Virginia.Burning coal and other fossil fuels for electricity is the largest single source of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, accounting for about 31 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gases. Now of course, without congressional action, an incoming President could end this pause. But a Republican victory seems unlikely, and the Democratic candidates do not have a lot of love for big coal. Bernie Sanders has pledged to halt all new federal leases for fossil fuel mega projects. Sanders could do this without the need of approval from Congress. A move like that would be a giant victory for the planet and all the people who live in it.Featured Image Credit: By The Official White House Photostream (P060809PS-0350) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons",0
8739, Rhode Island Official Dresses Middle Aged Man As Little Old Lady For Senior Citizen Photo Op,"A Rhode Island city official has resigned after she was caught dressing up a male middle aged bus driver as a little old lady to  prove  how well her snow shoveling program was helping senior citizens.Apparently unable to find a single real senior citizen to fill out her press conference, director of senior services Sue Stenhouse got a man who worked at a nearby senior home to don a wig, earrings, lipstick, and a dress to stand next to her while she bragged about the program. Let s just say it was not an effective disguise.Almost immediately, reporters began to question the ridiculous situation, but the sheer audacity of the stunt was such that initially no one called out Stenhouse or the  woman.  It was only later that things began to fall apart.When NBC affiliate WJAR-TV reported on the bizarre story, Stenhouse grew angry. I ve been in a meeting all night being a great public servant for the city of Warwick,  Stenhouse said.  Now, I get this (expletive.) And you guys did not reach out to me. And that was a big lie on the news. However, just a few days later she was turning in her resignation letter.There are, of course, a lot of questions that remain unanswered. Why didn t the officials simply ask a resident from the senior home they were standing in front of to join them for the presser? Why did they need an elderly woman to be in the shot in the first place? What was she thinking? And did Stenhouse get the idea from Mrs. Doubtfire or a Chris Farley sketch?It s difficult to fathom why Stenhouse, who by all accounts had a long and promising career in Rhode Island politics ahead of her, would torpedo her chances on something so monumentally silly. A few of her colleagues expressed shock and alleged deceit when asked to comment on the incident.One theory that seems plausible is that Stenhouse s snow removal initiative was struggling thanks to a mild winter. While not her fault, the lack of bad weather meant holding a press conference to brag about snow plowing was going to go down in flames. What followed was a series of desperate decisions worthy of a sit-com. According to witnesses, city officials had snow shipped to the front of the senior center and dumped in the background of the press conference. The bus driver-turned-old woman was just an extension to an already completely fabricated situation. Whats one more lie, and a little lipstick, after all?Featured image via Mashable",0
8740, Bill O’Reilly: I’ll Flee The Country If Sanders Is Elected President (VIDEO),"Fox News blowhard Bill O Reilly really doesn t want the future to give us a President Bernie Sanders. That s no surprise; after all, O Reilly is obviously as far right as Sanders is left. However, O Reilly has taken his fear of another left-winger as president to a whole other level. In fact, he says that if Sanders gets in, he ll move to Ireland.On a recent edition of the O Reilly Factor, the bloviating talking head said that things would be even worse than they are under President Obama, because Sanders would take all of Obama s policies and amp them up. He says that Sanders would  dismantle  current social programs, specifically Obamacare  in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.  That s when he said he ll be leaving the United States if forced to live under such rule. And you know, look, I m fleeing. If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I m fleeing. I m going to Ireland. And they already know it. I shouldn t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes. But I m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I m sorry. I m not doing it. Well, I got news for ya, Bill-O. Look at the clown car that makes up your side of the aisle. It s gonna be either Bernie or Hillary for the next eight years, if the good people of this nation have any sense at all. So, you better be packing your bags and getting your affairs in order. Go ahead, leave. One less right-wing talking head stoking fear and hate in the minds of ignorant viewers.Watch the comments below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8741, The Head Of The NRA Just Issued The Dumbest Challenge Ever To President Obama (VIDEO),"Wayne LaPierre has a way about him that defines  a**hole.  maybe it s the condescending look his beady little eyes get from behind those frameless glasses. Maybe it s the tone in his voice as he declares that the tens of thousands of U.S. gun deaths since his tenure began have nothing to do with guns.Or maybe we all remember his impassioned call for more guns in our schools after 20 1st graders were gunned down on one of the coldest days in American history.No matter the reason you may despise Wayne LaPierre, the fact remains the he is despicable. He s a disgusting human being whose moral code has been lost to the cold hard cash of the gun manufacturers who want as many guns as possible in the hands of whoever has the money to buy one.Understanding all of that, this video will enrage you. LaPierre has decided to challenge President Obama to a one-on-one gun control debate. His terms are that the debate be one hour with a moderator, no pre-screened questions and no long answers.It s difficult for the ammosexual mind to come up with much other than  criminals won t follow laws,  so the last stipulation isn t really that surprising. He may want to consult with Taya Kyle before he assumes that the president isn t willing to answer tough questions from the opposition.Rather than simply issue the challenge, LaPierre attached it to 8 minutes of propaganda attacking not only the president s stance on gun control but also the affordable care act and yes, you guessed it Benghazi. He calls the president a tyrant who ignores the constitution just before he calls on him to mobilize a national force to  turn Chicago upside down  in search of felons and criminals with guns.Because sending the National Guard to black communities to illegally search the residents and their homes without warrants or probable cause is just fine, but asking  law-abiding  white folks to fill out a form and wait ten minutes is an egregious act of tyranny.The entire video is nothing but a propaganda piece aimed at keeping the far-right extremists mobilized and ready to do things like occupy the Oregon wilderness in the name of  Murica or shoot up a Planned Parenthoood office in the name of life. In the very least he wants the status quo conservative argument of fear for your guns to weigh on the minds of every idiot who believes their firearm is the most important thing in their lives.You can watch the ridiculous challenge and the bloviating blowhard who issued it in the video below.

8742, Mike Huckabee Thinks Poor Americans Benefit From Treating Them Like We ‘Train Dogs’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee, in predictable conservative fashion, has just said something extremely offensive about people who aren t wealthy white men like him.During Thursday night s GOP undercard debate, Huckabee stated that it was only  common sense  to treat poor people with the same punishment/reward techniques that people use to  train dogs  if we want to improve the economy. Huckabee claimed that because  the tax system punishes them,  the current system made it impossible for Americans to really get ahead. He said: If you work really hard and you start moving up the economic ladder, you get bumped into a different tax bracket so the government thinks it deserves more of your hard work than you do. It s time for something big. As an alternative, the former governor of Arkansas suggested the  Fair Tax  plan, which would enforce a national flat sales tax of 10 percent. It s built on the common sense with which we raised our kids and train dogs. You reward behavior you want more of. And you punish behavior you want less of. That s how I raise kids, it s how I trained our dogs. And folks, it s not that difficult. Even if you remove all offensiveness and privilege from Huckabee s suggestion that poor taxpayers should be treated with the same systems we use to train our pet dogs, Huckabee s 10 percent tax suggestion is still an awful one. Last year, the Tax Policy Center put the theory to the test and determined that Huckabee s proposed alternative would actually be more detrimental and punish the nation s poorest Americans (no surprise there). The Tax Policy Center observed: The problem is that very high-income households spend only a fraction of their income, while low- and middle-income people spend all or most of what they make. A sales tax, by design, exempts a large share of income at the top. If it includes a prebate to protect people at the bottom and doesn t add to the deficit, then it must raise taxes on people in the middle. Here s the debate footage where Huckabee talks about treating poor people like dogs:Huckabee s attitude toward poor people echoes the rest of the GOP s line of thinking. Struggling Americans are nothing to the Republican Party, and are often looked over and cast aside. If you learned anything from last night s Republican presidential debate, it s that the GOP candidates only have certain interests at heart: their own.Featured image is a screenshot",0
8743, Bush Once Apologized To China In Order To Free 24 Detained U.S. Soldiers: America ‘Is Very Sorry’,"To hear conservatives, including those in the Republican presidential race, tell it, President Obama made America look weak by talking to Iran in order to get 10 detained U.S. sailors, rather than, say, immediately ordering carpet bombing of Tehran. Some right-wing media outlets were even more despondent. Breitbart, America s preeminent dumping ground of right-wing hysteria, devoted several articles to framing the incident as a humiliation for Obama.However, as much as conservatives would love to have this story be about Obama s weakness, the facts simply do not support that conclusion.For one thing, the entire duration was less than 24 hours. U.S. sailors had a GPS malfunction near the border of Iran. When they floated into that country s sovereign territory, they were picked up by Iranian military ships. By all accounts, they were treated well during their  captivity.  Secretary of State John Kerry worked tirelessly with the Iranian government, who sent them back with their boats the next day. No missiles were launched. No wars were started. No lives were lost.Getting no bloodshed, a perversely disappointed Republican Party were left instead to squabble over the details. At issue was whether Obama  apologized  to Iran for encroaching into their territory. This, Republicans said, was a serious blow to America s reputation. According to these warmongering blowhards, to apologize is to surrender.There are just two problems with this narrative: First, the Obama administration never apologized to Iran. And secondly, back in 2001, George W. Bush absolutely did apologize to another of America s economic foes, China, when he was faced with a similar situation. Nobody thought offering an apology was a sign of America s crumbling power when Bush did so.In April of 2001, 24 US Air Force members were  captured  by the Chinese government after crashing on a Chinese island. It was, without a doubt, a colossal screw up. America had been flying spy planes into China s territory, and one of those spy missions wound up crashing into a Chinese plane, killing the pilot. For 11 days, the U.S. soldiers were held in China while diplomats from both countries scrambled to figure out what to do. But then George W. Bush said he was sorry.The letter delivered today to China s foreign ministry by the US ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said Mr Bush and the secretary of state, Colin Powell, expressed  sincere regret  over the loss of the Chinese plane and the missing pilot, Mr Wang. Please convey to the Chinese people to the family of pilot Wang Wei that we are very sorry for their loss,  said the letter.The document letter appeared to be a complex linguistic compromise.A Chinese-language copy of the letter released by the US embassy did not use the term Chinese officials had insisted on    daoqian , a formal apology that admits blame.Even worse   if you re a writer for Breitbart   Bush went on to apologize for entering Chinese airspace. The same might be expected of Obama when two of America s ships entered Iranian waters.We are very sorry the entering of China s airspace and the landing did not have verbal clearance, but very pleased the crew landed safely. We appreciate China s efforts to see to the well-being of our crew.While the situation was extremely tense at the time, and although the Bush administration was reluctant to say  I m sorry,  they eventually backed down. (Note: The Bush administration would go on to repeatedly insist this apology was not an apology. Take that for what it s worth.) America didn t become the laughingstock of the world. Nobody felt like anyone had lost any respect. Instead, the two sides moved on. The American soldiers got to return home unharmed.As we ve seen time and again, the Republican Party, infuriated that they have no legs to stand on in complaining about Obama, create mountains out of molehills. A diplomatic issue that could have led to a very bad situation for 10 U.S. service members was resolved in less than 24 hours by two governments which strongly dislike each other and conservatives think that s what losing looks like. Are they crazy? No. Just extremely disingenuous.Or as the saying goes: There are lies, damned lies, and the right-wing media. Up is down. Cold is hot. And 10 soldiers getting to come home to their families safely is a  loss.  George W. Bush might want to have a talk with his colleagues.Featured image via Flickr",0
8744, WATCH: Trevor Noah Notices Something Oddly Familiar About The Flint Water Crisis (VIDEO),"On Friday, The Daily Show did a segment on the Flint Water crisis. During the segment, host Trevor Noah began the segment by offering this bit of advice,  I have a very simple rule in rule If the water s brown than me, I don t drink it. In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system.Noah noticed that the problem with Flint s water is so bad, that it reminded him of the ads that charities run, that try to raise money for people in Africa. A hundred dollars a day? Why didn t you say something? I want to call out to all my people in Africa right now watching The Daily Show. Because my friends: for only a hundred dollars a day, we can save a village in America and get these people drinking the water that they so badly need. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.Republican policies have officially destroyed an entire city s water infrastructure, making Flint resemble a third world nation when it comes to infrastructure. For so called  fiscal conservatives  the policies that led to the Flint water crisis are born out of the same values that most Republicans hold dear. Cut spending, at all costs. It doesn t matter if any entire city is poisoned. In their view, a pound of cure is worth more than an ounce of prevention.You can watch the segment below, in full.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveFeatured Image Credit: Screenshot via Comedy Central",0
8745, The NY Daily News Has Just LITERALLY Told Ted Cruz To F*ck Off For Trashing NYC Values (IMAGE),"If there s one thing you never do in life, it s piss off a New Yorker. If there s one thing you really never do in life, it s make fun of New York City on national television telling a city of millions, a city where liberty literally stands, that it has bad values.Well, Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz has now done both of those things, and needless to say, the city is pretty damn pissed. During the recent GOP debate, Cruz, tried to insult Trump by bashing  New York values.  He said: Donald comes from New York and he embodies New York values Everybody understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal and pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage. And focus on money and the media. Donald Trump then turned to Cruz and promptly ripped the a**hole to shreds for such a blatantly horrific remark.Trump wasn t they only one upset, here is the latest New York Daily News cover: Stop the presses! A new Page 1  DROP DEAD, TED: https://t.co/68hKgqmjBx pic.twitter.com/veDsxLYDTN  New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) January 15, 2016The NY Daily News, alongside the Statue of Liberty offering the candidate the universal symbol for  f*ck off,  has instructed the Canadian-born Cruz to go back to Canada.Cruz, in his lame attempt to appeal to rural folks who are scared of the big, bad city, because people other than just folks who think like them live there, has now stepped in a monumental pile of sh*t made of his own word vomit.If Cruz needs a reminder of  New York values  let s give one to him.New York values embody a city that never sleeps, one that is always there, always vibrant, and always willing to take on the world, literally, it s where the UN is and where the Statue of Liberty stands. The statue that embraces all. A statue that is the very embodiment of the United States of America.New York is a city that has some of the most prestigious colleges, the best theater and art, and is home to millions of people who come from every corner of the earth.New York is a city, that when attacked in the worst domestic terror attack in the history of the nation, stood together, stood strong, never gave up on one another, and citizens literally gave their lives to save one another.THOSE are New York values, and for Cruz to trash New York City, he s showing himself as the un-American, horrible person that he truly is. Way to let your smarmy true colors shine, Ted.Featured image: Twitter",0
8746, RNC Leader’s Backstage Rant Shows What The GOP Really Thinks Of Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Footage has been released of a leader of the Republican National Committee ranting for a full five minutes about the need for a rebellion against Presidential candidates like Donald Trump. The video serves as evidence that it s not just liberals who know that conservatives are going to lose in 2016 with extremists like Trump on the ticket.The star of the footage   Holland Redfield, who represents the U.S. Virgin Islands   uses some rather colorful language in his incitement against the likes of trust fund tycoon Donald Trump. If I didn t say this, I d go home very troubled.  Redfield tells the audience of the private, RNC Winter Meeting. When we have allowed the party to be representing a tremendous amount of anger we are playing a very dangerous game.Does the tail wag the dog, or does the dog wag the tail? He rails against the gutter-level language being used by candidates like Trump and others, and the  disrespect  for ethnic minorities which risks making the party unelectable to Americans who aren t white. Not only is this morally reprehensible, but it s electoral suicide in a rainbow nation.And what happens when a party member voices concerns about these issues? Redfield argues that  we re almost terrorized as members of our party.  Shut up. Toe the line, embrace each other, and let s go forward. Redfield refuses to name Trump because he fears:  I will be targeted. It is likely Redfield speaks for a sea of moderate conservatives across the United States who cease to feel represented by a party which has been seized by Christian and right-wing extremists. These moderate conservatives might well be forced into the position of voting Democrat in 2016, or abstaining altogether, with the absence of a GOP candidate who speaks to their vision of America. The Eisenhower Republicans, who aren t afraid to invest public money to make America a world leader in education, science, technology and engineering; who would rather the U.S. spent a little less on engaging in permanent war overseas, and a little more on roads, schools, and hospitals at home. How could they ever vote for a Trump, or a Ted Cruz?This video of this desperate plea for a new direction by this lone RNC leader speaks to the bigger crisis for conservatives in America. The religious right has pulled the entire party off it s axis, and is speaking to an ever smaller, echo chamber of extreme conservatism. In doing so, they are doing the job of putting a Democrat in the White House in 2016 all by themselves.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",0
8747," U.S. Air Force Advertises Martin Luther King Day ‘Fun Shoot’ Event, Claims It Was An ‘Honest Mistake’","Put this one under  Shit You Just Can t Make Up :A U.S. Air Force base in Georgia was forced to pull a flyer advertising a Martin Luther King Jr. Day  fun shoot  after public outcry, reports WMAZ.The flyer   featuring the face of the civil rights icon   promoted a noon gathering on Jan. 18 for the Robins Air Force Base Trap and Skeet Club, where participants would get two rounds of shooting and lunch for $20. Air Force officials pulled this provocative MLK Day  Fun Shoot  flyer: https://t.co/F65HoNYfwu #gapol pic.twitter.com/trss95PIcJ  Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) January 14, 2016 Officials at the base insist that the whole thing was just an honest mistake and, aw shucks, they didn t mean nothin  by it! They were just some good ol  boys never meanin  no harm. The official apology cleared the whole thing up: We realized the inappropriateness of the advertisement several days ago and immediately began removing the flyer. There was no malice of forethought in the flyer s creation and it was never the base s intention to portray Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a negative light,   It continued.  It was an honest mistake, to which we ve personally counseled the parties involved and will provide them with remedial training and appropriate oversight to prevent this sort of inattention from occurring in the future. If it was a state less prone to overwhelming racism, the apology might be believable. But this was Georgia. And it was the Air Force, the branch of the military most heavily infested with Christian extremism. If you weren t aware of it, the Christian Right has been trying to turn the United States military into a religious institution for decades. They ve had the most success in the Air Force so far.Unsurprisingly, where there is Christian extremism, there s systemic racism as well. So, keeping these facts in mind, the MLK Jr.  Fun Shoot  starts to take on a much more ominous tone. Context is everything.Featured image via screencap.",0
8748, The Winner Of The GOP Debate Is…Bernie Sanders (AGAIN),"If a debate is won according to who generates the most buzz, Bernie Sanders has once again kicked Republican ass on twitter. According The Hill,  Sanders had two of the most retweeted tweets during the debate with a pair touting his position in polls and going after GOP front-runner Donald Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. Both got more than 5,000 retweets. The Republicans seem to think they could beat our campaign. They haven t seen the polls. #GOPDebatepic.twitter.com/XitW9T28Vq  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 15, 2016I love the little frowning Republican faces; they so perfectly capture the frustration they must be feeling at losing in the polls, badly, to a *GASP* Socialist! Republicans are, of course, all for socialism but only as long as it s the rich that benefit and not all of the dirty lower classes that Bernie represents. Privatize the rewards, socialize the cost. It s the American way.Sanders also hit Trump over his naked appeals to racism and bigotry:I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we re not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together. #GOPDebate  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 15, 2016The problem with running on hate is that it only gets you so far. Once you get past the angry white old person demographic, no one else is interested.But what makes it even more remarkable that Sanders continues to outshine Republicans on twitter during their own debate is that Sanders only has 1.14 million followers compared to Trump s 5.69 million. Although if we follow Trump s track record, there s a good chance a lot of those are paid for followers. I have a hard time believing that the average Trump supporter is smart enough to turn on a computer, much less use social media.While Trump did pick up more new followers than Sanders during the debate, that s of little comfort to the Republican Party. They may fear a Sanders presidency, but they fear a Trump presidency even more. Sanders will move the country to a place where the rich won t be AS rich and everyone else will get richer. Trump will turn America into the laughingstock of the world and cost Corporate America far more money than that dastardly Socialist Sanders ever could.Faced with that kind of choice, Republicans may not have a choice but to go all in for Bernie.Featured image via twitter",0
8749, Obama Just Did Something Awesome On National TV That No President EVER Did Before (VIDEO),"President Obama has done something that no other President has ever done on national television, and it s going to drive every Conservative in the country nuts.

8750, Obama’s Epic Win Vs Ebola The Media Never Told You About (IMAGE),"The world is now reporting zero cases of ebola, the deadly virus that killed thousands in Africa. That good news comes after a sustained global relief effort led by President Obama and the American military, scientists and relief workers.President Obama marked the occasion in a Twitter post, pointing out that the moment is a  Great example of what we can achieve when we lead. Before I start, wanted to share this. Liberia is now Ebola-free. Great example of what we can achieve when we lead. pic.twitter.com/qjVcwg8tIi  President Obama (@POTUS) January 14, 2016From the World Health Organization report cited by the President:No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 3 January. On 29 December, WHO declared that human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus has ended in Guinea, after the completion of 42 days with zero cases since the last person confirmed to have EVD received a second consecutive negative blood test for Ebola virus RNA. Guinea has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have all now succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission linked to the original outbreak in West Africa.Yet Obama had to swim against the tide of right-wing scaremongering and media sensationalism in order to accomplish this vital task.In September 2014, Obama deployed 3,000 American troops to West Africa to help with efforts there to fight the spread of the disease. He also appointed an  Ebola czar  to coordinate the response, along with existing leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and other elements of the U.S. government.As Obama did this, the right was in the middle of hysterics. They were calling for the borders to be shut down, Chris Christie was unnecessarily quarantining a nurse, and Fox News figures were seriously claiming that Obama wanted an Ebola outbreak in America. Another Fox News talking head said Obama welcomed Ebola because his  affinities  are with Africa.At the same time, the more mainstream press was whipping itself into a frenzy, devoting hours and hours to what should be done if there was an Ebola outbreak in America despite the hundreds of safeguards in place from medical professionals. CNN hyped the non-problem more than even MSNBC and Fox.Curiously, this mainstream Ebola hype consisted of about 1,000 segments in the four weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, when Republicans were often campaigning on Ebola hype against Democrats, then fell off after the GOP increased its Congressional seats. Convenient.Still, President Obama refused to give into the fear and frankly hysterically overwrought madness embraced by the right and the media. As a result, a killer outbreak is in full retreat. Ebola hasn t been eradicated, but in all likelihood this latest outbreak is over   and Barack Obama stepped up to the plate and led yet another successful fight.Featured image via YouTube",0
8751, The Lying B**tard Behind The Fake Planned Parenthood Videos Gets Slapped With Federal Lawsuit,"David Daleiden, the mastermind behind the debunked and now possibly criminal Planned Parenthood videos, got slapped with a federal lawsuit [PDF] by Planned Parenthood this Thursday in San Francisco.The lawsuit includes compensatory and punitive damages for what Planned Parenthood has suffered since the video release, as well as attorney fees. Beth Parker, a Planned Parenthood lawyer, did not comment on how much money would be sought but indicated that the amount would include extra money spent since the release of the videos for increased clinic security.Daleiden and his organization, the Center For Medical Progress, are responsible for publishing completely fake videos that suggest Planned Parenthood illegally sells fetal body parts for cash. The videos provided a mountain of fodder for Republican outrage in 2015, resulting in wasted hearings, time, and money. There have also been some accusations that the videos causing increased violence at Planned Parenthood clinics, and a mass shooting.The lawsuit accused the Center For Medical Progress and a fake company called  Biomax  of violating the RICO Act, committing fraud, invasion of privacy, illegal recording and trespassing. David Daleiden, Troy Newman, and a group of other individuals used forged government ID s to gain entry to private conferences where they secretly recorded conversations with Planned Parenthood employees. Afterward, the group took the recorded conversations, cut and combined them together out of context with fake footage to make the now infamous videos.David Daleiden was completely unrepentant, calling the lawsuit  frivolous.  In an email he gave the following statement:My response is: Game on. I look forward to deposing all the CEOs, medical directors, and their co-conspirators who participated in Planned Parenthood s illegal baby body parts racket.Source: ABC NewsYou have to ask the question. Does Daleiden actually believe what he made is real or is he being intentionally obstinant at this point? He already was forced to admit that he was lying on live tv. How much deeper in denial can he possibly go?Daleiden continued on to say that Planned Parenthood is currently under investigation by multiple law enforcement agencies and the U.S. Congress, implying that this would reveal some truth about the matter. Currently, Planned Parenthood is under no investigation by any law enforcement agencies. However, Daleiden is now officially unable to say the same thing about both his organization, and himself.featured image via youtube screen capture",0
8752, Republican Debate Screeches To A Halt After Trump Goes Birther On Cruz (VIDEO),"Fox Business held their second Republican debate, and things went off the rails almost immediately.Just a half hour in, Donald Trump was asked to address the comments he made alleging that fellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz was not legally allowed to run for president because he was born in Canada. Cruz defended his eligibility by pointing out that the Constitutional requirement to run for president has always been interpreted to mean children of American citizens born in foreign countries were considered U.S. citizens just like anyone else. In one of the biggest burns of the night, Cruz went a step further by pointing out that some of the more  extreme  birther theories that Trump s fans support hold that not only does a child need to be born in the United States, but both parents need to be born in the country as well. By that logic, Cruz said, Donald Trump would be disqualified himself, because his mother was born in Scotland.Trump was not happy.Feigning concern for Cruz, Trump claims that if he were to choose Cruz as his vice presidential candidate, the Democrats would  sue, because we can t take him along for the ride.  Trump later claimed that if Cruz were to win the presidency, he would possibly face being kicked after a lawsuit over his eligibility. The entire auditorium was booing, but the jeers had been going on so long it was impossible to tell if they were meant for Trump, Cruz, or for the painful death of brain cells happening to everyone watching.By this point, the Republican Debate had come to a complete standstill. No questions were being asked. No other candidates were allowed to speak. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two front-runners, were arguing on national television about birther conspiracy theories. As far as television goes, it was entertaining stuff. As far as the fate of the country goes, it was chilling.Watch the surreal fight below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9L-prXogME]Feature image via screengrab",0
8753," Yes, Rick Santorum Asked People To ‘Google’ Him Despite The Frothy Definition Of His Name (TWEETS)","During Thursday night s undercard debate on Fox Business Channel, candidate Rick Santorum, who s somehow still in the race, asked viewers for a very special favor.The former Pennsylvania senator said,  Go and Google Rick Santorum and Hillary Clinton. You ll see a five-minute debate. I ll let you decide who won the debate.  He continued,  I ll tell you who won, I know I m out of time, I m going to take some of Rand Paul s time here for a second. Yes, Rick Santorum wants us to  Google  him. Why is this so goddamn funny?There was a time when the absolute last thing Rick Santorum ever wanted you to do was to  Google  him. Not too long ago, LGBT commentator Dan Savage produced one of the greatest political pranks of all time. In response to Santorum saying publicly that same-sex marriage will lead to man-on-dog sex, Savage re-defined the word  Santorum  to mean the  frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex. Worse, enemies of Santorum rigged it so that googling the Republican s name would only produce results that led to that definition. Hence, Santorum probably didn t spend much time asking people to Google him.Until Thursday night. Brave of him because, fortunately, Google no longer produces the new definition as a search result. But people who despise the Republican haven t forgotten. Twitter erupted with reactions to the inadvertent reference to Google.Historic moment: Rick Santorum just told people to go Google Rick Santorum.

8755, Karma’s a Bi*ch: Birthers Go To Court To Challenge Rubio’s Eligibility For Presidency,"They say karma s a bi*ch. It appears that at least two serious contenders for the Republican nomination for the presidency may not be eligible to be president according to birthers. Ted Cruz was born in Canada and Marco Rubio is being challenged as well. This week, Rubio sought to have a Florida complaint on his eligibility thrown out saying the argument  would jeopardize centuries of precedent and deem at least six former presidents ineligible for office. Rubio was born in Florida in 1971. However, Rubio s Cuban immigrant parents did not become U.S. citizens until 1975. That, according to birthers, means he s disqualified from becoming  president under Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that  no person except a natural born citizen   shall be eligible to the Office of President.  This is despite the fact that Rubio was born in the United States. Here is the birther argument about Rubio:  Birthers rely on various passages to back up their argument. One is the treatise The Law of Nations by Swiss philosopher Emer de Vattel, which they say influenced the founding fathers. The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country, of parents who are citizens.   They also cite the U.S. Supreme Court, which in the 1875 case Minor vs. Happersett, used the term  natural born citizen  in reference to persons who were born in the United States, of U.S.-citizen parents. Birthers argue that since his parents were not citizens when he was born, that disqualifies him from becoming president. Rubio filed a motion to dismiss on Jan. 11. The 34-page filing shows that Rubio s legal team spent considerable time researching the issue. The report concludes the following: Senator Rubio is a natural born citizen of the United States and he is eligible to be President of the United States. Is it karma that the Republicans are now reeling from the prospect of two of their leading candidates being ineligible for the presidency?  Throughout President Obama s seven years in the White House, many Republicans have floated the idea that he was not born in the United States. In fact, they propagated the idea so much that 53% of Republicans believe this nonsense today.Now, it s the Republicans that are destroying any credibility they have left. It s not just Rubio. Trump is after Cruz, saying he s disqualified from being president because he was born in Canada. Trump even plays Born in the USA, by Bruce Springsteen, at all his rallies as a shot at Cruz.The birther movement, which consists of many Republicans, has attacked and tried to discredit the president for years. Now, that same movement is after the very same institution, the Republican Party, that propagated it in the first place.Featured Image: Flickr",0
8756, Poll: 0.0% Of Young Icelanders Support Creationism,"For Americans, religion permeates almost every aspect of our daily lives whether we want it to or not. The United States is so religious, in fact, that when, say, a university instructs its professors to hold inclusive holiday parties, rather than focus solely on Christmas, many people believe Christianity itself is under attack. It is therefore always surprising to see just how non-religious other countries have become while America was busy having its pretend war on Christmas.A shocking new poll out of Iceland demonstrates the degree to which young people are abandoning organized religion. The survey of Icelanders found that while many older people (80.6%) still identified as Christian, those in their 20s or younger were astonishingly non-religious. In fact, when asked whether they believed the story of a biblical creation, like the kind found in American  creation museums , a whopping 0.0% of those 25 or younger said they did. Inversely, 93.9% said they believed the universe was created during a big bang.Of those younger than 25 93.9% said the world had been created in the big bang and 0.0% believed God had created the world. 77.7% of those between 25 and 44 years old believed the world had been created in the big bang and 10.1% believed God had created the world. In all but the oldest age category a majority accepted the big-bang theory. Only 46.1% of those older than 55 believed in the big bang, and nearly a fourth, 24.5% believed God had created the world.Perhaps because of this growing lack of religion, the poll also found that a large proportion of Icelanders of all ages expressed support for  the full separation of church and state. But before televangelist Pat Robertson goes dismissing the entire country as godless heathens, there is a bit of a caveat. As Icelandic Redditor avar points out, the implication that zero percent of young Icelanders don t believe in God is a bit misleading. The poll doesn t go that far.Now, what many outside of Iceland and I d say especially Americans need to understand is that even Christians in Iceland and for that matter in most of Europe don t literally believe in the origin story in the Bible in anything but trivial numbers. Maintaining the literal interpretation of that is very much an American evangelical thing. I bet if you polled priests in Iceland and asked them whether they thought the Big Bang happened you d get a 100% response rate in the affirmative.It s a fair point. In America, we often assume  religious  to mean  creationist  because so much of our religious discourse is consumed by conservative fundamentalists. Waking up to the fact that other countries and other churches don t have to be Bible literalists to still believe in God can be jarring for some. As part of a television show, an American religious conservative flew to Scandinavia to learn about how those countries worship. When he discovered how secular people were, and how even the church embraced things like science and same-sex marriage, his brain almost couldn t handle it.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuDqEGlKOus]Meanwhile, back in America, the country remains an outlier in the Western world. Thanks to conservative lawmakers that work to undermine education and special interest groups that push religion into schools, American students still struggle to accept well-supported scientific theories like evolution or the big bang. Slowly, that appears to be changing. Recently, the United States had a bittersweet moment when new polls found a majority of the American public (finally) accepted evolution over Creationism. We still have a long way to go to reach Iceland s numbers though.Feature image via Wikimedia",0
8757, Senate Democrats Will Force Senate Republicans To Vote On Trump’s Racist Policies,"Senate Democrats want Republican senators to vote on some of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump s racist policies, including his stance on banning Muslims from entering the United States.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said that the Republicans should vote on the policies of the front-runner since many Republicans have refused to distance themselves from Trump s racist rhetoric, nor say whether they would support him should he win the Republican nomination. Senator Reid said: These votes will give all Senators a chance to take a stand on the policy issues dominating the public debate   and Republicans a chance to stand with the frontrunner for their nomination. The senator is correct. After all, Trump s the leader of their party for the presidential nomination and despite the fact that some Republicans have disagreed with him, the overwhelming majority have not taken a stand on his divisive policies on Muslims and Hispanic Americans, especially Mexicans. That s because they fear alienating his popular support in their party. Trump currently leads all other Republican candidates by a wide margin for the nomination. Senator Reid said that it s both important and easy to ascertain what other Republican senators think of Trump and his policies. Reid said the votes: Can be done easily and efficiently under an open amendment process, with no interference to the light workload Senate Republican leaders have announced for 2016. Reid s move is actually very smart and it could show the true colors of the Republicans. It will also put them in a tough spot. There are a few Republican senators running for reelection in blue-leaning states.  Republicans are defending a total of 24 Senate seats in November.Senator Reid s suggestion comes as congressional Republicans are in Baltimore for their annual policy retreat to decide on issues the party will collectively take stances on for the year.With Trump s enormous popularity among Republican voters, senate Republicans have been treading water with the first-place candidate.  Whether Trump is holding his fellow Republicans hostage because of his popularity or whether they secretly feel the same way, the Republican party appears to be screwed. Some may criticize Senator Reid s tactic as politically motivated. Well of course it is! However, it s also useful. We need the Republicans to come out and say who they truly are.Featured Image Via Wikimedia Commons",0
8758," Flint, MI: Ten Dead, Eighty-Seven Infected With Deadly Waterborne Bacteria (VIDEO)","On January 13, 2016, Michigan governor Rick Snyder held a press conference to announce the  discovery  of an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city of Flint.According to officials in the Snyder administration, there have been 87 confirmed cases of the disease. Ten people have died as a result.Legionnaire s disease is caused by a deadly waterborne bacteria, called Legionella.Unlike lead poisoning, the other major water-related health crisis now facing the people of Flint, Legionnaire s disease is not caused by drinking contaminated water. Instead, the bacteria enters the body through the lungs, via water droplets in the air.On Wednesday Snyder officials claimed that they can neither confirm or deny that the outbreak is linked to the city s contaminated water supply.As The Atlantic reports here, the outbreak began shortly after the Snyder administration switched the city of Flint s water supply to the Flint River.According to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease occurs when two or more people are infected with the bacteria.In Flint, almost ninety people are known to have been infected by the disease between June 2014 and November 2015.What s infuriating about the Legionnaire s outbreak in Flint is that officials in the Snyder administration certainly knew about it long before Wednesday s press conference. Yet they said nothing until now.As reported here, between June 2014 to March 2015, the number of confirmed cases of Legionnaire s Disease in Flint skyrocketed.During the previous five years the city saw a fairly steady number of cases of the disease, which averaged about eight to ten cases during a ten month reporting period.But by March of 2015, the number of confirmed cases had spiked to 4x the prior average. Between June 2014 and March 2015, there were 45 confirmed cases of the disease. Seven people died from Legionnaire s Disease during that ten month period.Yet after seeing this sudden increase, officials in the Snyder administration took no action. There was no effort made to identify a possible source, although the Center for Disease Control provides specific guidelines for doing so. The public was also not notified that there was an outbreak, although the state health department knew, or should have known, at least by March of last year, if not sooner.Between March of 2015 and November of 2015, another 42 cases of Legionnaire s Disease were confirmed in Flint. Three more people died after being exposed to the waterborne bacteria.Still there was no mention of an outbreak until January 13, 2016.Snyder s press conference on Wednesday was the first time any official made mention of a Legionnaire s outbreak in the city, although at least ten deaths have been caused by the disease.State officials virtually ignored this deadly outbreak for almost a year. Then all of the sudden, on Wednesday, Governor Snyder called a press conference to inform the public that there is an outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease in the city.The question of how state officials could have just now discovered something that has been going on for this long may not be difficult to answer.Last week the federal government announced a Justice Department probe into the Flint water crisis. The announcement followed an investigation by the ACLU, which revealed that state officials had falsified documents and rigged tests to cover up the fact that the city s water is contaminated with lead.Over 200 children are confirmed to have lead poisoning because of the actions of Snyder and his appointed representatives. An additional 9,000 children are likely to be impacted. The number of adults who are affected is currently unknown, but likely stretches into the thousands.A Justice Department investigation into the Flint water crisis would undoubtedly reveal that the Snyder administration concealed information on the Legionnaire s outbreak from the public.What else has Rick Snyder s administration been hiding and lying about? We may never know.Just as the Snyder administration was coming under intense scrutiny over the city s toxic water, someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall. As Addicting Info reported here, the break-in conveniently targeted the vacant office where Flint s water records are stored.According to the CDC, a state health agency is responsible to conduct an investigation into the source of an Legionnaire s outbreak. Such an investigation is advised by the CDC any time there is an increase in the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease or an increase in the severity of cases (such as when the disease causes hospitalizations and deaths.)Outbreaks of Legionnaire s disease, such the one happening in Flint, would require an immediate investigation to determine the source as well as an urgent response from the state health department.Because of the timing and severity of the outbreak, which directly coincided with the switch of the water source, public health officials should have started an investigation into the source of the bacteria months ago. Instead they did nothing.State officials say they haven t made a  direct connection  between the city s contaminated water and the outbreak of the disease. That s more than likely because they never tried to identify the source of the outbreak. They just ignored it.Watch this video, recorded by club937 in January of last year, which shows the quality of the city s water.  We know that the water in Flint is contaminated with lead, a substance that causes a wide range of physical and mental disabilities, especially in children. We also know that the citizens of Flint were repeatedly told by the governor and members of his administration that the water was perfectly safe to drink.What s most frightening about the possibility that the city s water is the cause of the outbreak of Legionnaire s Disease is that people do not have to drink it to be exposed to the bacteria. This bacteria is associated with inhaling water particles, meaning that people can become deathly sick from simply bathing, showering, washing their hands or performing other tasks that most of us take for granted.Handing out bottled drinking water and lead filters isn t going to cut it.I cannot think of a single reason why the people of Flint would trust anything that Governor Snyder or members of his administration tell them about the water. They have been told lie after lie by this administration, ever since the city s water source was switched to the Flint River.What we can already say about the Legionnaire s outbreak is that state officials were aware of it months ago, yet they took no steps to protect public health. Ten people are dead.Snyder says he s not sure if the city s water is responsible for those deaths. That acknowledgment alone is enough to cause public outrage. It is his job to know. It was his job to know back in March, when there were already seven deaths attributed to this disease. But he didn t give a shit back in March. You know why? Because the federal government was not investigating Flint s water crisis back in March.Snyder and every member of his administration has got to go. Every shred of trust the public may have had in this administration is gone. It will never be back. No amount of PR from the governor s office is ever going to repair this.These are life and death issues for Flint residents. They need answers that they can trust, and they deserve to have representation that they can trust as they try to navigate their way through this incalculable nightmare.It was bad when they couldn t drink the water. Now there s a new threat looming over their heads, and that threat comes from the possibility that any contact with the water whatsoever could cause them to become deathly ill.These citizens cannot be expected to look to the same people who caused this disaster for answers now. They cannot be asked to trust the same administration that has lied to them over and over in the past, to tell them the truth now.Snyder and his administration are now saying they aren t sure if the city s water killed ten people. They don t exactly know if the water is safe to shower in, bathe in, wash your hands in. That s what they re saying now, when last week they said they were sure the water was safe for all of those things.At least a dozen petitions to recall Governor Rick Snyder have been filed in recent days. The Michigan Board of State Canvassers continues to throw the recall Snyder petitions out.Oddly enough the right wing majority board had no problem approving two Tea-Party backed recall petitions targeting state legislatures who voted in favor of a tax increase to help repair the state s dangerously neglected roads.To the citizens of Michigan I would ask, how many people have to get sick, and how many children have to be poisoned, and how many deaths have to be counted, before partisan political bullshit takes a backseat to the health and safety of your fellow citizens?You need to get this man, and every member of his blatantly corrupt administration out of office.*Featured image credit: Video screen capture club937.com",0
8759, Terrifying: Watch Donald Trump Turn These Adorable Little Girls Into The Hitler Youth (VIDEO),"Being a xenophobic bigot and a confirmed fascist wasn t enough for Donald Trump. He had to go and involve the children. These unfortunate little girls now get to go the rest of their lives knowing they sang a song of hate and fear in support of a man who embodies the absolute worst America has to offer.It may have been one thing had the song been a cute little ditty about Trump and his family or a generic and non-offensive tune about America, but it s not. It s a song of pure hate, with lyrics that can be described as nothing but stupid:CowardiceAre you serious?Apologies for freedom, I can t handle this.When freedom rings, answer the call!On your feet, stand up tall!Freedom s on our shoulders, USA!Enemies of freedom face the music, c mon boys, take them downPresident Donald Trump knows how to make America greatDeal from strength or get crushed every timeFace the music? Take them down? Get crushed every time? Seriously? The main problem is, while this asinine song may seem like it s about America s enemies, it s actually about America itself. Trump may well be looking to  destroy  our enemies abroad, but from the actions of he and his supporters at their rallies, the meaning couldn t be more clear: Stand in Trump s way and pay the price, no matter who you are.We ve seen his fascism in his platform. Registering American Muslims and refusing entry to all others into the country. No cure for immigration: deport them all. Build a wall; keep them out. If they dissent, silence them. These are the things we gasp at when we hear, knowing how much support this new age Hitler has. The press are tossed from his rallies for not focusing their cameras exclusively on him. He stops every five minutes when he speaks to encourage the mob mentality and have someone thrown out.This man is nothing but dangerous and because of that these poor girls won t soon be forgotten.Featured image via screen capture",0
8760, Looks Like The Founding Fathers May Have Actually Disqualified Ted Cruz From Running,"Now, some may say because Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) was born to an American citizen, even while in Canada, he is to be considered a  natural born  citizen. However, when looking at the Constitution in the context of the time frame that is was written, and in regards to how certain laws were to be read, that  natural born  status actually may not apply to the senator.Why? Because, unlike today, in 2016, when woman are considered equals among men (for the most part), when the Constitution was written by our Founders it was quite a sexist time.Legal scholar Thomas Lee from Fordham University believes that Cruz should be disqualified. And as the Washington Post describes: On this straightforward, intuitive, and deeply conservative reasoning, several prominent legal scholars have argued Cruz is arguably not a natural-born citizen. As the Founding Fathers and their contemporaries probably would have understood that phrase, the argument goes, Cruz is ineligible for the presidency   not because he was born in Canada, but because he was born in Canada to a Cuban father. Furthermore: Under King Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377, England expanded this definition to include the children of ambassadors and soldiers who were serving the monarch overseas. In the centuries to come, Parliament modified the definition further to include the children of private English subjects who happened to be abroad.In the late 18th century, though, that definition did not include English mothers who were traveling. If they conceived children with foreign men, it was assumed those children would not be loyal English subjects and were not considered  natural born. Yikes! Looks like Cruz isn t a natural born citizen after all. Well, at least if we go by the United States Constitution as it was originally written and intended. Which, strict  constitutional conservatives  like a certain Sen. Ted Cruz claim so adamantly to be. He might as well excuse himself from the presidential race right now. Unless, of course, he s not a strict constitutionalist and doesn t want to abide by the Founding Fathers original intent.HOW. DARE. HE?!Truth be told, we really don t know the Founding Fathers true intention, and can only go by how  natural born  was defined in the era that the phrase was first prescribed. Everything else is hearsay and interpreted to fit specific agendas (such as, wanting to allow a Canadian born to a Cuban dissident to be President of the United States). Sure, his mother was an American citizen, but if we are to abide by the law as originally intended, this surely may disqualify Cruz. All because the Founding Fathers were harshly sexist.How much do you want to bet Ted Cruz wishes he was a women s rights activist now? Oops.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (Flickr)",0
8761," Sorry Conservatives, Obamacare Isn’t Killing Jobs; In Fact, The Private Sector Is SOARING","If you listen to Republicans, the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing since Caillou first aired on television   or, something to that effect. While Ted Cruz may claim that  millions of Americans are hurting  because of the jobs that have been  destroyed  since the passage of Obamacare, Marco Rubio says that We have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,  and Carly Fiorina ignorantly asserts that   Obamacare is crushing small businesses,  none of that seems to be happening.Not only do we enjoy the lowest uninsured rate in history, but 2014   the first full year of implementation of the Affordable Care Act   treated us to a 15-year high in job growth. 2015 wasn t too shabby either, with the two full years in which Obamacare has been up and running being the best back-to-back years since there were new episodes of Full House.As Forbes Dan Diamond noted last week, since Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010 (or  Armageddon  as conservatives call it) the private sector hasn t lost any jobs. In fact, Obama is the worst job-killing President in recent history, if that is actually his goal.MSNBC took Diamond s graph and made some alterations showing job  growth  under George W. Bush compared to under President Obama. Clearly, after inheriting the dismal economy left to us by the Bush administration, the President and his evil socialist cohorts attempted to destroy America by putting people back to work: But whenever this or related topics come up, I hear from conservatives who insist that the data is deceptive because most of the new jobs are part-time, not full-time,  Maddow blog s Steve Benen notes.  This pesky detail makes the seemingly good news appear far more discouraging.  This would, of course, be heavily disconcerting, he notes   if it were true. Vox s Sarah Kliff reported on Monday that the  part-time  theory is complete and utter bullsh*t:[N]ew research in the journal Health Affairs suggests they weren t the norm: The data shows no national trend toward more part-time employment under the Affordable Care Act   even if you drill into the type of people you d expect to get hit hardest.Is Obamacare hurting the economy or the job market? All signs point to no   but that won t stop Republicans from trying to figure out a way. Or, of course, they might just make some stuff up. They re good at that.Featured image via MSNBC",0
8762, ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Who Had Never Fired One Gets Concealed Permit In A Single Day,"Today s lesson in the horrors of how easily a person can obtain and legally carry a firearm come from   big surprise   Texas. For two weeks now the Lone Star State has been imposing its ammosexuality on not just the residents who feel the need to keep an arsenal at home but on the college campus communities as well.That s right Like it or not   and most colleges say  not,   campus carry  has become a reality. Now any student over 21 with a legal concealed carry permit can carry a loaded weapon onto any college campus across the state. Texan lawmakers, proving they are dumb as stumps, have decided that would be the best way to curb the onslaught of campus shootings.Some people may say,  well, at least they have to be properly trained. Concealed carry permits come with a safety training course.  While that may sound nice  it s true on paper   in reality it s far more frightening.University of Texas at Austin student Zachary Stone, in preparation for a debate on the issue of  campus carry,  decided to go out with zero experience, having never fired a gun before and see what it took to get the concealed carry permit necessary to carry at school. He chronicled his experience for The New York Times and it is absolutely horrifying.The class required is a 6-hour course where you learn such important rules as  you can only shoot in self-defense.  No vigilante justice, not to intervene in a crime, and certainly not to stop someone from running away.  That would be murder,  his instructor told him. Stone says everything he needed to learn to pass the written part of the test, which was basically a list of where you can carry a concealed weapon, he learned in the last 10 minutes. He got a 100 on the written test.When it came time for the live-fire portion of the test, Stone was a wreck: Fire! I shot. The gun flew back. My neighbors each hit the center, but I missed a foot too high. Fire! I didn t realize I d have to shoot again so soon. I hadn t taught myself how to aim yet, and I wanted a few seconds to learn from the first shot. I also hadn t learned how to deal with the recoil. Anxiously, I pointed and shot   a few seconds after my neighbors. I still missed.That s when the instructor yelled at me.  You need to line up your sights!  I had no idea what that meant. He explained that for me to aim properly the dot at the front of the gun needed to be inside the post at the back of the gun.That was remarkably useful information. Fire! My next shot hit the center  X. Stone found himself being screamed at every step of the way, because he had no idea what he was doing. Lining up his sights paled in comparison to the reloading process, which required him to eject the magazine   something he had no clue how to do:I tugged on the magazine. It didn t move, so I pulled harder. I pulled as hard as I could, nervous to put so much force on a gun   empty or not.I called out to the instructor.  My magazine s stuck! Show me. Try to pull it out. That really shouldn t happen. I pulled on the magazine for the instructor.  You need to push the release,  he said. What s that?  I asked. The button. I pushed something. No. The button,  he said.That did the trick.Keep in mind that this young man had already passed the written portion of the test and was now on his way to being a  responsible gun owner  legally licensed to carry a concealed weapon to school. After repeating the live-shooting portion until 50 rounds had been fired each, it was time to tally the score and see if Zachary had the marksmanship necessary to be considered safe enough for public places.To pass, you need 175 out of 250 points. If you fail, you get two more chances. I did pretty well in the end   I got 216 points.The targets are huge; the distances close. In 2014, 99.7 percent of those who applied were given licences to carry concealed in Texas. As Stone proved, it s nearly impossible to fail. After less than one day s time, with a rented gun and absolutely zero real training, Zachary Stone had a permit to bring a gun to class.At his debate, after telling the story, he asked one question that the pro-gun crowd would struggle with: Given that the system allows me   lacking firearm experience   to get a license, would you be comfortable if we sat with each other in class, upon learning I m secretly carrying a gun? The system sucks.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
8763, Fox News Attacks Obama’s National Cancer Initiative By Claiming Obamacare Won’t Cover It,"President Obama gave America a bit of the spirit of the 60 s back when he announced, during his final State of the Union address, his support for a new American  moon shot  to develop a cure for cancer. It harkened back to the days of John F. Kennedy s  We choose to go to the Moon  speech he delivered at Rice University in 1962, and Richard Nixon s signing of the National Cancer Act of 1971 where he dedicated federal funds towards working on a cure for the disease.A national goal to cure one of the worst and widespread diseases known to humanity is an incredible undertaking. If it were successful, it would save countless lives, ease untold amounts of suffering, and reduce the colossal expenses we incur by managing the disease every year. But, because Obama suggested it someone had to have a problem with it.For years now, there has been a running joke of  If Obama is for it, Fox News hates it.  This included such silly notions as drinking enough water every day, to breathing oxygen, and other common-interest items like these. Reality has overwritten satire yet again when Fox News insisted that Obama s national cancer cure initiative was a waste of time because Obamacare won t allow it to happen.One of the objectors was Dr. Marc Siegel, who appeared on Fox and Friends to declare that Obama was the  wrong president to cure cancer.  It was a strange way to start his argument, but the implication was clear. Some conservatives like Siegel just don t want to see Obama with a  win  even if it meant we could cure cancer starting tomorrow.Jumping immediately onto the anti-Obamacare bandwagon, Fox hosts started suggesting that the Affordable Care Act inhibits cancer research. This is something that is not proven true. Some trade groups have made the disingenuous leap connecting cost-saving measures to a reduction in research. However, there are other aspects of the ACA that promote more research across the board.Seigel continued on, implying that Barack Obama had not committed substantial funds to cancer research, by citing Richard Nixon directing $100 million towards cancer research during his presidency. Barack Obama has actually directed $264 million towards cancer research as part of a $2 billion raise to the National Institutes of Health.Seigel also claimed that the ACA wouldn t provide enough coverage for treatments developed during a national cancer initiative:Obamacare is narrow networks of doctors,  he continued.  It doesn t include most of these major medical centers, the cancer institutes. It won t include these treatments that are $100,000 per year. And not only that, as you just said, it stifles innovation.Source: Raw Story Seigel is trying to conflate the coverage of current treatments with cures that have not been invented. It s a bit disingenuous to suggest that a cure that has not actually been developed yet will not be covered by the ACA. Data on which insurance policies cover treatments that have yet to be invented simply do not exist.Seigel s argument about existing treatments does not have merit either. Media Matters had previously pointed out that conservative media had misrepresented the facts in an AP report about narrow health care networks to falsely claim enrollees in ACA exchanges cannot get coverage for treatments at advanced cancer centers. The  narrow networks  that were used as the basis for the right-wing misinformation was a marketing tactic to provide lower premium options to customers and had virtually nothing to do with the ACA forcing them into that position.Watch the full clip below:It s ridiculous that Fox News is actually fighting back against a national cancer cure initiative, simply because they can t let it go on Obamacare, but that is exactly what is happening. He already won on jobs, national security, ending wars, ensuring marriage equality, providing health insurance to tens of millions and bringing America back into the hearts and minds of the rest of the world. They can t stand the thought of him also being the president that  cured cancer  as well.featured image: screengrab",0
8764, WATCH: Paul Ryan Reveals This Really Weird Reason He Hated President Obama’s SOTU Speech (VIDEO),"Paul Ryan sat down for an interview with USA Today on Wednesday. During the interview, the House Speaker revealed his thoughts on President Obama s final State of the Union speech. It was made immediately clear in the interview that Ryan loathed a lot of what President Obama had to say. Ryan was so upset with one point in Obama s speech that he said it  degrades the presidency. Ryan was mad the President Obama had mentioned how the hatred towards others that Donald Trump is fanning and exploiting for political gain is hurting the United States. In case you missed it, here is the part of President Obama s speech that Ryan is referring to: We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn t a matter of political correctness. It s a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.His Holiness, Pope Francis, told this body from the very spot I stand tonight that  to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.  When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that doesn t make us safer.That s not telling it like it is. It s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country. President Obama received a well-deserved standing ovation for that small piece of political sanity.So why is Ryan so mad? Well, he says that agrees with President Obama, saying that  Putting a religious test on anybody coming to this country is wrong,  but goes on to say that President Obama is wrong for commenting on the politics of the Republican Party. I think it sort of degrades the presidency to then talk about primary politics in the other party, during primaries. That s not what presidents ought to be talking about in State of the Union addresses,  Ryan said.  Speaking up for our values and speaking up for our beliefs is one thing. But kind of wading into the primary politics of the other party is just not really what presidents ought to do. If this were a normal primary election, Ryan might have a point. However, this is not a normal election and Trump is hurting the United States without actually being in any office. Trump was even called out during the Republican response when governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley said,  Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference.  A statement that could easily be seen as a chastisement of Trump for his refusal to keep his racism on the down low, rather than for being racist to begin with.This all boils down to the Republican establishment being angry and scared over the fact that Trump has the Party s racist base out of the shadows. Now that they are exposed, they can be criticized for it, at their expense. President Obama did that in a super classy way, wrapped in a message that draws on the better ideals of the United States.You can watch the interview, in full, below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
8765, WATCH: Huckabee Flips Out As Voter Confronts Him Over Support For Duggar Child Abuse (VIDEO),"GOP Presidential candidate and religious right poster boy Mike Huckabee was confronted over his relationship with the Duggar family and decided to browbeat an Iowa voter for pointing out his dysfunctional relationship.The voter asked Huckabee why he announced support for the Duggar family, pointing out he propped up  child abuse  and the subsequent cover up of that abuse while attaching himself to Josh Duggar, who molested five girls. The Duggars have been influential with the  religious right,  a key constituency of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee s support base.In response Huckabee melted down, accusing the woman of making a scene and getting her facts about the case.Huckabee yelled at the woman and insisted that because he had known the Duggar children  since they were babies  she had no right to speak out about how the Duggar family patriarch, Jim Bob Duggar, had avoided reporting his son s abuse towards young children.But the voter was right. Huckabee had backed the Duggars.When the revelations about Duggar came out, Huckabee announced he was still backing the Duggar clan.Janet and I want to affirm our support for the Duggar family. Josh s actions when he was an underage teen are as he described them himself,  inexcusable,  but that doesn t mean  unforgivable.  He and his family dealt with it and were honest and open about it with the victims and the authorities. No purpose whatsoever is served by those who are now trying to discredit Josh or his family by sensationalizing the story. Good people make mistakes and do regrettable and even disgusting things.Yet as the campaign heated up and media scrutiny increased, Huckabee apparently felt the heat and scrubbed his campaign website of material showing the Duggar connection.So far Huckabee has been able to capture the magic of his 2008 campaign when he won the Iowa caucuses. He has been unable to qualify for the top-tier debates and currently polls at an average of 2% among Republicans. In all likelihood Huckabee will return to the lucrative world of being a Fox News pundit and cranking out history propaganda videos targeted at impressionable children.Featured image via YouTube",0
8766, Major Study Finds Marijuana Perfectly Safe For Teens,"We ve come a long way from the days of rampant stupidity concerning marijuana use. We used to believe in  reefer madness,  the laughable idea that smoking pot would drive you innnnsaaaannnnne! Then there was the idiotic idea that marijuana was a  gateway drug  that would inevitably lead potheads to become heroin addicts. Then, more recently, there was the belief that getting high would make teens less intelligent. But, like most propaganda, the myth of the pot-addled teen ahem went up in smoke when science got involved:The study, published online January 6 in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found a statistical association between cannabis use and decreased intellectual performance. However, this association vanished when the researchers took other variables into account.  The notion that cannabis use itself is causally related to lower IQ and poorer educational performance was not supported in this large teenage sample,  wrote Claire Mokrysz of the University College London and her colleagues.A quick disclaimer here: I don t smoke marijuana. I have never smoked marijuana. I will never smoke marijuana (even if I didn t have asthma). Not interested, don t care. However, I grew up around a lot of people that smoked pot so I find the hysteria over it to be ridiculous. I find the idea of putting people in jail for smoking it offensive in the extreme. Cigarettes and beer are far more harmful but marijuana is dangerous? Spare me from your ignorance. Smoke m if you got em.That s not to say that the low I.Q. story appeared in a vacuum. A study released in 2012 clearly pointed to the possibility that marijuana use over a long period of time could lower your intelligence. People familiar with the drug were, needless to say, skeptical but the anti-pot crusaders latched onto this for dear life. After all, all of their other talking points (addictive, lethal, causes violence, etc.) have come up short. But now that the original research has been duplicated and expanded on, we know that the original study was flawed. That, of course, is the beauty of science, it self-corrects: People often believe that using cannabis can be very damaging to intellectual ability in the long-term, but it is extremely difficult to separate the direct effects of cannabis from other potential explanations,  Mokrysz added.  Adolescent cannabis use often goes hand in hand with other drug use, such as alcohol and cigarette smoking, as well as other risky lifestyle choices. It s hard to know what causes what- do kids do badly at school because they are smoking weed, or do they smoke weed because they re doing badly? This study suggests it is not as simple as saying cannabis is the problem. Will the anti-marijuana crusaders amend their narrative or will they continue to insist that smoking pot makes you dumb? Considering their fear of cannabis is irrational to begin with, it s unlikely they ll let go of such a useful fiction.Featured image via twitter ",0
8767, Five Republican Candidates Will Join Bigot Pastor Who Says God Punishes Gays With AIDS (VIDEO),"Five Republican presidential hopefuls are scheduled to speak at an ultra-conservative pastor s  religious freedom  event, to prove what the GOP believes religious liberty is REALLY about   i.e. bigotry, exclusion and treating those who live different lifestyles like scum.On Saturday, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee will appear on the Free to Believe Broadcast, which is being hosted by the Family Research Council s Tony Perkins and Vision America s Rick Scarborough   two men who have become infamous for their anti-gay activism. Both Perkins and Scarborough have taken it upon themselves to fight against gay marriage because it is apparently violating their Christian rights. In the past, Perkins has said that America s persecution of anti-gay Christians is inspiring ISIS and Scarborough said he ll burn to death to outlaw gay marriage.  Live and let live  is completely lost on these two, and they intend to keep fighting with more fear-mongering, threats and punishment.Scarborough, who is a pastor, has repeatedly said that God punishes gay people for their  immoral act  with AIDS and has even called for a class action lawsuit  against homosexuals in 2013. Scarborough has claimed that if only Americans would wake up and stop supporting gay rights, God would probably give us the cure for AIDS today.  Last year, Scarborough said God would be completely justified in sending a nuclear bomb to destroy America just because Obama appointed a few gay ambassadors. Here s a video of Scarborough preaching about AIDS and  God s judgement  on gays:Perkins  record of homophobia isn t much better.It should come as no surprise that the five GOPers listed above would support such a vile event. Cruz in particular has rained praise on Scarborough and similar anti-gay activists before, expressing his support for the Religious Right s rhetoric that God will punish gays. Cruz, along with Huckabee, have also supported anti-gay radicals by making appearances at a 2015 conference hosted by Kevin Swanson, who believes gay people should be put to death. The two candidates also stirred up controversy last year with their alliance to anti-gay Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, who became infamous for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples after the Supreme Court s ruling.Extreme events like the broadcast these five GOP candidates are planning to attend are a perfect example of what the party truly stands for. It s not about  religious freedom  at all   it s about hate, shame, fear and punishment and has very little to do with the true values of Christianity. When Republican candidates attend and participate in events like this, they re showing America who they really are and what they truly support   bigotry. Hopefully, America is paying attention.Featured image via Alex Proimos / Flickr",0
8768, Conservative Columnist Tries To Declare War On Iran On Behalf Of America,"Dear America, I would like to apologize on behalf of Britain for the awful political commentators that have migrated from our shores to yours. First Piers Morgan, and now Louise Mensch   who has just attempted to declare war on Iran on behalf of your country.And no, this is not satire.The people of Britain awoke, five to eight hours earlier than you this morning (depending on your timezone), to discover Louise Mensch had embarrassed both our nations by hate-tweeting the President of Iran. Mensch served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for our Conservative party (all aristocrats and private school types), before migrating to New York to serve the interests of media magnate Rupert Murdoch more directly.Think of Ann Coulter having been put through the washing machine on too high a temperature, and you have a pretty accurate mental image of Mensch.However, she seems to have gone a bit native and thinks she can declare war on your behalf, and put a Republican president in your White House.I will rejoice the day a new US President, a Republican, brings the hammer down on Iran and @HassanRouhani https://t.co/i6im0P3MBd  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 13, 2016But Mensch didn t stop there. She has carried on hate-tweeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani all day. Quite what she thinks this will achieve is anyone s guess. It appears she believed the President of Iran would be stopped in his tracks by an over-stuffed western media hack carping at him on social media.The sexist, racist @HassanRouhani forces a US sailor into repellent forced hijab #Iran pic.twitter.com/mXpbiVlF6E  Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) January 13, 2016In the meantime, President Obama and John Kerry were busy executing the kind of grown up politics and diplomacy one has to in this scale of international incident. Unlike conservative lawmakers and pundits, they bear the burden of responsibility for actually getting those sailors home   not merely scoring political points from their capture and treatment.In fact, they were able to secure release of the sailors, entirely unharmed, within hours. No embarrassing ultimatums, no extended hostage crisis, no saber-rattling   problem solved and time to move on. Meanwhile, the entire conservative media and political sphere remains in total meltdown, hyperventilating over an issue that has already been resolved expertly.And that s why America, and the world, cannot afford to put them in the White House in 2016.Featured Image via Wikimedia/Flickr",0
8769, Texas Pastor Explains How She Can ‘Move Clouds’ – And How You Can Perform Miracles Too (VIDEO),"Texas Christian Pastor Cindy Jacobs stood in front of her Trinity Church congregation in Cedar Hill, Texas, this month and described how she literally  moved clouds  and performed other miracles like  preventing typhoon flooding.  Really? You don t say? We re listening   teach us, Sensei.But, all kidding aside (okay   no kidding aside) if this is true, we really wouldn t mind knowing her secret. Here s how she says you can move clouds, too: Just read the Book! So I did, I just put my hands up, and Mike had the word that I should pray that the clouds dissipate.Did I get it right this time? yay! So, I lifted my hands and I said these simple words,  In the name of Jesus, I command this cloud layer to dissipate.  Now didn t that seem weird? You know what happened? Within a half an hour, no more clouds! Amen! Okay, so, in case  cloud moving  is not your thing, maybe you d rather get rid of typhoon flooding instead. If so, Pastor Jacobs has you covered there, as well: And so we said,  In the name of Jesus, we command the flooding to stop, the river to stop flooding and the streets to dry up!  You know what happened? In one hour, one hour, it stopped and I told them, prepare the van because we re going! It looks like anything is possible with Jesus. Maybe we can try this theory out with child hunger? Might as well give it a shot. Let s try it now: In the name of Jesus, we command child hunger be gone! Be gone with you! Did it work? I guess we ll find out here in an hour or so. Let s be patient.Let s not stop there. There are a few other miracles worth performing: In the name of Jesus, we command you, diseases, be gone! Be gone with you horrible diseases! Now!We re hoping this pastor isn t full of shit, really. Why? Because we d also like to win the lottery. One more time: We command you, lottery, give us the winning numbers! That s an order!And, God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.Featured image via screen capture",0
8770, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley Says We’ve Never Passed Racist Laws In This Country,"We ve never passed racist laws in this country, says the woman who is the governor of a former slave state where Jim Crow laws flourished and the Confederate flag flew until July 2015.It s most definitely the most ridiculous thing Nikki Haley has ever said, and it comes just a day after she delivered the Republican response to the State of the Union Address.Only six months have gone by since Haley called for removing the Confederate flag off statehouse grounds after a racist gunman murdered nine African-American parishioners at a black church in Charleston.The flag has been a symbol of white supremacy and slavery since the Civil War and actually flew on the statehouse itself after a law was passed mandating it. That s why it took a vote of the South Carolina House and Senate to remove it for good.So, it s pretty damn mind-boggling to hear Haley claim that we ve never passed racist laws in this country.According to Talking Points Memo, Haley responded to criticism of her speech by Donald Trump, who called her weak on immigration. And let s just say it didn t go well. When you ve got immigrants who are coming here legally, we ve never in the history of this country passed any laws or done anything based on race or religion. Let s not start that now. We ve gone too far than to go back into a race and religion issue. I ve been through those fights. That s not worth it. Yes, she really claimed that there have never been racist laws in the history of this nation, even though Haley lives and works in a state that seceded from the Union because they feared their pro-slavery laws would be abolished by President Lincoln.As Gawker points out, South Carolina also had many Jim Crow laws on the books, including making it  illegal for  any white man to intermarry with any woman of either the Indian or negro races  until 1967,  and banning restaurants from serving  white and colored passengers in the same room, or at the same table, or at the same counter  until 1954.Racism is even present in our own Constitution as the Founding Fathers made it the law that African-Americans could only count as three-fifths of a person when determining the number of congressional seats each state has every ten years.In addition, there s the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, literacy tests for voting, Operation  Wetback  of 1954, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, just to name a few. To see more, click here.Either Nikki Haley doesn t know the history of America and our legal system, or she is whitewashing it. Conservatives must be proud.Featured Image: Flickr and Flickr.",0
8771, Ted ‘Duck Hunter’ Cruz Goes Full Camo In BIZARRE New Ad Pandering To Idiot America (VIDEO),"Politicians have been known to do a lot of things to get elected. They usually cater and pander to a group of people who they think will have the best chance at casting a vote in their favor. In the case of Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz, those he s decided to cater to are the residents of Idiot America.Cruz has decided to go all in trying to get the ultra-religious, absent from reality, guns and God group of folks who love to hunt, hate gay people and live far away from populated areas. People otherwise known as extreme, right-wing Republicans.Perfectly pandering to this demographic, Cruz paired himself up with Duck Dynasty and their bigot-in-chief Phil Robertson. Robertson is about as anti-gay and bigoted as one could ever hope to be, so of course he s now endorsed one of the leading bigot candidates running for president   Ted Cruz.In a new campaign commercial for Cruz, Robertson, with his face painting black camo for hunting, tells everyone the qualifications he wants to see in a president: Is he or she godly? Does he or she love us? Can he or she do the job? And finally, would they kill a duck and put  em in a pot and make up a good duck gumbo? I ve looked at the candidates. Ted Cruz is my man. (Let s just pause for a second and acknowledge that Robertson said  he or she.  Got to at least give credit where credit is due)Now, as far as Cruz being the man for the job of President of the United States? Yeah, not so much. He s a smarmy man who will say or do anything to get his way. This includes, but is not limited to, likely not even being as religious as he says he is, or as  constitutional  as he claims to be.Cruz tends to do things for show, and no greater example of this can be seen than in this very commercial where he puts on blackface, pardon me, hunting camo paint that looks remarkably like blackface and someone should have told him that, and sits down to hold his gun and  hunt  with Robertson.Cruz is all like,  Look at me! I m just like you! I like to hunt and play make-believe Rambo, too! Ignore the fact that I m insanely wealthy and married to Goldman Sachs! Vote for me!  He knows exactly what he is doing. He s a smart guy, gotta give him that much, which also makes him irrefutably dangerous. He knows how to play the game, get what he wants, and he doesn t seem to care who might get hurt along the way.However, this ad right here, as funny as it may be, because it s pretty goddamn funny, also show to the depths he ll go to cater to a specific voter population. In this case, idiot America. Video/Featured image: YouTube",0
8772, Rick Scott Kills Babies By Eliminating Medical Standards After $200K Bribe From Hospital,"Rick Scott is an absolutely horrible governor and literally gives zero f*cks about the people of Florida   even babies. Governor Scott is being accused of eliminating health standards for children s heart surgery after a hospital donated $200,000 to Republicans, including his own political action committee.In 2015, CNN revealed that St. Mary s Medical Center in West Palm Beach had an extremely high mortality rate in their pediatric cardiology program. Between 2011 and 2013, the hospital had a 12.5 percent death rate for open heart surgeries on babies and children; by comparison, the national average was 3.3 percent. So many children were dying at the hospital that in 2014 five independent pediatric heart doctors arrived at the hospital to review the program. The doctors were horrified by what they found, and recommended that the hospital stop performing surgery on babies under six months old and not perform any complicated procedures on older children.The hospital ignored their advice and more children and babies died. The state of Florida was warned by multiple highly respected cardiologists that the hospital had problems, but the state did nothing. Actually, that s not true, they did something far worse than nothing.Two moths after CNN s investigation was published, the state eliminated standards that have been in place for nearly forty years to protect pediatric heart patients. Why? Because during the same period of time that all of the children were dying in St. Mary s, the owners of the hospital, Tenet Healthcare, donated $200,000 to Rick Scott s PAC and the Republican Party of Florida.David Nykanen, co-director of the Heart Center at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, called the move to eliminate the standards AFTER the donations  too much  of a coincidence: The coincidence is just a little too much. It s just a little hard to swallow. Tenet s Shelly Weiss Friedberg told CNN that they had nothing to do with the state s decision: At no time have we discussed the pediatric cardiac standards with the governor or his office, or with any elected official or anyone on their staff. Our opinion was not sought on the standards nor have we expressed a position on the possible repeal of the standards or the role of the Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel. Nyakanen was not convinced, saying, If someone is contributing at that level, obviously they have to have some influence. If Tenet Healthcare contributed so much money, you d think they have the ear of the governor and the politicians. Last month Administrative Law Judge John Van Laningham agreed that the state should do away with the standards, claiming that suggesting the quality of healthcare would diminish is a little insulting to the health care professionals who personally deliver those services.  But at St. Mary s the quality was never there to begin with and if anything the state should have stepped in and prevented the hospital from ever operating on tiny humans again. Of course, this is Rick Scott s Florida that we are talking about and he cares little about the people of the state he was elected to serve.This is not the first time Rick Scott has screwed over the people of Florida when it comes to healthcare. The former hospital CEO/Medicare thief and House Republicans brought the government to a grinding halt when they refused to expand Medicaid to nearly a million of the state s working poor. Now that they have done this, it is absolutely crystal clear that Florida s GOP-led government will stop at nothing to help their donors   even if that means killing your children.Featured image via Facebook",0
8773," President Obama Hammers Republicans: They’re Full Of Hot Air, Bluster, And A Word Starting With A B (VIDEO)","A day after he schooled Republicans during his historic State of the Union Address, President Obama smacked them down again in their own backyard.On Wednesday, President Obama traveled to America s heartland to speak to a crowd in Omaha, Nebraska and just like he did on multiple occasions on Tuesday night, called out Republicans for their bullshit claims about the state of our country. That s how crazy our politics has gotten. Where we now feel obliged to not root for America doing good. So when you hear people peddling this fiction about our enemies getting stronger, America getting weaker, when you hear folks say we can solve challenges by looking meaner or talking tougher, or carpet bombing wherever we want. That s just hot air. It s bluster. It s not serious. There s another word for it that starts with a B  It s baloney. Here  the video via YouTube.During the State of the Union Address, President Obama chided Republicans for refusing to accept the science of climate change, and slammed them for not voting for military action against ISIS even as they claim that he isn t doing enough to stop them.Despite what Republicans like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump say, America is already great and has been getting stronger every day as President Obama s policies continue to make Republicans desperate to destroy him. America has witnessed an unprecedented job growth streak that has reduced unemployment to 5 percent. Meanwhile, more Americans than ever before are gaining health insurance for themselves and their families. President Obama has also taken actions to fight climate change and has struck back against terrorist organizations time and time again over the course of his presidency, dealing heavy blows to their leadership structure in particular.Yet, to hear Republicans talk, you would think that America has been rendered into a wasteland that somehow only they can save. The only problem is that they have to lie repeatedly to make anyone think that. The facts, however, tell us that America is progressing and flourishing despite every Republican attempt to sabotage it over the years. And that s because President Obama has been a great leader, which is why Republicans are so desperate to have us believe that America is falling apart or faces destruction. Because the only way they will ever win the presidency again is if enough Americans actually believe them.Featured Image: Pete Souza",0
8774, Virginia Republican Says Conservatives Own Christianity In Attack On Obama For Citing Bible (AUDIO),"A House Tea Party Republican declared that conservatives own Christianity during an attack against President Obama.In his moral defense of granting asylum to thousands of Syrian refugees, President Obama cited the Bible in November to counter anti-refugee conservatives. Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger  - we were strangers once, too,  Obama said. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship. Indeed, the Bible commands Christians to love foreigners and treat them with respect and compassion. Deuteronomy 10:19 states:And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.And Leviticus 19:34 states:The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.The verse President Obama referenced is Exodus 23:9, which states,You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt.As we all know, Republicans are constantly claiming that America is a Christian nation and that we must adhere to Christian values. So if that is the case, you would think Republicans would jump to support President Obama and his effort to help refugees who are fleeing war and death in their homeland.But they aren t. In fact, they not only oppose President Obama, they are attacking him for using the Bible against them.During an interview with American Family Radio host Sandy Rios on Monday, Virginia Rep. David Brat argued that President Obama can t use the Bible to hit back at conservatives because he says the right-wing owns Christianity, and must indoctrinate people to make sure they are brainwashed to believe that conservatives have a monopoly on Christian values. Our side, the conservative side, needs to reeducate its people that we own the entire tradition. If you lose the moral argument, you lose the policy argument every time, so we need to reclaim the moral argument, where we re so strong. He also claimed that President Obama is using the Bible to build federal power. He s using the Christian tradition and trying to bring about compassion by bonking Republicans over the head with the Bible. It s almost a comedy routine on what compassion and love is. He s mocking his enemies in order to compel a larger federal state using the tradition of love. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.So David Brat believes that Republicans alone own Christianity and have the only right to use the Bible to push their political agenda. Of course, he is assuming that only Republicans are Christians, which is complete bullshit.Brat and his fellow conservatives are just pissed that President Obama used the Bible to reveal them as complete hypocrites. If Republicans really gave a damn about what the Bible said, they d be pushing for universal healthcare, a stronger food stamp program and would welcome refugees with open arms. But they don t, thereby proving that they are nothing more than opportunistic cherry-pickers who abuse religion for their own gain.Featured Image: Wikimedia ",0
8775, Dark Money: Ted Cruz Bought His Senate Seat With A Secret Loan From Goldman Sachs,"Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R-TX) secretly obtained a loan from the big pockets of financial giant Goldman Sachs, which he used to provide a decisive financial edge to his U.S. Senate campaign in 2012.Cruz has previously accused Goldman of being the beneficiary of  crony capitalism,  and said they  they seek out and get special favors from government. The loans obtained by Cruz were not disclosed on forms filed with the federal government.Neither loan appears in reports the Ted Cruz for Senate Committee filed with the Federal Election Commission, in which candidates are required to disclose the source of money they borrow to finance their campaigns. Other campaigns have been investigated and fined for failing to make such disclosures, which are intended to inform voters and prevent candidates from receiving special treatment from lenders. There is no evidence that the Cruzes got a break on their loans.A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz s presidential campaign, Catherine Frazier, acknowledged that the loan from Goldman Sachs, drawn against the value of the Cruzes  brokerage account, was a source of money for the Senate race. Ms. Frazier added that Mr. Cruz also sold stocks and liquidated savings, but she did not address whether the Citibank loan was used.Cruz is now characterizing the omission of this information as  inadvertent  and a  technical  matter. He went on to say  The facts of the underlying matter have been disclosed for many, many years.  He also told reporters,  All of the information has been public and transparent for many years, and that s the end of that. But the election was over in the fall of 2010, and it is now 2016   a six year gap between when he spent the money and when he finally acknowledged where it came from and how it was used. Cruz failed to amend or update this information for a large sum of money. Considering the candidate s history of playing fast and loose with the truth, there is no independent verification of his claim that the filing was  inadvertent. Cruz s wife Heidi is a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Houston, but is currently on a leave of absence from her job as her husband campaigns for president. When speaking about his wife s career, Cruz omitted the ten years of experience she had at the company.Featured image via Flickr",0
8776, Westboro Baptist’s Protest Of David Bowie’s Funeral Has Been Perfectly Trolled By Love,"It really doesn t get more pathetic than the folks over at Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Their pitiful hatred of anything that doesn t line up with their narrow-minded, myopic view of their own personal brand of  Christianity  is just short of pure evil.

8777, Right-Wing Broadcaster: Teenage Girl Is A ‘Prostitute’ For Being Afraid Of Bundy Militia (VIDEO),"We recently saw the heartbreaking plea of 15-year-old Ashlie Presley, who lives in the area that is currently being occupied by Ammon Bundy and his band of would-be domestic terrorists. She bravely took the microphone and tearfully explained why she was begging the militia to leave. One would think that most people would feel sympathy for her, but no, some people are too callous to feel anything at all. One such person is right-wing broadcast personality Pete Santilli.Presley is the granddaughter of Judge Steven Grasty, and Santilli decided to capitalize on that fact. He said that Grasty had allowed his grandchild to become a  prostitute.  In one of his broadcasts, live from the wildlife refuge where the militants are camped out, Santilli said: That judge was prostituting his granddaughter for political purposes, I m going to call it for what it is. If it were my granddaughter, I would not treat her like a prostitute like he did. He then went on to attack anyone and everyone who opposes what this militia is doing, calling them   bunch of effing communists  for letting the child speak at the meeting. Santilli ranted: What he did with his granddaughter is disgusting. It s called prostitution, okay? Except you gave it up for free  She s a young girl, she did just a masterful dramatic performance. The only reason that anyone needs to be fearful about what s going on around here are the corrupt bastards like her grandfather. He needs to be fearful because we re going to investigate and we re going to bring some justice to a judge. So, it sounds like this guy is not only attacking a vulnerable, scared teenage girl, but he is also threatening a judge. When will these yahoos be arrested?Watch the video of Santilli s vile remarks below:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8778, You Have To See The Trolls Who Repeatedly Shouted ‘BORING!’ At Donald Trump (VIDEO),"You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address. During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy. In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here   arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet. Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign   wait, correction. He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8779, FL Crowd Says ‘Amen’ When ‘Christian’ Man Brags About Molesting Children And Getting Away With It (VIDEO),"Jacksonville, Florida police are investigating a man after he stood in front of the City Council and told them he spent most of his life molesting children and getting away with it.The comments came during a Tuesday night debate over Jacksonville s Human Rights Ordinance, which would further protect the LGBT community in the city. Roy Bay, 56, stood up during the public comment part of the council meeting and said: I lived most of my life sexually assaulting kids and never went to jail. Because why? Kids believed me that hey this is, you re alright son. This is not a problem. Okay? This happens in homosexual lifestyle. Bay claims that the reason he started molesting children was because he was  sexually assaulted by the homosexual community  from the age of ten to twelve.The WHOLE homosexual community? Really? WOW.He said that he  entered into the life of homosexuality  afterwards and that is when he started molesting kids. He then claimed that in 1995 he became a  born-again child of God  and  God set him free  from his lifestyle of raping innocent children. When he mentioned  God  some members of the crowd began to clap and say  amen. News4Jax reports that the sheriff s department was informed of Bay s criminal confession and they said that there will be an investigation into his alleged crimes. There is no statute of limitations for child molestation in the state of Florida if the victims are under the age of twelve. So, it is entirely possible that his LGBT-bashing confession might land him in prison.Bay s assertions that the gay community is filled with predators like himself is completely unfounded. UC Davis published a 1982 study by Dr. A. Nicholas Groth that found that children are not in greater danger of being molested by homosexuals than heterosexuals:Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual.This is because, contrary to what Bay says, rape is never about sexuality, it is about power. The desire to have complete control over somebody is what fuels rapists and if Bay is the predator he claims to be, that is likely the reason he was raping children. The crowd members who shouted  amen  and clapped are probably the same imbeciles who support known child molester Josh Duggar. People like Duggar and Bay hide behind their Bible and commit atrocious crimes all while pushing disgusting stereotypes about the LGBT community to hide their own crimes.Hopefully, the police will find some evidence about this guy s crimes and put him in prison where he belongs.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot ",0
8780, GOP Bill To Derail Iran Deal Goes Down In Flames After 100+ Republicans Forget To Show Up To Vote,"The Republican Party is an absolute mess and we re starting to reap the benefits.While the GOP has spent Obama s entire presidency attempting to do nothing to help the country, they ve recently taken it so far that they hardly bother to show up at the Capitol at all. This is creating some really, really stupid problems.It s easy to see why House Speaker Paul Ryan was reluctant to take the job because one of the unenviable tasks he s expected to do is to somehow trick the hundreds of Republican lawmakers he leads into actually doing their jobs once in a while. It s not easy.Recently, an increasingly frustrated Ryan even told Congress that they needed to make more of an effort to show up on time for legislative votes. The process is supposed to take 15 minutes, but with lawmakers slowly trickling in when they feel like it, oftentimes it can go on for an eternity. (If you re getting the sense that lawmakers are behaving worse than high school students dragging their feet to homeroom, you re not the only one.) The lack of urgency means Congress hardly gets anything done. Members should be reminded, members should attempt to come to the floor within the 15-minute period as prescribed by the first ring of the bells. All sides of the aisle,  Ryan said. As a point of courtesy to each of your colleagues, voting within the allotted time would help with the maintenance of the institution. The chair appreciates the members  attention to this matter,  he said with a smile.Apparently, nobody listened, least of all Ryan s fellow Republicans.When it came time for Republicans to vote on a measure meant to derail Obama s historic nuclear deal with Iran, over 130 lawmakers, mostly Republicans, were visibly absent. It appears that voting for a thing they themselves had introduced had slipped their minds. An unhappy Ryan slammed down his gavel after 15 minutes and abruptly ended voting which vacated the tally due to insufficient votes.How big of a screw up was this for Republicans? The window to truly derail Obama s Iranian deal closed with Ryan s gavel. They blew it. Instead, Secretary of State John Kerry says America will begin upholding its obligations to the deal starting in a matter of days, barring any setbacks from Iran. Implementation day, which is the day on which Iran proves that it has sufficiently downsized its nuclear program and can begin to receive sanctions relief, is going to take place very soon, likely within the next coming days somewhere. In a supreme irony, many Republican lawmakers were probably catching up on sleep after spending last night giving breathless interviews disingenuously spreading the lies that Iran was holding American Navy service members hostage. As usual, their lofty rhetoric doesn t match their actions. If Iran was really so dangerous and they cared so much for the troops, would skipping this vital vote really be an option?Yet another example that the dysfunction in Washington stems largely from the Republican Party. As the right-wing movement continues to become swallowed by anti-government extremists who were once considered the radical fringe, even doing the jobs you were elected to do   say, pass legislation   can paint you as a  RINO.  Instead, many Republican lawmakers try their best to destroy the government from the inside by willfully throwing wrenches into the works. But as we ve seen, this  scorched earth  approach can backfire. During those times when Republicans actually do want to accomplish something, they fall apart. We see it here.Another Republican chance to hurt Obama goes down in flames by a needless unforced error due to stupidity, apathy, and laziness. What a legacy this Congress is building for itself. Republicans ought to be so proud.Feature image via io9",0
8781, Fox News Tries To Discredit POTUS For Saying He Wants To Cure Cancer (VIDEO),"When a president says one of his main goals is to cure a disease that has killed millions and is one of the main causes of death in the United States, one would think that all would applaud such a noble goal. Not so with Fox News, who found a way to try and discredit the president for saying he wants to cure cancer. Here s what the president said last night at his final State of the Union Address: With the new moon shot America can cure cancer. So tonight I m announcing a new national effort to get it done. Let s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. On Fox and Friends, the hosts said that the president or his writers got the idea about curing cancer from the show West Wing because the words he said were apparently similar to a scene from the hit show. Rob Lowe s character, Sam Seaborn  says: We ve reached for the stars, and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp. And so I announce to you tonight, we will cure cancer by the end of this decade. As usual, Fox has the tendency to sensationalize a message instead of applauding the effort of the president.  If you re going to rip off somebody, rip off Aaron Sorkin,  said one of the hosts, referring to West Wing s creator.Whether the words the president said are or aren t similar to a television show is irrelevant because the message itself is so much more important. One can only imagine if the country utilized all its resources to tackle a disease that has wreaked havoc on virtually every American family.Unfortunately, for Fox, finding a way to attack the president takes priority over a wonderful message. It s typical of their so-called right-wing journalism.Featured image via YouTube screenshot",0
8782, House Republicans’ Attempt To Be Cool With Snapchat TREMENDOUSLY Backfires,"Try as they may, Republicans have just not figured out how to connect with younger generations. They ve locked down a good portion of older white America, but it seems millennials just really don t want much of anything to do with them.However, in an attempt to try to appeal to this younger vote in an election year, the House Republicans decided they would join Snapchat, the infamous social app that deletes what is sent shortly after sending it. It s hugely popular among younger Americans, so they thought they d give a whirl.One problem, though. The man who they used in the GIF to advertise their Snapchat campaign was NOT happy they used him.How do you do fellow kids? House GOP will Snapchat the #SOTU https://t.co/5Tv5hb0GjP #SNAPoftheUnion pic.twitter.com/xc4XF3fmuR  mcbc (@mcbc) January 12, 2016You see, the man in the House GOP s #SnapOfTheUnion campaign is none other than HitFix writer Louis Virtel who also happens to be openly gay. The GIF highlights a moment he snapped his fingers while appearing on Jeopardy last May.Here s Virtel s reaction to being used by the GOP: Hey, GOP! Your candidates are horrifying garbage who ve done nothing for LGBT rights. Don t use my image. GOP, I think every day about closeted gay kids who want to kill themselves because their parents are ignorant, fearful Republicans. Dear GOP: The reason people liked my snap was because it defied regressive, homophobic, scary-ass losers like you. My image is STILL on the odious GOP site.

Likely both.The GOP will never catch the clue that younger generations just DO NOT like them for their blatantly derogatory actions taken against not only the gay community, but against nearly every minority in existence. They need to realize, hopefully sooner rather than later, that they are myopic in their views and archaic in their policy. They also need to learn how to make sure the people they are using in their campaigns are on board with being used. However, it s clear they just don t care.Featured image: GOP.gov",0
8783, Christian Extremists In Oregon Launch Campaign Of Terror Against Family For ‘Race-Mixing’ (VIDEO),"Christian extremists in Oregon are dragging the nation back to the dark days of Jim Crow laws and cross-burning, with a campaign of terror against a bi-racial family for breaching their racist rules on  racial purity .According to KPTV, the family in Salem, Oregon have become prey to a group of  Christian  KKK Klansmen who want an end to so-called race-mixing. The group have been sending the family handwritten notes containing racial slurs and threats of death   each of them signed with  KKK  and a Christian symbol of the cross. The report states that:One note said,  you and your family will die by the hands of me, die slow. Another note threatened to kill a family member if the police were called again.Brian Lewallen, a neighbor living in the same street as the family, believes the actions of these Christian extremists betrays their cowardice. If you can t deal with your neighbors in a way that is socially reasonable, then what are you doing aside from stoking fears?  he told KPTV.The local police force in Salem are investigating the matter. But as of yet, there are no suspects.The campaign brings to mind some of the darker periods of American history, where segregation laws barred non-whites from schools, universities, libraries and other public spaces. Where black people were forced to sit at the back of the bus. Where African-American men were called  boys , and white children had to be addressed as  Sir  by their black elders.The KKK terrorized the African-American community with almost unimaginable violence, as depicted in gut-wrenching images of lynchings like the one below.Warning: Deeply distressing image.Image via Atlanta Black StarIn total, the Klan murdered 3,446 African-Americans in 86 years. But the terror spread far wider than those killed.Now, in 2016, African-American and bi-racial families in Oregon are in a maddeningly similar situation as they would have been in 1926, 1936, 1946 or 1956. Under threat from Christian extremists, with an openly-racist police chief, and a GOP Party Chair who sold a pro-slavery novel which suggested African-Americans are like  retarded children.

8784," Man Without Shirt Was Shivering On Train, What Happens Next Restores Faith In Humanity (VIDEO)","Sometimes in life, with all the negativity that seems to saturate our media outlets, it s important to be reminded that there are still extraordinarily kind human beings still out there. One great example of this could be found in a recently taken video on a New York City subway train.NYC in the winter can be brutal. It s even more brutal if you re homeless and don t have much of anything to your name, including the necessary items of clothing to stay warm. On one subway train a man was without a shirt and visibly shivering as he sat by himself. However, what happened next was absolutely breathtaking.Another subway passenger strips down and takes off his shirt. At this point you can see this is where the video recording of the event begins. The man walks over to the man without a shirt, and not only offers him the shirt off his back, but also helps him put it on. And he didn t stop there. He went back and got his warm stocking cap and placed it on the downtrodden man s head.This good samaritan s name is Joey Resto, and according to ABC news: [He]  was taking the downtown  A  train to his home in Brooklyn after work this past Friday when he noticed a homeless man without a shirt shivering from the cold. At the time, temperatures in the city were hovering around 45 degrees. Resto said: He looked cold, hungry like he had just gotten beat up He looked so weak and frail. I had to help him, or he would not put it on. It just came from the heart. I don t know how anyone could have walked past him and had extra clothing and not given it to him. On top of everything he did, Resto still wishes he could have done more, and maybe had something warmer to offer him.Not everyone is the type of person to do what seems so innately right. Many stand by and watch as others suffer, but then there are people like Joey Resto who did what he could, no matter how big or little, to make someone else s existence just a little bit better. Well done. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, <span class=""mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span></span> = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&amp;version=v2.3"";  <span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">fjs</span>.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', '<span class=""hiddenSpellError"" pre="""" data-mce-bogus=""1"">facebook-jssdk</span>')); // ]]&gt;WATCH: Good samaritan gives shirt off his back to shivering homeless man on NYC train: abcn.ws/22Xc9pLPosted by Good Morning America on Tuesday, January 12, 2016Video/Featured image: Facebook",0
8785," Behold, Donald Trump’s 4th-Grader Response To Obama’s ‘Zero F*cks Left’ State Of The Union (TWEETS)","It s been a lousy 24 hours for Donald Trump s campaign to  Make America Great Hate Again    what with President Obama giving a  zero f*cks left  State of the Union Address that reminded the nation of the real gap between conservative and liberal politics. It s the difference between voting for Project Fear or Project Hope.So, how did Donald Trump respond to the State of the Union address? Did he point out any errors in the president s arguments of fact? Did he share a hopeful and ambitious dream for America which we could all get behind? Did he acknowledge the achievements of the president, but call for greater progress?Sadly, Trump did none of those. Instead, he reacted like an overstimulated, under-achieving fourth-grader. Remember the ultimate fourth grade put down to a teacher or authority figure? The feigned yawn and sleep? You re so dull you ve put me to sleep, Sir.Well, that was Trump s response to the 2016 State of the Union speech.The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic   very hard to watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016Apparently, there were too many grown up words for Trump to follow in this political event. He clearly got so bored that he stopped watching and decided to punch his GOP classmate in the arm to distract himself for a moment.Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016By the time he came back, the speech was over and he felt the need to pass comment. Although it must be said, he may well have just passed wind.The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016And with that, he ran out to the playground to pull on the pigtails of the girl he rather fancies but stands zero chance with.Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016Like any fourth-grader who can t compete in the spelling bee, or get the girl, Trump returns to the common role of playground bully. He decides that he s not satisfied with just punching that GOP classmate in the arm, so goes back to kick him in the shins too.Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016We ve already learned that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level, but it looks like maybe he is just a spoiled man-child in every way that matters? America, there s a reason U.S. Presidents need to be aged 35 or over   maybe we should have specified that was mental age too.Featured Image via Flickr",0
8786, Watch Paul Ryan Try – And Fail – To Hold In A Laugh During One Of Obama’s Jokes (VIDEO),"During last night s State of the Union, Republican politicians attempted to put on a brave face and avoid showing any sort of approval for a single thing that President Obama said. Some succeeded better than others.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan had the toughest job. Sitting directly behind the president, the camera was directly on his face throughout most of the speech. America cringed as Ryan desperately tried to keep his face emotionless and dead while Obama spoke. For the most part, the effect was to make Ryan seem nearly comatose. His dead eyes barely moved. His slackjawed expression radiated defiant stupidity. It was really hard to watch.The farce was blown apart, however, when Obama landed a particularly great zinger and Ryan couldn t help but break into a laugh. Knowing that even flashing a brief smile could send his fanatical Republican colleagues into a blood-thirsty rage, Ryan did everything in his power to stop himself from laughing. His face did things I didn t know a face could do. On live television, Ryan s face went to war with itself.Here s Paul Ryan trying reeeeally hard not to laugh at one of Obama s jokes pic.twitter.com/gqekuYJ1BF  GQ Magazine (@GQMagazine) January 13, 2016At one point, Ryan appears to physically put his tongue in cheek in order to keep it from betraying its Republican values.But if Republicans were trying   and failing   to put on a brave face, President Obama was clearly enjoying himself. In his final State of the Union address he took time to go over the many successes his administration had been able to achieve. He also used the opportunity to blast Republicans for the childish games they continue to play in order to score cheap political points at the expense of real governance.It s unclear whether Obama had known ahead of time that Republicans would be obsessively focusing on not smiling throughout his speech or if he just guessed based on past behavior, but Paul Ryan s idiotic attempts to avoid giving Obama any sort of credit perfectly accented the president s point. Need an example of how delusional the GOP has gotten? The Republican Party, which once claimed to be the party of ideas, couldn t even applaud when the sitting president of the United States said  America is the most powerful nation on Earth.  Even agreeing with him on that point would be  controversial  for these partisan hacks.Thank you, Paul Ryan. Your weird facial expressions can be used whenever America needs a reminder of where your party s priorities really are. And we ll try not to laugh.Watch the full State of the Union address below (Ryan s failed attempt to stifle his laugh begins almost immediately):[youtube https://youtu.be/j4Qp7DxYWYY?t=57m21s]Feature image via C-SPAN",0

No, the socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist tyrant Obama didn t have him killed, and he certainly wasn t taken out because he threatens the New World Order s agenda to use chemtrails and HAARP to kill Christians  Charles Carter died at the hands of a fellow conservative in an argument over (shockingly) a gun.Authorities have not released details of the shooting, which occurred in Grayson County, Texas, but the Paul Revere event page announced Carter s death in an emotional plea to God to give the poster  understanding  of the incident.Apparently, God responded, as the event page s current administrator, an organizer of the failure that was the 2 Million bikers 2 DC rally, Bill Williamson, had many more details later in the day.  I am behooved as to what has happened with Charles Carter and Vincent Smith from the Paul Revere event,  the admin complained.  The event that sky rocketed in a week has gone to hell and a handbasket in less then 24 hours Charles is dead, shot in the fore head by Vincent Smith.  The administrator explained that Carter attacked fellow organizer Smith in a drunken argument over a gun (though Smith was allegedly sober):I was in chat with Charles Carter most of the morning and I could see in his post that shit was not right within him. Shortly after Vincent shot Charles then I was on the phone with him and he explained what happened, Vincent was attacked by Charles that was liquored up and enraged. Charles attacked Vincent, snatched his side arm from him and was going to shoot Vincent. Vincent had a spare gun on him and was SOBER and faster then Charles Carter. Vincent Smith I Pray for You Brother as I am Praying for Charles Carter. I Pray that you both find peace. The Texas Marshal has ruled this a self defense, and from talking to Vincent IN DEPTH  I Bill Williamson BELIEVE HIM!  the administrator wrote.  If I am wrong them so be it. Right-wing online radio host Keith Williams also shared his sorrow over the unnecessary example of  responsible gun ownership.  Williams says that Carter was killed by a  fellow patriot  who  was suppose to be his brother in arms and friend. One of their fellow  patriots  says Carter was  shot between the eyes. Recently, the state of Texas made it completely legal to open carry handguns. While it is a felony in the state to carry any firearm while intoxicated, conservatives have traditionally opposed any and all firearms safety laws, viewing them as some sort of plot to grab guns from  patriots  like them. Unfortunately, we can expect to see  responsible gun owners  and  good guys with guns  (as the NRA calls every (white) person carrying a weapon until, of course, they commit a crime) shooting their friends family members, and enemies alike until we reform our firearms laws.Watch a video of Carter ironically begging conservatives to stop fighting with each other below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Stop behaving like childrenPAUL REVERE 2016 FINAL MARCH TO RESTORE AMERICA ( PAGE )WAKE UP AMERICA ( PAGE )Posted by Charles Carter on Saturday, January 9, 2016Featured image via screengrab",0
8788, These Memes Of Republicans During State Of The Union Will Totally Make Your Day (IMAGES/VIDEO),"Much like all of his other speeches, President Barack Obama s 2016 State of The Union speech was visionary, engaging and all-around amazing. Touching on a variety of political issues such as gun violence, addiction awareness, the Syrian refugee crisis, racial injustice and education, last night s speech definitely lived up to all of the president s previous State of The Union addresses and was possibly even greater.As we ve come to live in such a digitally connected society, it should come as no surprise that the internet started to respond immediately to Obama s final SOTU broadcast. As millions of Americans watched Obama, Twitter worked overtime to churn out a seemingly endless number of hilarious, quick-witted memes, capturing some of the most notable and comical moments of the event s guests and members of Congress. No one was spared   if you ended up on camera, you were pretty much instantly made into an internet meme. This was especially true if you were unfortunate enough to be a Republican.From GOP presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump to Kim Davis and Paul Ryan (who REALLY got it bad!), these memes have made our Commander-in-Chief s last SOTU all the more memorable. Here are our Republican-slamming favorites from last night s address:TwitterThis woman s face is something we can all relate to when it comes to Republican front runner Donald Trump TwitterSpeaker of The House Paul Ryan got slammed particularly hard! This particular facial expression has even been described as Ryan being  10 seconds away from throwing a tantrum.

8789, The Bundy Militia Now Has An ISIS Supporter Handling Their Computer Work (VIDEO),"David Fry is a self-titled  computer expert  that has joined the Bundy occupation at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. He is also a huge fan of Adolf Hitler and supports ISIS.A post that Fry made to his Google+ account read as follows: ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS FOR ISIS TO NUKE ISRAELHELL! Source: opb.orgWhen asked by OPB to explain why he supported ISIS and liked Hitler, he spoke about government conspiracies, plots against other nations, the September 11th attacks, the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, and a Jewish conspiracy to destroy the world with nuclear meltdowns.One week before Fukushima happened, an Israeli security team installing security equipment was there at Fukushima.Source: opb.orgFry explained that he drove from Ohio to join the occupation because he felt the Bundy militia consisted of  pretty good people. It was (a) miracle, that I got here,  Fry said.  I ve had quarrels with the government myself, and I feel there has to be some point where people have to put their foot down against the problems.Source: opb.orgFry is currently occupying his time using government computers to allegedly make a website for the Oregon occupation. The website is defendyourbase.net, which has various videos of militants, but it also has videos from video games and other very non-freedom related items, some of them from months ago.Why would a website made for the militia, have videos from months ago of some dude playing video games? It s a good question and I can offer one suggestion.Fry didn t make the website for the occupation.

Perhaps he retooled it a bit for the cause of liberty. The name  defendyourbase  definitely sounds like the video game angle is plausible, since in many shooter games you and your team have a  base  to defend.Here is a video that Fry made of himself from a government computer within the wildlife refuge:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k37CFeTLzeA&w=420&h=315] The Bundy militia officially has a Nazi-sympathizing, ISIS-supporting, Israel-hating, conspiracy-obsessed individual who got his combat experience shooting virtual aliens with a laser rifle in their ranks.

8790, Colbert’s Merciless Mockery Of Oregon Militants’ Supply Requests Is Absolutely Perfect (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon sure are soft. As their occupation stretches out, they have been sending around supply lists. These requests include everything from clean underwear to shampoo and conditioner. In fact, the mother of lead occupier Ammon Bundy has been making sure the militants are comfortable, by helping them beg for the things they need to keep breaking the law.Cue Stephen Colbert s endless supply of comedy. And no, Bundy s mother was not off limits. With regards to her helping spread the word about needed supplies, Colbert said: She would deliver the items herself, but the clubhouse sign clearly says,  No girls allowed. Colbert then went on to mock the militants  requests for things like shampoo and conditioner, saying: It s one thing to face off against the jackbooted thugs of the tyrannical government, (but) it s another to have to fight the frizzies. You want hair to bounce and behave. They really gave the Late Show host plenty of material when they begged for French Vanilla coffee creamer and throw rugs. They re either starting a revolution, or they re opening a bed and breakfast. It s just like Patrick Henry said:  Give me French vanilla or give me hazelnut   they re both yummy. Doesn t get much better than that. These people are nothing but a running joke, but, hey, at least it s great fodder for late night comedians.Watch the hilarity below:Featured image via video screen capture",0
8791," I Got This! GOP Melts Down Over Iran Detaining Navy, Obama Brings ‘Em Home (VIDEO)","As President Obama delivered his final State of the Union address, America once again was given a textbook case of the contrast between the right s erratic, dangerous leadership and Obama s calm and effective posture.When news broke that members of the U.S. Navy had been detained by Iran, the right went into meltdown mode.Marco Rubio said it was part of a pattern of Iran testing a  weak  Obama administration. Ted Cruz said it was  striking  that Obama didn t throw out his address and instead speak about the situation. Ben Carson whined,  While President Obama is complaining about global warming 10 of our American sailors are held in Iranian custody.  John McCain thundered that  Iran has already achieved a propaganda victory by announcing that they had  arrested  Americans on board American warships. Minutes before the State of the Union address was set to be delivered, Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) told CNN that the President should consider delaying it until the seamen had been returned while Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) described the situation as  humiliating  for Obama.The pundits were in action too, with MSNBC s Joe Scarborough tweeting,  Hey Iran, you have exactly 300 days left to push a US president around. Enjoy it while you can. After that, there will be hell to pay. But as we ve seen so many times over this presidency, while the right was throwing feces and freaking out, President Obama was getting something done. The seamen were freed on Wednesday morning without shots being fired, without a lot of noise and fury and drama, without a lot of unnecessary saber rattling.Iran has released two United States Navy patrol boats and 10 crew members who were described as  trespassing  in Iranian waters near a major naval base, state news media reported on Wednesday.The Pentagon and the State Department said that one of the boats had experienced mechanical problems en route to Bahrain from Kuwait on a routine mission on Tuesday, and the Iranians appeared to have accepted that explanation.Secretary of Defense Ash Carter praised the successful resolution: I am pleased that ten U.S. Navy sailors have departed Iran and are now back in U.S. hands. I want to personally thank Secretary of State John Kerry for his diplomatic engagement with Iran to secure our sailors  swift return. Around the world, the U.S. Navy routinely provides assistance to foreign sailors in distress, and we appreciate the timely way in which this situation was resolved. America was able to quickly and safely resolve the situation because unlike during the Bush administration, a diplomatic line of communication is now open between America and Iran. Instead of a wall of silence between the two countries, there is now a process in place to deescalate tension and an agreement now in operation to steer Iran away from becoming a nuclear state.Instead of freaking out and pounding his fist leading to Iran making the world more dangerous, President Obama has chosen the other path and it is a brand of leadership that has and will make the world safer.Featured image via Vox",0
8792, Kim Davis Utters Four Words To Describe Obama’s Speech – Gets Burned Alive For It (VIDEO),"Rowan county clerk Kim Davis already had her five minutes of fame; her time is over and done with. Or is it? At, least, it was until some Republican by the name of Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) gave tickets to President Obama s last State of the Union address to the Family Research Council, who then, in turn, gave the exclusive rights to one of the tickets to Mrs. Davis.Now, unfortunately, her five minutes of fame has been extended to six minutes. Heck, we wouldn t even grant her that right if she wasn t one of the top trending topics in the internet chatter world Tuesday night. But, the reality is, she is. For some reason, people can t get enough of Kim Davis   she must have all the makings of a star.A reporter caught up with Davis after Obama concluded his last remarks for the night, and uttered just four words of what she thought about her experience: It was a speech. En exclusivit  mondiale, Kim Davis pour l'AFP. ""Je voulais encourager tous les Chr tiens"" pic.twitter.com/yoCzflde2m  Ivan Couronne (@ivancouronne) January 13, 2016While not the kindest reply (it certainly was much more of a speech), it also wasn t the most thought-provoking either. But, hey, what else do you expect coming from the mouth of Kim Davis? Here is a suggestion for Kim, in four words:  just do your job.In all fairness, the internet was much harsher to her than her characterization of the president s speech ever was, and it s not even close. While it s never a good thing to be mean, she must have known a good roasting was coming her way.Here are a few of the top (and funniest) comments she received on the internet after so brazenly deciding to show her face on the most important day in politics.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Uproxx.Pic via Twitter.Pic via Twitter.What can we say? Kim keeps showing up in the limelight and we, as a people, continue taking the bait. She may not be relevant, but she sure is a target   no one can disagree with that. Her facial expressions were probably some of the most scrutinized, right up there with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. He appeared virtually emotionless throughout the entire speech, with a few slight movements here and there. It was almost like there was an unannounced contest between him and Kim Davis on who could appear to be the least interested in whatever the president was saying. Maybe they were playing chicken with each other; we don t know. What is clear is that Kim Davis will forever be in our memories, if not in our hearts.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8793, Nikki Haley Inadvertently Supports Obama’s Refugee Policy While Exploiting The Charleston Massacre (VIDEO),"Tuesday night, after President Obama gave his final State of the Union Address, Governor Nikki Haley (R-SC) delivered the Republican rebuttal. During her speech, though, she accidentally supported the Democratic Party s Syrian refugee policy while trying to exploit the Charleston massacre to take political shots at Donald Trump.After she was finished calling President Obama a failure, Governor Haley turned her attention to our immigration problem and the Syrian refugee crisis, saying: At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can t do that. We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined. That line about refugees is one Republicans often say to justify their refusal to help the desperate families fleeing from unthinkable violence in Syria. While this comment was not surprising, later on she said something that sounded an awful lot like a contradiction.Towards the middle of her speech, Governor Haley spoke about the Mother Emanuel massacre that took the lives of nine black churchgoers when a white supremacist decided that he wanted to start a race war. She said: This past summer, South Carolina was dealt a tragic blow. On an otherwise ordinary Wednesday evening in June, at the historic Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, twelve faithful men and women, young and old, went to Bible study. That night, someone new joined them. He didn t look like them, didn t act like them, didn t sound like them. They didn t throw him out. They didn t call the police. Instead, they pulled up a chair and prayed with him. For an hour. She went on to take a not-so-subtle shot at Donald Trump: We didn t turn against each other s race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world. So, while trying to exploit the Charleston massacre and taking shots at Trump, she accidentally supported Obama s policies. She said even though Dylann Roof did not look like the Mother Emanuel churchgoers, they embraced him because those are real American  values.  Haley is absolutely right! That is what our country is all about.The United States was built on the intrinsic belief that we are a free nation that welcomes everyone   especially the desperate, downtrodden souls of other nations. We are also a nation the does not let the fear of  others  overcome us and scare us into not helping people. Obviously, by this statement, she understands that the Syrian refugees perfectly fit this description and we should open our arms just like the beautiful victims of the Charleston did. I m sure that if you ask her if she meant her comments in this way, she ll say  no  and THAT is what makes them so great.Thanks for the support, Governor Haley! Obama appreciates it!Watch her rebuttal below:Featured image via video screenshot",0
8794," The Good, The Bad And The Ugly Aspects Of Obama’s Latest Presidential Report Card (IMAGE)","With President Obama s final State of the Union address is receding into history, FactCheck.org has released its presidential report card for January, and the news is mostly positive for the administration. Homicides have dropped 13 percent, but gun sales have surged.  The economy has added more than 9 million jobs, and the jobless rate has dropped to below the historical median.  The number of long-term unemployed Americans has dropped by 614,000 under Obama, but it is still 761,000 higher than at the start of the Great Recession.  Corporate profits are up 166 percent; real weekly wages are up 3.4 percent.  There are 15 million fewer people who lack health insurance.  Wind and solar power have nearly tripled, and now account for more than 5 percent of U.S. electricity.  The federal debt has more than doubled   rising 116 percent   and big annual deficits have continued.The chart below illustrates in more detail some of the positives and negatives, but at a glance, the president seems to been doing extraordinarily well on the economy, with the exception of income inequality and the comparatively flatlined weekly wages. An increased number of food stamp recipients since 2008 is never a good thing, but the good news is that the number has dropped since the previous FactCheck report.Regarding jobs, the following analysis of the decline in the infamous  labor participation rate  jumped off the screen:Contrary to many of Obama s critics, however, that decline is due mostly to factors outside the control of any president   factors such as the post-World War II baby boomers reaching retirement age. Survey data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in December show that those outside the labor force in 2014 said their reasons for not working were retirement (44 percent), illness or disability (19 percent), school attendance (18 percent) or home responsibilities (15 percent). Only 3 percent said they couldn t find a job, or gave some other reason.In other words, the Republicans often cite the low labor participation rate as a consequence of Obama s policies. Only, it s not. It s retiring baby boomers. Again, only three percent of the rate can be attributed to jobs. At most.Here s the entire FactCheck report card.Featured image via WhiteHouse.gov.",0
8795, How Kim Davis Got A Seat To Attend State Of The Union Is Just As Pathetic As Kim Davis,"If there s one person in this entire nation who does not deserve a seat at the State of the Union, it s Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis. Her reckless abuse of her position of power to deny same-sex couples the right to marry was outright unconstitutional. So unconstitutional, in fact, that it put her in prison.To top it off, she s not even attending to listen to the president, but rather just be a bigot counterweight  in the crowd. According to her lawyer, Mat Staver: She is not so much looking forward to going so much because of what President Obama has to say, she doesn t have much interest in that, as much as just to be there, to be a visible counterweight. The most bizarre part of her invitation is that the Congressman who invited her didn t even know that s who he was inviting. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) apparently didn t have a clue. He told HuffPo: I didn t invite anyone,  Jordan initially said late Tuesday afternoon, as he was jogging to House votes. When pressed on whether he had given his ticket to the Family Research Council, which then gave it to Davis   which is what a Democratic aide told HuffPost had happened   Jordan said he would have to confirm with his office.  I don t know,  he said.When Jordan was seen later, he confirmed the invitation: Yeah, so we gave a ticket to   at the request of the Family Research Council   we gave the ticket to Kim Davis  family I found out today. I m being totally honest with you: That s   Family Research Council asked us, her family wanted a ticket, and we said  OK.' Jordan seems clearly okay with the decision, because even though she s a criminal who didn t follow the law, conservatives nationwide see her as some sort of religious martyr doing her due diligence in the name of the Lord, Constitution be damned.Should Davis be able to attend one of the most prestigious annual events in the nation? Of course not. But leave it to Republicans and their quest to bring bigotry front and center as part of their party platform.Featured image: YouTube ",0
8796," ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Insults U.S. Troops, Tries To Spark War With Iran In Disgraceful Interview (VIDEO)","Nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK). The Tea Party Republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to Iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between President Obama and Iran s government. His ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves. Until now.On the night of the State of the Union, Cotton went on CNN s  Situation Room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about President Obama, even while a difficult situation was unfolding in Iran. On Tuesday evening, the Navy announced that two of its ships, and 10 U.S. sailors, were being held by the Iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory.Conservatives rapidly lost their minds, even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and, in all likelihood, harmless.The Americans were on a training mission in the Persian Gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into Iranian waters, according to the Pentagon. Iranian Coast Guard boats brought the vessels to a Revolutionary Guard base on Farsi Island, officials said.U.S. officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided, not captured, by Iranian forces. There doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side,  according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment.Iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly. No big deal, right? In fact, the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the United States and Iran is cooling off, thanks to President Obama s commitment to negotiations.Not as Sen. Cotton tells it. Speaking straight into the camera, Cotton spews lie after lie. His only agenda, to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from Iran.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3j8cFq6vUU]In labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage,  Cotton is viciously lying about the troops. They weren t taken by force. They aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory. Their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by Iranian ships. They never surrendered. The United States was never asked to  apologize  to the Iranians.But by fear-mongering to score political points, Cotton does risk inflaming tensions. Not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep, dark cavity where Cotton s brain allegedly lives. It s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of Iran is too much to ask for a Republican who is hell-bent on painting the Middle Eastern country as a dangerous enemy.As usual, American soldiers are being used by a Republican to serve his agenda. Secretary of State John Kerry couldn t do an interview with CNN, even if it might have helped Democrats in the polls, he was too busy talking personally with Iranian officials, coordinating the release of these soldiers.So going into tonight s State of the Union, where rhetoric on both sides will be high, ask yourself this: Which politician  supports  the troops more? The one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely.Feature image via YouTube",0
8797," Ann Coulter Gets EATEN ALIVE By GOP Strategist, And It’s WILDLY Entertaining (VIDEO)","There s something wildly entertaining about conservative infighting, especially when the person on the receiving end is Ann Coulter. She s not only racist, she s unapologetically racist, so clearly her choice for president is Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.As some say, the Republican Party may not be racist, but most racists are Republican. This was proved more so now than ever, and calling Coulter out on her anti-immigration/pro-Trump stance is GOP strategist Liz Mair.It all happened on MSNBC s Hardball where host Chris Matthews invited the two women on to discuss their viewpoints. After several minutes of meaningless banter, Coulter eventually settled on saying: It s all about immigration. It doesn t really matter what a Republican s position is on saving Social Security or how they re going to reform Medicare. Americans are being outvoted by foreigners, and Americans have been begging their own party to shut it down, to stop this endless immigration for decades now. As well as insisting that  Donald Trump is the first one to actually take America s side on immigration. That s why he is sweeping the polls. Mair jumped in and shut her down, saying: I think that that s a patently ludicrous notion. Most of the time, when we ve been looking at  amnesty fights,  they ve actually been shut down by a set of groups that are funded by population-control enthusiast liberal who is actually involved with zero-population growth and the Sierra Club. That s who s actually shut it down. It s not actually in any way advancing the economic interests of the American people. Free-market economists actually agree with that. Mair even goes so far as to call Trump a liberal. However, Trump is more of a  I m gonna say what makes me popular  kind of guy, and since his racism is working, he s run with it, or rather, on it. When Mair brought up that Coulter used to support Romney, Coulter bit back: My ideal ticket is Trump/Romney. That s what I m really hoping for. That s a dynamite combination. She s not wrong, that ticket certainly would be explosive for the United States, but not in a good way. Mair, however decided to continue tearing Coulter apart, saying: That is the proof right there that you are in no way conservative and no way interested in conservative policy. It s true. Coulter seems to only be concerned with being as racist as possible, and Trump fits the bill for that. Her love of Romney likely stems from the 47% remarks that were blatantly racist in his attack against President Obama and his supporters. And while conservative politics aren t always that blatantly racist, they aren t exactly inconspicuous either. Mair seems to believe that Trump supporters are just  liberals who just happen to hate Mexicans. Here s the thing   BOTH women are wrong about pretty much everything.So, while it was a pleasure to see Coulter get torn apart by a fellow conservative, Mair needs to realize that Coulter is pretty much the exact epitome of modern-day conservatism and conservative policy in the new GOP.

8798, Virginia Republicans Want To Verify Kids’ Genitals Before They Use School Bathrooms,"Conservative Christian lawmakers in Virginia have gotten extremely pervy and filed a transphobic bill this week that would force schools to verify a child s genitals to ensure that they re using the restroom that agrees with their  correct anatomical sex. Sponsored by Republican Del. Mark Cole, House Bill 663 (otherwise known as  Use of restroom facilities; penalty)  would prevent transgender students from using the bathroom that matches their gender, defining  anatomical sex  as the physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person s anatomy.  The bill states: Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Under the legislation, schools would be given the discretion and flexibility of letting students use a  single stall restroom  or  controlled  access to an empty restroom. The penalty for students who use the wrong restroom could be a fine of $50.Since the bill s filing, many have raised questions about how exactly the Republicans intend to verify a child s anatomically corresponding restroom. After the bill was proposed, civil rights advocate Tim Peacock criticized the bill, stating that  adults would be required to inspect children s genitals before they use the bathroom  for the law to be enforced. Peacock warned that the bill violated children s privacy, and was completely inappropriate and unnecessary: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections). This is just the latest   and certainly not the last   assault on transgender people by the religious right. In the past, Republican Colorado lawmaker Gordon Klingenschmitt tried (many times) to prevent transgender people from having access to public restrooms. Even Republican presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee has disrespected the trans community and made a disgustingly insensitive joke by saying he wished he d been able to say he was transgender in high school so he would have been able to shower  with the girls. Transgender people are becoming a target for the God-fearing Republican party more and more often, and protections must be put in place to control these outbursts of bigotry.Featured image via Mark Cole Facebook page",0
8799, Bundy Militia Just ADMITTED They Have Been Accessing Government Files,"Recently, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is looking into allegations that the armed militants who staged a takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge had accessed government files on the computers at the federal facility. The allegations arose after the group accidentally allowed Oregon Public Broadcasting to see that multiple computers had been turned on and government IDs and files were strewn about an office at the wildlife preserve. After Finnicum realized he shouldn t have allowed OPB to access the room, he quickly picked up lists of names and Social Security numbers by the computers, and hid government employee ID cards that were previously in plain sight,  OPB noted in its report   though Ammon Bundy denied at the time that his pretend army had touched anything: No, we haven t touched a single personal item. We haven t touched any of the computers, we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything. We re not here to hurt people, not even the people who work here. On Tuesday, terrorist group leader Ammon Bundy admitted that he and his followers have been going through government documents stored at the refuge. Not only does he intend to release the documents to the public, but Bundy claims that they will help get Steven and Dwight Hammond, two dangerous felons currently serving prison time for arson, released back into the population.Frighteningly, this means that the armed domestic terrorists now have access to personal information of Refuge employees, some of whom have already been threatened and harassed   causing them to flee the area. While Bundy still denies accessing computers, he fully admits to going through paper files at Malheur. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who manages the facility, says that because personally identifiable information may be among the files they have accessed, the agency is   is taking necessary steps to ensure employee and family safety.  Spokesman Jason Holm strongly condemned the actions of Vanilla ISIS: Removing fences, damaging any Refuge property, or unauthorized use of equipment would be additional unlawful actions by the illegal occupiers. Any movement of cattle onto the Refuge or other activities that are not specifically authorized by USFWS constitutes trespassing. There are sixteen full-time and one part-time employee at the refuge, all of whose lives are threatened by this rogue militia s illegal access of the information. Strangely, unlike unarmed and peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters, these terrorists have been met with zero interference from law enforcement, who has given them permission to come and go as they please. They re even free to be sent literal bags of dicks and other items from supporters and haters across the nation. Their presence creates such a strain that a Harney County judge has announced he will be billing Ammon Bundy upwards of $70,000 per day for the additional security needed in the area because of their insurgency.The militia s presence has caused numerous school cancellations up to 30 miles away, and forced refuge employees to work from home, at another office, or take administrative leave   as well as make locals fearful for their lives. However, the passive response to the Bundy militia may not last much longer. Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward says that law enforcement will not be intimidated from doing their jobs  and   there s an hour glass and it s running out. Hopefully, it runs out soon   before someone is hurt or killed.Featured image via OPB",0

Paul found out that he wasn t included in the debate last night, and couldn t contain his disappointment. Referring to the slight as a  rotten  thing to do, Paul posted several angry tweets about his exclusion from the line-up,  and even told CNN that he is boycotting the debate and  won t participate in anything that s not first tier because we have a first tier campaign. .@RandPaul: I will not participate in an undercard debate https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/s27wHk5elS  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) January 11, 2016Fox Business  January 14 debate marks the first time only seven candidates will be in the Republican debate, allowing candidates to be included based on the average of the five most recent national polls and the top five candidates in Iowa or New Hampshire. Paul didn t qualify, but he doesn t want to accept that. He told CNN: It s a mistake because the thing is we actually have been in the top five or six in most of the recent polls. In fact, last week in a national poll we were just one point out of fourth place. So I think it s a mistake to try to exclude me from the national debate. Continuing his temper tantrum on social media, Paul busied himself with retweeting posts from supporters that painted him in a more favorable light.Rand was so angry, that he also released this statement:And of course when all else failed to get his point across, Paul begged his  supporters  for donations to prove the media wrong:Paul has not had much luck in the polls, coming in consistently low compared to his fellow GOP candidates   but he apparently felt entitled to this debate and felt he should be given the chance to bore voters with his speeches, despite the fact that they ve already proven that they re not interested. For a man who was once considered the most interesting man in American politics, that s certainly a hard pill to swallow.Featured image via Medill DC / Flickr",0
8801, Bundy Militia Loses It Over Bag Of D**ks (VIDEO),"Last week, social media was filled with memes mocking the Bundy Militia s plea for snacks. Unfortunately for the imbeciles currently occupying federal land, America had a lot of fun and sent the militants a bunch of stuff that they did not like. Patriot  and well-known white supremacist Jon Ritzheimer posted a video on Facebook on Monday complaining about the various items people have sent the militia in lieu of the snacks, tampons and cigarettes the group asked for: It was really mind-blowing to me that people would actually spend their money (on this),  he said.  This box right here, $17.90 (for shipping). They spend and waste their money on all this hateful stuff to send out here to us and buy this ridiculous stuff. This one was really funny   a  bag of dicks.  Rather than going out and doing good, they just spend all their money on hate and hate. In the video you then see Ritzheimer rage sweep the stuff off of the table and onto the floor. He declares: We re going to clear the table and we re going to continue to do work and do good for our country. We re not going to be deterred, we re not gonna let you and all your junk and hate mail sidetrack us Honestly, we don t know what he s talking about. Americans were just trying to give him a nice bag of d*cks to snack on! They re gummy and delicious, why doesn t he want our gifts?Perhaps the best part of the video was the caption under it. Ritzheimer often exploits his military service to justify his hatred for the Muslim community, but under the video he says: To my family, I love you very much and I am sorry I can t be there with you. Please look at this as a deployment, only this time I m actually serving my country rather than being sent over seas to line the pockets of corrupt politicians. So, what? Now he doesn t believe he honorably served his country while in the military? If that s the case he needs to stop talking about being a former Marine. Our military deserves more respect that some guy who just rolls out his service when it s convienant for him   like so many other Tea Party Republicans do.I think that what this  patriot  really wants is more stuff. So if you have a few extra dollars to spare, maybe you could also send him some mouth watering d*cks to chew on while he is actively fighting against the country he claims to  love  so much.Watch his angry rant:https://www.facebook.com/scrappyphx.rider/videos/469856286535510/Featured image via video screenshot ",0
8802, Teary-Eyed 15-Year-Old Girl BEGS Y’all Qaeda To Leave: ‘I Shouldn’t Have to Be Scared In My Own Hometown’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that the Bundy militia s presence at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon is unpopular. Even those who agree with the sentiments behind the right-wing armed occupation of the federal property feel that it s best for the wannabe cowboys to skedaddle. Despite being offered a free pass out of the area, the ammosexual clan has made it very clear that they intend to stay  for years    even putting out calls for snacks, tampons, and clean underwear (mommy forgot to pack for them and isn t there to do their laundry) to help them on their mission to get even more free stuff.On Monday, Harney County residents put their differences aside and, whether or not they agree with the professed sentiments of the Bundy clan, rallied behind one thing: getting the armed madmen the f*ck out of there. While many made some excellent points about the grown men playing Army, one 15-year-old-girl s emotional plea stole the stage. I am 15 and I m a freshman in high school,  Ashlie Presley said, barely able to get her words out through the tears.   Being here with all this honestly has scared me. And it shouldn t.  She continued, fighting through the sadness of what the Bundys and their buddies have done to her town: I should not have to be scared in my own hometown. I know that all of my friends have been scared and have come to me to know what to do and I have to be the one to tell them that it s going to be OK, that everything s going to be OK. I shouldn t have to be scared, and none of us in Harney County should have to be scared in our hometown,  she concluded.While law enforcement refuses to take action and, for some reason, criminal prosecution seems unlikely, a local judge has vowed to bill Ammon Bundy up to  $70,000 per day for security costs to the county   so, at least it will become more expensive for Bundy s pretend army to continue its armed occupation of a bird sanctuary.Watch this teen beg Bundy and friends to stop terrorizing everyone below:Featured image via screengrab",0
8803, Daily Show: Obama Has ‘No More F*cks To Give’ At Final SOTU (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central s The Daily Show, is about to experience his first viewing of a time-honored American tradition: The State of the Union Address. To help him along in this endeavor, he called in one of his correspondents, Roy Wood Jr., who tried to help Noah to know what to expect.However, there was only one thing Wood seemed certain of: Obama is leaving office and he s gonna say and do whatever the f*ck he wants. Wood told Noah: More of a preview of the exhibits in the Obama presidential library   the Affordable Care Act, the climate change deal, how he taught not one but two Portuguese water dogs to fist-bump. But what I do know for sure about this year s speech? Obama has no more f*cks to give. Wood referenced the twitter photo, tweeted out from President Obama s official account while hammering this most important point home.This is it President Obama's final #SOTU. Say you'll be watching: https://t.co/W8niWpEVnX pic.twitter.com/NmLWydsePO  Barack Obama (@BarackObama) January 4, 2016Wood continued, commenting on Obama s smirk: Look at his face   he does not care. That s the same face I make when I m about to leave my job. He then went on to point out to Trevor Noah just what the SOTU actually is, and how the president is supposed to, no matter what, assure the American people that things are going great, no matter what is actually happening. You know Trevor, when America asks you if it looks fat in its jeans, it s not really looking for an honest answer. Just say America has a bangin  a*s and be done with it. And he s exactly right. And after all President Obama has been through, all the right-wing hate and obstruction, yet still managed to accomplish so much, he deserves to have a bit of fun.So, go for it, Mr. President. You ve earned it.Watch the clip below via Comedy Central:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8804," Oregon Judge Sticks It To Ammon Bundy, Plans To Charge Him $70,000 A Day For Security Costs","An Oregon judge has had enough of the hillbilly Bundy militia and is now saying that he plans to bill the leader, Ammon Bundy, up to $70,000 a day for security costs.The armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by the anti-government group has caused major disruptions in Harney County, and it doesn t seem like the merry band of imbeciles plan to leave anytime soon. According to reports, the group has used federal equipment to remove fences that separated the federal property from a local rancher.In addition to the damage they have caused on the property, the militants forced 800 kids to miss a week of school because the school board was worried about the safety of students.Police also report that they have had to relocate the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife employees from their homes  out of an abundance of caution  because the group possibly found out their personal information.  The group has been accused of illegally accessing the government computers in the building. Reporters with Oregon Public Radio claim that they say the computers on screensaver mode and a list of social security numbers out on the desks.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty spoke at a town hall meeting on Monday night and said that the militia is costing taxpayers between $60,000 to $70,000 a day. We re going to send Mr. Bundy the bill,  said Grasty.It s ironic that this group of jackasses, who claim to love the citizens of this country, are wasting taxpayer dollars every single day with this nonsense. Tea Party Republicans claim to be  fiscally responsible  and then waste $700,000. What s even worse is that GOP lawmakers are supporting the continued occupation of federal land and that is costing Harney County so much money. While these lawmakers encourage this behavior, they actively deny all sorts of social programs to low-income families because they claim that we cannot  afford  it. Seems legit, right?

8805," President Obama: Surely, Trump Can Only Be President On A Saturday Night Live Skit (VIDEO)","Only hours before he is set to deliver the last State of the Union Address of his historic presidency, President Obama found time to lampoon Donald Trump s chances of becoming president.The Today Show asked President Obama if he could possibly imagine a scenario where Trump wins on Election Day in November, only to receive a ten word quip in response.  Well, I can imagine it   in a  Saturday Night  skit,  Obama hilariously said.Then President Obama took a serious tone and warned that anything is possible. After all, who would have ever predicted that George W. Bush would use the conservative-leaning Supreme Court to steal the 2000 Election? That s why Obama warned Americans to not be complacent, essentially telling them that staying home on Election Day could give Trump the victory ever has nightmares about. But Obama was also expressed faith that Americans would reject Trump and his hateful rhetoric. I m pretty confident that the overwhelming majority of Americans are looking for the kind of politics that does feed our hopes and not our fears, that does work together and doesn t try to divide is that isn t looking for simplistic solutions and scapegoating. Vice-President Joe Biden was also interviewed by Today, and he warned that allowing Trump to become president would only make America weaker. He is divisive   I think he d have to acknowledge that he s very divisive   and that s not healthy. We always do best when we act as one America. We always do poorly when we appeal to our fears and our differences. Here s the video via Today.Trump currently enjoys a wide lead in New Hampshire and has regained the lead in some Iowa polls over Ted Cruz. It s not decided yet, but Trump appears to be heading toward becoming the Republican presidential nominee and he ll either face Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in a general election that is sure to be one of the nastiest presidential contests in history. Some Democrats have suggested that they will stay home if their preferred Democratic candidate is not on the ballot. And that is precisely the kind of complacency and irresponsibility that President Obama just warned against because that kind of divide is exactly what would let Trump become the leader of the free world with a Republican-dominated House and Senate instead of keeping him in Saturday Night Live skits where he belongs.Featured Image: Instagram ",0
8806, Trump’s Views On China’s Handling Of Tiananmen Square Will Make You Despise Him Even More,"The protest turned massacre at Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989 is one of the defining moments of the 20th century. The world looked on as a young man jumped in front of a tank to stop its progress a day after the Chinese military enforced martial law on civilian protesters. Reports state anywhere from hundreds to thousands of civilians were killed with possibly tens of thousands more beaten, wounded and imprisoned.It was a humanitarian nightmare so disturbing that the Chinese still won t allow anyone to talk about it more than a quarter-century later. Virtually everyone with a conscience condemned the Chinese for the unnecessary use of force they exacted on their own people. Everyone, that is, but Donald Trump.In an interview in 1990, when the blood was still visible on the sidewalks of Beijing, Trump talked about the massacre in an interview with Playboy Magazine: When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak   as being spit on by the rest of the world. Even back then Donald Trump was all about  strength.  To a nitwit like him, the strength of the Tiananmen Square massacre came from the tanks that ran over students on bicycles leaving in their wakes some of the most horrific images ever caught on film. To him, the Chinese government would have  blown it  had they allowed people to mourn the leader they loved and lost that led to unimaginable violence.Donald Trump sided with the Chinese on Tiananmen Square.His delusions about a  weak  America were also obvious. This was 1990. The Berlin Wall was about to come down. The United States military was about to wipe the Persian Gulf region clean of Soviet defense systems in use by Iraq. We were on the verge of declaring victory in the Cold War. How is that weak, exactly?The only people who perceive America as  weak,  militarily anyway, are the numbskulls who support  Donald Trump. We won t be looked at as strong if Trump is elected, we ll be looked at as stupid. Our country will lose what credibility President Obama has rebuilt after the disaster that was the Dubya administration.Rightfully so.Featured image via screen capture ",0
8807, Bernie Sanders Gets Some Pretty Outspoken Praise From Biden (VIDEO),"Vice President Joe Biden has nothing but glowing praise for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Biden, who contemplated a run for the presidency but decided to opt out, said of Sanders: Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it. And that is the absolute enormous concentration of wealth of a small group of people, with a middle class now being left out. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkFFh2M8rAc]Biden was referring to Sanders  consistent record of speaking out on and pushing initiatives about income inequality throughout his  career. Sanders has made the issue a central theme of his campaign. Biden also believes the issue of income inequality is of vital importance to the country. He said: There used to be a basic bargain. If you contributed to the profitability of an enterprise, you share in that profit, and that s been broken. Productivity is up and wages are stagnant. Sanders  strength is with young voters, with polls showing that he leads in double digits in that demographic. Many millennials, for example, have enormous college debt and they continue to have a tough time in the job market. Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, an organization that encourages young people to get involved in politics, said:  Part of it is really sort of the age that they grew up in. If you think about the millennials, that age group, they turned 18 as President George W Bush took office. That s the world they grew up in: their country is at war, it seemed to have lost purpose. And then as they were graduating from college the recession hit. So the social contrast that people generally have   that you invest in your education and you get paid off   was a myth for them. One thing is his genuineness. He s been consistent warrior against economic inequality since the 60s, and he hasn t changed a bit. Although Biden has not officially made an endorsement, he did meet with Sanders last October to discuss campaign finance reform.Bernie Sanders  campaign is moving in the right direction, gaining momentum at the right time more than any other candidate despite the fact that the media has not paid attention to him.  If the current polls are indicative of things to come, the Republicans better look out. Polls show him trouncing all Republican candidates, including Donald Trump by a wide margin.Featured Image: Marc Nozell (flickr)",0
8808, Ted Cruz Gets OWNED By His Own Harvard Law Professor: Calls Cruz Clueless On Constitution (VIDEO),"Laurence Tribe, who was Ted Cruz s own Constitutional Law professor at Harvard, visited MSNBC s The Last Word, to discuss Cruz s total lack of understanding on, and general contempt for, the Constitution of the United States.Professor Tribe said point blank that Ted Cruz only cares about the Constitution when it benefits Ted Cruz, or if he can use it as a weapon to hurt other Americans. Otherwise, he could not care less if the Constitution says you have a right he doesn t want you to have.You really can t argue with Professor Tribe s assessment of Cruz on that. He couldn t be more correct.Professor Tribe spoke briefly to the recent  birther  attacks put forth against Cruz by fellow Republicans and Donald Trump. He said that these attacks brought into light the glaringly obvious example of how Ted Cruz simply chooses to interpret the Constitution in any way that is convenient for him at the time, with no regard to the actual law.What this does is give us a window into the character of Ted Cruz. The sort of person he is, with respect to the American Constitution. Whats intriguing   it was true even when he was my student years ago   he used to believe in  originalism,  that is the Constitution always means what it meant when it was adopted- Except when it s not convenient for him to mean that. This is a perfect example.If the Constitution always meant what he claims, namely that if you got an American mother it doesn t matter where in the world you re born, you become a natura born citizen at birth. Well then, why in the world did congress need to pass a law dealing with naturalization and immigration in 1934, saying  from now on, although it wasn t true before, if you have a mother who s an American citizen, thats good enough? Source: MSNBCTribe s example seems innocent enough, but it speaks to a larger issue where Cruz simply doesn t care about constitutional law. Remember   we were still torturing people as recently as 7 years ago, regardless of what the Constitution said. Professor Tribe continued on even further in criticizing him even further, saying the Cruz he taught constitutional law to at Harvard is nothing like the Cruz of today. He implied that it was like the Cruz of today never studied constitutional law at all. Tribe also touched on some of Cruz s other comments, where he said that the Supreme Court s word has no impact on the law of the land. Professor Tribe could only describe it as  Scary.

8809, Watch Jimmy Fallon Give Mock Job Interview To Trump For Presidency (VIDEO),"Donald Trump made an appearance last night on the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon when Fallon informed the Republican front-runner that he would be performing a mock interview with him for the presidency. The usually aggressive Trump seemed mild mannered at times and appeared tired, perhaps from the toll that an election campaign can take on someone.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7jWw5lft4]However, Trump stuck to his previous controversial statements about Muslims, saying that although he has Muslim friends, they should be banned from entering the United States. He also took a few shots at Hillary Clinton, saying that he doesn t understand how she s not beating Bernie Sanders. Trump said: I mean, how can you lose like this? He really isn t even a Democrat. But he said he s a socialist, and I think he may be a step beyond a socialist. He also said that he would easily beat Hillary Clinton in the general election: I m winning against Hillary one-on-one. And I haven t even started on her yet, although last week I did a little bit. But we haven t even started. Later, during the mock interview, Trump was asked about his strengths to be president. His response was ironic since he described himself as a unifier of people, drawing uncomfortable laughter from the audience.This is the same Trump who has frightened millions of Hispanic and Muslim Americans in the United States with his rhetoric.Here is a transcript of the mock interview:Describe Yourself. I m an extraordinarily handsome person. I have a beautiful head of hair. I was always a good student, and I always worked hard. Why do you want this Job? Because I wanna make America great. What are your strengths? I think, believe it or not, I can bring people together. What are your weaknesses?  That I never forget. I m too nice too long, and when I become   somebody takes advantage of a situation, I become too bad for too long. Are you willing to relocate? I love the White House. This is a high-profile position. Is media attention something you d be comfortable with? Not at all. I d be very uncomfortable. Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",0
8810, What His Friend Barack Did When Son Beau Got Sick Brings Joe Biden To The Brink of Tears (VIDEO),"Joe Biden is as genuine as they come. For many, their first exposure to him was when they watched him decimate Sarah Palin in the pre-election debates with a brilliant mind, clever wit and award-winning smile. Four years later, it was Paul Ryan who looked like a deer caught in the headlights as VP Biden considered his preposterous answers in their debates together and couldn t help but bust out in that ever-popular Joe Biden laugh.Joe Biden is one of the good ones. He s one of us. He s not a wealthy man or a sleezy politician who manages to live large off of campaign war chests; he s just a man   who happens to be second in line for the most powerful office in the world.Last year we were thrust into the personal life of Joe Biden and his family when his beloved son Beau, who the vice president calls his  soul,  was taken from him after a battle with cancer. What many people don t know is the incredible support Mr. Biden received from the only man he can call  boss,  President Barack Obama. The president delivered a beautiful and unforgettable eulogy for Beau, but according to an interview Biden did Monday with CNN, that was just the tip of the iceberg of the love and friendship he showed the Vice President.According to Biden, after Beau had the stroke that began the path towards his passing, President Obama came RUNNING down the hallway of the hospital to see if his friend and colleague was OK. Biden assured the president that he would be; that he and his wife would sell their house to get by and take care of Beau if need be.In an incredible act of selflessness and kindness, our President offered to give Joe Biden and his family whatever financial support they needed to weather the storm. As he tells the story you can see the tears welling up in his eyes. He says repeatedly that he s certain the president will be upset that he made such a personal notion public, but this man obviously wants the country to know exactly what kind of man sits in the Oval Office.He goes on to talk about the president and his family and how they are HIS family. How the President s daughters have sleepovers with his granddaughters and how much the special friendship between them has meant.Warning: The interview is a tear-jerker. Never have I been more proud of our president MY president or more thankful for having had the opportunity to witness his historic and monumentally successful administration than I am after watching this video:Featured image via screen capture",0
8811," In The Midst Of Scandal, Office Containing Flint Water Records ‘Broken Into’","As the Department of Justice prepared to investigate Flint, Michigan s poisoned water, someone allegedly  broke into  a vacant office where the city s water records are stored.For more than 18 months, residents of the city of Flint have been sounding the alarm over the appearance, taste and smell of the water flowing through their taps.As Addicting Info reported here in January of 2014, the water had an offensive odor, foul taste and looked like  chocolate milk on tap. Yet for months officials in republican governor Rick Snyder s administration assured the public the water was safe. These assurances came even after independent testing showed high levels of lead in the city s water supply.As additional testing confirmed a sharp increase in the level of lead present in the blood of Flint s children, public outrage and heightened media attention followed.ACLU investigative journalist Curt Guyette soon uncovered a wealth of damning evidence, showing that Snyder officials knew that the water flowing into the city was not safe to drink. As we reported here the ACLU s investigation showed that officials rigged tests and falsified documents, repeatedly breaking the law, in order to cover up the fact that the water was essentially poison.On January 6, the United States Department of Justice finally announced that the agency was preparing to conduct a formal investigation into the Flint lead-poisoning scandal.Strangely enough, in the midst of all this, someone allegedly broke into Flint City Hall. On January 11, city officials confirmed that the alleged break-in targeted the vacant office where the city of Flint s water records are stored.Flint mayor Kevin Weaver and Police Chief James Tolbert have refused to say if any records were stolen from the office.When asked about security video of the break-in, Police Chief Tolbert said, The video doesn t show anything. How convenient that someone just happened to break into the vacant office where the city s water records are kept, just as those very records were about to come under intense public and legal scrutiny. The fact that the burglars managed to get in and out of a government building without being seen by anyone, or even caught on video, also seems pretty damn convenient.Across Michigan citizens have been calling for the arrest of governor Snyder, as more and more evidence emerges showing that he and his administration purposely allowed the residents of Flint to drink water contaminated with lead for more than a year, all while assuring them it was safe.Given everything we already know about Snyder, the odds that this break-in was not related to Flint s poisoned water are slim to zero.Rick Snyder s watergate scandal is looking more and more like Richard Nixon s every day.Featured image credit: Brandon Anderson, via Flckr under CC 2.0",0
8812, Ellen DeGeneres Tells Hillary Clinton To Her Face Who She Wants As President (VIDEO),"With the primaries getting closer and the choice for Democratic nominee for president becoming a choice between Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more and more people are letting their opinions be known when it comes to who they want to lead the nation.And while Sanders is definitely getting his fair share of endorsements, Clinton has been receiving quite a few lately. Between Planned Parenthood and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords giving her the nod back to back, now another person has told Hillary to her face that she has every aspect that they d like to see in a president.While appearing on the The Ellen Show, Clinton sat down with host Ellen DeGeneres, who then let her feelings be known directly to the candidate: I mean, I ve said it before, that you ve been held to a completely different standard than everyone else seems to be, you know, held to. You know what a supporter I am. I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president. And while this isn t a direct endorsement, this should really come as no surprise. Last October, while interviewing Pharrell, the producer/singer let DeGeneres know that he would be supporting Hillary, and she responded with: We have become a society where it is all about personality and celebrity and charm, instead of it being about the person who s gonna get the job done. And while we still don t know who is going to win the Democratic primary, let alone who will win the White House, Hillary definitely has the experience, know how, and wherewithal to get the job. She s seen and dealt with it all throughout her tenure in Washington DC. That being said, Bernie Sanders would still make a very formidable candidate, and honestly either candidate would be heads above any Republican candidate.Here s DeGeneres speaking with Clinton: // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt; I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president.  -Ellen DeGeneresPosted by Hillary Clinton on Monday, January 11, 2016Video/Featured image: Facebook",0
8813, Bombshell Reveals Nazi Connection To the Koch Brothers,"The infamous conservative Republican financiers Charles and David Koch had a family connection to the Nazis, a new book reveals.Jane Mayer, the New Yorker journalist who was among the first mainstream writers to document the Kochs  multi-million dollar campaign to effectively take over the Republican Party and the larger conservative movement, uncovers the connection in her new book, Dark Money.The book,  Dark Money,  by Jane Mayer, traces the rise of the modern conservative movement through the activism and money of a handful of rich donors: among them Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune, and Harry and Lynde Bradley, brothers who became wealthy in part from military contracts but poured millions into anti-government philanthropy.But the book is largely focused on the Koch family, stretching back to its involvement in the far-right John Birch Society and the political and business activities of their father, Fred C. Koch, who found some of his earliest business success overseas in the years leading up to World War II. One venture was a partnership with the American Nazi sympathizer William Rhodes Davis, who, according to Ms. Mayer, hired Mr. Koch to help build the third-largest oil refinery in the Third Reich, a critical industrial cog in Hitler s war machine.The Kochs, who are among two of the wealthiest individuals in America, stand atop an industrial giant   Koch Industries   that has previously been fined for being one of the worst polluters in America. The brothers use their fortune to finance a political machine that often pursues goals that would enrich the brothers by pursuing a hardline right wing agenda that favors big business and opposes government oversight and regulation.The brothers bankroll a network of groups that often hide their spending on political goals under tax laws. That is the  dark money  that Mayer s book title refers to. The Kochs run groups like Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, the Center to Protect Patients Rights   and then they are also able to flow money towards groups like the NRA, Americans for Tax Reform, and the Club for Growth.What those groups all have in common is their opposition to progressive ideals and their targeting of progressive and Democratic politicians.These groups also work at the state level to prop up governors and state legislators. One particularly potent success the Kochs had was helping Wisconsin s Scott Walker in his campaign to restrict union rights in his state. And the Kochs have cells working towards similar results in all 50 states.After spending about $400 million on the 2012 election, unsuccessfully trying to dislodge President Obama, the brothers announced plans to spend at least $900 million pushing for conservatives in 2016.Featured image via Flickr",0
8814, “Big F*cking Deal”: 10 Huge Things Obama Did To Fix America You Never Hear About,"When major changes happen, it is often difficult to realize they are underway when you re knee deep in day to day life. But when you take a step back and look at things on a larger scale, you can take stock of just how far progress has come.That is the case with a lot of what has been accomplished since President Obama was sworn into office at noon on January 20, 2009. Oddly, conservatives may be able to appreciate this more than the progressives who support Obama and voted for him twice. In their eyes, Obama has been radically remaking America, while progressives may often feel as if things aren t changing enough.Michael Grunwald s piece in Politico Magazine, of all places, goes through the Obama presidency and takes stock of the major changes that this president has engineered, many of which will reverberate through generations.Here are 10 of the things (and there are a LOT more) President Obama did:Grunwald explains further that Obama has not gotten a lot of these innovations   and many more   because he s been more focused on getting them done than taking a victory lap over them. He was determined to make his presidency consequential, as he believed Democrats and progressives had not done all they could to make as many lasting changes as they should have. He paid for some of these efforts through a loss of Congress to the GOP and a drop in his approval rating even as those who disapprove of him have benefitted from the stronger economy and widened safety net.The Obama years have delivered on a huge amount of  change you can believe in.

8815, Watch Hillary’s Unnecessary Response To Trump’s Ad Comparing Bill Clinton To Bill Cosby (VIDEO),"Short and easy quiz. Which of these things is not like the other?1) A serial rapist who drugged dozens of women in order to forcibly have sex with them without their consent. 2) A serial adulterer who had  sexual relations  with consenting women. 3) Hillary Clinton.If you answered  none of these things are like any of the others,  then you answered correctly. Number one is, of course, Bill Cosby. Number two is, obviously, President Bill Clinton. And number three is, well, you know. And yet somehow, Donald Trump and the traditional media have managed to conflate all three in order to taint numbers two and three with the rapey stench of number one.That s really all that needs to be said. And by the way, I thought more than a few conservatives have been defending Cosby against the growing list of victims who were allegedly raped by the one-time television and comedy star. But Trump is counting on the fact that his low-information ignoramus voters won t know the difference or, in fact, bother thinking for themselves for a change. Instead, they ll simply agree with Trump in spite of the facts.On Sunday s Face the Nation, Hillary Clinton was asked point-blank what she makes of this nonsensical line of attack from Trump.CLINTON: Well, if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that s his prerogative. You know, so be it.I m going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage, which affects two-thirds of the women, who are the ones receiving the minimum wage, protecting a woman s right to make the most personal health care decisions.That s why I m so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I m going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports.So, there are very clear distinctions. He can say whatever he wants to about me. Let the voters judge that. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made. It s been too hard-fought-for. And I m going to stand up and make it clear there s a huge difference between us.Yes, I get it. Trump is attacking Hillary for being a hypocrite by supporting women s rights while remaining married to a cheater. But it doesn t really make any sense. Guaranteeing continued access to affordable contraception and abortion services doesn t have anything to do with Hillary navigating a patchy marriage. But it s still an attack, I suppose.Frankly, Trump is attacking Bill Clinton more than anyone else. The message here is that a Cosby-like figure will have access to the Oval Office, and that s bad. Furthermore, there s definitely a bit of Trump racism on display here: Bill Clinton is just like a rapey black man. Run away! Trump s puritanical white voters won t like that, hence the Trump ad. The irony is that Trump s puritanical white supporters are also supporting Trump himself, who s had a rather spotty relationship with marriage fidelity himself.Bottom line: the ad makes zero sense, and it makes even less sense to demand that Hillary respond to it. Bill Clinton s behavior was Bill Clinton s behavior. Hillary had nothing to do with it. Full stop.Via Crooks & Liars:Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8816, Black Fox Guest Accuses Democrats Of ‘Literally Killing’ African Americans ‘With Guns And Abortions’ (VIDEO),"Fox News invited blogger Crystal Wright onto Fox and Friends Monday morning to remind America just how dangerous the Democratic party is for Americans   especially if you re African American.Wright, who is African American herself, went on the show to speak about her new book Con Job, which focuses on racial injustice and the so-called  negative impact  Democrats have had on the  poorer, dumber, and more criminalized  black community. She started off by talking about how bad welfare programs were to African Americans, but inevitably made a detour into other hot topics like gun violence and abortion. In speaking about the many assertions made in her book, host Steve Doocy asked the conservative blogger and author,  You talk about over the last 40 years, trillions of dollars have been put to fight poverty, yet poverty is proliferating in many neighborhoods because? Wright said, blaming the party that actually cares about Black Lives Matter, police brutality and social justice: Well, because of Democrats and the con that they re running on black Americans. They have made black Americans poorer, dumber, and more criminalized. Doocy asked Why do you say that? That s their end game? Wright answered: It s not just me. Look, 93 percent of   you know how the president goes around, wants to talk about regulating legal gun ownership? I ve never seen Barack Obama talk about the black lives being killed by other blacks in Chicago, DC, or Baltimore. Ninety-three percent of all black homicides are committed by other black people. And you know the number one cause of death among young black men ages 15 to 34? Guns. Illegal guns, cus they re killing each other. That s the con job. But yet, black people keep voting against their interests, and I would argue the Democrat Party is literally killing black Americans from the womb to the streets. Wright is actually (and not surprisingly) wrong   President Barack Obama talks about murder in places like Chicago often. Just last week, the president said it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.  Wright is also forgetting that 83% of all white homicide victims are murdered by white people   but yet no one talks about white-on-white crime.But no matter what our president has done in terms of racial justice, Wright believes that Democrats don t actually care about black people or the Black Lives Matter movement   they only care about getting black votes (she must be completely unaware of what her party does). Dissing Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton, Wright said: That is why [Hillary] is going out and saying,  Hey, black lives matter, but oh guys guess what, I support Planned Parenthood, the billion dollar abortion industry. Wright uses Planned Parenthood as an example only because statistically African American women are more likely to seek out medically sound and affordable abortions from the clinics.To give an example of a Republican candidate that does care about black people, she cited the always offensive front runner Donald Trump, claiming that he was the most pro-black candidate due to the fact that he supports restricting immigration.You can watch the bizarre interview below:Despite what Wright says about Democrats, there s proof that her beloved Republican party has also failed to meet her expectations:Featured image is a screenshot",0
8817, Priceless: Yelpers Review The Moron Militia Occupied Oregon Wildlife Preserve (IMAGES),"When the right-wing terrorists took over the Malheur National Wildlife Preserve, the first thought many had was of the guy pointing his weapon at a BLM agent from between Jersey barriers when the Cliven Bundy incident happened. When we learned that it was Bundy s own sons leading the charge to free a remote corner of Southeast Oregon from oppression, those fears were multiplied.Then something magical happened. Within hours we learned that the  occupation  would be a gathering of nitwits the likes of John Ritzheimer who were too stupid to bring enough supplies to feed themselves for a camping trip, never mind a  standoff  that Ammon Bundy said would last years.We learned that the desperate plea for snacks was foolish not only because these were supposed to be those survivalists we all hear about being prepared for the zombie apocalypse but because the local authorities suggested they just go to the store since nobody was watching them.The frightening became stupid and then completely ludicrous. Now what we have left is a group of armed idiots in a standoff with nobody occupying a taxpayer-funded retreat in a bird sanctuary, threatening to give the land back to the loggers. It was never going to go over well.At least we can laugh. If nothing else the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom have provided the internet with enough material for memes by the truckload, humor articles, op-eds and satire pieces for miles and enough YouTube parodies to last the winter if you re bored enough to watch them all.One of the most enjoyable reads you ll have during this debacle has to be Yelp, where  reviewers  have gone out of their way to make your tour of the preserve a memorable one. From large Cheeto-begging mammals spotted on the trails to toothless creatures in need of our support and protection, yelpers have made the incredibly ridiculous world of the Bundy Moron Militia even more absurd   and it is magnificent.Here are some images of the best Yelp has to offer. Enjoy! Toss in a few funny pictures for good measure and the humiliation of Ammon Bundy ands friends is just about complete: You can visit the comments HERE. Yelp has been cleaning them as they come in, as their policy is to not take a political stance on anything, but new ones are popping up all the time.

8818," Jealous Donald Trump Attacks Megyn Kelly Again, Says Nobody Wants To Woo Her (TWEET)","After Megyn Kelly shut down his attempts to woo her, Donald Trump posted an attack on Twitter that sounds just like the jealous rant of a creep who got shot down.During an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this month, the Fox News host described how Trump made multiple efforts to gain her favor in the run up to announcing his campaign for president last summer, declaring that she can t be wooed. He would send me press clippings about me that he would just sign  Donald Trump.  And he called from time to time to compliment a segment. I didn t know why he was doing that. And then when he announced that he was running for president, it became more clear. But I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. Indeed, Kelly has refused to take shit from Trump. During a debate in August, Kelly took Trump on and didn t make things easy for him. Offended, Trump lashed out at Kelly, claiming she was bleeding out of her  whatever. Even after Kelly went on vacation, Trump continued the vicious assaults with the help of his rapid conservative supporters.And now Trump has responded to Kelly s remarks in Vanity Fair by attacking her once again, this time targeting her for her looks and claiming that nobody wants to woo her. Megyn Kelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump,  the billionaire Republican presidential wannabe wrote on Twitter.  She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her! .@megynkelly recently said that she can t be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2016And, of course, Trump is only embarrassing himself. Say what you want about her political beliefs, it is undeniable that Megyn Kelly is not only a beautiful woman, she has a brain as well. Also, it s pretty ridiculous to say that nobody wants to woo her since she has been married twice. Clearly, at least two men have succeeded in wooing her while Donald Trump has failed repeatedly. It sounds like Trump is just jealous because a smart and sexy woman said  no  to him and refused to let him walk all over her.Featured Image: YouTube",0
8819, Disrespectful Prick Ted Cruz Will Snub President Obama By Skipping Final State Of The Union Address,"Instead of respectfully attending President Obama s final State of the Union Address like other Republican nominees, Ted Cruz is skipping it.The Texas Tea Party Senator made the decision to campaign in New Hampshire on January 12th rather than spending a couple hours respectfully listening to what our current commander-in-chief has to say during one of his last major speeches as president.Of course, it s not like Cruz couldn t fly in and fly back out after the speech is over, which is why this definitely feels like a snub of President Obama, especially when you consider that Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, and Bernie Sanders are all putting their campaigns on pause for the evening to hear what President Obama has to say.But Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler insists that this isn t a snub at all. Cruz is simply working hard to win New Hampshire, he says, even though Cruz is in third place in the Granite State 16-points behind leader Donald Trump. It s not a snub. He s going to be in New Hampshire, working hard to win New Hampshire. No disrespect. It just is going to work out this way. Tyler also added that Cruz will be be  disappointed  with the speech no matter where he is at the time it is delivered.  It won t matter because he ll be just as disappointed in New Hampshire as he will be in the chamber,  he said.Adding further insult and disrespect toward President Obama, Cruz intends to hold his own State of the Union hours before the real one in what the Dallas Morning News reports is being billed as the  State of Our Union Town Hall Meeting with Senator Ted Cruz. Basically, Cruz is snubbing the State of the Union Address to run off and pretend he is already president.And his disrespectful actions could come back to haunt him come Election Day in November.James Madison University professor of media and politics Dan Schill told The Hill that while Cruz s stunt won t necessarily harm him among Republican primary voters who already cheer anybody who disrespects President Obama, it may cost him voters who see this as being disrespectful. I don t think it will necessarily turn off too many primary voters in New Hampshire and Iowa, but there is that risk,  he said.  The choice to stiff the speech can send a message it s time for change. It may also backfire for people who see it as not respecting office of the presidency. In short, Ted Cruz is being a disrespectful little prick who believes he can fire up New Hampshire Republicans to vote for him if he snubs President Obama.It s one thing to dislike the man who is president, but disrespecting the office is totally unacceptable and proves once again that Ted Cruz isn t qualified to be president, whether he is a natural born citizen or not.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
8820, Watch Jennifer Lawrence PERFECTLY Identify What’s Wrong With Modern Day Life (VIDEO),"Modern day culture is far from what it used to be. Technology has taken over human contact and conversation, and people are seemingly forgetting what it s like the actually speak with a person who is directly in front of them. This forgetfulness can also be seen in the depths of Twitter as trolls seem to feel they can say anything to anyone at any time with no remorse for their actions or words because there is no human face attached to who they are attacking.A great example of this lack of human interaction experience occurred after Jennifer Lawrence won her Golden Globe for her performance in Joy. In what some people are calling rude, the actress was just being brutally honest and some people forget what it s like to point something out to someone s face. In actuality, the person who was being rude was a particular reporter who was asking Lawrence a question surrounding her win.The reporter begins to ask Lawrence a question, but the Oscar winner quickly cuts him off and says: You can t live your whole life behind your phone, bro  You can t do that. You ve got to live in the now. You know? The reporter continuing on, mentioned the Oscars, so Lawrence, being the quit-witted person that she is, drove home her point: We re at the Golden Globes. If you put your phone down, you d know that. Now, to the people calling Lawrence rude   Really? She was clearly giving that reporter her undivided attention and was making herself available to answer his question, and he was still staring at his phone. So, who was rude? It certainly wasn t Lawrence for pointing it out.If you go back and watch the Golden Globes during the part when Amy Schumer and Jennifer Lawrence were announcing each other s films, you can see that there was a jab at people using their phones then, too.We ve become a culture all too reliant on our cell phones and technology that we ve forgotten basic human interaction skills, better known as social skills. Don t call someone rude for pointing out rude behavior. Take what they are saying to heart, understand why it may offend you, because you may be just as guilty, and remember that human beings should, in fact, have human interaction without technology getting in the way.Lawrence perfectly points out what s wrong with modern-day life, and kudos to her for doing so. We all need to live in the now. Life is happening before our very eyes if we make the decision to look up from our mobile devices. Jennifer Lawrence calls out a reporter for not looking up from his phone. #GoldenGlobes #backstage https://t.co/anWeQCsIL6  Variety (@Variety) January 11, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",0
8821, Fox News To Viewers: Key To Winning Jackpot Is Buying As Many Lottery Tickets As You Can Afford,"The same group of people who believed Fox when the network was telling them President Obama was a Kenyan are now rushing to drain their bank accounts for lottery tickets after some characteristically stupid financial advice on Fox and Friends.While Fox was covering the record-breaking $1.4 billion lottery jackpot that has the entire country seeing dollar signs, one of their resident  experts  decided he would share his winning strategy: Spend all of your money on tickets to maximize your chances of winning.At first blush, Fox s expert, Richard Lustig, does sound like he knows what he s talking about. He s won the lottery seven times (at various amounts). His tips, however, are painfully bad. After saying there is no  magic wand  to help a person win the lottery, Lustig says there is one exception: Buy as many tickets as you can afford.In case you needed a reality check, draining your bank account on the off-chance that you win $1.4 billion in the Powerball is not a good idea. While the large pile of cash may seem enticing, the odds that you   specifically you   will be the one who wins it are vanishingly small. (The actual number is around 1 in 292 million.) Buying more tickets only increases your chances by a very small fraction. In all likelihood, you ll simply pay more to still lose.And the Powerball is this large for a reason: the lotto recently became much harder to win. This is no longer the game Lustig used to play, the Powerball has become a bigger mirage than ever. As ThinkProgress explains:In October, the consortium of states that runs Powerball approved a series of rule changed thatmade it much harder to win the jackpot. Under the new rules you select five of 69 numbers, up from five out of 59 numbers. The choices for the Powerball was actually reduced from 35 to 26. Still, this decreased the odds of winning the jackpot from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million.Why would the Powerball do this? Because huge jackpots create a media frenzy that, in turns, gets more people to scramble for lottery tickets. It s a profit-making scheme and it is working.Making matters worse for our hapless Fox News viewers, bigger pots don t make it a better deal for the average lotto player. Mathematicians have worked out that the pot would need to be vastly bigger (about 2.6 billion dollars) to make buying a lottery ticket even worth it statistically.Yikes.The hysteria surrounding the massive powerball jackpot is understandable (who wouldn t want to become an overnight billionaire?), but a respectable news outlet wouldn t run around telling its demonstrably gullible viewers that bankrupting themselves is the best way to become rich. Fox News, yet again, proves that they are much more comfortable operating as a 24-hour swindle operation rather than a responsible media giant with its audience s best interests at heart.Feature image via Media Matters",0
8822," Donald Trump Just Won A Major Award, And Ted Cruz Is Going To Be Devastated","Each year, the People For the American Way s Equine Posterior Achievement Award  is granted to public figures who drag America to a new low of right-wing extremism. For several years now, Ted Cruz has been  honored  with the top spot. But this year, the prize has been handed to Donald Trump.It s official Donald, you are the biggest horse s a$$ in America according to the adjudication panel of People for the American Way.Will Trump be as quick to crow about this victory as he was when he was crowned  Man of the Year  by WorldNetDaily? It didn t seem to bother him that the site is conspiracy theory central, and as Right Wing Watch points out, is convinced that Obama is about to throw every man, woman and child in America into a FEMA camp.Trump worked hard for this honor though. He labeled all latin American immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, he called for Muslims to be banned from entering the U.S. (even Muslim Americans returning from holiday), he lied that  thousands and thousands  of Muslims in America cheered while 9/11 was happening, and failed to retract or apologize when he was busted for it. Instead he chose to stand up at his next rally and physically mock the disabled reporter who had exposed his lie. On top of this, he spends the majority of time hate-tweeting any journalist or media outlet that dare refuse to kiss his trust fund tycoon posterior.This level of commitment to running for President as a bigoted man child needs to be honored somehow, and thankfully, People For The American Way solved the problem for us. Sadly, it does mean that Ted Cruz  winning streak is over. He will clearly have to work harder to win back the accolade next year. His brand of evangelical, homophobic, anti-choice, anti-science, pro-gun BS might well appall any rational human being   but there s a new bigot in town.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr",0
8823, KKK Leader Who Killed A Black Child With An Arrow Thinks ‘Finding’ God Gets Him Early Prison Release,"A few days after Christmas in 1992, Felicia Houston, 16, and two of her cousins were walking in an apartment complex when she was murdered by a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan in Monroe, North Carolina. Now, her murderer wants to be released from prison because he  found  Jesus.Russell Hinson was angry that a black drug dealer stole $70 from him on that fateful day. He told a friend that he was going to get revenge, I m going to shoot a n****r through the heart.  So, he and a friend, Guy Brown, drove around the apartment complex where the drug dealer was living, when he came upon the group of girls. The Charlotte Observer explained what happened next:Hinson and Brown heard their laughter. Then they saw them. Hinson reloaded and stuck the crossbow out the window. Don t shoot, Brown said. They re only girls.I don t care, Hinson said, One of them is going to pay.He fired.Felicia fell to her knees, her cousin testified, hollering,  I m shot, I m hurt! I m shot, I m hurt! Felicia died sixteen hours after she was shot and Hinson was arrested shortly after. The white supremacist went on trial for first-degree murder and it took an all-white jury just two and a half hours to convict him. Now, twenty-three years after shooting a child with a crossbow, he wants to be released from prison early.Dennis Long, Hinson s uncle, claims that prison  changed  him. He told the Observer his nephew  found the Lord  about six years ago and has expressed remorse about killing Felicia. The North Carolina Parole Commission will be reviewing his case soon and deciding whether or not he deserves release.It s always humourous to me that murderers like Hinson murder someone, go into prison and then claim to have accepted Jesus into their lives. As if picking up a Bible suddenly absolves them of the horrific crimes they committed. What s even more ironic is that this guy, a former leader of an organization that believes in white superiority, would probably spit on Jesus if he appeared before him. After all, Jesus was a Middle Eastern Jew.Hopefully, the parole board denies his request and sends him back to his cell where he belongs.Featured image via Charlotte Observer",0
8824, Ex-KKK Grand Wizard: Maine Gov. Right To Call Out Black Men’s ‘Defilement’ Of White Women,"David Duke is perhaps one of the most notorious Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan alive today. He also had quite a bit to say about Maine Governor Paul LePage s recent racist rant. LePage suggested that black drug dealers are coming into his state and selling drugs, and while they re at it, getting white women pregnant.Of course, the backlash was ferocious for LePage s remarks, and he tried to walk them back.  But David Duke, being the vile racist that he is, devoted airtime on a recent edition of his radio show to defend LePage. Calling LePage s racism the Trump effect of people not talking in politically correct manner,  Duke said: You are probably picking yourself off the floor to think that an elected governor in the United States of America would actually talk about this horrible destruction and defilement of young white women. These are not Anglo-Saxon guys from rural Maine doing this. These are, again, like the Puff Diddys   or whatever they want to call themselves   from New York. So, a black man having sex with a white woman is  defilement.  These remarks are especially egregious, considering the history in the United States of black men being lynched at the drop of a hate when a white woman cries rape. In the eyes of racists, there is nothing worse than a white woman coupling with a black man. If David Duke thought the historical context of what he is saying here would be lost on the rest of us, he is dead wrong.Duke also had a guest on his show who echoed his racist beliefs, Pastor Mark Dankof. Duke and Dankof then turned their attentions to Democratic Presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, because of her speaking out against police brutality against people of color. Duke said to Dankof: Isn t this the same Hillary Clinton who has constantly told us about black people being victimized by police? She says that this is a racist problem that police are shooting down blacks. When the fact is, they shoot down proportionally a far higher capita of a white person who acts criminally. This is a lie, of course. See the Bundy militia for Exhibit A. If those were black people, they d have been dead the first day. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is white privilege. But then again, of course the likes of David Duke would never understand that, and nor would he want to.Duke s full comments can be heard here, at his media archive.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8825, Fox News Host Calls For American Muslims With Links To ISIS To Be Executed Without Trial (VIDEO),"Fox News host,Judge Jeanine Pirro appeared to endorse the summary execution of Muslims suspected of links to ISIS-related terrorism without due process under the law.Pierre asked her viewers if the U.S. should apply the death penalty for ISIS-related violence. There was no real definition of what scale of violence or links to ISIS would apply. And the U.S. already lists 41 crimes as capital   meaning they are punishable by death   including murder, assassination, espionage, treason, and death resulting from aircraft hijacking. It is not supposed to matter what religious, racial or other motivation a suspect has of committing these crimes   the court is only interested in whether they committed the acts or not.In short, there is no need for a new capital crime specific to Muslims. Unless of course, you re a Fox News blowhard with an axe to grind.The responses from her viewers began as expected.A viewer named Josephine raged: They aren t afraid to kill us, so why should we be afraid to give them the death penalty? While Kevin wrote: We ve got a few guns down here in Texas, and more than happy to handle it!, Pierre reads this out with a grin reaching from ear-to-ear as if she s about to break out into a  Happy Birthday  song or something   when she is infact, calling for the summary execution of Muslims.She reads out Al s comment with the same hysterical smirk on her face: Why waste taxpayer money holding them in prison? They d kill us in a heartbeat. Adding her own snarky reply: Hey Al, and if we held them in prison Obama would let them out! But even amongst the viewership of Fox News, there are some people who have a respect for law and order   and the need to actually investigate a person suspected of committing a crime, rather than arbitrarily killing them. One such viewer, named Kimberly, said: Don t get ahead of yourselves. Everyone deserves a fair trial. Let the courts decide. This sent Pirro into a rage-induced tailspin of a rant in which she saw fit to lecture Kimberly. Hey Kimberly,  she snorts.  I drafted legislation all the time to increase sentences for punishment. The courts are the ones that implement the laws that we draft. Here we have a Fox News host openly endorsing the summary execution of Muslims, presumably Muslim-Americans, who are even suspected of ISIS-related violence. A channel which calls it unconstitutional to ask a white christian to register his gun, thinks it s totally appropriate to summarily execute a Muslim. Fair and balanced? Not a chance.Featured Image vis Screengrab",0
8826, Chuck Todd GRILLS Trump For Attacking Clinton: ‘Your First Divorce Was Ugly’ (VIDEO),"On NBC s Meet The Press, host Chuck Todd cornered Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump for his attacks on Hillary Clinton s marriage and the sexual indiscretions of her husband by pointing out something Trump doesn t want Americans to focus on   his own romantic history.During the segment, Trump continued his attacks on the Democratic front runner by bringing up ex-president Bill Clinton s controversial sexual past in response to her admission that Trump had a  penchant for sexism.  Trump called the former president  an abuser  and brought up the fact that there were sexual allegations against him.Confronting Trump for his threatened attacks against Clinton, Todd told the business mogul that if he continued to go after Clinton in this way, his own marital disasters would come bubbling to the surface and be back to bite him in the *ss. Todd reminded him: Your first divorce was ugly  All over the tabloids. Trump shrugged and stated that his own struggles from his love life mattered far less than Clinton s and weren t really up for discussion or ridicule. He said, You know what? I wasn t the President of the United States, and I wasn t dealing in the Oval Office, all right? Big difference. Trump then lied through his teeth and claimed that his first wife Ivana considers him  great    leaving out the part where he d actually cheated on her with Georgia beauty queen Marla Maples, who became his second wife. Trump also conveniently failed to mention that he has also been accused of  violent  sexual assault (by Ivana herself) and has a long history of misogyny.You can watch the footage below, courtesy of Mediaite:Although Trump said that Clinton s camp has been  unresponsive  to his attacks, Clinton responded to Trump this morning, stating that American voters didn t want to relitigate the past.Featured image is a screengrab",0
8827, David Bowie Using MTV Interview To Blast MTV’s Racism Is A Beautiful Reminder Of Icon’s Impact,"While the enormous sense of loss the world experienced upon learning of legendary pop icon David Bowie s passing from cancer at 69 has been understandably hard to accept, the impact that the legendary pop icon had on society cannot be overstated. During his ever-changing, boundary-pushing career, Bowie continuously used his celebrity and visibility to shed light on social issues that were being ignored.As we mourn the loss of Bowie, it s worth taking a moment to recall just one time that the singer called out injustice in the most rock n  roll way imaginable.In 1983, Bowie was shocked to learn that many of his African-American musical peers were being purposely ignored by MTV because  black music  was making white Americans uncomfortable. Never one to let people s discomfort dictate how he behaved, Bowie blasted the music network for its cowardice.Using an interview with MTV as an ironic platform for critiquing the network, Bowie grilled MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the network s shameless whitewashing. The exchange has become a legendary example of Bowie s sheer lack of patience for bullshit.There are many reasons to love David Bowie. Here's one. 1982: challenging MTV on their refusal to play black music: pic.twitter.com/0ku30wccVG  Charlene White (@CharleneWhite) January 11, 2016Like many television networks, MTV had decided to censor black performers so as to not offend the predominately white audience from  middle America.  Unlike the other networks, however, MTV was marketed on the premise of being edgy and revolutionary. Bowie revealed what a sham that image was. Is there anything less rock n  roll than being cowered by white, middle class mom s from Iowa who were afraid to see Prince or Rick James on television?Bowie (along with James, who explicitly called the network racist in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine) had brought up an issue that could no longer be ignored. It also may have saved MTV from itself. Just months after the public backlash, MTV exploded with the release of Michael Jackson s  Billie Jean,  followed by  Thriller.  The music videos would become among the most iconic ever released and, to many, would later come to define what a  music video is.Bowie passed away on January 10, 2016, but it s clear that his music, and his legacy, will live on for much, much longer. To honor him, we should not just listen to the incredible wealth of music he left us, but also never be afraid to stand up to inequality and injustice, wherever we find it.Feature image via Wikipedia",0
8828, SIX Republican Lawmakers Have Quietly Met With The Bundy Militia In Oregon,"When Cliven Bundy was engaged in an armed standoff against federal authorities in 2014 on his Nevada ranch, Republicans like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and a host of others threw their support squarely behind the criminal. Now, less than two years later, his sons are engaged in an armed occupation of a federal wildlife reserve in Oregon and six GOP lawmakers from various states have gone to meet them to applaud the latest criminal act waged by far-right, anti-government extremists.Rep. Dallas Heard (R-OR) recently brought in a group of out-of-state lawmakers to meet with the Bundy Militia, against the recommendations of law enforcement officials. The other five Republicans include Reps. Graham Hunt and Matt Shea of Washington; Reps. Judy Boyle, Heather Scott and Sage Dixon of Idaho. Another GOP fool, Rep. Michelle Fiore of Nevada, took part in the meeting by telephone. Fiore, if you remember, is the same lawmaker who said she would like to shoot Syrian refugees. A real gem.On the meeting with the other lawmakers and Bundy nuts she said: It s refreshing to see a representative like Dallas Heard care and lean on the side of citizens, versus our federal government Everyone knows I m a supporter of the Bundy family. Our relationship is pretty well documented. To be perfectly clear, she is a supporter of people who have pointed guns at federal law enforcement officials and others who have threatened to shoot anyone who tried to forcibly remove them from the land they are illegally occupying. By doing so, she, and her fellow Republicans, support the Sovereign Citizen movement the Bundys belong to. The movement that police officers all across the country have deemed on of the most dangerous threats to this country   possibly more so than the Islamic terrorists she claims to be so worried about.According to The Oregonian: Heard confirmed the meeting with the militants, including top leader Ammon Bundy, in a phone conversation. He described the trip as  a fact-finding mission.  Heard said he was worried about violence and wanted to prevent another tragedy such as the shooting last year at Umpqua Community College, which is in his district. I was concerned that some of my constituents might have been mixed up in this,  Heard said.  A good shepherd s job is to take care of all his flock. So, in order to prevent another massacre by an ammosexual(s), he went and supported with the very people who have said they want to engage the federal authorities in a Wild West shoot out and made videos saying  goodbye  to their family members? That seems legit.By meeting with these dipsh*ts, Republicans encouraged their dangerous behavior. The Bundy hillbillies are already emboldened by their father s success at holding off police officers by threatening to kill them, now they are receiving the same support he did. The more people applaud their volatile behavior, the less likely they will be to end their asinine occupation of the Refuge. Furthermore, while it is our lawmakers  jobs to represent us, it is borderline treasonous to represent a group of people who want to take over the government.Republicans, always showing how much they love America.Featured image via Twitter",0
8829, Stephen King Plows Through What’s Left Of Disgraced GOP Governor LePage’s Dignity (TWEET),"Being a resident of the beautiful state of Maine myself, I have a special place in my heart for Stephen King. His vocal opposition   or rather downright hatred   for Republican Governor Paul LePage has made him even more likable to those of us who have witnessed the second-term antics and complete disintegration of what little integrity  Governor LeRampage  had left.His first term was a nightmare. His re-election was made possible by a third-party run from a rich buddy pretending to be a Democrat. Watching him campaign on a platform of hatred for the poor and fear of the few thousand Somali refugees living in the Portland area was terrifying, especially when it became apparent that he would win a second term.In that second term, LeRampage has amped up his fight for the wealthy, essentially destroying the food stamp program and creating a quagmire of restrictions and red tape to sort through for any other kind of assistance that people have stopped bothering to try, opting instead to reverse Lepage s one victory as governor by increasing the crime rate that was at a 40-year low.People gotta eat. When the governor takes away their means without providing an environment that creates sufficient jobs, they do whatever they can to feed themselves and their families. They aren t running to the supermarket with the promise of lower property taxes for oceanfront millionaires.After LePage s latest racist rant sparked outrage around the country, Stephen King, whose tweets at LeRampage have earned him quite a few hearts and arrows on Twitter, sent this out on Sunday, tearing down what little dignity the governor may have had left:One must admit LePage has elevated assholery to a level far past the extraordinary and into a rarified sphere that might be termed divine.  Stephen King (@StephenKing) January 8, 2016Ahhhh The beauty of a Stephen King passage that will stand the test of time. The man just has a way with words. By taking everything the failed governor has ever done and reducing it to a single act of  divine  a**holery, King has summed up the feelings and frustrations of hundreds of thousands of Mainers who lament that they allowed this man to be elected, never mind re-elected.Thank you, Stephen King, for this wonderful tweet. And for Pet Semetary. Still one of my favorites.Featured image via Twitter",0
8830," WATCH: 20 Years Ago, David Bowie Saw America’s Dark Future","Almost 20 years ago, David Bowie released a music video in conjunction with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails that was disturbingly prophetic. The song  I m Afraid of Americans  was heavily critical of the accelerating dumbing down of American culture. The video took a slightly different tack and was heavily critical of America s increasingly out of control obsession with guns. Together, they gave us a painfully accurate glimpse of America two decades later: Loudly belligerent, proudly ignorant and dangerously violent.And this video was released back in 1997, well before America declared war on the Middle East and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of revenge, racism and religion. When Bowie sings the lyric,  God is an American,  he wasn t commenting on religion so much as commenting on America s theocratic tendencies and what they mean for the rest of the world.  I m Afraid of Americans  might as well be the national anthem of any country with a sizable Muslim population. Or oil. And Allah help you if your country has both.But the predictions didn t stop there. With a few simple lyrics like  Johnny wants a brain, Johnny wants to suck on a Coke,  Bowie accidentally summed up the entire career of Sarah Palin:The video is just as prescient, showing several scenes of Americans pantomiming gun violence. It turns out that David Bowie s character in the video is being delusional (no one had a gun) but it s an accurate reflection of how the world saw the United States back then. Even more so now than in 1997. Not for nothing, in 2015, we averaged more than one mass shooting a day. What s horrors await us in 2016?Here s  I m Afraid of Americans. On Sunday, January 10, 2016, David Bowie died of liver cancer after an 18 month fight. His musical legacy stretches decades and for anyone over the age of 35, he was an integral part of their childhood dreams and nightmares. Long live Jareth the Goblin King!Featured image via screencap.",0
8831, Why Is Mitch McConnell Suddenly So Afraid To Declare War On ISIS?,"Let s face it, Obama s second term has been so wildly successful, the only thing Republicans can do to prevent him from being the greatest president in modern history is to block everything. This even includes things that Republicans keep screaming are necessary for the safety of the nation.If you need evidence of this, just look at Mitch McConnell s recent statement regarding ISIS, and why he claims he won t allow Obama s request for congressional approval for war come up for a vote.Well, the problem with what the president submitted for authorization to use military force restricted what he could do. I can t imagine that I would be voting for an authorization for the use of military force that Barack Obama would sign because the one he submitted for us to take a look at restricted his activities, what he could do based upon conditions on the ground.Look, I don t want to tie the hands of the next president. The next president may want to actually defeat ISIL. And I think an AUMF, an authorization to use military force, that ties the president s hands behind his back is not something I would want to do to a new president who s going to have to clean up this mess, created by all of this passivity over the last eight years.McConnell s Obama Derangement Syndrome is so bad that he is literally refusing to allow Obama to go to war with, of all things, ISIS. It would be hilarious if it was another nation doing this.Mitch McConnell is officially afraid that Obama will be able to defeat ISIS before he leaves office. The Obama coalition has already liberated about forty percent of previously held ISIS territory and has prevented any gains by them since May of 2015. If McConnell holds a vote for authorization for war against ISIS, every Republican would have to vote yes to approve Obama s actions. If they didn t, the knives would come out for every one of them in the next election cycle. If they vote yes, they would be seen as cooperating with the president. If Obama made significant progress in the fight against the terror group, Republicans couldn t run on ISIS in 2016 and 2018. If something bad happened, every Republican would get challenged for supporting a  failed Democratic president. The only way Republicans can stay safe is by doing absolutely nothing to fight what they would otherwise call the greatest threat to America. That is just plain cowardly.Featured image via barefoot and progressive (altered)",0
8832, Ricky Gervais SLAMS ‘Future President’ Donald Trump’s Racism At Golden Globes (VIDEO),"It s pretty much a well-known fact that real estate mogul, reality television star, and the current Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is an unabashed racist. Of course, he ll say that he s not, as most racists do, but actions, and well, words   his very loud words   speak very clearly his disdain for pretty much everyone who isn t white. His rallies have become pretty much a who s who in white supremacy.Playing off Trump s frontrunner status and obvious racism was this year s Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais. While introducing actresses Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, both gorgeous, strong Latina goddesses women, Gervais was able to roast The Donald. He began his introduction saying: Eva Longoria and America Ferrera aren t just beautiful, talented actresses. They re also two people who your future president, Donald Trump, can t wait to deport. This was an obvious slam at Trump s position on Latinos, who he claims are rapists, murderers, etc., and he promises to deport them all. Well, the  illegal  ones, but really, his constant hatred of everything Latino is pretty much racism at its worst.Here s the introduction from Gervais:Then once the women were on the stage, Longoria and Ferrera seemed to poke fun at Hollywood and society in general who can t seem to tell one Latina actress from the next. And if you want to talk about under-representation in Hollywood, ask a Latina, Black or Asian actress about all the leading roles they get asked to play.The women begin, saying: Hi, I m Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes. I m America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguezz. And neither one of us are Rosario Dawson,  Longoria continued. Well said, Selma,  Ferrera noted. Thank you, Charo,  Longoria responded.It was a subtle jab, but brilliant nonetheless.Here are the beautiful ladies via Vulture: In regards to Trump and his obvious racism, one person who made sure to  thank  the hotel magnate was America Ferrera herself. In a piece written for Huffington Post last summer, Ferrera wrote: You, Mr. Trump, are living in an outdated fantasy of a bigoted America. Last week, America celebrated some amazing milestones   marriage equality, universal healthcare, removing of the confederate flag   making it clear in which direction the country is moving. That is why racist remarks that play to extremists won t change the tide, no matter how hard you try. They will only serve to rally more Latino voters to the polls. Your negativity and your poorly thought out speech ignited a fire in our community. Thank you, Mr. Trump!Thank you for reminding us that there remains an antiquated and endangered species of bigots in this country that we must continue to combat. Thank you for reminding us to not sit complacently at home on election day, but to run to the polls and proclaim that there is no place for your brand of racial politicking in our government. Thank you for sending out the rallying cry.You have made your thoughts on the Latino community clear and you continue to stand by them. And in return, we will do more than tweet about our indignation and beat pi atas of your likeness. We will silence you at the polls. We will vote and use our growing position in U.S. politics. Our fellow Americans who understand and value our contributions will join us. We know there is nothing that scares you more.The truth is, Mr. Trump, that your comments mean that you fail to see that immigrants are what have made this nation. They are at the core of our ideals, and they are the foundation that keeps us afloat. No, Mr. Trump, you may not reduce us to drug dealers and rapists. We are moms and dads, sons and daughters. We are valedictorians and honor students. We are college graduates, bankers, police officers, entertainers, teachers, journalists, politicians and we are the future of America.Thank you for helping us in our work to energize the Latino vote and to usher in our shared future! Keep it up! So, while Trump s racism ignites the fire under a dying breed of racism in this nation of people who would clearly still like to own people as property, the rest of the United States in living in 2016, embracing equality of all races, genders and sexual orientations, and will absolutely wallop Trump at the polls if he happens to win the nomination.All in all, Trump deserves condemnation, he deserves to be made fun of, and most of all   he deserves to lose.Video/Featured image: Hollywood Reporter",0
8833, Watch How White Supremacists Are Working To Win The Iowa Caucus For Trump (VIDEO),"If the current national Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump wins the Iowa caucuses, he may have to send a thank you card to a group of white supremacists.A super PAC set up by white nationalists (thanks to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court for that, by the way) is now doing robocalls on behalf of the Trump campaign to Iowa voters.https://www.facebook.com/david.dwyer.501/videos/10205589938852221/ I urge you to vote for Donald Trump because he is the one candidate who points out that we should accept immigrants who are good for America,  Jared Taylor said on the robocall, paid for by the American National Super PAC.  We don t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture. Vote Trump. Taylor is the founder of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance. The robocall included two more endorsements from a conservative Christian talk show host and the head of the white nationalist American Freedom Party.Since he launched his presidential campaign by blaming Mexicans for rape and murder and encouraged his supporters to rough up protesters for the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has attracted growing support from the white nationalist movement. They view his candidacy with its explicit appeal to white power enthusiasts as the first such outwardly racially bigoted campaign within the two major parties in U.S. history.Trump has also, of course, signaled that a presidency underneath his control would operate in a fascistic manner, banning travel to the United States by Muslims and also creating a national database of Muslims similar to the types of records created by Hitler s Nazi regime in Germany.Despite the outward support for Trump with figures like former Klansman David Duke and those otherwise aligned with the movement in favor of white supremacy, the mainstream media has largely shied away from labeling Trump supporters as bigots. Instead multiple mainstream articles and news reports insist that Trump s base of support comes from those concerned about  economic inequality.  Of course, Senator Bernie Sanders has made the fight to rectify that inequality as the centerpiece of his campaign, explicitly rejecting the racial and religious hatred embraced by Trump and so far not condemned by the party itself.Featured image via flickr",0
8834, Conservatives Will Hate Why Obama Invited This Woman To The State Of The Union,"President Obama is using his final State of the Union address to spike the ball on some of the accomplishments he has been able to achieve in the two terms of his presidency. As evidence of those achievements, several guests have been invited to sit with First Lady Michelle Obama.Among those guests will be U.S. Army Major Lisa Jaster, and her sterling accomplishment was becoming one of the first three women in the history of the United States to qualify as a U.S. Army Ranger.Before Obama was President, women were not permitted to try out for this elite designation. Now they are.Jaster was one of 19 women who attempted the Army Ranger course in April, when it was opened to female service members for the first time. In some ways, she was the most unusual of them: While most troops who attend are on active duty, male and in their 20s, she was a 37-year-old officer who was activated from the Army Reserve to go, temporarily leaving behind a successful career as an engineer with Shell Oil in Houston and her husband and two young children for a shot at making history.Jaster said in a phone interview Friday that she wants to show that there are men and women capable of succeeding in almost any role. I want my presence to symbolize the fact that there are competent people out there, and as long as the standards don t change, the best person for each job needs to be placed in that job,  she said.Amazingly, in this day and age there are conservative Republicans who still oppose the idea of women serving in combat positions in the military, despite most Americans realizing that if they can pull their own weight there should be no obstacle to service simply due to gender.Major Jaster shows that it can be done, and that America has finally reached a place where we have the best defending us no matter what sex they are. That s part of the Obama legacy.Featured image via YouTube",0
8835, Breitbart Racist Is Attacking Neil Degrasse Tyson: ‘He Is Stupid And His Politics Are Dumb’,"Let s face it, Republicans hate Neil Degrasse Tyson because he is the Obama of science. If the frighteningly intelligent black scientist gets his mitts on their white daughters, they will want to abandon their traditional values and become  ASTROPHYSICISTS.A great example of this is a blatantly racist attack piece put together at the Republican outrage mill Breitbart. In it, the author implies that liberals are racist because they love Tyson. This is followed up immediately by Breitbart using racist tropes of the  lazy black man  to attack him personally while lamenting affirmative action as the only reasons he is on TV.Tyson, whom liberals love because they are racists who can t believe a black guy could be smart enough to be a scientist and so spontaneously ejaculate and soil themselves every time they see him on TV, hasn t published anything of note for years. The advantage of being a celebrity scientist is that you don t actually have to do any science.He didn t get the PhD he was studying for at the University of Texas and had to go elsewhere for his qualification. Obviously, rather than take responsibility for his academic performance, Tyson has blamed racism. In reality, Tyson was playing in bands and appearing on stage instead of completing essays. Typical science PhD students are at any given time either studying, teaching or sleeping.In 2005, he said: I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there s equal opportunity. He of course doesn t address the fact that the only reason Neil deGrasse Tyson is on television at all, given his intellectual shortcomings, is that he is black.Source: BreitbartHere is another famously liberal scientist, who Republicans claim has  intellectual shortcomings,  that is only on tv because of his black skin and a lot of white guilt.image: RedStateQuick fact check. Tyson did not blame his lack of a Ph.D. from UT on racism. He was talking about racism on campus, like when he was stopped 7 times by campus police for walking near the physics building. It s worth noting he was never stopped by campus police walking near the gymnasium. His Ph.D. pursuit ended when the university dissolved his dissertation committee.It took 16 seconds of Google to find that information.Apparently Breitbart is an authority in Astronomy, Physics, and Astrophysics, because they have the ability to sense when a black person has  truly worked hard enough.  in the fields. They also proved their superior authority on the topics mentioned by saying Tyson hasn t published anything of note in years. Tyson has published 13 papers, which is more than Breitbart has done, and last time I checked Breitbart did not do peer-review of any published scientific material.They also hate Tyson because he thinks about something other than Jesus.On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642  Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) December 25, 2014Tyson hasn t published as much work as some others, but there is a context to that. He made a choice to serve the public over himself. Instead of being insulated within the scientific community, he has given up a lot of his legacy in scientific academia in order to bring science to regular people. He went out and made science cool again when Republicans have been trying to make it something to be feared.It s a strange manifestation of birtherism in a way. A black man can t both be smart and popular everywhere except within conservative America. There HAS to be a conspiracy by liberal whites to foist his blackness upon America s heartland.featured image via youtube",0
8836, This Terrified Six-Year Old’s 911 Call Is Heartbreaking (VIDEO),"After her step-father began beating her mother, a terrified six-year-old child rushed to the phone to call for help.Through her hysterical sobs, she told the emergency dispatch worker that her  mommy and daddy are having a fight. As the worker tries to get more information, Lisa pleads with her to please send the police.  This has been going on forever and ever,  she sobs. A few moments later the little girl can be heard hysterically screaming at her step-father,  STOP IT! We can t see what s happening, but we can hear the anguish and terror in her voice as she begs the 911 operator to send help. He hurt mommy Can you just send the police please,  she cries.After the operator instructs her to go and unlock the door so the police can get into the house, the little girl returns to the phone.At this points we hear her scream  He just knocked my sister out,  then saying  My little sister. The-four-year-old. There s another scream,  OH MY GOD. He s got the baby. Listen to the heartbreaking call below, via FacesofChildAbuse on YouTube.  The recording, now known as the Lisa Tape, is used by agencies across the country to educate people on the impact that domestic violence on children.After listening to the call, I had to find out what happened to that little girl and her family.I found out that Lisa, her mom and her siblings made it out of the situation alive.Today, Lisa Floyd is an advocate for survivors of domestic violence.Sadly, many domestic violence stories do not have the same kind of happy ending this one does.Every nine seconds another woman living in the United States will be the target of violence from a husband, boyfriend or intimate partner. These attacks result in more than 2 million injuries to women and 1,300 deaths, annually.We know that every year at least 3.3 million children witness domestic violence in their homes.Like Lisa s younger siblings, children who live in homes where domestic violence occurs are as 1,500 times more likely to become the targets of abuse.According to the National Domestic Violence Center, 50 percent of men who engage in violence toward an intimate partner, also abuse their children.Yet sentences for perpetrators of domestic violence remain shamelessly lenient in the United States. For example, the minimum sentence for someone convicted of domestic violence in the state of California is probation. In Florida, it is five days in the county jail. In Louisiana it s four days, at least 48 hours of which must served without the benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.Even more shocking, the average prison sentence for a man who kills a spouse or intimate partner in the United States is two to six years.Is it any wonder that at least 60 percent of domestic violence perpetrators repeat the violent behavior?When you listen to Lisa s tape and hear the terror in her voice, or when you look at the shocking statistics that show us how many women and children suffer horrible acts of violence at the hands men like Lisa s step-father, and then you compare those things to the consequences that our society considers  reasonable,  it s nothing less than shameful.Domestic violence remains the leading cause of injury to women in the United States. It s also the number cause of homelessness for women in children in the United States.Those statistics aren t going to change until we stop letting the perpetrators off the hook with a slap on the wrist.*image credit: wikimedia commons ",0
8837, Experts Think Gas Prices About To Go Lower Than EVER – You Won’t Believe How Low (IMAGES),"For some time now, the United States has been experiencing a rapid decline in gas prices. It s almost hard to forget when the last time filling up at the tank was a burdensome thing   that s because nearly two years has gone by since gas was over $3.00 a gallon (on average across the United States). Over the last year or so, gas prices have dropped even further, due to Saudia Arabia continuing to keep up output, and the Iran deal that is expected to glut the global market even more so. All of this is great news   but it looks like the good news will keep on flowing (pun intended) according to experts in the industry.The AAA and GasBuddy, two top organizations that follow gasoline prices, say that if refinery capacity stays strong the price of a gallon of gasoline could reach historic lows of $1.00 a gallon in some areas   a level that hasn t been reached since 1999. That would be quite a remarkable event.Prices are already low by historical standards and depending on which part of the country you live in, already under $2.00 a gallon. If you look at the map below, you will easily be able to see which parts of the United States already receive the cheapest gas. There are very few areas colored in dark green (lower than $1.38 a  gallon). Most of the middle part of the country is either light green ($1.68-$1.83), or yellow ($1.83-$1.98). If gas is pushed downward to $1.00 a gallon, that s still a huge percentage drop no matter where you live.Pic via Gas BuddyGas prices are mostly driven by four things: oil prices, proximity to refineries, refinery capacity and state taxes and levies.We already know that crude oil prices are going to continue to fall. Although, there are a few detractors, there always are. Nevermind that   here s what the money managers that run the economy are doing: while 6,346 of them bet on higher prices (okay   fair enough) 17,517 of them bet on lower prices. It s not even close. This is the least bullish investors have been on oil in more than five years, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.All in all, gasoline futures fell 1.83 cents or 1.6%, to $1.12 a gallon   the lowest it s been since February 2009. And   gasoline also fell 14.33 cents a gallon (11% for the week) which also happens to be the largest weekly loss since September 2009.If the experts are right, $1.00 a gallon gasoline may not be that far off. Thanks, Obama!Pic via Gas BuddyFeatured image via White House.",0
8838," Former Obama Adviser BLASTS Trump, Calls Him Out For Attracting All The Racist Idiots (VIDEO)","Donald Trump has helped America s racists feel good about showing their true colors in all their bigoted glory. Furthermore, amazingly, the more racist Trump s remarks get, the higher he goes in the polls. Things that would be political suicide for almost anyone else seem to work wonders for Trump s numbers. Well, there is yet another person who is calling Trump out: Former adviser to President Obama, Van Jones.What has Jones so upset is most ominous indeed. It seems that a  think tank  of white power types that go by the name American Renaissance is so impressed with Trump s racism that they are now making robocalls on behalf of his bid for the presidency. The calls focus specifically on Trump s  ban all Muslims  plan. The horrible message says: We don t need Muslims. We need smart well-educated white people who can assimilate to our culture. Van Jones appeared on Face the Nation on Sunday, and he blasted the dangerous, bigoted rhetoric that has made Trump so popular with racists: This is troubling. If I were [Donald] Trump, this is a time to look in the mirror. Who am I inspiring? Who am I attracting? Why will horrible racist groups say I m the only candidate that speaks for them? This is what is   my deep concern is that Donald Trump is beginning to legitimate some of the dark things that have been in our country for a long time, and now starting to let them elevate, let them rise. Jones is right, of course, but, unfortunately, Trump doesn t care. All he cares about is numbers, and if it takes being bald-faced racist to get them, then, by God, that s what he ll do. The GOP s base is full of ignorant bigots, and Donald Trump has done a perfect job of courting them. Help us all if he actually gets anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch the interview with Van Jones below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8839, WATCH: Paul Ryan Gets Slapped In The Face With A Huge Dose Of Reality About Obamacare (VIDEO),"Last week, Republicans in Congress decided to once again waste everyone s time and tax dollars trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They know that there isn t a snowball s chance in hell that President Obama was going to approve any of their attempts to repeal the law. However, they continued the ritual of passing doomed legislation anyway, only to have it vetoed by President Obama on Friday.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan discussed the Republicans  atest attempt to repeal the ACA on Sunday during an interview on Face the Nation. During the interview, the show s host John Dickerson grilled Ryan on the Party s lack of a viable option to the ACA. You said that you wanted the Republicans to offer an alternative to the president. One of the first things you did this year, though, was offer that repeal,  Dickerson reminded Ryan.  How is than an alternative?  Dickerson asked. It s not,  Ryan responded.  It s why we have to come up with an alternative. So, you re right about that one. Will you?  Dickerson asked, skeptically. Absolutely,  Ryan stated, earnestly.  My goal   I don t know how far it will go given we have a filibuster and a guy named Obama who s not going to replace Obamacare   but my goal is that, we as Republicans, if we don t like these laws, don t like the direction the country is going, I think we have to be more than just an opposition party. It should be noted that during the rest of the 10-minute interview, Ryan names a plethora of problems in the United States, yet doesn t offer anything resembling any actual solutions to those problems. We have to be a proposition party,  went on to say.  So, if we don t like this, we ve got to show how we would do things differently. And we really think Obamacare is failing, whether it s premiums, restricted access, high deductibles, families losing the insurance they wanted to keep. People are hurting and we need to offer a solution. So, yes, on this and many other issues, we need to offer alternatives. And that s exactly what I intend on having us do. Which is exactly what every Republican has said since the ACA became law. They have absolutely nothing to offer the American people to replace the ACA with. The only viable place for healthcare to move forward in the United States at this point, is to create a single payer system. And of course, the Republican Party isn t going to propose that any time too soon.You can watch the full interview below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
8840, Economist Responsible For ‘Reaganomics’ Makes Laughable 2016 Election Prediction,"Arthur Laffer, known for inspiring Republican economic ideology since the Reagan-era, and largely considered to be the father of supply-side economics, has just come out with another prediction. No, not another false trickle-down theory of  if you cut taxes on the rich  governmental revenues will somehow maximize, and we ll all be better off   this time he is weighing in on the outcome of the 2016 election.Not only does he think Republicans will win in a  landslide,  he thinks they re going to win practically every state. Here s what he told host John Catsimatidis on New York s AM-970 on Sunday: I would be surprised if the Republicans don t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50. I mean, I think we re going to landslide this election. That s some estimation on his part. The last time that happened was when Walter Mondale was running for president against Ronald Reagan. That was three decades ago   this guy must still be living in the 1980s. Since then most economists have come out on the record stating his economic theories have been wrong, and that  trickle-down  economics is straight up bogus. His  Laffer-curve  even has it s own laughable tag line: Laughing at the Laffer- Curve. Governmental revenues have declined since it was first implemented, giving tax cuts to the rich that ultimately hurt the economy AND the federal government s source of income. Still, that hasn t kept him from being a big wig within top Republican circles. Hey   rich guys like their tax cuts, we get it. Now they ll do anything and everything to keep on justifying those lower tax rates they have become accustomed to.Here s what else he had to say in the interview: When I look at these candidates, I don t see one of them who wouldn t do a great job as president. I think Donald Trump is phenomenal, I think Rand Paul has done a great job, I even like Jeb Bush   I think Jeb Bush is great, he did a wonderful job in Florida. Chris Christie   phenomenal. He also took a few jabs at Hillary Clinton, but pretended to be nice about it, saying that her  day is over. We get that he s a fan of Republicans, but there is no hard data to suggest even what he is predicting. It would be interesting if he could cite some source or reference for why he thinks Republicans are going to win practically every state, or why he would be  surprised  if they didn t. Yet   he doesn t provide any of that.If his 2016 election prediction is anything like his economic policies, you can rest assured it s flat-out wrong.Featured image via Laffer Center.",0

I cannot tell you how ashamed I was of our country when I saw them first hand. It was the first time I d ever been surrounded by so many ignorant people. For instance, this guy was at the event I went to:Image via FacebookDanger then took a photo of the arena that Trump bragged about filling to capacity. The venue was about half full and he explained later in the evening that seats did fill out, but there were tons of empty spots.Make no mistake, this place is less than half full. pic.twitter.com/osKDaTUtkG  Daniel Danger (@tinymediaempire) January 4, 2016When Trump started speaking, the writer explained that he constantly flipped back and forth between topics.

8842," Bernie Sanders Blocked From Speaking At Iowa High School, Guess Who They Let Speak Instead","Urbandale High School students worked hard to get a presidential candidate come to speak at their school in Urbandale, Iowa. Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump said that they would come speak to at the high school. Trump ended up speaking during the school s homecoming. Sanders was blocked by the administration.The Des Moines Register reports on the story, saying: The billionaire Republican visited the high school s homecoming in September after students launched a month-long campaign to recruit a presidential candidate to campus. Students had also reached out to the campaign of Bernie Sanders, who couldn t make the fall homecoming dance, but expressed interest in a later visit. Campaign officials recently tried to firm up Sanders  visit, but were turned down by school administrators. Students say they were told that another candidate visit would be too much of an administrative hassle. There were allegations of the school playing favoritism by only letting a Republican candidate speak to the school. The move prompted a backlash from some of the students. We let Donald Trump come as a presidential candidate, but in reality the main focus of his appearance at our school was that he was a high-profile celebrity,  said Josh Ingham, a senior at the school.  So we wanted a politician that is only involved in politics. So when the administration turned down this opportunity, we were kind of surprised and outraged since the campaign directly contacted our school. We had the opportunity. Ultimately, the matter was resolved with a somewhat weak compromise. Sanders wasn t allowed to speak at the school but some Urbandale students were given reserved seats at a Sanders  event. They were able to meet Sanders back stage at the event.The Des Moines Register reports that Ingham who, along with other students, was about to launch a petition to get the school s administration to reverse their decision, got a very special shout out from Sanders at the event: Sanders  Iowa staffers reserved prime seats at his Saturday evening appearance at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and set up a quick meet-and-greet with the candidate. About 25 Urbandale students gathered backstage behind a black curtain that separated them from the crowd of more than 1,500 waiting for the Vermont senator s arrival.When Sanders reached the venue, he handed a microphone over to Ingham and asked him to tell the group what had happened at the school. He told them standing up to their school was  a very brave thing to do. It s great that those students who attended the event got to have that experience. However, it is antithetical to the idea of civics education to have only one candidate, from one party speak. Representative democracy is about having candidates present their ideas, and then letting people decide who they agree with. When an institution only lets one side of the aisle speak, all they are doing is providing another bully pulpit for that party or candidate. Which is totally not cool.At least some of those students learned a valuable lesson. When the establishment screws you over   organize.Featured Image Credit:By Michael Vadon (Own work) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons",0
8843, Charles Koch Has The Sads Because He Thinks He Should Have More Influence Over Elections,"Charles Koch, the billionaire CEO of Koch Industries has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on political campaigns because of Citizen s United, but he still thinks he should have even more influence.During an interview with the Financial Times, Charles Koch whined that even as he spends tons of money trying to shape the political landscape to his will he still doesn t have as much influence as he expected to have in 2016.Koch says he presented of list of his wishes to Republican candidates, who basically ignored them, which is why he is pouting now. (It) doesn t seem to faze them much,  Koch said.  You d think we could have more influence. It is hard for me to get a high level of enthusiasm because the things I m passionate about and I think this country urgently needs aren t being addressed. In other words, Koch has the sads because he hoped Republicans would automatically be his puppets and support and enact all of his demands.The billionaire polluter actually gave the candidates a freaking LIST of things he wants them to do if they win the presidency and now he thinks he needs even more influence because the candidates didn t seem to give two shits about it.According to Politico, the Koch brothers are poised to spend nearly $1 billion on the 2016 election, in what should be seen as a blatant effort to buy the White House and Congress.Among the many aims on their agenda is the destruction of labor unions, abolishing the minimum wage, dismantling environmental protection laws, and repealing Obamacare while opposing any effort to bring affordable healthcare to the American people. And those are just a few things that the Koch brothers want to do to this country.Charles Koch attempted a run for president in the 1980s, but he failed miserably. Instead, he decided to focus on buying the government instead.But despite his massive influence on Republican politics, Koch is complaining that he still doesn t have enough power over the candidates. In reality, the American people are the ones who should be complaining about not having enough influence over elections, which the Kochs believe they are entitled to buy.If the Koch brothers are wondering why most of the American people see them as villains, this is why.Featured Image: Flickr",0
8844, Michigan’s Republican Governor Needs Your Tax Dollars To Fix The Flint Water Crisis He Created,"The water crisis in Flint is not just simply a man-made disaster, it is the actualization of unconstrained Republican policy. For more than a year, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and the emergency manager of Flint ignored the voices of all those who spoke out about the contamination of Flint s water. Now, Michigan is forced to rely on Obama and the federal government to rescue them.In April 2014, Flint s emergency manager forced the city to switch from using Detroit s water system to using the Flint River for water. The decision to do so was touted as a means to cut costs for the city. It turned out to be a disaster. There is an unusual amount of salt in the Flint River. The river is also extremely contaminated. So when the salt began to corrode the pipes of Flint s water system, lead leaked into people s drinking water. One study found the pipe corrosion problem could have been solved for as little as $100 a day. Now it is estimated that it will cost up to $1.5 billion dollars to fix Flint s water system. There has been massive outcry over the water system transition since day one. When evidence was shown that Flint s water had become contaminated, Snyder and the emergency manager choose not to act. That s why Snyder is currently being investigated by the EPA.For those not in the know, an emergency manager acts as the feudal lord for cities that want to behave fiscally irresponsibly. The emergency manager law was implemented by Snyder. When a local government fails to meet certain criteria, the governor appoints an emergency manager to replace the city government. The local government still exists, but those democratically elected officials do not have any real power. You might say that s just tough luck for Michiganders who elected Snyder. But you would be wrong. The emergency manager law was overturned through a ballot initiative in 2012. Snyder and Michigan s Republican-controlled state government decided to replace the law, with an almost exact copy.Now as many as 100,000 people have been poisoned by reckless neglect (and Republicans  unfaltering devotion to destroying effective government.) This disaster was entirely preventable. The same way that the massive water shut offs in Detroit, that have received international condemnation, are completely unnecessary.At this point, there is no way that the Flint water crisis can be solved without receiving financial aid from the federal government. Snyder declared the disaster a state wide emergency last week, which makes it so that he can request financial aid from the federal government. Snyder must call on the Obama administration to fix his mess.Featured Image Credit: Michigan Municipal League via Flickr Creative Commons License 2.0",0
8845, Bundy ‘Militia’ Is Begging You To Send Them A Bunch Of Tampons — For Freedom,"Folks, Barack Obama s tyranny has hit the fine, upstanding patriots currently occupying a federal building in Oregon hard. Not only did the crazed, armed occupiers  mommies forget to pack snacks for them, but they seem to have run out of clean underwear and tampons   as well as other items needed for their pretend revolution (don t worry, they do have plenty of guns).Even though police have promised them the freedom to move in and out of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge   a strange thing to grant terrorists   these grown men playing cowboy seem entirely incapable of driving to the store to buy their own supplies. The new wish list, posted to Twitter by extremism analyst J.J. McNab, includes much more than snacks.The militants now want supporters to provide them with tampons, underwear, t-shirts, money, blankets, socks, bed sheets, shampoo, deodorant (let s face it   that many Teabillies in one place can get a bit smelly), gaming supplies, and cigarettes:The need for tampons is no laughing matter. Recently, one of the militants announced that they plan to use women and children as shields against anything they view as an attack   in that case, the presence of women and children was used to dissuade the evil government from shutting off the electricity. This, of course, is a tactic that was used at Bundy Ranch as well, with one armed terrorist revealing that  If they are going to start shooting, it s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot. I personally think that helping them would be a great idea. Send as many tampons as you want (using that big, bad government mail system) to:Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, c/o Y All Qaeda36391 Sodhouse LnPrinceton, OR 9772Let s send them more tampons than they will ever use. They can find their own damn coats.If you don t want to waste money on tampons, make a phone call and urge the FBI to finally take action against these dangerous domestic terrorists.Featured image via FreakOutNation",0
8846, Donald Trump Likes How North Korean Dictator Kills People To Solidify Power (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents. You ve got to give him credit,  Trump gushed. How many young guys   he was like 26 or 25 when his father died   take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss. It s incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn t play games. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that. A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power. Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign. After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies. He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt. He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt. If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr",0
8847, Gabby Giffords Has Made Her Choice For Who She Wants As The Next President,"The adversity that former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) has had to overcome is nothing short of breathtaking. After being shot in the head during a meet and greet with her constituents five years ago, she has made a comeback that could put her at hero status. She s a hero, because not only has she made a startling recovery, but she has dedicated her life to trying to making sure no one has to endure the pain of gun violence. Through her organization Americans for Responsible Solutions, alongside her husband retired astronaut Mark Kelly, they have made it their life s work.Now, knowing that the epidemic of gun violence is still rampant, Giffords knows we will need a continued strong voice of leadership in the White House to combat the gun lobby and fight to enact gun legislation that will be proactive and lasting. Later this week, Giffords is expected to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Clinton has released through her campaign comprehensive solutions to reduce gun violence. She knows we are well past the time to enact proper legislation.This endorsement may come as a surprise to some, but to others it will make perfect sense. Clinton has long been a supporter of better gun reform while her democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady bill five times, and according to CBS news: Sanders voted in favor of 2005 law that absolved gun manufacturers of any legal liability when someone uses their products during the commission of a crime. Part of Clinton s goals for gun reform includes a repeal to the gun industry s immunity protection: Hillary believes the gun industry must be held accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Hillary will lead the charge to repeal the so-called  Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,  a dangerous law that prevents victims of gun violence from holding negligent manufacturers and dealers accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns. Giffords, alongside her husband, want gun reform, and she seems to be endorsing the candidate who has a history of standing strong against the gun lobby and is most likely to continue President Obama s efforts, combat Republicans and their perversion of the Second Amendment, and get the job done.Featured image: Americans For Responsible Solutions",0
8848," In HISTORY MAKING Kiss Cam Moment, Gay Couple Featured At NHL Game (VIDEO)","During nearly every sporting event, at one point in the game, the cameras are taken off the game to scan the crowd for loving couples to smooch each other on the infamous  Kiss Cam.  Almost always, or let s just say it like it is, these cameras seem to always find straight couples. However, last year, a beautiful couple got caught on the Kiss Cam at Dodger stadium, and it looks as though another beautiful couple got their moment recently during a hockey game.In what is being reported as the first same-sex Kiss Cam moment in NHL history, Brad Parr and Andy Evans, while attending a Los Angeles Kings game at the Staples Center, were featured. The kiss drew huge cheers from the crowd.Parr told Outsports: It was a particularly sweet night since the Kings were playing and beat my hometown Toronto. My parents and siblings live in LA but the rest of my family think I am a terrible traitor for being a Kings fan; I ve lived in LA for 17 years. Not only did these fantastic men get to smooch in front of thousands of fellow King s fans, but they are also triathletes raising money for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society s Team in Training.This beautiful moment in history is wonderful and shows the progress we ve made as a nation, but it also highlights that in 2016, we re just now getting around to acknowledging that gay couples, male and female, do in fact attend sporting events.Congrats to the beautiful couple, and if you d like to donate to help their cause, go HERE.You can see the full video HERE, but here s a highlight of just the pair in their moment in history: Progress!

8849, New Group Of Armed Idiots Show Up To Provide ‘Security’ For Bundy Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does. The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the  security  for the militia. There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to  protect  the original occupying militia. However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that. We don t want it and we re asking you to leave. According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has. MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote,  alarmed  by the Pacific Patriot Network guards. According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be  patrolling the perimeter  and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there. The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them. At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people. It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8850, This Homeless Veteran Receives A Gift From A Child He’ll Never Forget (VIDEO),"Most of us don t know what it s like to be homeless, but three brothers decided to let all of us know with a video that has gone viral. As a homeless man sat in the streets of New York asking for money for food, the youngest brother Omar sat next to him and pretended to be homeless.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvoWBbYxdwc]As people passed by, it was young Omar who who was getting money in his cup while the homeless veteran received nothing. At one point, after a policewoman put money in Omar s cup, the veteran asked her for money, saying that he had nothing to eat the entire day. Annoyed, the policewoman sternly said that she works every day and that he s a grown man and then flicked his hat.Another passerby was even more abusive. After he gave Omar some money, the veteran asked for some change to which the man said,  This little kid out here. They don t know what it takes. You re a grown ass man. I got a job. I work my ass off every day.  The veteran replied,  I served my country sir.  The man then said,  You served your country! Here is something that served your country!  He then spilled the food he was carrying all over the veteran.Yet, despite being humiliated and crying, the veteran stood up, walked a few feet to a restaurant, and came back with two slices of pizza, one for him and for Omar.That s when the two brothers of Omar came up to the veteran and told him that Omar was not homeless. They gave him all of the money Omar had collected and an additional $200. Surprised and crying, the veteran and the brothers exchanged hugs.We don t know why this man who served his country is homeless, but war is damaging both physically and psychologically. What we do know is that he was extremely kind hearted to Omar despite the humiliation he suffered at the hands of strangers.One thing that we should learn from this video is that we need to take care of our veterans.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.",0
8851, Police Investigating Possible Attempt To Murder Bernie Sanders (VIDEO),"Since at least September, people have been calling for Secret Service protection for Bernie Sanders, noting that he is vulnerable to   potentially violent confrontations with disturbed people.  With the Right s almost devout adherence to their misunderstanding of socialism and conservative politicians  desperate attempts to equate Democratic Socialism with National Socialism (After all, a man who wants to make education affordable, help the poor, and rebuild our infrastructure is just like Hitler).It seems as though people who are concerned with Sanders  safety are correct   because on Thursday, someone shot up his Nevada campaign office while the Senator was in town. Winning Democrats reports that campaign staffers found a bullet hole in the window of the Las Vegas headquarters on Thursday morning, the same day the Senator was on site.So far, the bullet has not been located, but Metro Police took a report for malicious destruction of property and are investigating the shooting. Police confirmed that a bullet appeared to have gone through the window, but were unwilling to confirm that a shot had been fired, according to the Las Vegas Sun.The Sanders campaign declined to comment on the shooting.Numerous petitions have been circulating for months asking that Sanders be given a Secret Service detail. After all, Hillary Clinton has one. Donald Trump has one. Even Ben Carson has Secret Service protection. To date, while Trump has allowed and even encouraged violence and threats at his rallies, all of it was directed at people he didn t like   African-Americans, Hispanics, and Muslims. Only Sanders has had someone attempt to whack him. According to the Secret Service website, Sanders certainly qualifies. Candidates must:Be publically announcedHave some degree of prominence as shown by opinion pollsBe actively campaigning and entered in at least 10 state primariesBe seeking the nomination of a qualified partyHave qualified for matching funds in the amount of at least $100,000Have received contributions totaling $10 millionSanders is, of course, publicly announced. While Clinton is winning in the polls, Sanders has continually shown  some degree of prominence. Prior to 1968, candidates did not receive Secret Service protection. However, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, things changed. We began protecting major candidates like Clinton, Sanders, and Trump   and even people who don t stand a chance like Ben Carson. He is certainly registered in at least 10 state primaries. He s seeking the nomination of the most qualified party, and he qualifies for matching funds. He has also received donations well over $10 million.It s time we demand that Sanders receive Secret Service protection   after all, he s the one people seem to be shooting at.Watch a news report on the attack below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws3ajM_CEYc?rel=0&showinfo=0]Featured image via screengrab",0
8852, Barbaric Bullies Set Disabled 13-Year-Old Boy On Fire (VIDEO),"Deandre Williams suffers from a disability which causes him to walk with a limp. Because of his condition, his mother says, a group of student bullies routinely picked on and bullied him, even giving him the nickname  limpy. Shortly before Christmas, this same group of students invited the teen to the community center, supposedly to hang out. The 13-year-old then went with the group to the home of one of the student bullies.Once inside the house, one of the students doused him in cologne and then lit him on fire. He was trying to leave, run out of the house but he can t because he can t run. He walks with a limp,  his mother, Ursula Allen, told Fox 5 in New York.According to Allen, there were others in the house at the time the attack occurred, including the mother and the sister of the student who set her son on fire.Although Deandre had severe burns on his face, neck, chest and arm, more than two hours past before anyone attempted to get medical attention for the injured teen. When the sister saw what was going on she covered it up,  Allen said.  She put Deandre in the shower which hurts even more. The teen was later admitted to the hospital in critical condition, due to the severity of his injuries.Here s more on this story from Fox 5.The attack on Deandre Bloomfield took place in Staten Island, New York on December 2nd.During an interview with New York Daily News on December 9, the teen said he thought the boy who attacked him was his friend. He used to bully me. Smack me around,  he said during the interview, which took place in his room at Staten Island University Hospital North.The teen described what happened on the night of the attack. First he smacked me. I got up and I said,  Don t smack me again.  And when I wanted to leave, he picked up a perfume bottle with a lighter, and he sprayed it on me. He did it two times. The first time he did it sparked on me. . . . And that s when I started to run, and he threw the whole bottle at me. His clothes caught on fire.Deandre s attacker, another 13-year-old boy, was not identified by police, due to his age. He was arrested and faces multiple charges.No charges have been filed against the boy s mother or sister, although police say they are still investigating the incident.After spending almost three weeks in the hospital, Deandre was released just before Christmas. Community organizations pulled together to send a message of support and healing to the teen, who also opened an assortment of awesome Christmas gifts, including an xbox one, OVO clothes, gear and more, courtesy of rapper Drake and radio station Hot 97.1.During an interview with the station on January 8, Deandre said he won t be able to go back to school for another few weeks yet. He still has some healing to do. When asked whether he felt safe going back to the same school, he said the students who bullied and attacked him are no longer attending classes there.According to the National Education Association (NEA) bullying impacts more than 13 million students in the United States annually. Every day in the U.S. more than 160,000 kids stay from home school because of bullying.If you think a child is being bullied, the NEA advises against just ignoring the signs, hoping the behavior will correct itself. Instead, the organizations advises adults to intervene as soon as they suspect there is a problem.The NEA says parents should: Take any and all steps to address bullying including getting professional help. And be sure to inform someone in your child s school that your child is being bullied. It s crucial that parents have a contact person in the school whether it be a principal or assistant principal, a teacher or a support staff person. *Featured image credit: video screen capture via Fox 5",0
8853, Experts: ‘Militiamen’ Live Hand To Mouth On Gov’t Disability And Their Wives’ Hard Work,"Jon Ritzheimer, infamous right-wing terrorist and incredible douchebag, barely squeaks by on his government disability check and has said that he is  thankful to have a wife who works.  As it turns out, experts tell us that this guy who spends his days fighting imaginary battles and sucking up a good man s oxygen isn t the exception to the demographics that make up a right-wing terrorist militia, he s the definition. These guys are broke,  said Mark Pitcavage, who has been researching far-right movements for 22 years and has studied the Harney County occupiers.  Right-wing extremists, generally speaking, have very little money. How a right-wing extremist occupation like the one in Oregon would pay for itself isn t exactly an issue there s been a lot of data on. By referencing the research of people like Pitcavage, we can deduce that right-wing extremists are for the most part freeloaders, likened to teenagers who think they can take care of themselves but overwhelmed the first time they have to pay a bill or do a load of laundry. It s quite possible that a lot of them will get tired and feel the pressure to go back and care for their families,  Pitcavage explained. Those families, left behind to care for themselves, are probably better off without their  patriarch,  the almighty man who controls everything and can make the decision to just pack up and leave on a whim to occupy a forest a thousand miles away that they ve never heard of before last week.Daryl Johnson, a former DHS domestic terrorism analyst, says militia members have a warped sense of priority where their duty  is concerned. A video released by Ritzheimer showed him crying that he would probably be killed and how much he would miss his family just before he held up a copy of the Constitution and declared  But I took an oath. They ll think nothing about taking half their paycheck and using half of it to buy ammunition and guns,  Johnson told The Oregonian.The gist here is that these idiots aren t just the worst the American gene pool has to offer, they re also incredible assholes who are neglecting their families to go play soldier in the Oregon wilderness. They re holed up in a facility they didn t pay to be at, squeezing the taxpayer for their utilities and costing tens if not hundreds of thousands more in wages paid to employees who can t go to work.The sooner these imbeciles are removed and incarcerated the better off the country   and their families   will be.Featured image via thetruthaboutguns.com",0
8854, 21 Hilarious Memes Of The Bundy/Oregon Standoff (IMAGES),"With the standoff in Oregon ongoing, one can t help but laugh at the silliness of the so-called Citizens for Constitutional Freedom and their antics. Although it s always good to find humor in any situation, one can t help but wonder if a group of armed African Americans did the same thing, what the repercussions would be. Would they have been coddled by law enforcement in the same way? What about a group of Muslims? Can you imagine what would have happened if a group of armed Muslims took over some compound? Talk about a formula for a  shootout! The double standard is clear.Instead, the Bundy boys, along with their bearded homies, have been coddled by law enforcement. Although they haven t created the so-called change they ve been asking for they have become celebrities, getting airtime on a host of news outlets throughout the standoff. Odds are if they were African American or Muslim, they d probably be in jail, a hospital, or much worse.In any case, let s have some fun with these funny guys.

8855, People Are Posting Photos Of Their Food To Mock Starving People In Syria (IMAGES/VIDEO),"According to The Independent, people who support the regime in Syria are sharing pictures of food on social media in an attempt to taunt starving civilians trapped in a town currently being bombed in Syria. The town of Madaya, a holdout for opposition forces, has been held under siege for six months by the Syrian government. The famine has become so bad that locals report that there are no more cats or dogs left in the area.

8856, WATCH: Ted Cruz Tells Social Worker He’s Going To Deport Her If He Becomes President (VIDEO),"During a  Cruzin  to the Caucus  campaign event in Iowa on Thursday night, Ted Cruz was questioned by a young woman who is concerned that she may be deported if Cruz is elected president.According to the Washington Post, Ofelia Valdez is a 30-year-old woman, who works as a special needs social worker and activist. Her parents brought her into the United States when she was a child illegally. She tells Cruz that she is currently safe from being deported because of President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The program mandates that homeland security focus their attention on high priority individuals who have come into the United States illegally. High priority targets are people who have a violent criminal record. DACA makes it so that government agencies are not wasting resources going after people who more than likely were brought here by their parents, and have lived here for most of their lives. I think of myself as a part of this community and you know, first day of presidency, you decide to deport, you know, people like myself, you know, it s just very difficult,  said Valdez.Cruz has vowed to reverse the executive orders made by the President during the Obama administration. It doesn t seem to matter what those executive orders are, Obama made them so they are bad. So Cruz responds, essentially telling the woman that he would deport her, should he become president. If you re a DACA recipient, you were brought here illegally, and violating the law has consequences. One of the problems of our broken immigration system is that it is creating human tragedies and there are human tragedies when people break the law,  Cruz says.Cruz then goes on to list a number of other nations that he seems to think have a singular, hegemonic system for immigration, that represents the entire world.  This is met with thunderous applause from the other attendees at the event.You can watch a video from the event below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
8857," Mark Zuckerberg Supports Vaccinations, And Anti-Vaxxers Are Super Pissed About It (IMAGE)","Mark Zuckerberg has a daughter, and unlike parents involved in the anti-vaxxer movement, he s a responsible parent who cares about the health of his kid and those around her.The Facebook founder posted a photo of himself holding his daughter Max in a doctor s office waiting for vaccinations.

We all care about our kids. Growing up, my mom s best friend had a perfectly healthy daughter. She received MMR and had a grand mal seizure and suffered brain damage. Her dr diagnosed her with vaccine injury. She was left unable to talk or walk for the rest of her life. So that was MY first personal experience with vaccines. Bottom line A pharmaceutical that carries at least a risk of harm to some, should never be mandated. Because, in the end, no one seems to care about the  sacrifices  made for the  common good. Another woman named Colleen Kennedy wrote furiously that  herd immunity is a myth  and proceeded to try and scare people by listing the ingredients of the vaccine as if this has not been public knowledge for years.Others attacked the pharmaceutical industry for allegedly created epidemics so that they can sell more vaccines. You know, crazy ravings from paranoid people.As we all know, measles became a national story once again as the virus became an epidemic in this country, especially in California where many parents send their unvaccinated kids to school. Measles had been largely wiped out in this country by 1997, but because of anti-vaxxers, measles made a comeback and killed an American for the first time in 12 years.The MMR vaccine is one of the most successful preventive measures a parent can take to keep their kids healthy. Not only is measles the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, it s deadlier than the Ebola virus that sent Americans over the edge with fear in 2014. Even Fox News  own medical expert strongly endorsed vaccines and ripped anti-vaxxers a new one when asked about the new epidemic.Mark Zuckerberg is being a responsible parent and leading by example that he doesn t fear vaccines and trusts science. Other parents would be wise to follow suit for the sake of their own children.Featured Image: Raw Story",0

8859, Bundy Terrorists Claim God Told Them To Act Like Toddlers And Take Over Wildlife Refuge,"Ammon Bundy and his wayward crew of temper tantrum-throwing white guys with guns are now claiming that God talked to them and told them to seize the federal wildlife refuge.On Friday, Bundy told a meeting of fellow right-wing domestic terrorists that he refuses to end the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge because  the Lord  told him to go there in the first place. I was asked to do this by the Lord. I did it how he told me to do it. It sounds like Bundy and his band are suffering from a form of mental illness. Because the Mormon church that Bundy is a member of sure doesn t agree with him.In a statement earlier this month, officials from the Church of Latter-day Saints rejected Bundy s claim that his seizure of federal property had anything to do with religion. Church leaders strongly condemn the armed seizure of the facility and are deeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they are doing so based on scriptural principles. This armed occupation can in no way be justified on a scriptural basis. Exactly, and that is why we can no longer tolerate this armed occupation. Bundy and his pals are committing treason and domestic terrorism. They have illegally carried guns on federal property, along with breaking and entering and threatening violence against federal officials. They have forced the town of Burns to live in fear as schools and businesses are closed to avoid putting innocent children and adults in harm s way.If Bundy and his group were a bunch of armed black people or Muslims, federal and local law enforcement would have already riddled the building with bullets on the first day and Ammon Bundy would look like Swiss cheese.But because these guys are white rednecks with guns, law enforcement is giving them free reign to do as they please. Bundy thinks him and his buddies should be able to walk free when this is all over and they assume the government will give in to their demands. If that were to happen, nothing will stop these terrorists from becoming more emboldened in the future. Perhaps they ll set their sights on the Capitol building or the White House next.This armed takeover has been totally unjustified from the very beginning. Not only have Dwight and Steven Hammond, the arsonist ranchers whom Bundy says he is fighting for, rejected his cause, history and the law are firmly against him as well.Bundy claims the federal government stole the land from ranchers, but that is far from the case.According to Oregon Live, the federal government has legally held the title to all public lands in Oregon since it was a territory. After exhaustive research, the Supreme Court also ruled in 1902 and 1935 that this is the case. Furthermore, ranchers have willingly sold and been paid fair value for their land by the federal government to expand the wildlife reserve over the years.In short, the Bundys do not have religion, history, nor the law on their side. They are terrorists, pure and simple, and they need to be arrested and thrown in prison, or treated just like we have treated terrorists in the Middle East, who ironically enough also claim religion justifies their cause.Featured Image: WMUR",0
8860, How Fox News Helped Domestic Terrorists,"In the first year of President Obama s term in office, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning about the threat of domestic terrorism. Immediately, Fox News and the rest of the conservative media   Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and other talk radio figures   slammed the document and were soon followed by Republican members of congress.Overly sensitive to the hue and cry from the right in those early days, then Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano withdrew the report and the unit behind it was disbanded.Since then, America has had several instances of right-wing terrorism, from the South Carolina church shooting to the murder of police in Las Vegas and the Bundy clan s repeated armed run-ins with federal authorities.Daryl Johnson is the Homeland Security analyst who worked on the report, and he says that pull back has made things dangerous.On Friday, the department announced a task force with the Justice Department to focus on countering homegrown extremists radicalized by foreign groups such as the Islamic State, drawing staff members from dozens of federal and local agencies. It is unclear if the group would investigate domestic antigovernment groups. The D.H.S. is scoffing at the mission of doing domestic counterterrorism,  Mr. Johnson said.  The same patterns that led to the growth of the antigovernment groups in the 1990s is being played out today. D.H.S. should be doing more. In case you have forgotten the growth of those right wing groups in the 1990s   again, under a Democratic president they accused of  tyranny,  we had the Oklahoma City bombing, which until 9/11 was the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and is still the second most deadly attack of its kind. 169 people died and over 680 people were injured.Even worse, today s mainstream conservatives are espousing many of the radical ideas of the extremist movement. What once was way out on the fringe has now manifested in Republican lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio and Texas Governor Greg Abbott calling for a  convention of the states,  echoing Confederate-era arguments about diluting the federal government and leaving more up to right-wing state governments.Thanks to Fox News browbeating the government into downplaying this very real threat to Americans, we could face a major loss of life.Featured image via YouTube",0
8861, Gotta Love It When Idiot Conservatives Accidentally Reveal People HATE The NRA,"Conservatives alongside right-wing media outlets are trying desperately to spin the gun debate in their favor. They know that the majority of Americans support President Obama s executive actions on guns, so they need to make it look like people don t want them.One conservative media outlet, Breitbart, decided to run an article with this title: OBAMA S QUANDARY: NRA GAINING SUPPORT, GUN CONTROL LOSING IT Screengrab via BreitbartHowever, within the text of the article they try to piece together some sort of magic way of showing Americans support the NRA, but instead fail miserably, stating: In 1987, twenty-seven percent of Americans strongly supported the NRA. In December 2015, that number had risen to 38 percent. In order words, over one-in-three Americans  strongly support  the NRA. In other other words, two-in-three Americans do NOT support the NRA. It doesn t seem smart to write an article about how terribly Obama is doing and then point out with numbers how more than half the nation is actually on his side and not yours. Bravo for that. Well done.They also point out: In addition to these things, the American people are voting with their feet by walking into gun stores all around the country and buying firearms at a record pace. Figures from the FBI show that 2015 set a record for the number of background checks performed in a single year, with 23,141,970 checks performed. But then reiterate: So the NRA enjoys the  [strong] support  of more than one-in-three Americans while support for gun control is losing ground. WSJ suggests that this put Obama in a position where he had to go it alone. No, the NRA enjoys the reward of paying off members of Congress to make sure President Obama and the rest of America doesn t get the chance to hurt gun profits. Oh, and all this hysteria over FBI background checks really proves is a strong amount of paranoia from the one-third of Americans who actually think guns are a solution or are deceived into thinking they ll lose their firearms.In regards to actual support for stricter gun laws, data proves that is actually up drastically with more than 55% of Americans saying they want laws on gun sales more strict:There are facts, and then there s how one interprets facts. Breitbart chose to report only one-third of Americans strongly support the NRA, but anyone with a rationally thinking brain can decipher that this also means that two-thirds of Americans don t. They also want you to believe citizens don t want stricter gun laws, but, in fact, they do.Truth is, we need stricter laws on gun sales to make sure the wrong people don t get their hands on guns. This includes mental health background checks. If you re a law-abiding citizen without a history of mental illness, guess what   NONE of your rights will be  infringed  because you ll still be able to purchase your precious paranoia machines firearms. And just like laws regarding cars and driving don t stop every accident, they sure as hell prevent a lot, just like better gun laws would prevent unnecessary deaths as well.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8862, Kentucky Republicans Propose Bill To Delay School Year To Accommodate Creationist Museum,"Kentucky Republicans have decided to put the profits of a creationist museum ahead of the education of their state s children, and that just about says it all.At the very start of 2016 s legislative year, Kentucky conservatives introduced a bill, SB-50, that would keep schools closed until the end of August in order to allow the state s brand new  Noah s Ark  museum to eke out a few more weeks of the tourist season. Priorities!Writer Dan Arel has been following the situation, in all its mind-numbing stupidity, for the better part of a year. He writes:As I reported back in August of 2015, Kentucky Sen. Damon Thayer, R-Georgetown, and Sen. Chris Girdler, R-Somerset had proposed such a bill to help extend the vacation season to bring more attention to the forthcoming Ark Encounter. Grant County is set to become a major tourist destination due to the presence of the Ark,  Thayer said.  But there won t be many families from Kentucky visiting in August if we continue with the current calendar. And while other states have set their school schedule around economic issues, you d be hard-pressed to find a state do that to satisfy the bottom-line of a single man.Meet Ken Ham, the right-wing creationist famous for his creation museum and infamous for getting absolutely demolished in a debate with Bill Nye. He and his giant Ark have Kentucky s Republican-led legislature wrapped around his finger.Lately, Ham has been so busy hurling hatred at gay people that one might forget that he makes most of his money by running a religious-based creation museum and associated ministry in Kentucky. In the past few years, Ham has set his sights on expanding his museum to feature a  life-sized  mock up of Noah s Ark. After a ton of fundraising   and a few charges of tax fraud   Ham opened his Ark in November, 2015.To give you an idea of how obnoxious Ham can be, this is how he chose to announce his big Grand Opening ceremony set to begin this summer: We are so excited that the construction progress and schedule landed on this 7/7 date. Genesis 7:7 states that Noah and his family entered the Ark. So it s fitting we allow the public to enter the life-size Ark on 7/7. Ham s enablers in Kentucky want to extend the park s  vacation season  to September. They hope this will bring in more money, but what they don t mention is that almost none of it would be coming back to the state. Ham, for all of his religious-speak, is primarily a huckster. He continues to label his for-profit  ministry  a tax-exempt church, and therefore pays little to no taxes. Keeping kids out of school so their parents can buy tickets for Ham s park does nothing but make students in the state more ignorant, residents poorer, and Ham richer.Schools, obviously, are not happy, either. As Ham continues to count his dollars, teachers and principals are left scrambling for a way to salvage the potentially lost time. One principal was hopeful that the bill wouldn t pass, but conceded if it did, it would be a disaster.  It may help tourism, however, I think it could potentially hurt many Kentucky children. Given the fundamentalism promoted by Ham s anti-intellectual  museums,  it s safe to say the principal is being too generous. This has all the makings of an educational disaster.Feature image via Christian Post screengrab",0
8863, Ammon Bundy’s Own ‘Safety’ Committee Tells Him And His Militia Terrorists To Go Home (VIDEO),"If anything should tell the militia terrorists occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon that it is time for them to give this ridiculous  occupation  up, it should be the fact that a committee that Ammon Bundy himself helped create is telling them to leave.On Friday night, the Harney County Committee of Safety, which Ammon Bundy helped form, held a townhall event in which the occupiers were told to leave. A letter from the committee told them, essentially: you made your point, now it s time for you to go home. First, spokesperson Melodi Holt seemed to try to butter the clowns up when she began speaking, telling the militia people that they did a good job by: shining a light on the Hammond case here in Harney County.Your actions have created a national focus on the Hammonds and other issues here and across the West that have created mutual distrust, anger and unrest between the people of the land and the federal government,  Molt read.  We thank you for stirring us to action. However, that was the end of the good things Holt and the committee had to say about the Bundy militia. She went on to slam the occupiers  tactics, saying that the committee and its supporters: were very upset that you chose to take the aggressive action of occupying the refuge and did it without our knowledge or any local approval, and in a fashion that has created huge distrust and loss of credibility of and for us as a group and as residents within the community. We approved of most of your message but disapprove of your unilateral methods of occupation. We ask that you organize your people, explain that your point has been made and leave in a peaceful and honorable fashion. No comment has come from the militia occupiers, and they declined to show up to the event that was essentially held to blast what they are doing.Mr. Bundy & Co., when your own people think you are doing the wrong thing, it really is time to hang it up. Go home. The local communities and residents, along with the federal government, have been more than lenient and patient with you. The committee is right. The point has been made. Leave.Watch video of Holt s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8864," Bundy’s Anti-Government Militia Costing Taxpayers $100,000 A WEEK During ‘Indefinite’ Standoff","We already know that the citizens of Harney County do not want the Bundy militia around, but neither should the rest of us. Their stupidity is costing us a fortune.While it may seem that occupying an empty, powerless wildlife refuge during the harsh Oregon winter would be an exercise in harmless stupidity, a fuller picture is emerging that reveals the Bundys and their fellow anti-government extremists are costing America hundreds of thousands of dollars a week in tax money.The occupation of the refuge is still centered around a single building, the amount of extremists with guns marching around and threatening to shoot cops has meant nearby buildings have also had to be evacuated. The employees have been placed on paid leave for their own safety. This means that while protesting the government, the militia has caused a costly shutdown of operations that actually wastes more money than it saves.Government Executive did some digging and found that the total amount of money being paid out to employees that can no longer do their job without risk being caught in the crossfire of this ill conceived insurrection is staggering.Nearly 120 permanent and seasonal employees report to BLM s district office in Burns, Ore., nearly all of whom are now on paid administrative leave.The salaries of those workers total approximately $117,000 per week, according to a BLM spokesman. The office has already been closed for more than one week. About 50 more employees work at the refuge center or the Forest Service s Emigrant Creek Ranger District office, many of whom are also on paid leave.An official at the Harney County, Ore., joint information center   which is handling inquiries on the situation   who refused to be identified due to  security threats,  said federal officials  don t have a cost estimate yet  on the other two facility closures, noting they are dealing with a  fluid situation. In other words, the expenses are only getting worse as the siege continues and the tension mounts.Hundreds of thousands of dollars have already been lost and the militia is only growing more emboldened. On January 8, the Harney County Sheriff s Department announced that negotiations have all but fallen apart and the militia appears to have dug in for the long haul.Statement from Sheriff Ward: pic.twitter.com/6fz0OenM4d  Harney Cty. Sheriff (@HarneyCoSheriff) January 8, 2016While the militia has been dismissed by some as clowns (and they are), they are still dangerous. But even  fiscal conservatives  should have a problem with this approach. They are expensive dangerous clowns. Every day they stay in Oregon and continue to make threats, the total damage caused by their actions continues to tick upwards.Feature image via YouTube screengrab",0
8865, Racist Moron Gets Fired For This 20 Second Video Of Him Shouting ‘Wetback’… At An Arabic Person (VIDEO),"It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers. Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it. Occasionally, the imbecile will be found and karma will collect their job, or in the very least, they re forced to quit the internet.In this case, the story has one added hilarious twist: The dumbass shouts the slur, loses his job and gets called out   and he couldn t even get it right. During his hand-clapping chorus of  Beaner! Beaner! Wetback! Wetback!  the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is. In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic. Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests. Maybe he felt if he called her something as clever as  towel head  she would detonate.Or perhaps he really is just that stupid.The man, an Oregonian identified as an employee of a small company, Wolcott Plumbing, now has bigger fish to fry. He ll be waiting in line Monday at the unemployment office. After local station KGB got hold of the video and reported on it, a company official wrote: First of all, this is a very upsetting situation. Under no circumstances do I personally nor do we as a company condone the use of abusive language of any kind to anyone. Upon further investigation today, I learned and confirmed it was one of my employees in the video. This employee was immediately terminated. When will idiots like this racist numbskull learn that those cell phones aimed at them while they spew their stupidity are recording? Hopefully not until after every single one is exposed.Featured image via screen capture",0
8866, Cruz Dedicates Empty Seat At State Of The Union To ‘50 Million Unborn Children’ Instead Of Gun Violence Victims (TWEET),"Yesterday, President Barack Obama made a touching tribute to the victims of gun violence. Just days after his executive action on gun control, Obama announced that he would be leaving an open seat at his future State of the Union address to represent every life that has been lost in senseless gun-related deaths   a sentiment that anyone who been affected by gun violence could appreciate.This move from our president isn t surprising  the Obamas have hosted family members of gun violence victims in State of the Union addresses before. Obama s empty state at the State of the Union will be in the First Lady s guest box.On a conference call with Organizing for Action, Obama explained the reason behind his gesture: We want them to be seen and understood; that their absence means something to this country. We want to tell their stories, we want to honor their memory and we want to support Americans whose lives have been forever changed by gun violence and remind every single one of our representatives that it s their responsibility to do something. Obama also reminded his supporters that  these kinds of important gestures only matter if it translates into action. Like clockwork, it didn t take long for a Republican to swoop in and ruin the moment. This time, it was Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, who decided to take the president s emotional, heartfelt remarks and turn it into a GOP talking point on abortion. Pro-birth Cruz, who has been known for his abortion and sex-related rants, tweeted this awful thing in response to Obama s tribute:Ted Cruz twitterHow sensitive. Like many of his conservative peers, Cruz has been resisting Obama s executive action hard, and making sure to add his unwanted opinion wherever and whenever possible. Currently, there is a fundraising appeal on Cruz s campaign website that claims that Obama  wants your guns  (even though Obama has repeatedly said that he believes in the Second Amendment and that legal guns will not be confiscated).Featured image via Gage Skidmore",0
8867," This Pill Is 25,000% More Expensive In America Than In India – And You Can Blame The U.S. Government For It","In 2013, Gilead Sciences Inc. filed an application with the FDA for a new drug that they claimed could cure hepatitis C. The drug was nothing short of a miracle.The new wonder drug was named Sovaldi. Where previous hep C treatments had a minimal success  rate and involved 6-12 months of grueling treatment that involved a slew of harsh side effects, Sovaldi cured people at a 94%+ rate in one 12-week treatment. It was so good, that Gilead received the FDA s Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which is given to drugs that show a tremendous advance over existing options and treatments.After an astonishingly fast review process and approval by the FDA, Gilead filed a patent for Harvoni which is Sovaldi combined with an NS5A inhibitor. Demand for Harvoni skyrocketed globally because currently there are approximately 130 million to 150 million people living with hepatitis C around the world.To call this a medical advance of historic proportions would be putting it mildly. The unfortunate fact is that the very thing that makes Harvoni so wonderful is what makes it absolutely terrible  if you happen to live in America.In the U.S., a 12-week course of Harvoni costs $84,000   $94,000. It works out to approximately $1000 per pill. If you lived in India, the cost per pill is $4.I get it. The cost to develop a drug can be staggering. Research and development work, plus the employees who perform it, are not free. Then there are trials and further tests. It all gets expensive. But here is the problem; Gilead didn t do any of these steps. It turns out, Sovaldi was already invented by a group called Doctors of the World at Cardiff University in 2007.DotW is claiming that Gilead merely copied their publicly funded research, rushed it through FDA approval and patenting, and then immediately jacked the price to reap an absolutely insane profit. It worked. In 2014, Gilead had a total revenue of $24.9 billion compared to $11.2 billion in 2013.Comparing this to India, you start to see the disgusting truth of it all. The Indian government denied Gilead a patent in their country, on the grounds that they couldn t prove that the drug was more effective at treating hep C than what was invented at Cardiff University in 2007. This has forced Gilead to actually compete in a free market.Due to not having a government-sanctioned monopoly in India, Gilead was forced to sell their pill at $4. This results in a total cost to save your life of about $340.For the cost of the same treatment with the same pill in America, where we have  the most amazing healthcare system in the world,  you could literally move to India, live there for about 2 years, take the drug for a few weeks during that time, get cured, then move back and still come out saving money.How freaking ridiculously insane is this?!A lawsuit was filed by Doctors of the World against Gilead as well, on the basis that the drug molecule was not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Seeing as India s regulatory agencies and patent office has already concurred with the opinion in this lawsuit, things do not look to be going well for Gilead in the future. I personally wouldn t be buying their stock.This brings us to the heart of the problem. Gilead essentially ripped off publicly funded work, copied a drug, then  innovated  by mixing it with a secondary drug to call it unique. This justified the technicalities required for a patent, but it violated the spirit for which patents are intended. If the FDA and U.S. patent office did some due diligence and used India as a precedent, denying Gilead their vulture capitalism cash cow, this would not be an issue.The FDA has a problem with revolving door crony capitalism. One example is FDA member Milton Packer, who chairs the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee. Packer reviews applications for drugs submitted to the FDA for regulatory approval. He is also financed by Novartis and has spoken on their behalf to the advisory board he himself chairs. He has also gone to bat in his own committee for GlaxoSmithKline in 2003, Spoke for Sanofi in 2009, and consulted for Pfizer in 2010.Packer s activities, while part of a government board meant to impartially regulate pharmaceuticals on behalf of the nation, scream conflict of interest. And he is only one person among many who participate in this sort of nonsense.Government involvement in a market, especially one like pharmaceuticals, is desperately needed. However, when that government involvement ends up being corrupted to where it serves the needs of corporations over people, it becomes a government-sanctioned monopoly that is enforcible by law.Real progressive regulatory and patent reform is so desperately needed in America, and any presidential candidate who is serious about helping the middle class should make it a primary focus of their campaign.Featured image via drugs.com",0
8868, BUSTED: Guess What The Bundy Militia Was Doing While They Were Not In Gunfights With The FBI,"Oregon Public Broadcasting just busted the Bundy militia using government computer systems and accessing federal employee data within the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.In a rather serendipitous occurrence, the blue tarp man himself   LaVoy Finicum   was leading OPB reporter John Sepulvado through the building on a tour, explaining what their plans were for the building. That s when Finicum led him right into something none of the militia wanted anyone to see.Finicum led Sepulvado into a computer room that was part of the wildlife refuge compound. He explained to Sepulvado that the militia planned to convert it into a  media room  to house reporters who they expected to come to the site.That s when it all went wrong for the militia.Sepulvado observed militants interacting with government computers in the compound that can only be accessed with employee badges. Employee badges were also strewn about the room, laying out in plain sight, along with papers that had names and Social Security numbers on them.Finicum immediately realized how badly he screwed the pooch by allowing the OPB reporter to see what they were doing, and for good reason. Their activities likely will fall under the Computer Fraud And Abuse Act which carries some serious penalties (fines and up to 10 years in prison) for what they were doing.Finicum made a mad dash to pick up all the papers full of personal information and ID cards and hid them away. Shortly after that, Ryan Bundy entered the room.Bundy emphatically denied that anything had been touched since they began their occupation of the compound: No, we haven t touched a single personal item. We haven t touched any of the computers, we haven t tried to log on   we haven t done anything. We re not here to hurt people. Not even the people who work here. This is where I call BULLSH*T. I ll bet any amount of cash that federal employees do not make a habit of having reams of papers, covered in very sensitive and personal information just laying about on their desks as a normal part of their workday. I will also bet that if they were to do something like this, it would be once in a blue moon and they would put it away before the left for the day. The same goes with the ID cards. If they were the key to using a computer, there is no doubt that any activities would be tied to the card used to access a terminal, and any misuse would fall on the individual who was assigned the card. There s no way employees would leave them laying around like that.The stupidity of the militia, bringing a reporter into what is essentially an ongoing crime scene, would almost be comical, except for one really serious detail.Law enforcement officials informed OPB that prior to the occupation, federal employees and family members of local law enforcement had received anonymous threats. Harney County Sheriff David Ward said that his own deputies and family members had been followed home by unknown individuals, photographed, and had property damaged in recent months.There are 17 employees that work at the refuge. All of these people could have had their personal information, home addresses, phone numbers, emergency family contacts, and God knows what else stolen and disseminated by a group of militants with too many bullets and too few brains. Up till this point, things were a good laugh. Now  not so much.Featured image via OPB",0
8869," Muslim Woman Kicked Out Of Trump Rally Speaks Out: They Asked, ‘Do You Have A Bomb?’ (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s rally are a hotbed of bigotry, and that was proven at his latest event in Rock Hill, South Carolina. A Muslim woman, Rose Hamid, 56, attended, and she says she had some predictably horrific encounters before Trump s goons finally threw her out for no reason other than the fact that she is Muslim. Speaking to CNN s Don Lemon, Hamid said: One guy was saying,  Get out   do you have a bomb? Do you have a bomb?  I said,  No. Do you have a bomb?  They were saying ugly, ugly things. One guy was saying,  God is great.  I said,  Yeah, God is great. Though Hamid wore a shirt that expressed peaceful intentions, she and another man were escorted from the event by a police officer. To make matters worse, Trump himself seized the opportunity to stoke the fires of hate and bigotry in his ignorant base, saying as they were removed by a cop: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Hamid summed the experience up perfectly when she told Don Lemon that Trump s repeated Islamophobia and hate speech is a vivid example of what happens when you start using this hateful rhetoric and how it can incite a crowd. Lemon asked Hamid what most folks would ask a person who goes into a lion s den of hate deliberately: Some people would say,  Why even put yourself in that position, Rose? To be around those people. Hamid s response was one of wisdom and bravery: Because I don t want to think of them as  those people. I think that s what the problem is, that we look at people and we categorize them as  those people  who are bad people and  these people  are the good people. I believe that people in all camps are decent people as we get to know them. Well, she has more faith in humanity   and especially in Donald Trump supporters   than I do. Hopefully, on some level, Rose Hamid is right and I am wrong.Watch video of the interview below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8870, Watch What Happens When a Muslim Woman Shows Up At A Donald Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has managed to attract the most racist and Islamophobic of American voters. That was all on display in Rock Hill, South Carolina, at a Friday night campaign rally when a Muslim woman, 56-year-old Rose Hamid, was thrown out by Trump security.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0Otof0wow]Rose, dressed in traditional Islamic dress and a t-shirt that read  I come in Peace,  was sitting in the stands directly behind Trump when Trump supporters, at the urging of his campaign staff, began to chant Trump s name after Rose stood up when Trump suggested that Syrian refugees were affiliated with ISIS. Rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled, which eventually led to her removal by Trump s security.Hamid later said that she  came to the rally to let Trump supporters see what a Muslim looks like so I figured that I d give them the opportunity to meet one. She said that many were shouting  epithets  at her. She said that one man yelled,  You have a bomb, you have a bomb. Trump made an ironic comment at her, making the victim of the night the victimizer. Trump said: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Major Steven Thompson of the Rock Hill Police Department said that Hamid was removed  from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that  anybody who made any kind of disturbance  should be immediately ejected.However, it s clear from the video that Hamid was not making a disturbance. It s become commonplace for Trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti-Islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country.This is Trump s America, and as can clearly be seen from the video, if this person gets to power, we are all in trouble.Featured image via YouTube Screenshot.",0
8871, Elizabeth Warren Rips Into Jeb Bush For Taking ‘Disgusting’ Money (IMAGES),"Elizabeth Warren may not be in the spotlight as often as she used to be, but we assure you she s still there, fighting away. Anytime she sees something that doesn t quite look right; you can bet she s the last person in a room afraid to speak up about   especially when big banks are involved.On Friday, Senator Warren was reading a story like the rest of us mere Earthlings, and was so outraged by it that she took to her Facebook page for a viral call out. Her target? Jeb Bush, his super PAC, and Former AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg.The billionaire Republican donor just gave $10 million to the Right to Rise group to keep Jeb from falling out of the race. It s basically keeping him alive to duel it out just before the nation s first primaries begin. But   that s not the reason for her dissatisfaction. It turns out; Warren still has a bitter taste in her mouth stemming from the economic collapse of 2008, which saw his company receive a  huge bailout from the Bush administration  after doing a disservice to the American people. She doesn t forget these things it seems.Her full post is featured below, but this part of it is the most headline-worthy, without a doubt: I m not sure what s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother s bailout money, or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections. Pic via Facebook.The Wall Street Journal first reported the contribution on Thursday, although he refused to talk about it in an interview with them. We wonder why. You feel strongly enough about the man to give him $10 million, but don t want to talk about it? Strange.Senator Rand Paul also saw the irony in it, as well. He tweeted out almost a full day before Senator Warren how odd it was for Bush to be accepting money to  bail out his campaign,  especially when that money came from  his brother s bailout money. Pic via Twitter.Why does anyone seem surprised? This is just politics as usual. You scratch my back; I ll scratch yours. It s worked this way forever. Heck, it s even legal. Bush used to work as an  advisor  getting paid millions from investment banks just shortly after he left the Governor s office in 2007. It s not like he s expected to do any special favors for all these generous contributions he s receiving from these big banks. People need to lighten up.**If you didn t catch the sarcasm in that last part, we promise to do a better job next time.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8872, Governor Of Texas Unveils Detailed Plan To OVERTHROW The Federal Government,"There s something stirring in the Deep South that is reminiscent of when the South decided they were going to throw a hissy fit and secede from the union for not being allowed to own people as property. Some states feel that they shouldn t have to follow federal law and believe states  rights supersede the laws of the federal government.Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R), knowing in his heart of hearts that while he doesn t like that the federal government holds supremacy over the states, due to this little thing called Article 6 Section 2 of the United States Constitution, has decided to release a plan to change the Constitution. This is in an effort to change the rule of law in the United States and prohibit Congress, the Supreme Court and the president from regulating states. He seems to be calling forth for their to be an overthrow of the government by the states who don t agree with the Constitution as it is written so that they can have their own set of rules and laws.Abbott, in a bit of word play claims to have unveiled constitutional amendments to  restore the rule of law.  However, it seems he would rather not have federal law at all. Honestly? The next step after this would be secession. It looks like Abbott may be on the verge of wanting to start another Civil War.Abbott, with his own interpretation of the Constitution put out a press release that stated:Governor Greg Abbott today delivered the keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation s Annual Policy Orientation where he unveiled his Texas Plan to restore the Rule of Law and return the Constitution to its intended purpose. In his plan, Governor Abbott offers nine constitutional amendments to rein in the federal government and restore the balance of power between the States and the United States. The Governor proposes achieving the constitutional amendments through a Convention Of States. The increasingly frequent departures from Constitutional principles are destroying the Rule of Law foundation on which this country was built,  said Governor Abbott.  We are succumbing to the caprice of man that our Founders fought to escape. The cure to these problems will not come from Washington D.C. Instead, the states must lead the way. To do that I am adding another item to the agenda next session. I want legislation authorizing Texas to join other states in calling for a Convention of States to fix the cracks in our Constitution. Governor Abbott went on to explain that dysfunction in Washington, D.C. stems largely from the federal government s refusal to follow the Constitution. Congress routinely violates its enumerated powers, while taxing and spending its way from one financial crisis to another. The President exceeds his executive powers to impose heavy-handed regulations. And the Supreme Court imposes its policy views under the guise of judicial interpretation. Governor Abbott urged action by Texas   and other states   to restore the Rule of Law in America.Governor Abbott offered the following constitutional amendments:Prohibit Congress from regulating activity that occurs wholly within one State.Require Congress to balance its budget.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from creating federal law.Prohibit administrative agencies and the unelected bureaucrats that staff them from preempting state law.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a U.S. Supreme Court decision.Require a seven-justice super-majority vote for U.S. Supreme Court decisions that invalidate a democratically enacted law.Restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments by limiting the former to the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution.Give state officials the power to sue in federal court when federal officials overstep their bounds.Allow a two-thirds majority of the States to override a federal law or regulation.The full plan can be found here.The one who seems to not want to follow the Constitution is Gov. Abbott himself. If he did he wouldn t want to amend the Constitution as it is written. He s trying to overthrow the government by stripping federal authority away from every aspect of our government as it stands today. He wants to be able to throw out decisions made by all three branches of our federal government. If this isn t treason, I don t know what is.What Abbott doesn t seem to realize is that in a nation where everyone gets a vote to elect in who they want as lawmakers, THAT is how we can change federal laws. We don t throw a hissy fit over certain laws that don t fit with the criteria of what you want for your specific state. That s what the South did before the Civil War when they wanted to own humans as property, and that what he seems to want now to overthrow any gun regulation or marriage equality. What he is proposing is going against the very fabric that makes us the United States of America. The South lost then, and he will lose now.It looks as though Abbott is trying to be the next Jefferson Davis and lead a new brand of Confederate States.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8873, Weird: Ted Cruz Fantasizes About Spanking Hillary Clinton (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz again showed that his campaign is weirder than previous conservative Republican efforts by publicly fantasizing about spanking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.Cruz revealed his spanking fantasy while rehashing the favored conservative conspiracy theory about Clinton doing something nefarious with her emails. In this iteration, Cruz echoed earlier conservative claims that Clinton was involved in a wide-ranging cover-up of the Benghazi terrorist attack in Libya.In response, Cruz said, Clinton deserved  spanking  for supposedly covering up what happened on the fateful night of the attack.A woman in the audience had asked:  For three and a half years people in Washington have been skirting around Benghazi and no one has been held accountable. I want to know what you would do. Someone needs to pay. Ma am you are exactly right. What happened in Benghazi is a national disgrace. Four Americans were murdered. We lost the first ambassador in the line of duty since the Carter administration,  Cruz said.  The immediate response of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the entire administration was to engage in deception, obstruction and cover up. They began by falsely blaming it on some ridiculous internet video, but even before that was the question that everyone should ask is why was security not there in the first place when the ambassador said over and over again, keep us safe. Cruz  added:  We do know Hillary told her daughter Chelsea, well gosh, I knew it was a terrorist attack, while we were out telling the American people it wasn t. You know I ll tell you, in my house, if my daughter Catherine, the five-year-old, says something she knows to be false, she gets a spanking. In addition to lying about the Obama administration response to the attack   President Obama referred to it as an  act of terror  almost immediately after the event   Cruz s conspiracy echoes other sexist belittling of Clinton that has become mainstream on the right.She has often been compared to Lady Macbeth and other infamous women who have orchestrated events as conservatives have often been flummoxed in their quest to attack her and tie her in to one conspiracy or another.Cruz is doing well in Iowa, and could consolidate enough of the fundamentalist right-wing  Christian  vote their to achieve a victory, but his har right persona is almost guaranteed to face electoral failure everywhere outside the solid red enclaves of the south. Indulging in a public fantasy about spanking Clinton will not help that cause.Featured image via Flickr",0
8874, You’ll Never Guess Which Conservative Blowhard Compared Trump To Hitler (VIDEO),"As you re probably aware already, Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill   Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor, yet another Bill   Bill O Reilly   along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, reviewed the video. At the tail end of the segment, O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino,  [B]y making Hillary Clinton the focus, and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby, Monica Lewinsky.  O Reilly continued,  You know, I don t know if Hitler made it, but you know, he might have. It s crazy. So, yes, Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler. Frankly, I don t quite know how to feel about this. On one had, O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand, O Reilly isn t totally wrong. Obviously, there s only one Hitler, and I ve resisted the urge to go there, but the ad is classic propaganda, the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign. Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels, Hitler s minister of propaganda. But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again, if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial, I m all for it. If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads, and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly, thanking him for the easy win, they re insane. This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November. Thanks, O Reilly.Via Media Matters: Featured image via Twitter",0
8875," Captain ‘Murica: Civil War – Theft, Fraud, Booze And Brawling Are Wrecking The Bundy Revolution","The next American Revolution ended before it ever started, by the hands of the very  patriots  that claimed they were ready to die for the freedom poachers and arsonists.Ammon Bundy s occupation of misfit militiamen is already starting to fracture apart because they just can t seem to get along with each other. Brawling, fraud, theft, booze and paranoia are quickly turning the situation in Oregon into the fastest failure of a publicly funded reality TV show ever.Blaine Cooper, whose real name is Stanley Blaine Hicks, was accused by another militia member of assaulting him with a sucker punch. The victim of the assault, Jeff Kagan, quickly called upon the government he hates when he dialed 911 after the assault. No reason was given for the assault, other than the fact Kagan walked from his camp across the street, towards the main militia gathering area. When he approached the area, Cooper attacked both Kagan and one other individual. Cooper also attacked one of a 3-member group of people who came to help remove a suicidal veteran who suffered from PTSD. Allegations were made that Cooper planned on using the veteran literally as a target to provoke a violent confrontation with federal authorities, by exploiting his PTSD and suicidal tendencies. While Cooper appears to still be there, he has prevented others from joining to grow their numbers. Count him as about 3 to 4 lost members.Self-titled  Captain  Joe O Shaughnessy stole crowdfunded money from the group s  war chest  to fuel a drinking binge at a local motel. This caused him to be branded a  deserter and a coward  by fellow militia members, such as John Ritzheimer. After all the booze money was gone, the  captain  left the standoff and claimed all statements made about him by the militia members are a smear campaign.Brian  Booda  Cavalier, who goes by the name Fluffy Unicorn (yes he really does) has also been forced out of the militia as well. This happened after he was caught lying about being a former marine when the US Marines confirmed with the press that he has never served a day in his life. Cavalier was the personal bodyguard of Ammon Bundy for a time.The infamous  blue tarp man  LaVoy Finicum, is also leaving the gathering, despite his allegations that the FBI will arrest him if he does. I need to get home. I got cows that are scattered and lost,  Finicum was quoted as saying. Clearly he should have brought his cows with him so he could take care of them.Initial reports that indicated the militia were numbering around 150 individuals appear to have been exaggerated as well. The group was actually 15 people and now it is down to 12 without a federal officer firing a single shot due to bad behavior and directionally challenged cows.Perhaps the first Bundy standoff was more  successful  and avoided mockery because it was relatively new. Who really knows? With luck, these people will make being in a militia as uncool as your dad wearing socks with sandals while chaperoning the school dance.Featured image via WMUR",0
8876, Republican Presidential Candidate Reveals Their New Plan To Starve The Poor,"Jeb Bush just unveiled a key component of his welfare reform package. The Republican presidential candidate wants to completely scrap the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. It should be noted that  Right to Rise  is the name of Bush s Super PAC.Bush wants to replace those programs with one that gives states  Right to Rise  grants, to support state-run programs aimed at alleviating poverty. Bush refers to the current programs in place as  failed programs  of the war on poverty, on account of there being 47 million people who are still poor in the United States. In the place of these failed programs, states will be given Right to Rise Grants. These grants will allow states to meet the needs of poor families, in the way that makes most sense in each state. As governor of Florida, I saw first-hand how states could be the laboratories of democracy. I know that giving states more flexibility will open the door for transformative ideas to eliminate poverty and increase opportunity,  Bush wrote on his campaign website, on Friday.Bush does not have any interest in reforming welfare to help fight the war on poverty. He wants to further the Republicans war against the poor. This proposal is just an attempt to dismantle the welfare system in the United States, in order to create a less efficient government.If Bush cared at all about the poor, he would support raising the federal minimum wage to a point where working people no longer need to go on assistance programs. Bush doesn t want to raise the minimum wage. In fact, he has publicly stated that opposes the very concept of the minimum wage. As with welfare, Bush thinks that the minimum wage is a matter for the states to work on, not the federal government. There is disagreement between economists on what effect raising the minimum wage might have on job creation, yet almost every economist agrees that raising the minimum wage would lift many people out of poverty. Now, if a candidate, Republican or otherwise, seriously wanted to reform welfare in a way that acts as scheme to lift people out of poverty, they should be looking at what Finland is doing.Featured Image Credit: USDA via Flickr",0
8877, ‘American Sniper’ Widow Gets Set Straight After Telling POTUS ‘We Can’t Outlaw Murder’ (VIDEO),"Taya Kyle, the widow of infamous  American Sniper  Chris Kyle, attended CNN s  Guns in America  town hall Thursday, where she grilled President Obama on his executive actions regarding gun control and safety. Mrs Kyle, who received the  thank you  right-wingers said would never come from the president for her husband s service, took to the moment like a champ, managing to squeeze every conservative talking point possible into a few short minutes.A somewhat bizarre moment came when she told the president we  can t outlaw murder.  She presumably meant that there s no way to stop all murders from happening, so why bother trying if it will inconvenience someone with a 10-minute background check: The thing is that the laws that we create don t stop these horrific things from happening, right and that s a very tough pill to swallow. We want to think we can make a law and people will follow it, but by the very nature of their crimes they are not following it. By the very nature of looking at the people who hurt our loved ones here, I don t know any of them would have been stopped by the background check and yet, I crave that desire for hope, too. Part of it is we have to recognize that we cannot outlaw murder, because the people who are murdering, right, are   they are breaking the law but they also don t have a moral code that we have, so they could do the same amount of damage with a pipe bomb. Mrs. Kyle and those who think like her probably thought her point was some form of a slam-dunk   that the president wouldn t be able to answer. That turned out to not be the case, as her argument is based in NRA myths and lies and not in the reality that we all live every day.She does make some interesting points about the direction the country has been traveling when it comes to violent crime but stops short of reasonable when she says we should be celebrating the dropping murder rates in our country. The president agreed that we don t put enough emphasis on the good that we ve done, but that s because there s still so much horror happening every day.He s right. We can t simply say,  hooray for us, we kill fewer people than we did in 1985, let s stop worrying about it!  We have to remain vigilant and continue to institute policies that will bring the violent crime rates even lower over the NEXT 2 decades as well. The president s actions are a part of that plan and a part of his ongoing commitment to make America safer.Watch the entire exchange between President Obama and  American Sniper  widow Taya Kyle below:Featured image via screen capture",0
8878," Ted Cruz Performed A Totally Awkward JFK Impression, Proving Why Conservatives Aren’t Funny (VIDEO)","Someone, at some point in time, made the mistake of telling Ted Cruz that he s a funny impressionist. If you recall, Cruz previously regaled us with a totally not-funny re-enactment of the Miracle Max scene from The Princess Bride. Correction: Cruz nearly ruined that scene for all time. There s something especially repulsive about a squishy-faced right-wing zealot hamfistedly performing a scene from one of the most beloved comedies of our time.And now, he s trying to sully the memory of one of the most beloved presidents in modern history by doing another one of his   let s face it   really, really awkward, flopsweat inducing impressions.The second place contender for the Republican nomination appeared at a diner in Iowa the other day and unexpectedly broke into his impression of John F. Kennedy.And it sucked. Sucked, sucked, sucked, sucked.Not only that, but he insisted,  JFK would be tarred and feathered and thrown out of the modern Democratic Party.  Um, no. There s no justification for that, whatsoever. Once again, Ted Cruz is totally lying. In many ways, JFK is more liberal than our current Democratic president, and he s absolutely more liberal than the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton.Cruz continued,  You know, JFK said [in JFK voice],  Some men see things as they ahhh, and ask why. I see things that nevah wuhhh, and ask  Why not? STOP! For the love of all that is holy, can someone please tell Mr. Cruz to never, ever do that again? Ever? Along those lines, stop trying to be funny, conservatives. You can t do it without sounding like Lt. Hauk from Good Morning, Vietnam.The whole thing was made worse by the fact that Cruz was flanked by one of the most extreme Republicans in Congress, Steve King. Together, they form a Voltron of awfulness   both of whom routinely exploit the proud ignorance of their supporters. I can t even imagine the seismic disaster that would ve occurred if King had launched into a Reagan impression at the same time. Suddenly the fabric of space and time would ve collapsed and formed a singularity of unfunny that not even light could escape.Again, stop it, senator.

8879, NRA Gets Blasted For Live-Tweeting Obama’s Town Hall Meeting Instead Of Actually Attending (TWEETS),"On Thursday night, CNN s Guns In America  town hall meeting on gun violence attracted the attendance of several gun legislation opponents, but strangely enough the most outspoken pro-gun group wasn t there to counter President Barack Obama on his executive action. Host Anderson Cooper said that the National Rifle Association (NRA) had definitely been invited, but chose not to attend. Proving that it was all talk and no action, the gun advocacy group had declined the opportunity to participate in the live Q&A session with the President, and basically forfeited their right to complain about the issues going forward. NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said the reason the association declined was because the meeting was just a  public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House. However, that didn t stop the NRA from whining and giving their opinion during the town hall meeting anyway. As the organization watched Obama talk about tightening background checks and closing loopholes for gun sales, the NRA decided to live-tweet the event   a choice it would immediately regret.NRA TwitterNRA TwitterNRA TwitterAs Guns In America went on, the NRA made up for its lack of physical presence by filling its Twitter feed with criticisms of Obama and shared several equally ridiculous posts from gun rights advocates. Thankfully, not everyone on Twitter is as thick-headed and came to Obama s rescue to set the NRA straight:TwitterTwitterSome even chose to remind the association to shut the f*ck up since it couldn t be bothered to confront Obama in person.TwitterObama also took some time out of the town hall to blast the NRA for backing out of the discussion and expressed his disappointment in an organization that has been so vocal against gun legislation. He said: Part of the reason I welcomed this opportunity by CNN to have a good discussion debate about it is because our position is consistently mischaracterized.   There s a reason why the NRA is not here. They re just down the street. And, since this is the main reason they exist, you d think they d be prepared to have a debate with   the president.I m happy to meet with them. I m happy to talk to them, but, the conversation has to be based on facts and truth, and what we re actually proposing, not some   you know, imaginary fiction in which Obama s trying to take away your guns.

8880, Heavily-Armed Man Claiming To Be Jesus Arrested After Plotting To Kidnap Obama’s Dog,"A North Dakota man was arrested Wednesday after having driven to Washington, DC with one goal in mind   getting himself a new dog. But the crazed ammosexual didn t want just any dog   he wanted Bo, the First Dog of the United States. Responding to a tip from the Secret Service, police tracked the would-be dog-napper down at a Hampton Inn near the Washington Convention Center.Scott D. Stockert, 49, of Dickinson, N.D., told police that he was armed, directing them to his pickup truck where he kept a 12-gauge pump shotgun and a bolt-action .22-caliber rifle. In addition, police found a billy club, a machete with a 12-inch blade, and 350 rounds of ammunition. He was arrested and charged with carrying a rifle or shotgun outside his home or business, which is illegal in the District of Columbia.After his arrest, Stockert told police that he was Jesus Christ, that he was the son of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and expressed displeasure with the Affordable Care Act. Stockert   or Jesus, depending on whether or not you believe him   says that he was in town to a.) kidnap Bo and b.) to announce his planned run for President and a $99 per month insurance plan. You picked the wrong person to mess with,  he told agents as he was arrested.  I will f*ck your world up. On Friday at Jesus  preliminary hearing, a judge ordered him released into a high-intensity supervision program pending a court date to be set later. Stockert is not permitted to possess any weapons   real or imitation   or to go near the White House or Capitol.Court documents don t specify why he wanted to kidnap the dog, but one thing is for certain   Bo is safe for another day. As for Stockert s presidential campaign  Well, he s already had more ideas than the entire Republican field combined. Maybe he can be the man to oust Trump as the frontrunner. After all, has The Donald tried to kidnap Obama s dog? Think about it, Trump fans.Featured image via JustJared ",0
8881, Obama Was Right About Gun Owners: Here’s What The NRA Doesn’t Want You To Know (IMAGE),"The NRA has an army of puritanical, loyalist supporters who will oppose any and all attempts at gun control. Almost anyone who owns a gun or supports the Second Amendment is a member of this legion that will rise up in fury if anyone attempts to do something as bold as study gun violence in the United States.That s the common narrative that the NRA wants people to believe. In reality, the NRA s membership is huge, somewhere between 3 million and 4.5 million people, but it is a paltry number compared to the number of gun owners in the United States. Approximately 37% of the United s States reports that either they or someone in their household owns a gun, making gun owners a minority in the United States. The exact number of people who own a gun in the United States is unclear, but that number has to be much larger than those who are a member of the NRA.When President Obama announced his plan to enact new gun control laws by using his executive powers, he claimed that gun owners would support the new gun control laws. A CNN/ORC poll reveals that he was right. The Washington Post/Wonkblog compiled the results of the poll into a chart, found below. The poll results show that a majority of people, even gun owning households and Republicans, support the new gun laws. The poll even mentioned President Obama s name during the poll, which can skew polling results, as Wonkblog pointed out. I think it is fair to say that Republicans have a tendency to have negative view of President Obama. YouGov did an experiment that showed that a mere 16 percent of Republicans supported universal healthcare when they said that President Obama supported it. When pollsters said that Donald Trump supported universal healthcare, 44% of Republicans said that they support it, too.Chart Courtesy of WaPo/WonkblogSo, if these new gun law regulations are favorably viewed by the majority and are minimal in their scope, as even the NRA admits, why couldn t they be passed through Congress? That s where the real power of the NRA starts to be seen. They just buy candidates. That s the reality of money in politics, the majority s opinion does not matter. Congressional representatives appeal to the well-funded minority, ideas of democratic rule by the majority be damned. The executive orders that President Obama plans to make law are not the actions of some despot trying to seize guns away from law abiding citizens as the NRA wants their supporters to believe. His hand is being forced to take these actions by the gun lobby who have made effective government unconscionable in the age of rule by corporate oligarchy.Featured Image Credit via The White House [Public domain], Wikimedia Commons",0
8882, The Daily Show Slams Trump And Cruz In Hilarious Double Take-Down (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah and The Daily Show had a field day with the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the funniest segments of 2016 thus far.Birtherism has come back to haunt the Tea Party in a big way as their favored candidate is now dealing with the fact that unlike President Obama, he really wasn t born in the United States. Donald Trump has been happy to point that out as Ted Cruz begins to gain in the polls. And this is comedy gold as far as Noah is concerned. The son of an American mother and a foreign father who graduated from Harvard Law School and dreamed of being president, even though   let s face it, people   he wasn t born in America. That s right, we re talking about Ted Cruz   the Canadian-born Texas senator. This even took Noah by surprise because he  didn t know that this shit could happen to Republicans, as well. Like I thought Republicans were the ones who do this, not the ones who get it done to them. This for me is like hearing that someone roofied Bill Cosby. Noah pointed out the way Trump worked the scandal into conversations and how he is particularly fond of using Twitter to launch attacks. But Noah did not let this be a one-sided scandal. In what could be fodder for Ted Cruz to use in a counterattack, Noah reminded the audience that Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter, which is true because he said he saw it on TV.Indeed, Noah did a segment last year chronicling all of the instances in which Trump has creepily talked about his daughter over the years. You can read all about it here.To conclude, Noah urged everyone to start using the hashtag #DonaldTrumpWantsToBangHisDaughter.Here s the video via Comedy Central.And the 2016 race just keeps getting more entertaining.Featured Image via Screenshot",0
8883, Cleveland School Officer Placed On Leave After HORRIBLE Message About Tamir Rice’s Mom (IMAGES/VIDEO),"An officer at a Cleveland school has come under fire after he posted a status on Facebook that called the mother of slain Tamir Rice a  stupid b*tch  and made vile, insensitive remarks about young police brutality victims.Rice, a 12-year-old from Cleveland, was shot and killed last year by police officer Timothy Loehmann, who saw him playing with a toy gun and shot the boy dead before investigating the situation fully. Last week, Loehmann was let off the hook and cleared of the charges filed against him. Two days after this announcement, Cleveland Metropolitan School District officer Matt Cicero decided to voice his opinion on Rice s case over social media. The page is no longer available, but fortunately the screenshots are. He wrote: Tamir rices momma just want money. Lets make the proper changes raise your kids not to play with fake guns stupid bitch. All this media because the are notgetting what they want  Again pleeeeze anyone who does not like what I post ..unfriendly me or block me your not worth my time. Matt CiceroThis disturbing meme was also found on his Facebook page:Matt CiceroMany people came to the innocent victim s defense, saying that Rice hadn t deserved to die just because he was playing with a toy. Cicero couldn t be reasoned out of his ignorant mindset. He responded to his critics: You pull out a gun you get shot. I don t have time to ask questions and coddle kids that wave guns around. Matt CiceroIn the past, Cicero had patrolled the school district where Rice went to school, and it s horrifying to think that someone with this attitude would be trusted enough to protect children. Cicero has been placed on administrative leave since this incident has gotten attention, however many   including Cleveland City Councilman Jeff Johnson   think Cicero should be flat-out fired. Addressing Cicero s comments, Johnson said: It s disrespectful to women, it s disrespectful to African-Americans. The fact that he s so insensitive and he s placing the blame of Tamir s death on Tamir, for me that s enough for him to be not working with children in the Cleveland school system. Cleveland Metropolitan School District spokeswoman Roseann Canfora called Cicero s comments insensitive at best. In a statement, she wrote: While we respect every employee s right to freedom of speech, with those rights comes a responsibility to do so in ways that are appropriate and sensitive to others, particularly to the people we serve.

8884, The White House Has Issued An Official Response To ‘Making A Murderer’ Petition For Release,"After the release of Making a Murderer by Netflix, people have been utterly mortified by the giant spotlight that s been shown on our criminal justice system. In this particular case, the criminal justice system in Wisconsin.After Steven Avery was cleared of any wrong-doing after a conviction of rape in 1985, he attempted to file a lawsuit against those who wrongfully accused him and purposefully put him into prison. However, the tables were turned once again when instead of getting the justice he deserved, he, alongside young Brendan Dassey, were accused and convicted for their alleged involvement in the murder of Teresa Halbach. The documentary series on Netflix is horrifying to watch, because it shows how vindictive the officers and lawyers involved in the case were to make sure Avery was put back into prison.A  We the People  petition was created on the White House website to ask the Obama administration to pardon Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey. The petition read:Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey should be given a full pardon by President Obama for their wrongful conviction in the connection to the murder of Teresa Halbach.Based on the evidence in the Netflix documentary series  Making a Murderer , the justice system embarrassingly failed both men, completely ruining their entire lives.There is clear evidence that the Manitowoc County sheriff s department used improper methods to convict both Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey.This is a black mark on the justice system as a whole, and should be recognized as such, while also giving these men the ability to live as normal a life as possible.And because of the clear outpouring of support in favor of this petition, an official response has been given by the White House:Thank you for signing a We the People petition on the Teresa Halbach murder case, currently featured on the  Making a Murderer  documentary series. We appreciate your interest in this case.To best respond to your petition, we should go over what exactly presidential pardoning power entails.The U.S. Constitution grants the power of clemency to the President: The President   shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States. This clemency authority empowers the President to exercise leniency towards persons who have committed federal crimes. Under the Constitution, only federal criminal convictions, such as those adjudicated in the United States District Courts, may be pardoned by the President. In addition, the President s pardon power extends to convictions adjudicated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and military court-martial proceedings. However, the President cannot pardon a state criminal offense.Since Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey are both state prisoners, the President cannot pardon them. A pardon in this case would need to be issued at the state level by the appropriate authorities.While this case is out of the Administration s purview, President Obama is committed to restoring the sense of fairness at the heart of our justice system. That s why he has granted 184 commutations total   more than the last five presidents combined   and has issued 66 pardons over his time in office. They also exhibited how many sentences have been commuted by President Obama   far more than any president in recent history. They added:This Administration has taken a number of important actions to reduce the federal prison population in keeping with the President s continuing efforts to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system at all phases and to better address the vicious cycle of poverty, criminality and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. These include:In 2014, President Obama also issued an Executive Order creating a Task Force on 21st Century Policing that produced a concrete blueprint for cities and towns seeking to put in place new strategies to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve while enhancing public safety. (The Task Force s Final Report is available here.)And he has met with Americans across the country who are working to improve the criminal justice system, from law enforcement officials working to lower crime and incarceration rates, to former prisoners who are earning their second chance. Last summer, he became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. And he continues to work with Congress to pass meaningful criminal justice reform that makes the system more cost-effective, fairer, and smarter, while enhancing the ability of law enforcement to keep our communities safe.Thanks again for raising your voices. We hope you ll continue to participate on the platform.It s unfortunate that because Avery and Dassey are state prisoners they cannot be pardoned by the president. It s also unfortunate that they are in Wisconsin with the equally as corrupt Gov. Scott Walker who refuses to pardon the men. Walker s press secretary issued the cop-out response, stating:Those who feel they have been wrongly convicted can seek to have their convictions overturned by a higher court.It s not looking likely for justice to be served for Avery and Dassey, but one can still hold out hope that their convictions for their alleged involvement will be overturned.Featured image via Netflix",0
8885," Watch Maine Governor’s Racist Rant For Yourself, Then See If You Buy His Excuse (VIDEO)","Maine s Republican Governor Paul LePage became a statewide embarrassment yet again this week when he decided to blame the problem of drugs on black drug dealers from out of state.On the very same day state lawmakers were debating whether to file impeachment proceedings for LePage s previous offenses (and there are many), the Tea Party conservative was attending a town hall meeting where he decided to go WAY off script and float an outrageous theory about black people targeting Maine s white women. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  these types of guys  they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. The comments were so unbelievable that several news outlets quite literally refused to believe it had even happened  that is until Maine s public access channel aired the video.Universally loathed   LePage has the distinction of being hated by both Democrats and Republicans who know him   and already facing a strong possibility that he will be kicked out of office for a series of offenses that span everything from calling Obama a racist to verbally threatening a Democratic colleague during a legislative meeting, LePage s seasoned team of spindoctors got to work trying to frame this as anything other than what it actually is. More so than ever before, the need to lie about what happened was dire. LePage s job is on the line.His team offered up this nonsensical word salad: The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. Then LePage, getting truly desperate, went ahead and implied that he was not racist, just really, really stupid. I was going impromptu and my brain didn t catch up with my mouth,  Gov. Paul LePage said. He said he meant to say  Maine  girls and not  white  girls when he made the  slip-up. It was not intended to be race,  he added.  It was intended to be Maine. Are you buying it? Don t.For one thing, the video makes it clear that saying  young white girls  was no slip of the tongue. Watch it again. He didn t stumble over his words. He didn t misspeak. When he got on the topic of drugs, he immediately jumped to the poor  white girls. If LePage is guilty of any mistake it s that he accidentally said out loud what he clearly believes but knows better than to admit to. For a guy like LePage, who has spent his time in office viciously attacking the poor and making ugly racial comments, the idea that black drug dealers would be coming to impregnate his state s white women is a racist trope that fits right in to his worldview.Even members of his own party seem to recognize that this isn t a mere  slip-up,  but represents the acknowledgment of long simmering racist views that he uses to base his conservative policies on. One Republican critic, Lance Dutson, didn t mince words:  This is one of the most blatantly racist statements he s ever made. The scariest part? He said  one of ",0
8886, Obama Can’t Stop Winning As New Jobs Report Shows U.S. Economy Still Kicking Ass,"Today, I would hate to be a Republican strategist. Why? Because with the election only 10 months away, I have to tell my candidate that the economy is still growing robustly and shows no signs of weakness. If anything, it still has room for explosive growth even after adding another 292,000 jobs in December:The jobless rate, which has declined since topping the 10 percent mark in October 2009, is now hovering just above what economists consider full employment   the point where further declines could start to push up inflation.The average monthly gain in jobs last year were closer to the 2013 average of 199,000 a month, but short of the 260,000 figure reached in 2014. The remarkable thing is how consistent employment growth has been over the past three or four years,  said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody s Analytics.  We re getting at least 200,000 jobs per month on a consistent basis. That s quite an achievement. The only downside to this report is that there was no growth to average hourly wages. That s been the  slow  part of this slow recovery. On the plus side, once we reach the  full  employment mentioned above, wages will grow and grow rapidly. Companies will be competing for employees and the way to do that is by offering higher pay. This, by the way, is one of the reasons Corporate America has not been all that gung-ho about heating up the economy. High unemployment means low wages, the second favorite phrase next to  Golden Parachute  for CEOs.But, once wages start going up, people will have more money to spend and that increases demand. Increased demand, of course, requires more people to fill that demand and that means more jobs which means more people have money to spend and so the cycle goes. Slowing or reversing this cycle was the express purpose of the Republican s austerity mania in which they insisted pulling money out of the economy would  help  it. A crippled economy is good for Republican political ambitions.Fortunately, Obama fended off most of their bullshit cuts and instead implemented policies to avoid inflating the economy on a fragile bubble. It may have been slow but the Obama Recovery is incredibly stable (did you even know the rest of the world s economy is a mess?) and so far resistant to shocks. If we keep up this pace, Obama will be handing his (Democratic) successor a solid foundation from which to build a bridge to the future.Maybe they can find jobs for all the Republicans that will be out of work come election day?Featured image via Black Water Dog/Pete Souza",0
8887, ‘Pissed As Hell’ Oregon Rancher FURIOUS At Bundy Militia: ‘This Is My Home!’ (VIDEO),"Georgia Marshall has had just about enough of the white privilege performance art masquerading as a patriotic revolt against the tyranny of something something EVIL GUB MINT! Ever since the Bundy terrorists seized a wildlife refuge in Harney County, the entire county has been seriously pissed off at the presumption of these idiots that they speak for the residents. Unlike the Bundy cosplayers, the residents of Harney are grown ups who have worked very hard to build a working relationship with their government: The progress we ve made in this community compared with the sh*t we went through years ago when you could not stand in talk to a manager,  she told the crowd.  Granted, it s not a lot of progress but it s coming. Marshall pointed out that an organization called the High Desert Partnership was already working  damn hard  for the residents of Harney County. We are the poster child of the ranching community, of the environmental community, of the government community!  she exclaimed.  Have we ever had anybody put together a refuge plan in this god damn nation? Hell, no, we haven t! But it happened here and it happened in Harney County. This is how grownups behave. If you don t like how the local government works, you push and you compromise and you talk and you keep pushing until things start to get better. On the other hand, when you re an entitled, self-important little shit like Ammon Bundy, you pull out your gun, holler about  freedumb!  and demand your every whim be catered to. Especially getting snacks.Here s the awesome video of Georgia taking the Bundy morons behind the woodshed for a shellacking:Now, if it seems odd that a group of anti-government jackasses would show up in Oregon and make demands for a community they don t belong to, you re not crazy. When the Bundy boys originally rolled into town, they were all about the Hammond family not serving the full sentence for their crimes. But, the Hammonds said  Holy crap! These yahoos aren t with us! Please let us serve our time in peace  and the Bundy boneheads suddenly found themselves without a cause. So, as wealthy entitled white people, they defaulted to  Waaaaahhhh! The government is oppressing us!  and demanded they be given more free stuff because in right-wing  Murika, rich white people get everything and screw everyone else.I hope Georgia and the other residents of Harney get their wish for a Bundy-free county so they can live their lives the way they want, not the way a group of wannabe martyrs and cheap knockoff revolutionaries say they should.Featured image via screencap.",0
8888, President Obama To Critics Of His Tearful Address On Gun Violence: I Give Precisely Zero F*cks (VIDEO),"President Obama held a CNN televised Town Hall Meeting on Guns in America on Thursday night, during which he took a moment to remind those criticizing him for showing emotion that he gives precisely zero f*cks about their opinions. He is focused entirely on saving lives, and bringing the plague of gun violence under control.CNN host Anderson Cooper first replayed the President s emotional address for the audience. This is captured in the video below. Obama doesn t work up some watery eyes. He has tears literally running down his cheeks as he recounts the 26 people gunned down at Sandy Hook elementary school, 20 of them first-graders, and the devastation of the loved ones left to grieve the loss. His growing frustration at the intransigence of conservative lawmakers to give so much as an inch in the face of such catastrophic and preventable tragedies has been clear in each new post-shooting statement he has had to deliver to the nation.However, conservatives have concocted all sorts of bizarre conspiracy theories about what those tears really meant. One Fox host even went so far as to argue Obama was using a raw onion to produce the tears.So, when asked about the reaction, Obama took a moment to revisit his encounter with the parents of the children slain at Newtown. What becomes clear is that any human being with a functional level of empathy should be breaking down in tears in the face of such horror. I visited Newtown two days after what happened. So, it was still very raw. It s the only time I ve ever seen Secret Service cry, on duty.It wasn t just the parents. You had siblings, you know? 10-year-olds, 8-year-olds, 3-year-olds, who in some cases didn t even understand that their brother or sister wasn t going to be coming home.And I ve said this before. It continues to haunt me. It was one of the worst days of my Presidency. To those who argued he was crying about the wrong thing, the President had a straightforward reply: I want to emphasize that there are a lot of tragedies that happen out there as a consequence to the victims of crime, you know, there are police officers who are out there laying down their lives to protect us every single day, you know, and tears are appropriate for them, as well. And I visit with those families, as well, victims of terrorism. Soldiers coming home. You know, there s a lot of heartache out there and I don t suggest that this is the only kind of heartache we should be working on. You know, I ve spent a lot of time and a lot of hours, in fact, a lot more hours than I spend on this, trying to prevent terrorist attacks. It s a tough job, being the President of the United States. A role where decisions that are literally life and death have to be made every day of the week. America, and the world, need someone in the White House with the humanity to make those decisions with care and consideration. That s something to remember come November 2016.Featured Image via Screengrab",0
8889, Donald Trump Reveals The First Thing He’d Do If America Puts Him In The White House (IMAGES),"Republican front runner Donald Trump has revealed a truly insidious  First Day in the White House.  His number 1 priority? Removing  Gun-Free Zones  from schools.To much of the world, schools being gun-free is standard. The entire developed world has achieved consensus on the simple logic that deadly weapons and children don t mix. It seems only the Republican Party of the United States and their followers reject this logic. As a result, the U.S. leads the developed world in deaths by gun per capita and school shootings, by a distance which is as horrifying as it is embarrassing.As we can see from the data compiled by Quartz, the United States suffered almost the same number of mass killings in schools between 2000 and 2010 than 36 other nations combined. This figure becomes yet more astonishing when they point out the fact that:In 2010, the US was home to a population of approximately 309 million. The populations of these other countries totaled 3.8 billion.Yet, speaking to an audience in Burlington, Vermont on Thursday night  Trump announced: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools  you have to   and on military bases on my first day. It gets signed my first day, You know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko?  he asked.  That s bait. Trump timed the announcement to coincide with the President s Town Hall meeting on gun violence, which was airing on CNN. President Obama, having been consistently thwarted in his efforts at bipartisan cooperation on gun control, will now use executive powers to implement a raft of measures to protect American citizens from out-of-control gun violence.Donald Trump and the Republican Party just failed a very big test. Given the choice to operate with political courage in the interests of the American people, or with political opportunism in the interests of themselves and their donors, Trump and the GOP picked the latter. In doing so, they put American lives in peril, and proved themselves unworthy of a place in the White House.Featured Image via Flickr",0
8890, Donald Trump Tells Security To Throw Bernie Sanders Supporter Out Into The Cold Without His Coats (VIDEO),"It seems Donald Trump s cruelty knows no bounds, especially after his latest campaign rally.During a rally in the middle of a very cold winter night in Vermont, Trump ordered security to throw a Bernie Sanders supporter out of the building without his coat.Several Sanders supporters gained entrance into the Burlington rally at the Flynn Center throughout the evening in order to heckle and interrupt the Republican presidential wannabe.Of course, the Sanders fans managed to annoy Trump to the point where his campaign team actually began to screen people to make sure they were Trump fans. Considering how Trump has treated protesters and hecklers during previous rallies, it was only a matter of time before he treated them heartlessly.At one point in particular, Trump directed attention toward one man and ordered security to escort him out. This normally would not be unusual since hecklers and protesters are escorted out of rallies all the time, but in this instance, Trump noted the extremely cold temperature outside and told security to throw the man out into the freezing air without his coat. I thought I heard a little voice over there. Get him outta there! Don t give him his coat. Keep his coat. Confiscate his coat. You know it s about ten degrees below zero outside. No, you can keep his coat. Tell him we ll send it to him in a couple of weeks. And Trump s supporters cheered the cruelty as the man was parted from his coat and forced to go without it during a freezing night in Vermont.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump went on to acknowledge that he expected some Sanders supporters to interrupt his rally since he was in Vermont, Sanders  home state.Sanders and Trump have engaged each other recently through media and social media, the most notable of which occurred when Sanders criticized Trump for not supporting wage increases for workers during an interview on CBS. The very next day, Trump flip-flopped on the minimum wage, posting on Twitter that it s bad that workers haven t received much of a raise in years.Featured image via Flickr",0
8891, Seth Meyers Dubs Oregon Militia Terrorist #Tarpman In Most Hilarious Mockery Yet (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day. Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort. Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  Tarpman,  and proceed to mock him relentlessly. Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave. Then, it panned to  Tarpman  hiding with his gun. After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity. He even called  Tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia Clue. Watch the clip below, via MSNBC:Well, it seems that this particular terrorist, Levoy Finicum, has gotten his fifteen minutes of fame, and they re not about to be over.Congratulations, Mr. Finicum. You are currently on short list of extremely stupid people, even by the standards of anti-government terrorists.Featured image via video screen capture from MSNBC",0
8892," So, About That ‘Stand Down’ Order In Benghazi From Hillary– IT NEVER HAPPENED (VIDEO)","That dreadful night in Benghazi, Libya in September of 2012 when the lives of four Americans were lost will be one that we shall never forget. We shall never forget it for two reasons: because of the tragedy that occurred and the loss of life, and because Republicans and Fox News insist that there was some sort of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton in her reaction to events that took place.Clarifying one of the longest held myths by Fox News and conservatives, Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta spoke to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell. Not only did he debunk the myth of a  stand down  order so many on the right like to claim was said in an effort to prove Hillary as uncaring and incompetent, but he also explained how everything that could have been done, was done.Mitchell first asks Panetta about some existing circulating theories about that dreadful night in Benghazi:Now you re here in Washington because you re going to be testifying to the Benghazi Select Committee tomorrow. You have already testified to other committees, but to this committee, and there s a new movie coming out, 13 Hours, and it s about to be released. It is accusing the CIA operatives on the ground of being ordered to stand down and not go to the rescue in time. And the suggestion is that, if not for that order to stand down, that Chris Stevens and the others might have been saved. First of all, you were at the Pentagon at the time, I believe. Was there any order to stand down that you know of?Panetta responds:Absolutely not. You know, I m sure there are going to be movies and books and there will be all kinds of theories that will be presented, but from my experience, and from the role that I played as secretary of defense, there was never any order to stand down. On the contrary, the whole effort was to do everything possible to try to save lives.Delving further into if there were any sort of Hillary Clinton misstep, Mitchell asks if there were any sort of  stand down  order:There s also a report, several reports, that the Pentagon made an offer of a rescue effort, military effort to the State Department, and that someone, the suggestion is Hillary Clinton, said,  no thanks, we don t need the help or stand down or stand back.  Was there any effort by the Pentagon to intervene that the State Department rejected and would she have even been in the role?Panetta offers an answer that many right-wingers are not going to like whatsoever, the truth:I m not aware of any such effort at all. As a matter of fact, after meeting with the president, I immediately went back and we made decisions to deploy forces, to put them in place to be able to go in and provide help to those involved, and we in fact put forces in place. The problem was that [the] attack ended quickly and because of time and distance we never had a chance to get there. This is a tragic event. It s tragic in a number of ways. But most importantly, it s tragic because it s now become a political football that unfortunately, I think, doesn t do service to all of those that were committed to trying to protect lives.Panetta is exactly right. This tragedy has become even more tragic by how it has been wrongfully perpetuated by conservatives to try to score political points against Hillary Clinton. We need to learn from what happened in Benghazi and make sure it never happens again. We also need to, once and for all, put the myth to bed that Hillary was incompetent. She, of all people, is quite aware of the loss that happened that day. She s also one of the best qualified to make sure it never happens again. Video/Featured image: MMFA",0
8893, Numbskull Ben Carson Just Managed To P*ss Off Every Decent Parent In America,"Ben Carson may be the dumbest person ever to perform brain surgery. He has proven time and time again that he has no clue on matters of simple science issue,s and has demonstrated a lack of critical thinking skills that have landed in the  pants on fire  category of fact checkers on numerous occasions.His stories about growing up some street-wary tough guy who liked to beat and stab people turned out to be fabrications. His tales of being held at gunpoint couldn t be verified by anyone. The only thing Carson has ever said that seems even remotely true is that he often felt like the  dumb kid  in class. He likes to follow it up with how he persevered and became a brain surgeon.Whatever it was that pushed Ben Carson through medical school and into a fellowship at one of the world s most prestigious hospitals was definitely not his ability to think on the fly. Left unscripted and with a microphone, Carson is his own worst enemy. That was never more obvious than it was at a recent campaign stop to talk to 5th-graders in Des Moines at the Isaac Newton Christian school.Apparently Carson was again trying to build on that old favorite  dumb kid  card when he turned into by far the dumbest person in the room. Without considering that he was dealing with 10-year-olds, Carson actually asked the class to point to the worst student among them. A Des Moines Register reporter tweeted that at least half a dozen kids in the class singled out one student:W/ crowd of 500 @RealBenCarson just called out to 5th grade class: who's dumbest kid in class? At least half dozen kids point to 1 student.  Timothy Meinch (@timeinch) January 7, 2016If you re a parent and that didn t absolutely infuriate you, you should have your idiot filter cleaned. In what universe is it OK to EVER degrade a child to make a political statement? The student said he wasn t upset by being singled out, which may make Carson feel better, but certainly not the kid s parents.Carson s numbers have been dwindling and it appears his campaign is nearing the end. Hopefully he drops his aspirations to de-throne George W Bush as the least qualified buffoon ever to occupy the Oval Office sooner than later before he causes any more damage.Featured image by Gage Skidmore",0
8894, ‘Family Values’ Republicans Introduce A Bill That Would Make Sex With Lobbyists A ‘Gift’,"You have to love the Republican party. They call themselves the party of  family values.  They hold themselves to a  higher moral standard.  They think they are spiritually superior because they statistically go to church more often than Democrats. All of those things, however, are underscored by the one thing that defines Republicans more than anything else: Hypocrisy.The GOP-controlled Missouri state legislature is considering a bill from Rep Bart Korman that would require the  gift  of sex with a lobbyist to be disclosed, but not with a monetary value. Take your time and read it again; your eyes aren t deceiving you. The actual wording of the bill states: the term  gift  shall include sexual relations between a registered lobbyist and a member of the general assembly or his or her staff. Relations between married persons or between persons who entered into a relationship prior to the registration of the lobbyist, the election of the member to the general assembly, or the employment of the staff person shall not be reportable under this subdivision. The reporting of sexual relations for purposes of this subdivision shall not require a dollar valuation. So .yeah. If you re married to a lobbyist or are in an actual relationship with a lobbyist you re good, but if you re boinking one for political gain you have to report it without attaching a dollar value. That little stipulation would presumably keep parties involved from being charged with solicitation.There is some speculation that the bill has its origins in a political quagmire of corruption that Korman himself is at the center of. According to our friends at Freak Out Nation:What we have here is a classic kindergarten game of  if I can t have it, neither can you  that dates back to a kerfuffle related to a fancypants dinner  meeting  held in January 2015.  The House Telecommunications Committee, which is led by none other than Rep. Korman, held a  meeting  at the Jefferson City Country Club, where the men dined on fancy steaks and other high priced entrees.  Oh, and this dinner was fully paid for by a lobbying group that the Committee oversees.The press got wind of it and the public was so incensed that Speaker John Diehl ordered all future meetings be held at the Capital. Rep. Korman tried to justify the Committee s actions by saying that meeting at the club for dinner was the only time the group could congregate.So here we are, one year later, and Rep. Korman proposes this quite bizarre Bill that requires sex be listed as a  gift.  What does that mean, though? Is he insinuating that lobbyists are engaging in sexual activity with lawmakers on a regular basis? Is this directed specifically at Speaker Diehl or another member of the House? So many questions and no answers yet.Political shenanigans need to be called out on this one for sure, but alas Missouri is Missouri. Republicans in red states seldom feel the need to explain themselves. Should the public become concerned with issues they don t want to deal with they can simply introduce a bill limiting abortion, taking food stamps from children or removing any and all gun restrictions on the books.Shiny object politics at its finest.Featured image via Wikipedia",0
8895, WATCH: Obama Goes BEAST MODE On CNN Anchor For Pushing Gun Grab Conspiracy (VIDEO),"President Obama got real and raw with CNN s Anderson Cooper during a televised town hall meeting on gun violence..@POTUS addresses the ""conspiracy"" that ""we are creating a plot to take everybody's guns"" https://t.co/AFzFmmsvGC https://t.co/p611SWIrgk  CNN (@CNN) January 8, 2016Obama was speaking about the right-wing conspiracy that he is in favor of mass confiscation of guns when Cooper interrupted him and asked,  Is it fair to call it a conspiracy? A lot of people believe this deeply. That stopped the President in his tracks, and he angrily turned to the anchor. I m sorry Cooper, yes, it is fair to call it a conspiracy. What are you saying? Are you suggesting that the notion that we are creating a plot to take everybody s guns away so that we can impose martial law is not a conspiracy? Yes, that is a conspiracy. I would hope that you would agree with that. For years President Obama has had to keep his emotion in check, knowing that flashes of anger and outbursts would instantly give his political opponents fodder for tired, old lines of attack about the  angry black man. But Cooper s indulgence of the right wing myth of gun confiscation came at the wrong time in Obama s presidency. He has a year left in office, with no more elections left to fight without the need to soothe the egos of those spinning wild yarns without any connection to reality.While Anderson Cooper isn t a right-winger like the figures littering the airwaves on Fox News, his invocation of a  both sides  talking point was almost as bad. Obama s actual actions and proposals on guns bear no resemblance to the right s ongoing characterization of them as a  gun grab,  and even less so the idea that Obama supports  gun confiscation. The people promoting that idea   the NRA, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and other figures on the right are simply pushing a conspiracy theory on par with the idea that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an inside job or that the government is covering up alien abductions. It is patently absurd for Cooper to give credence to this wild-eyed assertions, and Obama understandably was put off by Cooper giving it credibility on-air.Featured image via Twitter",0
8896, Paul Ryan Attacks President Obama For Being ‘Distracted’ By Murdered Children,"On Monday, President Obama announced that he was expanding background checks to close the  gun show loophole  and ordering federal authorities to more aggressively enforce the current gun laws. Republicans, predictably, went insane and started screaming  tyranny  and  unconstitutional.  In the world of the GOP gun nut the president   or any lawmaker for that matter   should not ever, EVER try to make this country a safer place because .FREEDOM!One day after announcing his executive action on gun laws, President Obama held a press conference to explain why he felt it was important that he take action. The president was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and when Obama spoke of the twenty children who died that day he broke down and cried in front of the nation. Callous Republicans immediately accused him of  faking  his tears for political gain   new Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was one of those people.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spoke to Yahoo News s Katie Couric, on Thursday, where he was asked if he was moved by the president s tears on Tuesday. The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us. The United States has become a war zone and the weapons of choice are as easy to buy as toilet paper. How scary is that? Murica!Featured image via Gage Skidmore",0
8897, Maine’s Tea Party Governor Just Went On A Racist Rant So Offensive It Could Get Him Impeached,"Worst governor in the United States Paul LePage (R-Of Course) has said and done some truly reprehensible things during his time in office, but the latest bit of toxic sludge spewed from his mouth might finally be his downfall.On Wednesday night, during a town hall meeting, Maine s governor went so deeply racist that even members of his own party acknowledged it was  one of the most offensive statements  ever to come out of LePage s mouth   and that s saying something.While discussing Maine s drug problem, LePage floated the idea that it was out of state black people who were getting (white) Mainers hooked on heroin. It got worse from there. These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty   these types of guys   they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,  LePage told a large crowd.  Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty In a shameless attempt to spin it as not overtly racist, LePage s long-suffering communication director, Peter Steele, said that this wasn t about race. He then gave the following word salad defense. The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,  Steele said.  What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state. There are, might I say, just a few questions left unanswered here. Why did he use names like  D-Money  to refer to the  types of guys  who come into the state from Connecticut and New York? Doesn t that sound a lot like the kind of  gangsta  name a white conservative from Maine might come up with if they were brainstorming the backstory of a black drug dealer? Why did he specifically mention  young, white girls  when describing the kind of girls D-Money  likes to  impregnate?  Does he have any proof that  half the time  out of state drug dealers of any race impregnate Maine s young women?But the biggest question is Does he really think the entire state of Maine is too stupid to notice this for what it is? An ugly racist rant that is meant to stoke old racial fears of black men stealing white women?Democrats have long complained about LePage, but even Republicans are finding it increasingly hard to ignore his egregious behavior. Some have even created a website called  Get Right Maine,  which is an attempt to get LePage booted out of office and give the Republican Party a chance to save their image from the damage LePage has done.For LePage, his racist rant couldn t come at a more vulnerable time politically. Just days before he decided to introduce his imaginary black stereotype D-Money to voters, Maine s state lawmakers were discussing whether they should kick LePage from office or just censure him.House Majority Leader Jeff McCabe, D-Skowhegan, said LePage created this situation with his own actions. We join other Mainers around the state and share their anger and frustration,  said McCabe.  Democrats are focused on the most pressing issues before us. We are committed to addressing the drug crisis, growing access to broadband as well as helping our struggling mills.   The governor has isolated himself and we are not playing his games. He just handed his haters   which is, roughly, just about everyone he works with   a ton of ammunition. Ever his own worst enemy, LePage countered by throwing a massive tantrum, accusing his own party of conspiring against him and vowed to never work with Democrats again.The sooner LePage gets booted from office, the better.Feature image via Flickr",0
8898," Dem Presidential Candidate Asks: What If Right-Wing Domestic Terrorists Were Black, Muslim?","Democratic presidential Martin O Malley just got real about the response to the right-wing domestic terrorists who are occupying federal land in Oregon.Speaking to an Iowa radio station, O Malley, the former governor of Maryland and mayor of Baltimore, was blunt about the ongoing situation. This is not the way we act as Americans and I dare say that the federal government s exercising a lot of restraint here,  said O Malley.  It s hard to fathom or it s hard to imagine if the people taking over buildings by armed force were Muslim or black, as some commentators have said, it would be the same reaction. So hopefully this will get resolved peacefully. They are not militia, they re acting in criminal ways, this is criminal behavior. Since the militia members   led by the son of rogue rancher Cliven Bundy   illegally took over the federal facility, the mainstream media has fumbled over what precisely to call the men. First they were called  peaceful protesters, and  then they were called  armed protesters  in dispatches from ABC News and the Associated Press.Even after one of the men, who are white, made a public statement that he would be willing to die while occupying the government land, the bulk of the mainstream media has been unwilling to apply the label of  terrorism  to their activities.The kid gloves treatment being afforded to the gang   recently federal law enforcement said they could come and go as they please   has led people to compare the treatment to situations like 12-year-old Tamir Rice. Rice, who was black, had the police called on him while he played with a toy gun. Instead of being  talked down  and negotiated with, he was shot and killed in the street and led by the prosecutor a grand jury declined to indict the police officer who did the deed.In addition to the disparity in treatment, Republican presidential candidates have condemned the specific gun-wielding tactics of the occupiers while also heaping praise on the  principles  behind their gripes, which are complaints about the federal government collecting money for the use of land owned by the government.These men and other militia affiliated groups have tried to argue that the government cannot own the land in question, and that they should be allowed to raise profit-making livestock on it without paying anyone.Featured image via Flickr",0
8899, Warnings Issued After NRA Fans Plan To Open Carry Guns Near President Obama,"Once again pro-gun forces in America are trying to intimidate anyone trying to reduce gun violence   even the President himself.Ahead of President Obama s town hall about his executive action to reduce gun violence, warnings were issued about the likelihood of gun fans parading around outside the event brandishing their weapons.President Obama s town hall event on gun violence at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. on Thursday night is likely to provoke strong emotions. And the school s police chief is warning students and faculty that protesters could be carrying weapons on campus   legally. Please be advised that it is lawful to carry firearms in Virginia, and this includes at public outdoor spaces on our campus,  Thomas Longo, GMU s interim chief of police said in an email to the school s internal listserv. Though students are on winter break, the chief wrote that the University Police  will have officers present to ensure that all protesters remain law-abiding. Over the last few years the so-called  open carry  movement has paraded around with weapons in public as a way for gun extremists to show off to everyone how supposedly macho they are.In some cases, these protesters have taken their weapons into restaurants, supermarkets, and major chain stores like Target. Understandably, most parents don t want to have guns swinging around while they re trying to buy their weekly groceries and some stores have begun to ban the open carry crowd.The NRA   who chickened out when CNN invited them to this town hall   has pushed the president as the gun confiscator-in-chief, when in reality at best Obama has pushed for expanded background checks and limits on gun magazines. Now those who have been teed off by this organization   who pays its executives handsomely from their annual dues   have been driven to brandish guns outside an event under heavy secret service protection.It isn t smart, it s dangerous, and at best it will continue to make the pro-gun side of the debate come across as unhinged extremists.Featured image via Wikimedia",0
8900," Donald Trump Claims Paris Is In Germany, But We Assure You It Is Not","If you ve attended a basic geography class, you probably know that France and Germany are separate countries. You probably also know that Paris is the capital of France. But if you re Donald Trump, the man with the  world s greatest memory, you might be a bit confused on that point. See, not only can Trump remember thousands of Muslims cheering 9/11 in New Jersey (a feat even major news networks can not accomplish), but he knows that Paris is in Germany. Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level,  Trump tweeted Thursday.  Germany is a total mess-big crime.  Ironically, he ended the tweet with  GET SMART! Now, since Trump said it, it s likely that conservatives will believe it until they see with their own eyes that it isn t true   so we re going to do a public service and help them out.Now, it might seem scary with all the pictures and colors, but it shows the entire world. No, stop trying to eat it. Don t make me get the water bottle!OK, now that that s sorted out, this map has a thing on it called  words.  Words are those funny little combinations of letters people who don t grunt to communicate throw together to let people know what they want to say. Now, if you look at a place called Europe, you ll notice that France and Germany are right next to one another.Yes, Donald, France and Germany are right next to one another. In fact, one of them (France, where Paris is located) recently played host to a terrorist attack that Republicans often use to justify their horrific calls to round Muslims up into camps and prevent them from entering the United States (sound familiar, Donald?). The other is the place where your hero Adolf Hitler lived.Featured image via screengrab ",0
8901, Local Citizens To Bundy Terrorists: ‘Get The H*ll Out!’ (VIDEO),"Harney County resident Jarvis Kennedy has a message for the out-of-state terrorists who have taken over Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.  Get the hell out of here. Mr. Kennedy, who is a Burns Paiute Tribal Councilman, spoke at a meeting of the council on Wednesday, saying the armed militants occupying the wildlife refuge are unwelcome and unwanted. His comments were met with a round of thundering applause from those in attendance. We as Harney County citizens don t need some clown to come in here and stand up for us,  Kennedy said.  They just need to get the hell out of here. Councilman Kennedy began his remarks by comparing the government s treatment of  Natives  to those of the terrorist organization occupying Malheur. I got a question for the world,  he said.  What if it was a bunch of Natives that went out there and overtook that   or any federal land? What would the outcome be? Think about that. What would happen? Would they let us come into town and get supplies and re-up? For those unfamiliar with the history, Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was settled by the Paiute and other Native American tribes some 11,000 years before it was declared a  sanctuary  for native bird species by president Theodore Roosevelt, in 1908.Mr. Kennedy s ancestors were removed from the land by the federal government.The hypocrisy of those who support the YallQaeda terrorists knows no bounds. These are people who deny that the federal government has  authority  to remove people from their land. Clearly, if that is the case, the land belongs to the local tribes that had lived there for thousands of years before the federal government removed them, not ignorant militiamen from Nevada, Florida, Arizona or any other state of the non-Oregon variety. We don t need them to back us up,  Councilman Kennedy told the crowd.  We didn t ask them here. We don t want them here. Mr. Kennedy made it clear that, in spite of right wing propaganda to the contrary, the armed men occupying the wildlife refuge are terrorists. They say they don t want to bother the community,  he said angrily.  But you know what? Our little kids are sitting at home right now, when they should be at school. They re jeopardizing and they re scaring everyone. Watch Councilman Kennedy s speech published by KGW in Portland via YouTube: Local tribal members are not the only Harney County residents enraged over the out-of-state terrorist occupation of Malheur.A long list of organizations have denounced the Bundy terrorists, including groups that represent Harney County farmers and ranchers, such as the Oregon Cattleman s Association and the Rural Organizing Project.The group Oregon Wild sternly denounced the Bundy s and their supporters as domestic terrorists, holding a community hostage for their own political gain. The dictionary definition of the word terrorism is  the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims.  This word should not be used lightly, but it is exactly what the extremist group currently occupying Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is attempting to do,  said Oregon Wild Executive Director Sean Stevens.Even the Hammonds, the two men these terrorists are supposed to be defending, have made it clear that they do not agree with or support the actions of the men who are terrorizing Harney County.As Portland, Oregon s KGW reports here, Groups representing businesses, wildlife and residents in Harney County have released statements about the protest. None supported the armed occupation at the wildlife refuge. The men holed up in Malheur National Wildlife Refuge have deluded themselves into believing that they are heroes, fighting for people  not strong enough  to fight for themselves.Harney county residents make it clear that these armed lunatics are living in a fantasy world. They neither want or need  help  from the delusional nut jobs that have descended on their community. The citizens see these men for exactly what they are, domestic terrorists attempting to exploit the Hammonds conviction for poaching and arson, in order to further their own political agenda.As Harney County Sheriff David Ward points out here, the Bundys and their followers are not there to  help  anyone but themselves and their anti-government agenda. These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives to attempt to over throw the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. Instead of defending the local citizens, as the Bundy terrorists claim they re doing, they are terrorizing a small community that never asked them to come and very clearly wants them to leave.Featured image via screencapture",0
8902, Mike Huckabee Throws Evangelicals Under A Speeding Bus For Not Supporting His Campaign (AUDIO),"Mike Huckabee is fed up with evangelical  Christians  and threw a temper tantrum because they won t support his run for president.The Republican presidential wannabe aired his grievances with conservative  Christians  during an interview with Fox host Todd Starnes, throwing them under the bus in the process.Huckabee s poll numbers stand at a meager 1.3 percent, which makes him particularly angry at evangelicals as they flock to Ted Cruz. This, of course, sent the former preacher into a jealous rage as he accused evangelicals of caring more about getting rich off social issues than changing the law. A lot of them, quite frankly, I think they re scared to death that if a guy like me got elected, I would actually do what I said I would do, and that is I would focus on the personhood of every individual, we would abolish abortion based on the Fifth and 14th Amendment, we would ignore the Supreme Court s same-sex marriage decision. As we all know, Huckabee has repeatedly said he intends to ignore the Supreme Court and abolish a woman s right to choose and same-sex marriage should he become president. But he says evangelicals are not really into doing either of those things because it would bring their money-making operation to an end. A lot of these organizations wouldn t have the ability to do urgent fundraising because if we slay the dragon, what dragon do they continue to fight? And so, for many of them, it could be a real detriment to their organization s abilities to gin up their supporters and raise the contributions, and I know that sounds cynical but, Todd, it is what it is. Huckabee then accused conservative  Christians  of running on  secular standards  instead of on biblical principles and told Starnes that these organizations should come out and admit to donors that they really don t believe in biblical principles, they just want to dupe Christians into making them rich. Look, we re a club, we re an organization,  Huckabee suggested they say.  We talk about prayer, but we don t necessarily believe that it will change things. There comes a time in our lives where we either believe in a great God who does great things and uses sometimes the weak to get it done, or else we don t believe in that and we just get human might and we gather all the human resources and we live or die by the human sword. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.This little hissy fit by Huckabee is incredibly revealing. Not only did Huckabee decimate any chance he had of getting their support, he basically blew the whistle on how these conservative  Christian  organizations operate and what they actually believe. Huckabee just came out and blasted these organizations of fleecing donors for money by pretending to believe in God and prayer and not really caring about enacting a social conservative agenda because they wouldn t be able to make any more money once it goes into effect.This might actually be the first time Huckabee has been truthful throughout his entire political career, and you can bet that conservatives are going to blow a gasket over it.Featured Image: Wikimedia",0
8903, Watch Trump Fans Attack Peaceful Protesters Holding ‘America’s Already Great’ Sign (VIDEO),"Two completely peaceful protesters were attacked and forcefully escorted from a Donald Trump rally on Monday after loyal supporters realized their signs were pro-Obama and anti-Trump.The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts was packed, and the footage captured shows two men wearing glasses sitting amongst the supporters. The men aren t doing anything to attract attention to themselves other than holding bright yellow signs, one that reads  America is already great  and another that says  God bless President Obama.  Eventually, Trump s fans find out that they re on the opposite side of the voting spectrum.Upon this discovery, a few of Trump s loyal and aggressive minions attempt to start a verbal altercation with the protesters. One man behind the protesters is seen telling them,  Shut your mouth!  while a man in front of them motions to the signs and says, You re at a Trump rally? Ditch those! Ditch  em! When that didn t have the desired effect, the Trump lovers took it a step further. The supporters grabbed the signs out of the non-confrontational protesters  hands and ripped them to pieces as many other nearby supporters began to scream and chant Trump s name. It wasn t long before security surrounded the two men and escorted them out of the rally. Trump can be heard talking over the noise and saying  Friend or foe, I don t know  as he notices the commotion.You can watch a video of the incident below, which was posted by YouTube user Harrison Walsh:Featured image is a screenshot",0
8904," Trump Campaign Chairman Goes Rogue, Is Caught Joining YallQaeda","It appears that the Bundy militia has finally managed to radicalize a highly impressionable American into joining their cause   and it just so happens to be one of Donald Trump s campaign officials.In a shining example of the kind of people who gravitate towards the Republican front-runners campaign, Jerry DeLemus, an anti-government fanatic, dropped what he was doing as the co-chairman of  Veterans for Trump  in New Hampshire to join up with the Bundy family members in Oregon to attempt to kickstart a revolution to overthrow the federal government.According to his Facebook, DeLemus (who is married to a New Hampshire Republican state congresswoman) arrived in Burns, Oregon along with a  videographer  to wage a  psyops war  on the mainstream media that are spreading  lies  about the Bundy brothers. screengrab via Raw StoryDeLemus is no stranger to walking right up to the line of insurrection. He has been adamant that the government is ruled by tyranny and may need to be overthrown. The Bundy brothers are just the kind of fanatics that he would latch on to. As the Daily Beast recently reported, DeLemus spent much of 2013 trying to raise an right-wing army in Rochester. He s begging for a fight. I believe that we have another financial collapse coming soon and it will be worse than the one in 2008,  Delemus warned.  There are stark differences we must realize that we have nearly a 0% interest rate and our debt is nearly double. Not to mention our credit rating has been dropped. On top of this we have a government that has no respect or regard for the rule of law as provided in our Constitution.If we do not stand against this insanity we can be sure we will fully slip into tyranny. We are in a similar position our Founding Fathers found themselves in and their decision to stand was equally difficult. During the 2014 standoff at Bundy Ranch in Nevada, he was right there with the other  patriots,  marching with guns and facing off against the federal government.Apparently, nobody let him know that Trump was not on the same page. Trump may be a racist, xenophobic narcissist, but he s not  let s overthrow the government  crazy. At the same time DeLemus was grabbing his camping gear and buying a plane ticket to Oregon, Trump was disavowing the militia. Trump, like many of his Republican challengers, felt the militia was too extreme, even for conservatives.When asked his feelings on the group, he called them lawless.  You have to maintain law and order, no matter what. It s a bit awkward that one of his staffers is now joining their ranks.So why would a guy like DeLemus support  law and order  Trump? That s easy. They share an affinity for hating Muslims.Inspired by the bigotry in Texas, DeLemus recently tried to organize a  Draw Muhammad  rally in New Hampshire in the hopes of inciting violence between right-wing bigots and Muslim residents. The event fell apart and DeLemus claimed he  won  against Muslims anyway by  spreading awareness. If DeLemus s rush to join an anti-government militia illegally occupying a wildlife refuge shows us anything, it s that Trump s base is teeming with right-wing extremists held together by little more than hatred. It s hard to imagine a single other candidate losing a campaign staffer to an insurrection and maintaining his or her massive lead in the polls, but Trump doesn t rely on anything but his own big mouth to keep himself in the lead.Feature image via YouTube",0
8905," Ted Cruz Reveals Paranoid Fantasy Involving Obama, A Chisel, And Arlington Cemetery (TWEETS)","Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz stunned audiences on the campaign trail this week with a piece of paranoid fantasy that would make Alex Jones blush. On Wednesday, Cruz reportedly told crowds:Cruz: ""We're just steps away from the chisels at Arlington coming out to remove crosses and stars of David from tombstones.""  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016For most rational human beings, this statement would occur as a flight of fear-mongering fancy so far beyond the bounds of reality that it was laughable. But, he is appealing to Republican voters after all   a majority of whom believe the Earth was created 5000 years ago, by an omnipotent God.But even for a GOP candidate, this is out there. So, what on earth prompted this moment of insanity?Context of that Cruz nightmare of crosses being chiseled off soldiers' tombstones: It could happen if 5 liberals dominate SCOTUS  daveweigel (@daveweigel) January 6, 2016Seriously, that s it. Apparently Senator Cruz believes that the only thing restraining Obama from sneaking into Arlington with a chisel and removing religious symbols from the gravestones, is the presence of conservatives on the Supreme Court of the United States.Could it be that the GOP hopeful s rant had less to do with Arlington, and more to do with the fact that the birther conspiracy has blown up in his face?Cruz, born in Canada to a U.S. citizen mother and a Cuban father, is now facing the Birther conspiracy that he so enjoyed inflicting upon President Obama. The three requirements to be President of the United States are:The definition of  Natural Born Citizen  is still unsettled in U.S. law, meaning that Cruz is far more open to genuine challenge by the Birther movement than Hawaii native Barack Obama.This sounds like the desperate rant of a candidate in trouble. As Driftglass points out expertly:Ted Cruz knows the rotting, raving heart of the GOP perfectly well. From his dentist s drill voice to the transparently concocted, treacly fascism of his style, he has spent his adult life meticulously constructing a public persona to fit the madness of his party hand-in-glove.And he is not going to let some interloping radioactive Chia-publican sweep in and steal his brownshirt chumps.Awkward.Featured Image via Flickr Creative Commons",0
8906, Cher Does NOT Hold Back On Twitter As She Calls For Death Of Michigan Governor (TWEETS),"When it comes to the safety of our drinking water that comes out of our taps, we are left to trust those who are elected to keep us safe and work in our best interests. However, what s been happening in Flint, Michigan over the past few years is criminal. Flint s city manager was held accountable to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) alone. They, alongside other officials denied that there was lead contamination in the Flint s water.As Rachel Maddow reported: For more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored irrefutable evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River exposed [residents] to extreme toxicity,  the complaint reads.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River water was as deadly as it was arrogant. Calling officials  conduct  so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience,  the complaint cites the specific experiences of a few plaintiffs and their families, all of whom allege they have been challenged by similar health ailments since high levels of lead and copper entered their bloodstreams.These conditions include skin lesions, hair loss, chemical-induced hypertension, vision loss and depression. Of the four families described in the complaint, two had ceased to drink Flint water after a certain point   and used it only for washing and cooking   but still said they were exposed to many of the same ill effects. Finally admitting to the toxicity in Flint, Snyder declared a state of emergency and apologized, but for many it is too late. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened an investigation into how things could have gone so devastatingly wrong for so long. This is following an EPA investigation that began last November.Needless to say, people are utterly outraged, and justifiably so.Taking to Twitter, legendary artist Cher called Snyder out by name and asked that he be jailed.

8907, The Daily Show Puts Vile Fox Host In Her Place For Accusing President Obama Of Faking Tears (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah has been criticized for not taking on Fox News as much as Jon Stewart used to do, but on Wednesday, the new Daily Show host proved he can be just as tough on them.On Tuesday, President Obama delivered a speech announcing new executive actions to combat the epidemic of gun violence in this country. As he referenced the 20 children murdered at Sandy Hook, Obama could no longer hold in his emotions and began to shed tears. Clearly, the deaths of these children and all the children who have been killed by guns affects him deeply.But the heartless hosts of Fox News quickly accused President Obama of faking crying. Andrea Tantaros of Outnumbered stirred much outrage after suggesting that Obama kept an onion in the podium. I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears,  Tantaros said in agreement with her colleagues.  It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. Trevor Noah, on the other hand, had a completely different reaction. He praised President Obama and declared that it is about time that something was finally done to combat gun violence. Noah even appreciated President Obama s raw emotion. See that thing you re feeling right now, that pain in your chest that comes from watching someone weep on national television, because he knows that society can do better than to file the shooting of children under  shit happens?  That feeling is how you know that you re human. No matter how opposed to Obama s policies people may be or how cynical their politics they have to at least acknowledge and respect the raw authenticity of that emotion. Or so you would think. After playing a clip of Tantaros accusing Obama of crying fake tears, Noah expressed his disgust and lamented that she shares the title of human being with everyone else. Are you fucking kidding me?! Shedding tears when you think of murdered children is not really believable? You know what? There is something here that is not really believable, the fact that the rest of us have to share the title of human being with you. Here s the video via Comedy Central.The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Get More: The Daily Show Full Episodes,The Daily Show on Facebook,The Daily Show Video ArchiveAndrea Tantaros is a vile sorry excuse for a human being for accusing President Obama of pretending to cry over children whose lives were cut unfairly short by guns. It is absolutely heartless for anyone to think such a thing, and Tantaros should be ashamed of herself.Featured image via video screen capture",0
8908," Native American Tribal Leader Shuts Down Oregon’s Cry-Baby White Militia, And It’s Glorious (IMAGE/VIDEO)","It has been almost a week since over 20 armed gunmen occupied a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, demanding the land be returned to its  rightful owners . The Chair of the areas Native American tribe had something to say about that, and it s a mic drop.When chair of Burns Paiute tribe heard protestors would return land to its rightful owners, she joked she started writing acceptance letter  Salvador Hernandez (@SalHernandez) January 6, 2016One of the armed gunmen, Ryan Payne, spoke to the New York Times on Tuesday, claiming that: the federal government unconstitutionally laid claim to land within the United States,  and people who use and love the land   ranchers, miners, and loggers, among others   deserve to have it back.The 5.2 million Native American and Alaska Native s identified by the 2010 U.S. Census might be a little more familiar with this problem that the ammosexual occupiers of the Oregon reserve.An interactive map put together by the science and humanities magazine Aeon shows details the land grab of 1776 to 1887, during which the United States seized over 1.5 billion acres from America s indigenous people by treaty and executive order.The short video below shows the near total transfer of land from Native American tribes to the United States over that time frame.  On Wednesday of this week, the Burns Paiute Tribe, who s reservation is close to the armed occupation, called on the militia-men to leave. The Chairwoman of the Burns Paiute Tribe, Charlotte Rodrique, told Reuters that the occupation was  desecrating one of our sacred sites, I don t give much credence to their cause, she continued. We never gave up our aboriginal rights to the territory, so we as a tribe actually view this as our land, no matter who is living on it,  she said.  We were here first and just want to set the facts straight. Her dignified message somewhat underscores the wanton belligerence of the Bundy militia, who the FBI confirm will face federal charges when their standoff comes to an end. If the federal government owes any group some land, it s certainly not this sad bunch of angry white ammosexuals. Featured Image via ScreenCapture/PL Blog",0
8909, Marco Rubio Panders To Israel By Insulting President Obama In New Campaign Ad (VIDEO),"Ladies and gentleman, the pandering for lobby money is officially on the airwaves. In a new ad, Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio says that President Barack Obama spies on Israel. With all of the problems the country is facing, Rubio decides to mention Israel, a foreign country that receives billions of dollars a year in military aid to continue the ongoing  illegal occupation of the Palestinian people. Why would Marco Rubio spend millions of dollars on an ad to mention a foreign country thousands of miles away?[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMMwWXWCCn8]The answer lies in the money Rubio stands to receive from pro-Israel lobby groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), an organization that can make or break a political campaign with its enormous organization and wealth.

8910, NRA ‘Good Guy With a Gun’ Angry About Obama’s Executive Orders Shoots Up Apartment Building (VIDEO),"Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the  gun show loophole  and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them   like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns, conservatives have been preparing for  war on the President s policies. We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab   that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something, something Dark Side. And, of course, as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric, one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police in Redding, California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building. According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department, what law enforcement found was sort of expected. A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws. If that s not bad enough, he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window. Once police arrived, he began shooting at them: Officers made verbal contact with the subject, described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system. The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers.  Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama. The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up. During this time, officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance.  An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful. After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender, the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand, leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment, in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees,  the release notes.  Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times.  The suspect was declared deceased on scene. We heard the five shots   everyone was screaming,  resident David Rice recalled.  He came out screaming  Obama! Obama! Obama!  (Police) told him to come out with (his) hands up, and he kept telling them  No, no, no. One woman recounted being briefly taken hostage by the anti-Obama shooter, who grabbed her and pulled her into his apartment: As soon as he shut the door, he hugged me and he kissed me on the forehead. He was aiming at a guy, and then he just got sloppy   he was shooting everywhere. The shooter, whose name has not been released, had a documented history of mental issues and was a felon, but was somehow able to get a gun   in other words, he was exactly the sort of person the President s plan aims to keep from being weapons.Fortunately, no one was hurt (aside from the shooter) this time.Watch a video of the shooter below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));EXCLUSIVE: Cell phone video captures exactly what happened at a deadly officer involved shooting Tuesday night in Posted by Madison Wade on Wednesday, January 6, 2016You can also view a report on the shooting here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0-aOi2nkHk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via screengrab",0
8911, ‘This Is A Nightmare’: AL City’s Black Residents Live In Fear Under ‘Confederate Commander’ Police Chief,"The black residents of Dothan, Alabama are, quite literally, living in fear   and with good reason. Their police chief, Steven Parrish, is an open member of a neo- Confederate organization by the name of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Even worse is the fact that officials in Dothan are fully behind Parrish keeping his job as police chief, despite his ties to a clearly racist organization.During a Tuesday government meeting, Dothan Mayor Schmitz allowed just one person in support of Parrish and one against him to speak. Paul Carroll, one of Dothan s black residents, said to the meeting: This would never happen to the Jewish community. You would never see someone who s a neo-Nazi being made chief of police, but somehow we as the black community are supposed to accept that we have a neo-Confederate? Carroll also said to local paper the Dothan Eagle: We are supposed to accept that we are supposed to put our trust and our faith in someone who has those connections? I don t (feel safe). Sometimes when you have had a life of white privilege it is very difficult for you to understand what it is like to be a minority. And Carroll has good reason to feel that way, as Parrish openly says he is a Sons of Confederate Veterans  Commander.  So, it s not good enough to just be a regular member of a seriously racist organization, but he has to be a commander. It is also believed (but not proven) that Parrish was in cohoots with narcotics cops who deliberately planted drugs on black men in the area during his time on the force.Another of the city s black residents, Ruth Nelson, says of Parrish s reign as chief: This is a nightmare. And when we look at the real underlying problems that are causing this..they need to be addressed and they need to be addressed with equality and with truth. Resident Kevin Saffold alluded to the idea that the city of Dothan would soon be in an uproar if the Parrish situation weren t handled to their satisfaction: If you don t want this to be another Ferguson, if you don t want civil unrest, if you don t want people taking matters in their own hands and not being cooperative, then you should do something about that. I believe in the court system and I believe in justice   I don t see no reason why the board should not at least demote him to some other field. All of these residents are right, and they have every right to be outraged and afraid. After all, there will be no justice for minorities as long as the police department is headed up by this racist POS.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8912, Jeb Bush Blames Bad Parenting For Black Crime: Says His Own Kids’ Crimes ‘Not His Fault’ (VIDEO),"Earlier this year, Presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was asked a question regarding domestic protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, which were tied to predatory policing of African-Americans that led to murder-by-cop.Via Think Progress:During a Q & A with employees of the pharmaceutical company Nephron, his response to a question about teachers  unions veered into his thoughts on the origins of the mass protests in Ferguson and Baltimore. Kids in this country are aimlessly wandering around in their lives because they ve never been told they were capable of learning,  Bush said.  They ve never been challenged to achieve far better. They ve never really had the kind of mentoring and nurturing that gives them the sense their lives could be better. You see what happens in Baltimore and Ferguson. You see the tragedies play out. You see people becoming so despondent they take actions that are horrific. Jeb is   with a slightly softer wording than some   using the same old white privilege-ridden Republican response to criminal issues that are a part of the African-American community   blame the parents.Fast forward 7 months later:During an interview with CBS Miami, the topic of Jeb s daughter Noelle came up. Jeb was asked by the interviewer about his daughter s criminal past and multiple issues with drugs. The interviewer specifically asked if Jeb felt that during his time away from home campaigning and during his tenure as Governor,  if he didn t have enough time for his family   and if that made him feel personally responsible for his daughter s problems.Listen to Jeb s incredibly hypocritical response in the video below via CBS Miami:  I can t blame myself. That s not gonna solve any problems, and you just can t do that. Jeb can t blame himself for choosing not to be around for his family when his daughter was engaging in criminal drug activity. However, as you saw above, if you are black and live in a city that means it s YOUR family s fault if you engage in any immoral or illegal activity.Here is some history on Jeb s daughter. In 2002, Noelle was arrested when she tried to forge a Xanax prescription in Tallahassee. A judge sentenced her to rehab. In July 2002, she was jailed for three days for violating her probation by breaking the rules of her rehab program. In October 2002, Noelle was jailed again for 10 more days when she was found in possession of crack cocaine while in the rehab center. In 2003, she finally completed the program and has had a cushy job at one of daddy s companies ever since.These are 3 crimes that were drug related in less than one year. She spent less thantwo weeks in jail total for all of it.It s relevant to know that during Jeb s first year as Florida governor he signed a law increasing mandatory minimums for drug offenses and for minors, including a 3-year minimum for as little as 4 grams of heroin. He also blocked the implementation of  treatment instead of jail  for nonviolent drug offenses. Bush also opposed a ballot measure that would have allowed 10,000 drug offenders to leave jail and enroll in treatment programs. Somehow Jeb s daughter avoided this mandatory minimum sentencing minefield.One final bit of annoyance Jeb s son George P. Bush was also arrested for breaking and entering his ex-girlfriend s home while drunk when he was 18 years old. He walked when charges were not pressed.What an elitist Republican jerk   Jeb Bush really showed his capacity for hypocrisy and contempt for other people by excusing himself for his families problems, while laying ALL the problems African-American people encounter in life squarely on their parents  shoulders.Featured image via Flickr",0
8913, Stolen Valor: Men In Oregon ‘Militia’ Caught Red-Handed Falsely Posing As Marine Veterans,"Two of the men involved in the armed standoff in Oregon have been caught falsely claiming to have served in the Marines. An investigation shows the two have committed stolen valor. One of the men, Brian Cavalier, is the personal bodyguard to Ammon Bundy and has told reporters that he served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Here s the problem: the US Marine Corps has no record of his service. That s because he was never enlisted. The other man, Blaine Cooper, also claimed to be a Marine, but he was only in the  Delayed Entry Program.  He dropped out before actually going to boot camp.A more in-depth look reveals that Cavalier is just a tattoo artist, and not only that, but the only record he has is a rap sheet full of DUI s and theft   nothing even affiliated with the military. That s what police records show, anyhow. It appears he faked his military credentials so he would be more credible to serve in the Oregon gang and get more street cred.Here was the encounter Brian Cavalier had with reporters, who hilariously goes by the nickname  Raging Unicorn: I m a retired United States Marine, I can rage. He also tried to sound ex-military when one journalist asked to access the refuge building, stating boldly: No, that s logistical security issues that we can t have happen, head count can t be divulged for security purposes. When he was later confronted about his false claims, and that the US Marine Corps had confirmed that he was in fact never a Marine, he reportedly got very nervous, saying: That s unfortunate that someone would say that. I m not commenting on anything. I told you what it is. Pic via Latest.No service member who served would ever cower away like that. But, his reply wasn t needed. These guys are fakes   the evidence already proves that. While claiming to have served in the military isn t technically against the law, it s not respectful to the men and women who actually did risk their lives for their country. The 2013 Stolen Valor Act only makes it unlawful if someone falsely claims to have received an award or commendation to receive some form of compensation. Neither of these men violated that.With that said   we have a feeling stolen valor isn t going to be as much of an issue when the FBI presses federal charges against them when this is all over and done with. That much is guaranteed.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8914, The Most Conservative States Depend Far More On Federal Aid – This Proves It (IMAGE),"A new analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group devoted to educating taxpayers, shows that some of the most conservative states in the nation are the most dependent on the federal government. Really? How can this be, you say? Republicans hate the federal government, right? While some conservative states certainly do, the reddest states (most particularly the Bible Belt in the south) actually rely on Uncle Sam far more than the most liberal states in the nation. It s pretty hilarious, actually.Looking at the data, you ll see that five of the ten most conservative states in the country are considered to be in the top 10 (out of 50) that are most reliant on the federal government. The numbers are calculated as a share of government revenue coming from the Fed, as opposed to self-reliant sources within their own state. Each state is given a percentage (located on the map below). This can include Medicaid payments, education funding, infrastructure financing, grants, etc.Pic via GallopGo ahead and take a look. You will see that Mississippi is #1 in both categories; it s the most conservative and the neediest. That s just one example. We have a feeling that each state would turn blue real quick if Republicans got their way on most of their economic policies directed towards the poor. This proves that some of the most conservative states in the country would barely be able to get by without the federal government.Pic via Washington PostSee where California ranks? Not only is it the most populous (by far), but it s considered to be one of the top six most liberal states, you know, the sort that passes all kinds of progressive reforms conservatives claim to hate. Well, guess what? It s one of the LEAST dependent on Uncle Sam. That s right   the state s liberal politicians do a better job generating revenue by itself   i.e. creating jobs, making sure education is a priority, all those liberal ideas that actually make a difference in people s lives   without needing as much help.It s information like this that is sure to blow the mind of any Republican reading it   that is if they re open minded enough to digest objective facts. But, we know better than this. Conservatives don t care about facts. They just know they hate welfare   anyone else receiving welfare; just not the monies they personally get.Featured image via Wikipedia.",0
8915," WATCH: Fox News Just Sided With President Obama On Gun Control- What Now, NRA? (VIDEO)","Hell just froze over, because Fox News is now on President Obama s side when it comes to his new gun safety executive order.Bill O Reilly said, during a segment on The O Reilly Factor, that the NRA and gun owners need to accept that background checks for buying guns are reasonable.I know how unbelievable that sounds, but here it is in a video:Could we possibly have hit a point where the Republican establishment has finally had it with the monster they created in 2008? Has the NRA and its head idiot, Wayne LaPierre, finally become caricatures of themselves that are too embarrassing even for people like Bill O Reilly and Fox News?Here is something that I never, ever thought I would say in my life: I agree with Bill O Reilly, especially on the part about being paranoid. However, there is one part where Bill just had to veer back into the realm of stupidity so he could throw his audience a bone   likely to prevent them from throwing a beer can through their TV screen at home. Bill openly addressed President Obama while saying a firearm registry will not solve America s gun problem.The sudden burst of common sense from Bill couldn t last forever. It is a well documented, checked fact that President Obama does not want to create a gun registry. This was proven when the last universal background check bill completely outlawed the creation of one.Obama s openly accused the NRA of lying about this, from a Rose Garden press conference: They claimed that it would create some sort of  big brother  gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite. This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry. Plain and simple, right there in the text. But that didn t matter. The latest Quinnipiac poll, from December 23, 2015, shows background checks have an absolutely MASSIVE amount of support across the board.Photo: QuinnipiacIt has had this kind of support since after the Sandy Hook massacre, give or take a relatively negligible variance in points, so to act like all of a sudden it is  reasonable  is strange at best.Regardless of the details, the simple fact that Fox News   and Bill O Reilly in particular   are siding with President Obama on gun control is nothing short of a noteworthy event in American history. The internal Republican fallout will be amazing to watch.Featured image via video screen capture",0
8916, John McCain Goes Full-On Birther — Tries To Get Ted Cruz Disqualified From Race,"It s no secret that Senator John McCain hates Ted Cruz. Although he has tried to hide it by repeatedly calling the Republican presidential candidate a  friend,  it s hard to look past the time he called him a  wacko bird. He has also been very vocal about his disdain for Cruz s government shutdown tactics and in 2015 he said that he basically disagrees with the candidate s entire platform. With all of this in mind, it was really no surprise when McCain added his opinion to the Ted Cruz citizenship controversy.By now, you have probably all heard about Donald Trump questioning whether or not Ted Cruz was qualified to be president because he was born in Canada. The Constitution says that only a  natural-born  citizen can sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, and the GOP front-runner implied that he didn t know if Cruz was a legal candidate.During an interview on Wednesday on Phoenix radio station 550 KFYI s Chris Merill Show, John McCain said  he didn t know  if Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada: I know that came up in my race because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the Canal Zone which is a territory. Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona when it was territory when he ran in 1964. .Asked if the Supreme Court might have to weigh in on the  natural born citizen  issue, McCain said,  It may be, that may be the case. It is likely that John McCain doesn t really question whether or not Cruz is eligible to be president; instead it seems as though he was trolling the senator a little bit. But if he does actually question his right to run, he may be trying to get the party to disqualify the Tea Party maniac.Although McCain has made some pretty stupid political decisions in the past (cough..Sarah Palin cough), he is basically a moderate Republican and not as loony as the Teabillies who have hijacked his party. That means he knows that even though the Constitution does not specifically define  natural born citizen,  the consensus is that if a person is born to American parents, even in a foreign country, they are  natural born. What s really funny about this whole non-scandal is that we are seeing the Republican Party target their own candidate in the same way many attacked President Obama   and he was actually born in the United States.Oh the irony Featured image via Salon",0
8917, Huge Progressive Group Demands Debbie Wasserman-Schultz Immediately Resign As DNC Chair,"Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz has been under a tremendous amount of fire lately for what some Democrats perceive as a vendetta against Senator Bernie Sanders. Liberals have accused the DNC chair of  fixing  the primary in Hillary Clinton s favor and there have been many calls for her to step aside. Now, a large progressive group is adding their voice to the fray after comments the chairwoman made in the New York Times Magazine about Roe v. Wade.CREDO Mobile, a phone company that uses their profits to fund liberal causes and has a network of more than 3.6 million people, started a petition calling for Wasserman-Schultz s resignation. The petition was prompted by an interview that was published Wednesday morning in which the chairwoman said there is  a complacency among the generation of young women whose entire lives have been lived after Roe v. Wade was decided. The comments garnered immediate backlash as women took to Twitter and lashed out at her using the hashtag #DearDebbie. She later clarified her remarks, saying: For many in my generation who lived the majority of our lives with the right to make our own health care choices, there wasn t a sense of urgency after Roe v. Wade settled our right to a safe and legal abortion. Since then, opponents worked aggressively to chip away at women s reproductive freedom and they have awakened a sleeping giant in the millennials leading the fight in defense of the progress we ve made. CREDO fired back at Wasserman-Schultz with the petition demanding she step down, claiming:Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz just accused young women of  complacency  in the fight for abortion rights.Young women, especially low income women and women of color, have been bearing the brunt of the right-wing s relentless assault on abortion rights and have been leading the charge to fight back. Wasserman Schultz s comment shows how out of touch she is with the progressive core values of the Democratic activist base, and is just the latest in a string of unacceptable actions that makes it clear it is time for her to resign as chair of the DNC.The group also accused her of rigging the primary to  suppress Democratic turnout,  putting her personal interests before the party, trying to sabotage the president s Iran deal, and siding  with anti-progressive special interests. Whether you agree with CREDO or not, the debacle on Wednesday and the others in the months leading up to it, show that there is a rift forming in the party that is not good for us. With the primaries right around the corner and the general election just months away, we need to unite for the good of our party. The infighting is unhealthy and the more divided we become, the better the chances are that we could see a Republican in the White House. Do you really want a President Donald Trump or President Ted Cruz?It is time to put our differences aside and focus on beating the GOP in November; we can handle everything else afterward.Featured image via Florida Politics",0
8918, The White House Had WAY Too Much Fun Trolling Birthers Over Ted Cruz (VIDEO),"For seven years there s been several folks, let s call them birthers, who have questioned the validity of President Obama s United States citizenship. These people refuse to believe that the president was born in Hawaii, and refuse to believe that even if he wasn t (he was), that he was born to an American citizen, his mother. When it comes down to it, it s not that they question the validity of Obama so much as they question the validity of having a black president. After all, he doesn t look like any other former president, so he must not be from here, right? Wrong.Now, if birthers really wanted to go after someone vying for the Oval Office, they, quite literally, could go after Senator Ted Cruz. You see, Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen. However, just like Obama he was born to an American citizen, so he is, in fact, a natural-born citizen as the Constitution stipulates, but if you re going to go after anyone for being foreign-born, Cruz makes a much better target.Lately on the campaign trail, Captain Birther himself, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, has brought up the legitimacy of Ted Cruz s ability to run for president. He s even gone so far as to want Cruz to  go before a judge  to make a ruling on his citizenship.Getting a good giggle from all of this was none other than White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who, when asked about Cruz and this line of questioning regarding citizenship, answered: It would be quite ironic if after seven or eight years of drama around the President s birth certificate, if Republican primary voters were to choose Senator Cruz as their nominee. Somebody who actually wasn t born in the United States and only 18 months ago renounced his Canadian citizenship. Which is very true. If these Republican birthers, who were so angry at the make-believe possibility that Obama was not born in the nation actually vote for a man who, in all legitimacy, wasn t born in the country, it would not only be ironic, it would be hypocritical, and prove the entire birther movement is steeped in racism.It s impressive that Earnest was able to hold himself together as much as he did after that question was asked.

8919, Brokeback Bundy: Hilarious Hashtag Mocks What The Militia Is Getting Up To In The Woods,"The Bundy brothers and their militia continue to play patriots at an Oregon wildlife reserve, but the rest of the world hasn t joined in their revolution. In fact, people are getting really good at mocking them.As the FBI announced that it would be cutting off power to the building and supplies have already begun to run low (who knew you needed more than a few boxes of Ramen noodles to sustain you on an months-long occupation of a federal building?), things are looking pretty desperate for the anti-government fanatics hold up within. It s an open question of how long they will stubbornly insist on staying out in the cold to prove how macho they are.Other than a few baffling interviews, and one hilarious blue tarp, the Bundy s have been mostly quiet. The rest of the world is left to wonder what they are getting up to in there on these cold nights.Needless to say, Twitter began speculating  and the right-wing militia isn t going to like what they came up with.Under the hashtag #bundyeroticfanfic, people from around the country are describing   sometimes in lurid detail   the romantic encounters the Bundy s and their companions may be having while trying to keep warm.

In interview after interview, Cliven Bundy s son, Ammon, spoke breathlessly about how noble and important the occupation of this wildlife refuge was for  freedom.  The reality was anything but awe-inspiring. Ammon has made repeated calls for others to join him and bring supplies, but few have heeded his call. The relentless mocking paired with the group s own embarrassing moments in front of the camera have made even sympathetic right-wing anti-government nut jobs like Sean Hannity recoil.When you ve lost Hannity, you ve lost your right-wing revolution.Ironically, it turns out that all the guns they brought along with them while they were dreaming of a showdown with the government didn t stand a chance against the relentless mockery they have received from the internet. Their cause was doomed to fail, but it s hard to imagine they anticipated it failing because people couldn t stop laughing at them.

Be Arrested For Poisoning Flint’s Water (IMAGE),"Michael Moore has joined others in calling for U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder for not preventing lead from contaminating the city of Flint s water system. Moore was born and raised in Flint, MI. His first documentary film, Roger & Me, chronicles the downfall of Flint and explains how its demise was orchestrated by big business and conservative policy.Moore posted a photo of himself on social media that shows him holding a pair of handcuffs. In his other hand, Moore is holding up a sign which reads, #ArrestGovSnyder. Activists have been using the hash tag to call attention to Flint s water crisis, and Snyder s culpability in the matter.https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153223367636857/?type=3&theaterAccompanying the photo, is a letter written by Moore condemning Snyder over the crisis. Moore Writes: Dear Governor Snyder:Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.And for that, you have to go to jail.To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven t figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.By taking away the city s clean drinking water in order to  cut costs,  and then switching the city s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created. Moore argues that Snyder is a criminal, and should be arrested for switching the city s water source to the Flint River, which caused the contamination. Moore argues: Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don t like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you   and this time, I hope, it s going to convict you. Other celebrities have been quick to fire off on Snyder after the hashtag surfaced.

8921, FBI: Bundy and His Band Of Domestic Terrorists Will Face Federal Charges When Their Tantrum Ends,"Federal authorities have no intention of killing the Bundy brothers and their traitorous followers. They d rather arrest them and put them behind bars.Thus far, the federal government has been incredibly tolerant of the armed white rednecks currently occupying a federal wildlife refuge building in Oregon.The militants would like to engage federal law enforcement in a firefight to the death, but seeing as how authorities are planning to cut electricity to the building and the fact that the men had to beg for supplies because they failed to prepare for the long haul, it won t be long before the cold winter and hunger force them to surrender.The FBI and Sheriff s office are counting the felonies and misdemeanors each member of the group has committed since the beginning of their stunt, and according to Harney County Sheriff David Ward, the FBI intends to arrest them and make them pay the consequences for their actions. The bureau has assured me that those at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will at some point face charges,  Ward told Oregon Public Broadcasting on Tuesday. He then warned the militant that things will only get worse for them the longer they refuse to surrender.  They have an opportunity right now to work towards a better solution, and not face further charges,  he said.Indeed, right now the group faces charges of sedition and treason against the United States. In addition, they also face charges for breaking and entering, carrying guns on federal property, and trespassing, just to name a few.If found guilty of a felony, they would also be departed from the ones they love the most their guns.So while the federal government isn t going in with guns blazing, they are taking steps to end the pathetic little rebellion and are waiting to place each domestic terrorist in shiny metal bracelets.To help speed up the process, Sheriff Ward also pleaded for people to stop sending supplies to the militants. I think if one person gives them a Snickers bar, they re going on national media and claiming that the community supports them. If you re giving them support, you re just prolonging the situation. Here s the audio via Oregon Public Broadcasting.It s been a rough week for Bundy and his buddies. Not only have they been roundly condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, they can t even catch a break from Fox News and have been mercilessly mocked across the country, becoming a national punchline.For now, all we can do is wait for Bundy and crew tuck their tails between their legs and surrender to see if the FBI keeps their word that they will face charges for their crimes. Until then, let the mockery continue.Featured Image: Wise Geek",0
8922, This Incredibly Powerful Statement From A Teen Survivor Of A School Shooting Can’t Be Missed,"When we think of school shootings, we often think of those directly involved   the dead, the wounded, the people who saw the gunman s face. Desiree Palmer was not in the room at Marysville-Pilchuk High School in Washington, when freshman Jaylen Fryberg stormed into the school cafeteria and shot five other students, killing four, before fatally shooting himself. But she, along with an entire community, felt the impact.Desiree s story was brought to my attention by none other than Montel Williams. Williams, a proud, gun-owning conservative, recently said that he watched President Obama outline his plan to ease the suffering in this country by taking executive action on firearms   not, of course, by stripping ownership from law-abiding citizens as the NRA and its acolytes fear, but through a series of common-sense reforms.While some cling to the idea that any reform is a sign that Obama is coming for their guns, Williams takes a more reasonable stance, as he explained via Facebook: I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill. That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams told his inevitable detractors.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. Truly responsible gun owners, Williams says, support common-sense reforms.The talk show legend told Addicting Info that Palmer s story helped him form his opinions, that reading her words sherpad him to the conclusion that something has to be done:We agree that Palmer s words need to be read by all. Though she was not in the cafeteria she felt the loss, lived through the terror, and still struggles to cope with the terror of that day. While it might be easy to assume that the suffering begins and ends with the victims and their families, when violence occurs it hurts everyone around.In it, you will see the strength of a young woman who knows a fear many (or most) do not  the fear that someone she knows, a loved one, a friend might pick up a gun. That friends will die far too young. That life will never be normal again.I think it is safe to say that I have always been a pretty fearful person. I am afraid of failure, displeasing people, not doing the right thing; but I have never been afraid of the actual world, until now. October 24th will be a day I always remember because it has challenged almost everything that I believe in. I wasn t in the cafeteria and I wasn t close to the ones we lost. Yet still, I am not okay. And I hate the response I have been getting by admitting that. People say,  well, you weren t even in there so why do you still let it bother you?  I seriously asked myself that question for the longest time until I realized that I am allowed to feel how I feel. I feel weird, abnormal, dysfunctional, incapable, unsocial, exhausted, broken, and weak. But I also feel nothing at all.I go to school and watch everyone pretend like things are normal.I go to school and pretend things are normal.And I am so sick of it.It has been 90 days since the shooting and it seems like things are almost worse than ever Behind closed doors, that is. I think all of us realize it, but think we are too crazy to actually believe that MAYBE it is acceptable for us to still be in pain. Teachers avoid the subject because it s uncomfortable and parents avoid it because they don t know what to say. Everyone avoids it because they think they are alone.I am asking this for myself and my peers at Marysville-Pilchuck: please, someone, say something.Say something besides  It s time to get back to work! We have tests in May! Say something besides  We have to move on  or  You ll get through it .We need to hear,  It s okay to not be okay right now , because a lot of us don t think it is.It is so frustrating to be in an environment that settles for the worst just because one horrible thing has happened. The most common thing I see in my community is the mindset that horrible things are going to happen and we just have to let them. Some days I am too tired to deal with the emotions, but most days, I m just pissed off. We all need to heal, but letting fear hinder our ability to create the good things again is not helping. We have had enough taken away from us.I have a dream at least once a week that involves me being the target of a shooting at my school. Often times, one of my peers is the one holding the gun I think that is what scares me the most. This time, it wasn t some  bad guy  or stranger, it was a friend to many and a family member. I can t help but think that my dreams represent my newly-born fear of trusting other people.I guess you just never really know these days.I have been trying to write this post for about 2   months. Every few weeks, I go back and read what I had said the last time I wrote. Each time, I try to finish it, but never do. When I started, it was November 22nd. I explained what I went through on that day from beginning to end. The second entry, was right before Christmas and at that point, I was just sad. It s scary to watch myself explain how I have reached acceptance of reality, and then a few short weeks later, describe how I am absolutely falling apart. I have never been so confused in my entire life.To be honest, I still don t really know what I am trying to accomplish by writing this. Maybe someone will read it and know they aren t the only one who feels like they re just going through the motions every day. My hope isn t that you understand me, it s that I start to.Today I am angry and fearful.Angry that the world is the way it is, and fearful of the same thing.Desiree PalmerMarysville-Pilchuck High School studentIt s easy to get lost in the debate over whether or not it is worth it to enact gun legislation. After all, we often hear that  criminals don t care about gun laws    or, from more callous individuals, that  your dead kids don t trump my Constitutional rights. Lives lost in school shootings are not the  price of freedom  as we often hear. They are future doctors, lawyers, musicians, artists, police, and more. They are our future, which we see stripped away with every bullet fired as a result of our lack of action. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  the President said of his planned reforms.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  Obama said   and he s right. If expanded background checks and other reasonable reforms can stop a single act of violence or save a single life, then they are worth it. Period.Featured image via KIRO7",0
8923," Bristol Palin Being Sued For Custody And Child Support, Probably Wishes She Had Practiced Abstinence Now","Bristol Palin brought this upon herself. After all, she could have just practiced what she preached. Now, it s her turn to take responsibility.But she didn t, and now the daughter of America s village idiot has a second out-of-wedlock baby by a second dude, who now wants Bristol to pay him child support as well as give him joint physical custody of the little girl named Sailor Grace.Palin has already been embroiled in battles with her other baby daddy Levi Johnston over their 7-year-old son Tripp. And now she gets to battle Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.According to legal documents obtained by Radar Online: The parties have reached a final custody and visitation agreement for residing in the same community and have executed, personally and through their attorneys, a confidential stipulation regarding custody. Therefore, the only pending issue to be addressed by the Court is the matter of past and future child support. And Bristol Palin isn t the struggling single mom she pretends to be. She has a lot of money to make child support payments.After getting knocked up and giving birth the first time around, Palin became a paid spokesperson for for an abstinence-only campaign, making $262,000 in 2009 alone. And then she got a $100,000 payday by selling her story to In Touch Weekly. And Palin owned a $400,000 modern lakefront home in Alaska, pictures of which you can see here.Combine all of that with the millions of dollars her mom has suckered from conservatives across the country via donations and book sales and it becomes quite clear that Bristol can afford to pay child support.One would think Bristol would learn her lesson by now. But apparently she s quite comfortable being paid to preach abstinence while having sex and babies with any guy she meets. The hypocrisy is stunning and makes it hard to feel sorry for her.For years now, she has criticized women and girls for being irresponsible when it comes to sex and birth control. Now it s time for her to take responsibility for her own actions, which means she should have to pay child support in a timely manner so that her child can have at least one parent who has some discipline and isn t a spoiled brat who whines all the time.Featured Image: Inquistr",0
8924, All Talk NRA Refuses Chance To Debate Obama Over Gun Control On Live TV,"Apparently the only thing the National Rifle Association and the White House can agree on is that President Obama would smoke them in a debate on gun control.CNN extended an invitation to the NRA, the nation s most powerful gun lobby, to join Obama during a live town hall on Thursday evening in Virginia to discuss the issue of gun violence. They gracelessly declined.NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam seemed willing to assume the NRA would come out of the debate looking very badly. He claimed the White House would rig the event and turn it into a  public relations spectacle. In other words, the NRA believes it would lose and Arulanandam is desperate to think of a good excuse as to why that is.Undermining this excuse, however, is the fact that it is CNN, not Obama, that is organizing the event.A CNN spokesperson said that it was the network, not the White House, that proposed the idea of a town hall on guns, and noted the audience would be evenly divided between organizations that support the Second Amendment including NRA members as well as groups that back gun regulation.The only ones too afraid to show up to this mixed crowd are NRA representatives.And while it s laughable that the NRA already threw in the towel before the debate even began, they are justified in being worried about what they would face if they were brave enough to show up. As Obama proved numerous times during his two presidential elections, he s a formidable debate opponent. It is also clear that the issue of gun control is an area that Obama is fired up about. For years, Republicans in Washington and their pro-gun benefactors have stymied any and all attempts to address mass shootings. Entering his last year in office, Obama is done playing games. Earlier this week, he gave an emotional and powerful speech about the need for better gun control   and what he plans to do about it. Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying,  Obama said.  I reject that thinking. We know we can t stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence,  he added.The NRA seems content to fight against any conceivable campaign to stop needless gun violence. This includes floating reckless lies that Obama is a tyrant seizing people s guns. On social media, the lobbying group regularly promotes misinformation to its gullible followers. They aren t used to being called out on it.Now that it is time to actually face Obama, it s no wonder they can t do it.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",0
8925, College Moves to Fire Christian Professor For Saying Christians And Muslims Worship Same God (VIDEO),"Professor Larycia Alaine Hawkins upset administrators at Wheaton College when she donned a headscarf last month to show solidarity with the Muslim community in the wake of anti-Islamic sentiment across the country. Wheaton College, which touts itself as a Christian school, also had a problem with Hawkins when she said that Muslims and Christians worship the same God, quoting Pope Francis.  In a statement, Wheaton College initiated a termination-for-cause proceeding against Professor Larycia Hawkins on Tuesday, saying Hawkins wouldn t participate in  clarifying conversations  about theological issues.Here is the Facebook post that Wheaton found problematic://  I don t love my Muslim neighbor because s/he is American. I love my Muslim neighbor because s/he deserves love by virtue of her/his human dignity. I stand in human solidarity with my Muslim neighbor because we are formed of the same primordial clay, descendants of the same cradle of humankind a cave in Sterkfontein, South Africa that I had the privilege to descend into to plumb the depths of our common humanity in 2014. I stand in religious solidarity with Muslims because they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God. But as I tell my students, theoretical solidarity is not solidarity at all. Thus, beginning tonight, my solidarity has become embodied solidarity. As part of my Advent Worship, I will wear the hijab to work at Wheaton College, to play in Chi-town, in the airport and on the airplane to my home state that initiated one of the first anti-Sharia laws (read: unconstitutional and Islamophobic), and at church. I invite all women into the narrative that is embodied, hijab-wearing solidarity with our Muslim sisters for whatever reason. A large scale movement of Women in Solidarity with Hijabs is my Christmas  # wish  this year. Perhaps you are a Muslim who does not wear the veil normally. Perhaps you are an atheist or agnostic who finds religion silly or inexplicable. Perhaps you are a Catholic or Protestant Christian like me. Perhaps you already cover your head as part of your religious worship, but not a hijab. I would like to add that I have sought the advice and blessing of one of the preeminent Muslim organizations in the United States, the Council on American Islamic Relations,  # CAIR , where I have a friend and Board colleague on staff. I asked whether a non-Muslim wearing the hijab was haram (forbidden), patronizing, or otherwise offensive to Muslims. I was assured by my friends at CAIR-Chicago that they welcomed the gesture. So please do not fear joining this embodied narrative of actual as opposed to theoretical unity; human solidarity as opposed to mere nationalistic, sentiment. The statement above sends a message of love and tolerance and it s the college that exudes intolerance and Islamophobia by firing this courageous woman. Professors also have the right to academic freedom. One can only imagine the consequences of muzzling professors because they speak about important social issues. One of the most cherished aspects of the American way is the right to freedom of speech. Wheaton College has violated that right by moving to terminate the professor. A petition signed by tens of thousands has been circulating to reinstate the professor.Here is what Illinois Committee A on Academic Freedom had to say about Wheaton s actions: There can be no doubt that Wheaton s attempt to fire a professor for expressing support for Muslims is an attack on academic freedom. But what few have realized is that this bigotry also an attack on the Christian values of loving thy neighbor that Wheaton pretends to embrace. The administration at Wheaton is not just betraying the values of freedom that every true college must stand for, they are also betraying the values of Wheaton College itself. Here is Professor Hawkins  graceful response on the move to terminate her: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SRRq3SdcBo] Show your support for Professor Hawkins by signing and sharing this petition.Featured image: screegrab",0
8926, Watch The NRA’s Wayne LaPierre Support Then Oppose Then Support Firearm Background Checks (VIDEO),"It s no secret that NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre is totally fricking nuts. Unfortunately for him, his newest online video won t ameliorate his reputation for being a well-financed escaped mental patient.Cutting to the chase, LaPierre s video goes something like this:1) Background checks should be expanded. 2) Background checks shouldn t be expanded. 3) The NRA helped create background checks!I m not exaggerating. LaPierre opens by discussing how the NRA has been actively pushing for the background check system to be augmented to include mental health records, which, LaPierre says, would ve prevented a long list of recent mass shootings. By the way, smart move, Wayne. Thanks for reminding us about some of the most tragic gun related killing sprees of our lifetime. I m not sure whether acknowledging the roster of homicidal killers is the best way to pitch the NRA s pro-gun position, but there it is.He continued by taking a sharp right-hand turn   criticizing the expansion of background checks to include gun shows and internet sales after having just seconds earlier supporting the idea. See, apparently expanding background checks to include mentally ill people is somehow better than expanding them to include gun shows.The video wraps with yet another whiplash-inducing pivot. LaPierre explains how the NRA was instrumental in establishing the National Instant Check System in the first place, an obvious admission that the NRA once supported a gun-regulation measure, the expansion of which is now inexplicably forbidden.Okeedokee.The bottom line: yes, the system could be heftier. The problem is that LaPierre and his flying monkeys spend millions of dollars intimidating or buying-off lawmakers who render ineffective any efforts to improve the system. In other words, any weaknesses in the system can almost entirely be blamed on the NRA. And if a bill that fortifies the system is introduced, the NRA will inevitably kill it. Why? Anything that makes it more difficult for consumers to buy guns will be opposed simply because the NRA is solely tasked with selling guns. LaPierre knows the Second Amendment is nothing more than a convenient marketing gimmick for selling deadly weapons to sociopaths.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLTMkg1RLW0]Featured image via video screen grab",0
8927, Alabama’s Chief Justice Just Spit On The Constitution: Reinstates Ban On Gay Marriage,"One would think that to hold a position like Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court you would have to know a thing or two about the law. Justice Roy Moore, the same guy who lost a battle and his job over the statue of the Ten Commandments in the Alabama State House, is looking to once again defy the Supreme Court of the United States and the Constitution he is sworn to uphold and protect.Moore sent word on Wednesday that the SCOTUS ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide doesn t apply to Alabama. Citing the fact that the case was ruled on for other states   not Alabama   and how right Kim Davis was to refuse to do her job, Moore laid down the gantlet to his next impeachment.Apparently Moore doesn t quite understand how the judicial branch of the federal government works, nor does he understand the 14th Amendment. The gay marriage ruling was specifically intended to extend the rights of couples in one state to all states in the union.Pesky little things like facts, procedure and protocol don t matter to Moore, whose Administrative Order reads: Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect, Moore and other opponents of equality have said there is confusion about the actual meaning of the Supreme Court s historic Obergefell v Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in every state in the union. Confusion and uncertainty exist among the probate judges of this state as to the effect of Obergefell on the  existing orders,'  he wrote.Those  existing orders,  essentially an archaic ban on a now-legal practice, were more than clarified when a federal judge ordered in July that the SCOTUS ruling was binding on all probate judges in Alabama. Judges from two counties have discontinued licensing for the time being, but could ultimately face the same fate as Kim Davis if they continue to violate a federal order.Roy Moore told CNN that the vendetta he has against same-sex marriage isn t a religious issue; it s about the law. Roy Moore is full of crap. He is and always has been nothing but a southern crusader for Christianity.Featured image via screen capture",0
8928, The FIVE Most Ridiculous Things Done So Far By These Make-Believe ‘Patriots’ In Oregon,"Last Saturday, a bunch of well-armed  militiamen  decided to protest the extended sentence of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, who started fires on federal land near their property. The federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence. And according to Rolling Stone: The first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences, which they served. But the U.S. attorney in the case called foul; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence. In October 2015, the Ninth Circuit imposed the mandatory minimum, ruling that:  given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.  The ranchers are due back in federal prison Monday to serve out their five years each. Well, not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long, Ammon Bundy, son of the infamous anti-government imbecile Cliven Bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) not too long ago, decided he would involve himself in the fight against  tyranny  of government against these law-breaking ranchers. Bundy, and his band of merry morons, decided to take over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. He posted a video to Facebook where he declared: We have basically taken over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. And this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here. And we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms. Maybe they don t need their legs?Well, needless to say, the government isn t being  tyrannical,  but rather following the laws as they are written. These  militiamen  may not like the laws, but that s what elections are for   you vote in the people who make the laws. You don t hold armed protests, or rather hissy fits, in an empty wildlife refuge.Nonetheless, in no particular order, here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe  Patriots  in Oregon:If there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere, you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled. And not disappointing us in the slightest, the Bundy  Militia   made sure to offer some doozies. Looks like maybe they could have used some of that  tyranical goverment  [sic] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comOne of the  Patriots,  Jon Ritzenheimer, even made a goodbye video for his family. Occupying a bird refuge is dangerous, and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them.After this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of  soldiers  apparently forgot the Boy Scout motto  be prepared // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;ATTENTION SHARE ATTENTION SHARE!!!!!!Anyone that wants to send any supplies can send them to: General Mail  Posted by Blaine Cooper on Thursday, December 31, 2015  several folks took to Twitter to mock the living hell out of the ill-prepared dimwits:Please send snacks b/c the USPS isn't at all part of the ""oppressive tyrannical government "" we hate. #YallQaeda pic.twitter.com/IUWtQPo2Fi  Princess Slay Ya (@dumbsainted) January 5, 2016Send Snacks Please pic.twitter.com/8pgxCK9Dcs  Not Being Governed (@ArtofNBG) January 6, 2016Send snacks for freedom, please. #YallQaeda #EatMorChikin pic.twitter.com/XDVu378VA8  Ronald Keith Gaddie (@GaddieWindage) January 5, 2016Pretty badass, right?

8929, Father Furious When TSA Agent Frisks 10-Year-Old Daughter In Two-Minute Pat Down (VIDEO/IMAGE),"A 10-year-old girl s awful experience with a TSA agent is now making national headlines after she was forced to undergo an inappropriately long and invasive pat down.Vendela Payne had been traveling back home to California with her family when she was stopped by a TSA agent at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Vendela had accidentally left a Capri Sun drink in her bag as she went through the security line and was flagged for further screening   which is when her travel experience changed drastically.Removed from her family, Vendela was forced to endure an uncomfortable pat down that lasted two uncomfortably long minutes. Her father, Kevin Payne, was on the other side of the glass and began recording the entire screening as he noticed  it was an uncomfortable situation. In the video footage below, you can see how lengthy, repetitive and invasive the pat down was, as Kevin repeatedly calls out the TSA s actions in the overlaying text:If you didn t observe how uncomfortable the pat-down made Vendela feel by her frozen, blank stare in the video, she spoke about the traumatizing experience in an interview with NBC. The young girl said she kept trying not to  throw a tantrum like a 1-year-old. : My dad was making funny faces silly faces in the mirror and I felt like screaming the whole time. I know it s to keep everybody on the plane safe, but she kept patting me down. Pat down, pat down. It was like, over and over. TSA agent pats down Vendela s chestWhile Kevin says that he supports airport security policies and safety procedures, he agrees with his daughter that the TSA agent was inappropriate during the pat down. He said: I m a very big proponent of security, and if they were patting me down no problem, but this was a 10-year-old girl. The whole system seems to not work the way it should be working. They gave her a very standard pat-down for an adult female. I don t think it was modified one bit. If you look at videos, most pat-downs on adults (take) about a minute. Start to finish, in real time, (Vendala s pat-down) was 1 minute and 47 seconds. It just didn t seem like it was an efficient pat-down. The TSA s website states that screenings are meant to determine if prohibited items are being hidden under clothing and that agents will use sufficient pressure to detect concealed items. However, the site also says that screening procedures for kids 12 and under have been modified so that children are not likely to undergo a pat down screening. In Vendela s case, her father believes that the agent chose the pat down screening without considering other options.",0
8930, Trump-Supporting Gun Nut Holds AR-15 Like A Baby During The Most Bizarre Interview Ever (VIDEO),"Gun nuts are a strange breed. They are paranoid, uneducated, and don t feel complete without a few penis extensions guns fully locked and loaded at all times. However, one ammosexual just took it a step further, by holding on to his beloved AR-15 during an interview on CNN.Who is this guy and why is he allowed anywhere near guns, you might ask? This guy actually is New Hampshire s own Mark Limoges, owner of Black Op Arms gun store. He s also a Donald Trump supporter, and he showed up to the interview with a perfect copy of the AR-15 that he lovingly presented to The Donald himself. Limoges told the show s hosts: This is an exact replica of the gun we gave Mr. Trump. It has our Black Ops Arms symbol on it with our Black Ops Arms symbol on the handrail. And the other side, we have the  Live Free or Die  with the American flag on the handrail. He did, however, admit that Trump s Secret Service detail was more than a little concerned about both the visit to the gun store and the gift of an assault rifle. Limoges goes on to explain how that was handled: We actually wanted Mr. Trump to come to our gun store, which the Secret Service was not real thrilled about. A Secret Service agent came to the store, took the gun. We removed the bolt out of it. They took possession of the weapon and then presented it to us before we went into the room to present it to Mr. Trump. Limoges also admitted that the weapon he give the GOP front runner would be illegal in Trump s home state of New York without modifications. Then, of course, he had to go and accuse President Obama of attempting to seize guns, saying: I think it s probably a first step towards it, yes. Host John Berman seemed surprised, and said,  Really?  in response.Berman s co-host Kate Bolduan challenged this assertion, reminding Limoges that President Obama explicitly says that he has no such plans: The president said yesterday in his speech that his actions are not a plot to take away everybody s guns. This statement led to Limoges accusing the president of being a liar on live television: Mr. Obama has also said other things that have not always been the truth. Berman went on to press Limoges: Look, he says he respects the Second Amendment. And if you just look at the actions he s taking, even the things he was proposing a few years ago which were steeper than this, even if you support universal background checks, that doesn t necessarily mean you want to take someone s guns away. Limoges  mind was not changed, though, and he concluded: Most of the people that come in [to the gun store] are real nervous about what Mr. Obama is going to do to limit their chances of getting weapons. Maybe that s why he insisted on keeping his AR-15 cradled so closely for the duration. Obama could come take it during the five minutes he was talking to those lovely CNN hosts.Get some help, Mr. Limoges. You clearly need it.Watch the entire bizarre exchange below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8931, Joe Scarborough Defends President Obama’s Emotional Announcement On Gun Control (VIDEO),"While it s often difficult to notice, Joe Scarborough is one of the remaining few  reasonable  Republicans. Of course, this has a lot to do with his party s radical shift to its far-right flank, backed with the ascension of Donald Trump. Consequently, certain Republicans such as Scarborough, who at one time sounded radical, sound rational today. To his credit, Scarborough has often sidestepped partisanship to give credit where credit is due.Such was the case Wednesday morning when the host of MSNBC s Morning Joe vocally defended President Obama s executive order on gun control.Scarborough and co-host Mike Barnacle elaborated on the president s announcement, and agreed that expanding background checks for gun sales is an eminently reasonable action to take. Scarborough made sure to underscore for his unhinged conservative viewers that Obama didn t say anything about grabbing any guns. He also validated the president s genuine sadness and anger when mentioning Sandy Hook during his remarks.Via Media Matters:SCARBOROUGH: You see the frustration, don t you, in every press conference after every mass shooting, the president being frustrated by his inability to get anything done even when 90 percent of Americans support stronger background checks.BARNICLE: Absolutely, Joe. And living with the knowledge that you have to provide more information to become a Little League baseball coach than you do to a gun show.SCABOROUGH: Look at this. So if you re driving, a lot of people are listening to us as they drive into work. We re showing a Quinnipiac University poll that actually shows 89 percent of Americans support background checks for gun purchases at gun shows. Eighty-seven percent Republicans, 87 percent. And as other pollsters have told us, up to 80 percent of Republicans in early primary states, who vote in early primary states, support background checks. And, this is not a prediction. I m just going to tell you how it s going to be. There are going to continue to be mass shootings. Terrorists are going to continue to do it over the next decade. And the things that I ve been talking about on background checks and all of us have been talking about and the president has been talking about, Republicans, it s going to be the Republican position within the next two, three, four years. I say Jim VandeHei, one of the things that was most astounding yesterday was the reaction. The Pavlovian reaction from Republicans over a set of actions that really weren t far reaching. And even the White House will tell you, they were modest at best. He hopes he can do something to start the gun show loopholes so terrorist can t walk in and buy guns. But it wasn t even that, and I m not knocking him, it wasn t that sweeping. Nobody got any guns taken away yesterday.And, of course, Joe is correct. According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, 95 percent of Democrats and 87 percent of Republicans support background checks. Back in 2014, 92 percent of gun owners supported expanding the regulation. Yet, when the Manchin-Toomey amendment was proposed back in 2013, the Senate GOP filibustered the legislation in defiance of nearly 90 percent of its voters. Why? Three words: National Rifle Association. The only constituency that matters to the congressional Republicans. It s an almost awe-inspiring dynamic   the NRA s extremist agenda is a higher legislative priority for the GOP than 87 percent of Republican voters.Furthermore, the president s order is, as Scarborough said, not that  far reaching.  Back in 2013, the president announced much more stringent and comprehensive regulations on gun ownership. The president, at the time, tried to resurrect the expired assault weapons ban and close all of the loopholes created by the NRA in 1994. There were bullet control  proposals: no more magazines larger than 10 rounds, and no more armor-piercing bullets. Today, however, the president s actions are limited to just the background checks and additional funding for the FBI and ATF. Nothing else. But that won t stop the relentless lies and fear-mongering by the GOP, telling its people that Obama s out to confiscate their guns. As much as I d like it to happen, it won t.Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8932," Watch Trump Mock His Moronic Supporters To Their Faces, And They’re Too Stupid To Notice (VIDEO)","If there s one thing Donald Trump knows how to do really well, even better than most, it s sell things. And in this case, that  thing  isn t real estate or a television show or a book, but rather just himself. With the phrase  Make America Great Again,  with no further explanation besides loving guns, hating Mexicans, and lowering taxes, he s gotten a rather large following to support him.Being the salesman that he is, he doesn t care who supports him as long as they do. He uses simplistic phrases on purpose, because he knows that most of his supporters likely don t have above a third grade reading level. He plays to the stupid vote, but calls them smart and the  most intelligent  because, after all, they are voting for him.However, at a recent campaign event in Claremont, New Hampshire, Trump seemed to let it slip that he knows his supporters are an army of loyal idiots. After reciting poll after poll after poll, which seems to be all these events are, self-congratulatory events for himself, he told the crowd that no one is ever leaving him. No matter what he says, or how awful he behaves, he knows he has the support of this moronic base.He said: Did you see? One of the things that came out in the one poll, nobody s ever leaving me. I could be the worst person in the world, they re not leaving. Continuing, he said: If I was up here and did some really inappropriate things, my people stay. I love you people. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love my people! They re the most loyal. And if that wasn t bad enough, he then comes out and says it: I m winning with the smart people, I m winning with the not-so-smart people, too. I m winning with everything. With all of this he got cheers and shouts of  I love you!  and  We love you!  from the crowd of unsuspecting nincompoops.Trump knows exactly what he s doing, which is actually what makes his run for the Oval Office so terrifying. He plays to the simplistic and imbecilic minded in the nation, and they lap it up with a spoon. Trump doesn t care that his voters are dumb. I mean, hell, George W. Bush won in 2004 after 9/11 and starting a war based on lies. There is definitely a base of voters in this nation who shouldn t be allowed to operate heavy machinery, including a voting machine.

8933, Stephen Colbert Mercilessly And Hilariously Mocks Unprepared Bundy Terrorists (VIDEO),"In a glorious segment on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert piled on the mockery of the anti-government loons who took over a federal wildlife refuge building without preparing for the long haul.When Ammon and Ryan Bundy seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, they were hoping to ignite a war against the federal government. Instead, the federal government ignored them and most of America laughed at them and the right-wing militia movement became an even bigger joke than it has ever been.The armed militants have been labeled  Y all qaeda  and  Vanilla ISIS  and drew even more ridicule after having to beg people to send them snacks through the US Postal Service because they somehow forgot to prepare for a long occupation. Ammon Bundy has even backed away from his brother s claim that the group came there to kill or be killed during an embarrassing interview with Megyn Kelly.Clearly, Bundy s pathetic rebellion has very little support. And Stephen Colbert only added more mockery on Tuesday night. I haven t seen this many angry, bearded men in Oregon since I referred to Blue Moon as a craft beer,  Colbert quipped. These confused, fragile, heavily armed creatures need someplace to live where civilization won t upset them. They re clearly endangered, although it s hard to know exactly how many there are because their camo is so good. Here s one standing between two bushes, I believe. Sadly, there s no hope of establishing a breeding program because, frankly, it s a bit of a sausage fest. Colbert also mocked the stand-off the armed traitors hoped for but didn t get. Probably not what the protesters had in mind. That s like taking over the Alamo and then not being surrounded by the Mexicans. To conclude, Colbert mocked Bundy and his friends for being less prepared than a troop of boy scouts. What heroic, go-it-alone mountain men have always needed   Go-Gurt, string cheese and Lunchables. I want you to hang in there, fellas, because help is on the way. The refuge should really be renamed the  Ammon Bundy Preserve for the Armed and Cranky,  Colbert suggested.Here s the video via YouTube.Yeah, hang in there, guys. Because the longer you carry on this farce, the more material you give to Stephen Colbert and the rest of the world with which to mock you. Congratulations, you all are officially a worldwide joke.Featured Image: Screenshot",0
8934, Bernie Sanders Roasts Donald Trump: ‘I Don’t Have To Spend Money’ To Make Him ‘Look Dumb’ (VIDEO),"On Tuesday s edition of  The Nightly Show, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders promised to steal the White House from Republican front runner Donald Trump if the two should ever face off in the presidential election.On the show, host Larry Wilmore asked Sanders what he thought about Trump s much-reported use of the word  schlong  to insult Hillary Clinton. Sanders, making a joke out of Trump s numerous nonsensical remarks, said: I don t know the answer to that. I have yet to recover from Trump s shock that women go to the bathroom. I m still recovering from that, so  schlonged,  I haven t figured out yet. Wilmore pressed on, asking Sanders if he would  schlong  The Donald if they went head to head for the presidency. Sanders replied,  Let me say, we will beat him badly. How s that? Wilmore also brought up the fact that someone had been writing anti-Trump messages in the sky last weekend, right above the Rose Bowl Parade. Wilmore asked Sanders if he d had anything to do with it, since there had coincidentally been a rally for Sanders at the same time. Sander responded with something we all know to be true: I don t have to spend money to make Donald Trump look dumb   he does it all by himself. You can watch Sanders roast The Donald below: The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore Get More: The Nightly Show Full Episodes,The Nightly Show on Facebook,The Nightly Show Video ArchiveIn later parts of the interview, Sanders took the opportunity to express his support for President Barack Obama s executive action on guns, blasting Republicans for trying to hold back an initiative that was so badly needed in America. We re not getting any cooperation from the Republicans, no matter how many horrific mass shootings we see. I think the most important thing we have to do now is to expand and improve the instant background check. What the president is trying to do now is deal with the so-called gun show loophole. Many of Sanders  constituents in Vermont are responsible gun owners, but Sanders said they accept the dangers that can come with firearms and don t argue that policies must be in place to avoid their misuse. People hunt and they do outdoor things   that s what we do. But the vast majority of the people understand, in my state, and I think around the country, that it s imperative that we do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. Criminals (and) people who are mentally unstable should not own a gun. That s my view, and there is a broad consensus around that. Also touching on the Black Lives Matter movement, Sanders and Wilmore agreed that the media has blown controversial issues out of proportion. Sanders said, I think white people are as appalled as African-Americans and Latinos in seeing what we re seeing on television, and that is unarmed people being killed while they re in police custody. The Vermont senator, who has made criminal justice reform a crucial part of his campaign, also stressed that reducing police brutality would be one of his priorities as president: The first, and maybe most, important is to make sure that if a police officer breaks the law, that officer   like any other public official   must be held accountable. Other things that we have to do is demilitarize many of our local police departments. We have to make police departments look like the communities they serve, in terms of diversity. What appalls me is that we have more people in jail today than any other country on Earth   more than China, 2.2 million people   and that s why we need real criminal justice reform. We ve got to make sure that kids have jobs and education, rather than hanging out on street corners unemployed. Featured image is a screenshot, via Raw Story",0
8935, @Ammon_Bundy’s Ridiculous Late Night Twitter Rant Has Everyone Talking (TWEETS),"Either Ammon Bundy himself or a clever imposter has taken Twitter   and the media   by storm. The head of the Oregon Moron Militia, Bundy is the textbook case of the modern  Murican  patriot.  He is either just being himself and having a Twitter-fest of spewing out right-wing talking points or someone has decided to channel him, guessing the Bundy-esque things he might say.The rant was late-night, when the cold of the Oregon forest may have demanded a little something to make a person forget what aches. More than a dozen tweets went out from the account, including a retweet of an interview Bundy did with a local blog. Here are a few examples:As Thomas Paine said, It is the duty of the patriot to protect its country from its government. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 5, 2016We are not about fear, we are not about force, we are not about intimidation. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016We came here in protest because of the force and the intimidation that we have seen in this county. #CitizensForConstitutionalFreedom  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016With that being said, we will not be intimidated by the federal government for taking stand for something we strongly believe in.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016It even went so far as to compare the Moron Militia to Rosa Parks:We are doing the same thing as Rosa Parks did. We are standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016However, reporters now say the account is believed to be a fake. Tony Dokoupil of MSNBC tweeted this:People, Ammon Bundy is not operating a twitter account. I stood with him last night as tweets supposedly from him went out.  tonydokoupil (@tonydokoupil) January 6, 2016That seems to be compelling enough. A reporter who was there at the time says Bundy isn t on Twitter at all. That seemed like the case for sure when the account was suspended by Twitter, which has a process of verifying identities of celebrities and others in the news. Then USA Today reported that the account was suspended and that it was re-instated.Another theory may be that much like many people on Twitter who have become public figures, Ammon Bundy has someone  smarter  than he is running his account. With all the freedoming and interviews he s doing, Bundy probably doesn t have time for the social media onslaught for the movement, which has obviously been even less successful than the movement itself.Alas, the account is still alive and well and as of Wednesday at just after 11 AM EST tweeted this:The last thing we want is an armed confrontation. We want this to end peacefully without anyone being harmed.  Ammon Bundy (@Ammon_Bundy) January 6, 2016That s the first real evidence that the account may not be real unless Ammon Bundy s goal of remaining for years to give a bird preserve to loggers, miners and ranchers has changed. Or maybe he s just cold.Featured image via Twitter",0
8936, Watch How Absurd A Gun Nut Looks Defending U.S. Gun Violence On A UK TV Show (VIDEO),"Try to picture a place where gun control is real   where people can sit in a coffee shop without worrying that a lunatic is going to start indiscriminately shooting people. Imagine you didn t have to worry about the safety of your children when they got on that school bus. Conjure an image where things are peaceful enough that most of the police don t even carry guns, and when they do they wear big yellow letters that say  armed. Believe it or not, those places do exist. In a far away land called Europe and another called Australia, people have learned that guns don t have to be what defines them and that if a society is to evolve, it must do so peacefully. They ve moved on to bigger and better things while here at home, we dig the hole a little bit deeper.President Obama s executive orders on gun control have put America in the spotlight. People from all over the world want to know if the United States has finally learned its lesson and decided to take action. In the UK, where gun deaths for the year won t reach the number America has had in five days, talking to a Yank who loves guns has to be almost as comical as it is ridiculous.The talking points we listen to every day and have accepted as the right-wing response, sound even more absurd when you hear them spoken to a Brit. This particular ammosexual, Niel McCabe from Armed American Radio, tosses out that kicks and fists have killed more people than rifles, knowing full-well that  rifles  aren t the culprit in most murders and suicides, handguns are. He keeps tossing blurb after blurb of the same old rhetoric. If we can t have a law that will 100 percent solve the problem, we shouldn t have laws at all. It s really just so stupid.It s really just so stupid.BBC43 Host Jon Snow has some tough questions for the flat top-wearing poster boy who is for the  right  to keep killing each other.

8937, The Hidden Root Of White Rage,"Paul Krugman asks a simple question about why white (conservative) people who fly into a rage always seem to do so over really stupid things:Something that strikes me, however   and which I don t fully understand   is that when people like this turn to angry rhetoric, with at least a hint of violence, the trigger events tend to be trivial. There are plenty of real grievances that could be motivating working-class whites Now, I loves me some Krugman but he s missing the super obvious here: White conservatives are angry at a racially unjust economic system that has started to treat white people the same it s always treated black people. It was supposed to benefit them to the detriment of  those  people and it did, decade after decade. White people enjoyed a lifestyle unprecedented in history and managed to deny that life to millions of minorities. But the rich got so greedy that the system is breaking down and now everyone is suffering. Except for the rich, of course.The end result is that they can t attack the system they love without admitting how unjust it was in the first place. What are they going to say?  Hey! Where are all the white jobs?! On top of this frustration is the cold and horrible (for white people) realization that they no longer have total control over the government. With a black president in the White House, there is zero chance of getting through the kind of policies that used to transfer immense amounts of wealth to the white community while leaving the black community out in the cold. Those days are over and with the rapid  browning  of America, they aren t coming back.This leaves us with millions of angry white people betrayed by a system they believed in and supported their entire lives. But to admit that the system was unjust would be to admit that they, white people, benefited at the expense of black people in the first place. Most white people, including liberals, would rather gnaw their arm off to escape this trap. And so they find the most ridiculous and mundane targets for their rage, a rage that should be directed at the system but can t be. It really is that simple.Featured image via AI archives",0
8938, Oregon Militia Terrorist: I’ll Die Before I Let The Feds Arrest Me (VIDEO),"The situation with the Bundy ranchers and their heavily armed right-wing militia s occupation of a federal building on a wildlife reserve in Oregon is escalating. The federal government is planning to take steps to end their ridiculous occupation, but at least one of them has said he ll lay down his very life before he allows the authorities to arrest him.The Harvey County Sheriff said of the handling of the militant takeover: There are things being done. It s not visible to the public. Authorities are reportedly taking steps to stop power service to the occupied federal building, as well as working with the FBI and other federal government authorities to have the militia members removed. Of course, the idiots calling themselves the Oath Keepers, had to comment. They told families to relocate their children: This is not a family event. The only people there should be the armed men who are willing to die there with Ammon Bundy and his brothers and a couple of embedded reporters. One of the militiamen spoke with MSNBC about his intentions for when the government closes in on their occupation. LaVoy Finicum, 55, says he knows that agents are coming for him and others occupying the building. However, he seems to believe he ll die first. He said to MSNBC: I have been raised in the country all my life. I love dearly to feel the wind on my face. To see the sun rise, to see the moon. I have no intention of spending any of my days in a concrete box. Well, sir, if you weren t breaking the law, you wouldn t have reason to fear spending time in prison. These idiots need to be arrested. They are nothing more than real life, bona fide terrorists.This guy is so dumb that he sincerely believes that the authorities won t find him because he is hiding under a huge blue tarp in the middle of a vacant parking lot with his penis extension gun. I ve got news for you, Mr. Finicum: They ll find you, and they ll arrest you. If you threaten them or put up a fight, they ll kill you.Take my advice: go home to your farm and your kids before any of that happens.Watch Finicum s statements below, via MSNBC:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",0
8939, Maddow Compares Trump To 1968 Racist Candidate George Wallace: The Similarity Is Shocking (VIDEO),"Some political pundits have been unable to describe how Donald Trump manages to maintain his popularity. With his escalating hateful rhetoric, personal insults, and generally obnoxious behavior, many have settled their confusion by pretending there is no way he can win the Republican primary. The problem with that is, all polls show he can.Rachel Maddow uncovered what seems to be the secret to Trump s success. It appears that he took his complete strategy for how to run a presidential campaign from 1968 s Racist Alabama Governor George Wallace. This explains a lot about how Trump s campaign of disgusting hate has been able to flourish so easily among regressive conservatives in America.If you use a little imagination and think Trump and Muslims, instead of Wallace and African-Americans, the parallels will suddenly become clear. Like Rachel said,  Close your eyes and just listen to the news reports from that election. It s almost like they re talking about Donald Trump. Watch Rachel s presentation comparing Trump and George Wallace below:What Rachel pointed out was incredibly significant. The comparisons are eerie and even if you were to take the direct comparisons of Trump and Wallace out of the picture, the supporters   who you couldn t possibly say were imitating each other intentionally   are virtually identical in the thoughts they convey about why they support their candidate.Rachel finished the segment by making a great point: Donald Trump has something that Republican voters like. They liked it the last time that he offered it to them for a short period of time,  she said.  And now they like it this time, as well   it s the same type of significant popularity. It just hasn t gone away this time around because he hasn t stopped running this time around like he did in 2012. She s right. Trump offered up the same fare in the 2012 presidential campaign and got a huge amount of support from it. If he had chosen to invest himself fully the last time around, he could have taken the nomination from Romney, who was universally panned by the Republican establishment right up until he was their only choice.The question now is: what will happen when Trump ends up on the ballot? A couple years after Wallace was officially in an election, he was shot. Could Trump s hate speech eventually become that kind of liability?Featured image via Youtube",0
8940, Republicans Are About To Bailout A Foreign Company That Screwed Over 500K American Consumers,"Do you remember the time that Republicans thought automotive companies should be allowed to go bankrupt? They seem to have forgotten all about that.House Republicans are set to give a big wet kiss to Volkswagen in the form of a bailout that will prevent them from being sued by over 500,00 American consumers, against whom they admitted committing fraud.Volkswagen has been caught up in a huge scandal after it admitted to cheating on air pollution standards. The context behind the scandal and ensuing lawsuits lies with  defeat devices  that VW had installed in approximately 580,000 of their diesel vehicles, in order to fool emissions testing in the U.S.Remember, these are the same Republicans that worked to block a VW plant from opening in Chattanooga, Tennessee because the plant was going to be unionized. This proves they don t really care about Volkswagen. They just really love hurting American citizens.The suit, filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA could net Volkswagen up to $18 billion in fines. However, that s not all of their problems. The Justice Department also indicated that it could roll individual lawsuits into their litigation as well. The individual lawsuits come from owners that might win up to $6,000 each in compensation for paying more than a gas-powered model costs plus decline in resale value. Add on a potential 3 billion more from consolidated individual cases Whoa! That s a lot of money!What will Volkswagen do? Why, run to Republicans of course.Yes, these are the same Republicans that wanted GM to just go bankrupt when a bailout for them would save jobs. It s clearly a different story when government action helps regular people. For rich, faceless corporations no bailout is too large or too insane   and this bailout is truly insane.The bill, which doesn t actually offer monetary compensation to cover VW s lawsuit costs, will instead make it virtually impossible for a class action suit to be brought against the corporation.From The Fiscal Times:The simplicity of the VW Bailout Bill belies the chaos it would create. Proponents like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the bill s leading lobbyist, say they merely want to get rid of  non-injury  class-action cases, based on potential damages from defective consumer products or corporate actions that have yet to result in harm. Lawyers for class-action litigants argue that defective products deserve compensation even if the consumer hasn t yet been injured.But the bill goes much further, stating that courts may not certify class-action suits unless the plaintiff  affirmatively demonstrates that each proposed class member suffered the same type and scope of injury as the named class representative or representatives. This is devastating because it sets up all class-actions to fail,  says attorney Lori Andrus, who represents several Volkswagen plaintiffs. If every class member must have the same type and scope of injury, it forces extensive proofs for class certification   essentially a full-blown trial up front, where plaintiffs will have to prove that their injuries match with their fellow representatives.Source: The Fiscal TimesTo put it simply, this isn t only for Volkswagen. This is a good straw-man case that Republicans can use to do something they have wanted to do for decades:  shut the door to justice on American consumers that get screwed over by corporations. It would allow for rampant abuse of the system, resulting in sub-standard products being sold, with little to no recourse available to consumers ever. Additionally, it would overturn decades of judicial precedent where corporations were held accountable for fraud while circumventing federal rules that lay out class action standards.As an extra insult, Republicans are pairing the bill with the FACT Act, which would force public reporting of personal information of asbestos victims, in an effort to sabotage their compensation for poisoning. It s incredibly inappropriate for Congress to send the message that it s OK to hurt people by the millions,  said Rebecca Kaplan   a Volkswagen owner.  The more people you hurt, the more this law will protect you. Featured image via screen capture from YouTube",0
8941, Donald Trump Cracks Jokes After His Supporter Calls President Obama ‘A Muslim’ (VIDEO),"Here we go, again.Another supporter of Donald Trump openly shouted at a Trump rally held in New Hampshire on Tuesday that President Obama was a Muslim.  And, this time, the only difference we got from Trump was a sarcastic reply, which in essence all it did was show his supporters that it s funny to be a racist.Here s Trump pretending to go after one of his supporters for the hateful comment: Oh, I m supposed to reprimand the man. Who was the man that said that? I have to reprimand. How dare you. Okay, I reprimanded him. I reprimanded him, now the press can t be angry. Is anyone surprised? We re not. Trump has become such a joke that we re tired of even using the word  joke.  It s long played out   so is the media. Even when he shows a penchant for hateful rhetoric, all the media can do is laugh about it. The shock factor is over. And, the thing is, there was nothing funny about this.All CNN and crew could do when announcing this latest B.S. was to smile. Below is an actual pic taken in context showing what they thought of this latest incident. It s like we re all in some twisted, twilight zone waiting for the rapture. For more on this, visit HERE. See for yourself.Pic via CNN.The truth is hate sells. Trump takes care of the media, and they scratch his back in return. Trump didn t lie when he said he was good for business   cheap reality TV. and political theater, calling the president a Muslim, it s all good for shits and giggles. And, frankly, this writer is tired of it.The real truth is, Trump wouldn t go after his supporters for being racist even if he wanted to. That s because, the majority of his supporters are racist. He can t alienate his base. According to a major poll done, a full 66% of his supporters think Obama is a Muslim. That s pretty insane. Maybe that s why CNN is laughing. They still can t believe this is still actually happening, either.",0
8942, Montel Williams SHAMES The NRA: Responsible Gun Owners Support Background Checks,"Talk show legend Montel Williams is a conservative, one who has expressed very critical opinions of Barack Obama in the past. But Williams says there s an area where he can t disagree with  the President   Obama s plan to use his executive powers to help alleviate a problem most of his fellow conservatives won t touch.On Tuesday, the President broke into tears as he discussed the problem of gun violence in America today   specifically, the lives lost in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, which Obama calls the  worst day in [his] presidency.  Obama has pledged to close the  gun show loophole,  which has traditionally allowed pretty damn near everyone to circumvent the background check procedure and get themselves a shootin  stick with minimal hassle. In addition, the President will be removing legal barriers preventing a doctor from reporting when someone is too crazy to have a gun, strengthening licensing requirements for sellers, and making dealers responsible for reporting guns that go missing.While many conservatives, including the veritable Brady Bunch of ignorance that is the GOP 2016 presidential field, view these common sense steps as an attack on the freedom of every single man, woman, and child, Williams applauds the President s approach to the problem of gun violence today.  I PROUDLY own 14 guns RESPONSIBLY,  Williams wrote on Facebook.  Naturally, I listened closely to what President Obama said today on guns, and I ve read what was put out detailing his proposals. He explained that no truly responsible gun owner should oppose the President s plans to reform gun laws, nor should any of them develop the opinion that the President and his jack-booted thugs will be going door to door taking people s firearms from them. I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill,  he says.  That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams added in a comment.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. In an op-ed for HuffPo, Williams says that  as a proud, responsible, gun owner,  he  can t NOT support  the President s proposal: I realize this may not make me popular with some gun owners, and I realize there is deep distrust of President Obama and his use of executive action. Simply put, I ve always believed in being a responsible ambassador for the Second Amendment, a right that I hold dear; and, thus, I believe responsible gun owners MUST be the loudest voices for universal background checks and addressing the mental health crisis we face in this country, which form the crux of the president s proposals. Williams says that he has formed his views largely through his work with students  in the wake of school shootings over the years.  Williams challenges anyone who disagrees that it is important to enact common sense gun legislation to spend time with children who have survived school shootings: They all have the same, haunted look in their eyes, one that frequently keeps me up at night. I would challenge anyone to listen to their stories, experience their pain and then go back the next year and the next, and see how profoundly they are affected and then do it all over again for the next school   you ll feel the same way I do. Universal background checks should be a no-brainer. Guns should not change hands without a background check,  he says.  I cannot give my car to my children without filing a form with the DMV, and no one complains about that burden, nor do they suggest it s a veiled attempt to de-car America. Unfortunately, the NRA and its acolytes spread fear   Obama wants your guns   to all who will listen, and unfortunately too many listen. The NRA and its bought-and-paid-for politicians fight progress with regard to gun legislation every step of the way   including, of course, background checks. Giving up even that much, in their eyes, would be giving up their guns.Williams suggests that we dispense with the meaningless rhetoric, cross the aisle, and work together to solve the problem of gun violence in this country   the root of which, he  says, is that it s  dangerous allowing people to acquire guns without a background check. Williams says that both liberals and conservatives need to skip the divisiveness that plagues our country and focus on the fact that our children s lives are at stake. He asks his fellow gun owners not to buy into the extreme Right s propaganda that paints this as a gun-grabbing measure: This is common sense, and, ultimately, the best way to advance and protect the Second Amendment right we hold dear. Williams is right. No one is trying to take anyone s guns. In fact, President Obama is attempting to ensure that everyone who should be able to get a gun can get one. In the end, this would even accomplish some conservative goals: people would feel safer around armed individuals if they all passed a comprehensive background check and were mentally competent to handle the weapon, for instance. In that sense, the President s plan is a godsend for pro-Second Amendment people of all stripes. If conservatives want to end the stigma associated with gun ownership, the absolute best way is to support this opportunity to protect the integrity of the Second Amendment.Featured image via Facebook/screengrab ",0
8943, Bill O’Reilly Plays Stump The Trump On Foreign Policy And Makes Him Look Like A Fool (VIDEO),"Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night, only to be embarrassingly stumped by Bill O Reilly.O Reilly wanted to know if Trump plans on taking military action against Iran if he becomes president, and Trump totally demonstrated his lack of foreign policy knowledge by dodging the question and ranting about things he really doesn t understand. If you re elected president are you going to take military action against Iran?  O Reilly asked.  Are you going to do something to that country? Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia,  Trump replied with what seems to be a reference to Iranians attacking the Saudi Arabian embassy in retaliation against a mass execution the Saudis recently committed on New Year s Day in which 47 were killed, including a Shiite cleric.  I would want to protect Saudi Arabia,  Trump claimed.  But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically Trump suggested that he might attack Iran if Saudi Arabia offered the right price but remained largely unwilling to say one way or another whether he would get America involved in yet another costly and bloody war in the Middle East.O Reilly continued to press Trump for an answer, calling him out for dodging the question.Trump then went on a tirade against the Iran nuclear deal, calling it a disastrous deal that Iran has already supposedly broken before claiming that Iran will have a nuclear weapon  very soon. Clearly, Trump is not aware of the fact that Iran recently surrendered their entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians, which is definitive proof that the Iran nuclear deal is a success because it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.The Iran nuclear deal stands as one of President Obama s greatest achievements, and should not be abandoned in favor of war when diplomacy is working. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia is nothing more than ISIS posing as a legitimate nation. They use Sharia law and behead so many people every year that ISIS leaders must be envious. The only reason our government has failed to call the Saudis out for their horrible human rights record is because they control the second largest oil reserves in the world.This is why it is not only important for the United States to reject military action in the Middle East, we need to become energy independent so that we no longer have to rely on Saudi Arabia for our energy needs. Frankly, the United States government should grow a pair and strongly condemn Saudi Arabia right now for behaving like a terrorist organization.The bottom line, however, is that Donald Trump is unfit to be commander-in-chief. He not only wants to send American troops to die needlessly in Iran, he wants to make Saudi Arabia pay for it. Basically, Trump would turn America into a puppet for the Saudis. But more likely, he would damage relations with both nations and put America squarely in the middle of a potential conflict that could easily turn into World War III.America does not need more war. We need peace. And as O Reilly pointed out, voters have the right to know what Trump plans to do, even if Trump thinks they have no right to know at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via video screen capture",0
8944, Trump Goes Full Birther — On Ted Cruz,"Donald Trump has revived the birther conspiracy theory, but this time he has targeted a fellow Republican: Ted Cruz.Cruz has begun creeping up in some state polls, particularly in evangelical-heavy Iowa, so as he has done in the past Trump went on the attack.Donald Trump said in an interview that rival Ted Cruz s Canadian birthplace was a  very precarious  issue that could make the Texas senator vulnerable if he became the Republican presidential nominee. Republicans are going to have to ask themselves the question:  Do we want a candidate who could be tied up in court for two years?  That d be a big problem,  Trump said when asked about the topic.  It d be a very precarious one for Republicans because he d be running and the courts may take a long time to make decision. You don t want to be running and have that kind of thing over your head. Trump added,  I d hate to see something like that get in his way. But a lot of people are talking about it and I know that even some states are looking at it very strongly, the fact that he was born in Canada and he has had a double passport. Trump is easily the most visible proponent of the birther conspiracy theory. Before the 2012 election, Trump made numerous national television appearances demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate. Trump even claimed that he had enlisted right-wing Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio to send a  cold case posse  to Hawaii to investigate Obama s past.The reality TV star even made a bizarre video requesting Obama s college records in order for the Hawaiian-born president to prove his citizenship.Senator Cruz s mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to him in Calgary, Canada, which easily fulfills the requirement for someone to be a  natural-born citizen  of the United States. While Cruz s ideas may be repellent to the majority of citizens, he is easily eligible to be President of the United States.After years of trying to de-legitimize President Obama through two terms, it is odd to see the tactic turned against the right s own candidates. Like so much of their rhetoric, it resembles Frankenstein building his monster then watching it turn on him instead of his enemies.Featured image via Flickr",0
8945, WATCH: Ted Cruz Pushes Birther’s Bizarre Star Wars Video Supporting His Presidential Run,"Ted Cruz is promoting the work of a birther filmmaker who has created a bizarre YouTube video that casts the right-wing Texas senator as the hero of the Star Wars movies. Cruz s campaign pushed a link featuring the video in a blast email to supporters: In honor of the latest Star Wars movie, the team here at Cruz HQ wanted to share with you a YouTube video created by a fellow supporter that depicts Senator Cruz as a Jedi Warrior, fighting for the Constitution,  the Cruz campaign wrote in an email to supporters last night, linking to a fawning Breitbart article about the video.The video shows Cruz riding an elephant with a lightsaber made out of the U.S. Constitution moving from state to state, flipping them from Democratic blue to Republican red. The video ends with Cruz confronting President Obama flanked by a phalanx of RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) and restoring liberty.The film was created by birther filmmaker Joel Gilbert, who produced the anti-Obama propaganda film Dreams from My Real Father. In that film, Gilbert indulges in the conspiracy theory that Obama s father was Communist Frank Marshall Davis. The video also uses fake images to smear President Obama s mother, claiming that she posed for sexual photos.Gilbert also claims that Obama has had plastic surgery so that his nose no longer resembles Davis. Gilbert also alleges that the president is secretly a Muslim, despite the ample evidence that he is a practicing Christian, and claims that the 2012 presidential election was stolen. He writes columns for World Net Daily, a leading pro-birther conspiracy website affiliated with Donald Trump.Pushing the video is just the latest example of Cruz s significant habit of stroking his own ego, often indulging in hyperbolic speech to cast himself and his campaign as central figures in a hero/persecution myth.Featured image via YouTube",0
8946," Jennifer Lawrence: When You Attack Planned Parenthood, You’re Attacking All Women","Jennifer Lawrence has been speaking her mind lately. In an interview with GLAMOUR, the Academy Award-winning actress went no-holds-barred on a lot of issues, including the recent attacks on Planned Parenthood. She said: It s so awful. It isn t an attack on abortions; it s an attack on women. Because Planned Parenthood is so much more [than abortion]. My mom was really religious with me when I was young. She s not so much anymore. And I wouldn t have been able to get birth control if it weren t for [Planned Parenthood]. I wouldn t have been able to get condoms and birth control and all these things I needed as a normal teenager who was growing up in a Jesus house. Lawrence was referring to the November attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado, when Robert Lewis Dear killed three people and wounded nine. Planned Parenthood, which delivers sex education and reproductive health care to women, has faced attacks before. There have been three attacks since September after an anti-abortion group accused Planned Parenthood of selling baby parts. The flames were fanned by Republicans, including presidential candidate Ted Cruz, who said: They were certainly caught on film, that there is no doubt that they were selling baby parts. That is unambiguous. The videos show senior Planned Parenthood officials selling the parts of unborn children, and it is a federal criminal offense. It s a felony to sell the body parts of unborn children for profit. That accusation has proven to be false, but the damage done when a public figure makes such statements is enormous, similar to Trump s verbal attacks on Islam, which has caused a spike in attacks on Muslims across the United States. Lawrence s feelings about the Republican party are already documented: I was raised a Republican, but I just can t imagine supporting a party that doesn t support women s basic rights. Lawrence believes that Planned Parenthood provides important services to women, and she was horrified by the recent attacks. She said: I am a successful woman who has not had a pregnancy . [Laughs] But seriously. What harm comes from supplying people with birth control, condoms, Pap smears, and cancer screenings? She s right. Planned Parenthood provides services to women that they wouldn t have access to otherwise. A recent study shows: For the millions of poor women who depend on Planned Parenthood clinics, this scenario would mean the loss of affordable and accessible contraceptive services and counseling, as well as breast and cervical cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Later in the interview, Lawrence was asked why she decided to take a stand on major issues. She said: I keep going back and forth on being opinionated  My business is based on everybody buying tickets and seeing my movie. It s not smart, business-wise, to be opinionated. But then what s the point in having a voice at all if I m not going to use it for what I truly believe in? You can read a transcript of Jennifer Lawrence s full interview here.",0
8947, FL Toddler Shoots Himself In The Face After ‘Responsible Gun Owner’ Leaves Weapon In Truck (VIDEO),"A Florida two-year-old is in critical condition after he shot himself in the face Monday night while playing with his  responsible  gun-owning  grandfather s unattended gun. WFTV reports that the unnamed child was riding in his grandfather s pickup truck when grandpa parked and ran inside the family s home, leaving the little boy to his own devices. Grandpa, whose name has not been released, also left his gun behind   because what s the point in being irresponsible if you re not going to go all-out?The grandfather says he left the little boy playing with some tools in the back seat, but the child managed to climb into the front of the truck, where Granddaddy kept his .32-caliber Kel-Tec gun. The gun was  responsibly  kept in a holster, but the child removed it and shot himself in the cheek, near his eye. The boy was airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, where he remains in critical condition. They are talking to individuals that were at the residence, possibly in the residence and we have forensics out gathering some evidence,  said Twis Lizasuain, Osceola County Sheriff s Office media relations director, who noted that evidence thus far suggests the discharge was  accidental    a word we too often hear when one of the  good guys with guns  shoots a child or, through negligence, allows a child to shoot him or herself. We will always encourage you to secure a weapon, especially when children are present. Though the shooting will likely be called  accidental,  grandpa might not escape unscathed. He could still be charged under a law that allows an irresponsible person to be held accountable if a child gets ahold of a gun that was not properly stored out of reach.Watch a report on this latest example of why guns make it into far too many hands than needed, below:Featured image via NLM",0
8948, Rush Limbaugh Squirms And Stammers As A Caller Debunks His LIES About Guns And Obama (VIDEO),"Just about every day, Rush Limbaugh s big fat lies are systematically exposed and debunked online by a variety of sources, and it never stops being awesome. But when it comes from one of his own dittoheads   and on his own show, no less   it s especially entertaining. Not only is it fun to hear callers stick it to him, it s even more fun to watch Limbaugh squirm and pluck his chest, desperately struggling to wiggle out of the call.Such was the case on Tuesday following President Obama s executive order to expand background checks and to provide additional funding for mental health treatment and new resources for the FBI and the ATF.During the January 5 edition of his radio show, Limbaugh was ranting about something he yanked out of his diseased bunghole, suggesting that Obama s executive order forces patients to tell their doctors where they re storing their firearms and ammo. Of course, this is total hooey, and Limbaugh would ve continued to elaborate on his lie if it hadn t been for an industrious and  pro-gun  caller who totally undermined Limbaugh s entire rant with the, you know, facts.Hashtag flop-sweat.The caller noted that there are, in fact, state-level statutes in place already that mandate doctors to ask mental health patients if they believe they re a danger to themselves, but there s nothing in either state law or Obamacare or in Obama s executive order demanding that doctors known where patients are hiding their weapons. Nothing. It doesn t exist. Limbaugh made it up.Via Media Matters:CALLER: [Y]ou re telling a half-truth, at least for my state   a half-truth for my state. You need to get the information from the pamphlets that were sent out to health professionals at that time for each state. And we weren t   it does not say you ask where the gun is. It asks sensible things like  are you going to hurt yourself?  If they are, of course, stupid enough to say yes, you re, you know   do you have access to ways   are you planning on hurting someone else? But nothing on that says that I have to ask him,  Where is your gun?  and so forth. I got that information and that was from my state, not from Obama. That was from my state, and I know federal trickles down to state, but I take a little issue with some of your blanket statements when most of it was common sense prior to that, but it is state statute in Illinois a long time ago that if, say grandma has dementia and she lives with you, that you have a certain way to store that, and that s just called gun responsibility.Limbaugh stammered and tried desperately to dodge the truth. The caller, meanwhile, kept hammering away, noting that it s perfectly acceptable to, for instance, call the police if we think someone in our household is a danger to him or herself. The caller refers to this action as a  civic responsibility. Needless to say, Limbaugh s call-screener will likely be spending the New Year looking for a new job.By the way, you have to listen to the audio of the call just to hear Limbaugh completely choking on the truth.Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8949, 40 Million Bad*ss Birders Just Declared War On Oregon Terrorists,"According to an open letter addressed to the  Oregon Terrorists,  there are some 40 million nature photographers and bird lovers in the United States, and they re pissed.The letter, written by a wildlife tracker and nature photographer named Kevin, warns the militants who are currently holed up in Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge that  no small group of armed thugs is going to destroy the great wildlife and national park system that our great Republican President Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir put in place over a century ago. Writing under the name Norwegian Chief, the author states that the entire birding community is up-in-arms over what is going on in Oregon:We are watching your every move, and we have been watching you for a long time. And yes absolutely you are domestic terrorists of the worst kind, and the truth about your decades of constant poaching of protected wildlife around Malheur and other wildlife refuges, national parks, national forests and BLM lands has been well-documented. For years those of us who are wildlife photographers, birdwatchers and carers of wildlife, have been documenting the activities of you poachers and criminals around many of our nation s wildlife refuges.He goes on to remind the armed thugs that it is people like himself who have brought many criminals like them to justice over the years:With our powerful cameras, and ability to move unseen in the wilderness, we have found and documented your illegal hunts, your illegal traps and all sorts of illicit activities, and are constantly feeding that information to law enforcement, and we have finally got many of you poachers on the run and into jails.Just to make sure that the terrorists understand that these folks mean business, the author describes in glorious detail, exactly why they should:Those of us who are international wildlife and nature photographers regularly face charging elephants, attacking lions and grizzlies, hidden crocodiles, massive storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, the hottest, coldest and windiest conditions, and all kinds of poisonous snakes and bugs in our work, and we know the outdoors and wilderness from desert to jungle to sea to mountain to tundra from pole to equator better then any poacher or criminal or yeehaw yokel ever will, and we are not afraid to protect it. We have a just fear of nature from experience, but we don t fear you gun-toting thugs in the least.These are people who are likely to be far more familiar with the local terrain than the armed lunatics who seized the wildlife refuge. They re people who have spent countless hours hiking those trails, getting to know every nook and cranny of the wilderness. They re also people who have the kind of patience it takes to remain totally still for long periods of time, and to mask their presence so that not even a wild animal can detect it.Kevin writes:You will never see us, but we and our cameras will always see you. We will #takebackmalheur from you terrorists, and will not rest until every one of you thugs and poachers is behind bars where they belong.As Addicting Info reported here, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major source of revenue for local businesses.According to the letter, the birding network is watching every move made by these terrorists. They know who goes in and out, who is taking supplies and who is supporting this armed and illegal occupation. According to Kevin, someone from a nearby trailer park isn t going to like the consequences of their recent actions.We know the nearby trailer park, who is supplying you with food, and a tourist boycott of them is already in the works for all birders for this upcoming bird season. We know who everyone is coming in and out, and why, and every shred of information is going straight to law enforcement and across every birding network in America.He writes that he, and others like him are: sick to death of you welfare queens and cheats living off of BLM land, illegally gutting our wilderness and our wildlife. Malheur, Hart Mountain, Klamath Marsh, Yellowstone, Glacier, Yosemite etc etc, they all belong to us, we the American people. In closing, Kevin says this:We stand now and forever with wildlife, and you seditionists and terrorists are about to find out that s there is a natural law of karma that vindictive people, who go out and poach innocent animals, will never be able to outrun or hide from.We are watching you and our years of birding photography have made us endlessly patient and determined.I must admit, I never really thought of birders as being all that badass.I definitely do now.I have no doubt that if there was ever a head-to-head battle between these birders and the yokels who are currently occupying the Malheur wildlife refuge, these birders would kick YallQueda ass all the way back to the scum-filled swamp they crawled out of.Read the entire letter from Norwegian Chief here, via Daily Kos.*Featured image credit: Pixabay",0
8950, Ted Cruz Goes FULL Right-Wing Lunatic Trying To Raise Support Off Obama’s Gun Actions (IMAGES),"As they say, desperate times call for desperate measures, and as all the right-wing lunatics of the Republican party seem to be drifting towards Donald Trump, Ted Cruz knew what he had to do   go full right-wing lunatic himself.After President Obama announced his common sense executive actions for gun reform and a safer America, many Republicans were outraged. After all, fewer guns in the hands of the mentally ill means fewer massacres, which in turns means people won t be as scared and in turn go out and buy stockpiles of unnecessary firearms. Republicans, bought and paid for by the gun lobby, want to make sure people stay scared and have as many guns as possible.Well, Senator Ted Cruz, doing all he can to fear-monger his base of voters too stupid to realize they re being manipulated, decided he would have some fun with photoshop and scare people into supporting him. He sent out this to entice people:via tedcruz.orgOr from a mobile device: via tedcruz.orgMind you, President Obama said nothing of taking guns from anyone, or wanting anyone s guns. He s done nothing to, in any way, go against the Second Amendment which calls for citizens to be well regulated. Obama is simply trying to make sure existing laws are followed and the wrong people don t have access to buy firearms.Now, unless these right-wingers are terrified that they are going to be labeled the ones who are mentally ill, none of this effects them whatsoever. In fact, it strengthens the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners.However, Cruz, knowing his supporters are paranoid idiots, is preying on this fear for support and sends them an image of a militarized President Obama with the very false and simplistic phrase,  OBAMA WANTS YOUR GUNS,  perfectly catering to the fear these simple-minded, myopic voters have.We could say,  shame on you  to Ted Cruz for doing this, but to his credit, this sort of fear-mongering, albeit utterly inaccurate and unethical, works for Republican politicians. They have perfectly wrapped up the terrified conspiracy theorist vote, and this imagery play perfectly into that narrative.That being said, shame on you, Cruz. This is just pathetic.Featured image: tedcruz.org/flickr",0
8951, Fox Host Claims Obama Used A ‘Raw Onion’ To Fake Cry Over Murdered School Children (VIDEO),"Anyone who watched Barack Obama break into tears as he spoke of the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary can tell that the President is a man who truly feels for the victims of gun violence   anyone, that is, who doesn t work for Fox News.After the President s announcement that he would be doing what Congress is unwilling to do   expanding background check and gun safety regulations, including closing the  gun show loophole  (all sensible measures)   the hosts of Outnumbered pounced on the President s plan, arguing that he was violating the separation of powers doctrine. What really bothered them, however, was the idea that a human being is capable of showing emotion that is not fake. And so begins Onionghazi, brought to you by our friends at Fox News. What was really upsetting was the tears that he wiped away again and again,  Melissa Francis said.  You want that for   I mean, we feel frightened about what s going on with ISIS. And he can t pull that kind of passion for anything about this.  She added that she feels  bad about those kids  in Newtown, but claimed it s  only about this that he gets so upset about. After a commercial break, Andrea  Tantaros jumped into the fray, arguing that President Obama s tears must be fake because  he would have spoken out a long time ago  if he really cared   especially in favorite conservative talking point, Chicago: This is how many years? Almost eight years, he s almost at the end of his term, and you haven t heard him go to Chicago and really speak out about this issue. And he is uniquely poised to do so. But everything that he s doing will not solve the problem.So, I would check that podium for like a raw onion or some No More Tears. It s not really believable. And the award goes to  we are in awards season. It just didn t seem horribly authentic,  Meghan McCain agreed.  And maybe it is, I don t know him at all.  In any case, she thinks the President should go to Chicago instead of  talking about God-fearing Americans when ISIS is coming to their hometown and shooting up 14 people. They say he s just cool, that s the way he is, that he doesn t get emotional,  Francis chimed in.  We haven t seen this in a very long time and it s about something that feels political, that feels somewhat insincere, that feels like it s not going to make a huge difference. It s like bad political theater,  McCain opined.It s something that was to be expected: President Obama showed compassion for murdered children, so the Right has assumed what they feel is a duty to for some reason attempt to convince people that he is not sincere   an act that is shameful at best.Watch it below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIvAgKrq4tc?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen capture",0
8952," Cops Take Care Of ‘Chronic Problem’–Kill Unarmed, Disabled Black Man (VIDEO)","Kevin Matthews, a 35-year-old Black man from Detroit, Michigan, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. Even so, Matthews had never committed a felony offense in his life.On December 23, a Dearborn police officer shot Matthews multiple times, ending his life. Two days later, the coroner ruled his death a homicide.Since the shooting, police have made every attempt to make it appear that Matthews was a hardened criminal. During an interview with the press, Detroit Police Chief James Craig claimed that Matthews had  a crime problem. During an interview with WXYZ, Police Chief Craig also called him a  chronic problem in this area. In case we need more proof that cops believe they have a right to act as judge, jury and executioner, police have repeatedly stated that Matthews committed larceny earlier in the day. Note that the words  accused of larceny  or  suspected of larceny  aren t used in association with this officer-involved shooting. Instead, with their words, Detroit and Dearborn police make it clear that they ve assumed the role of the courts; trying, convicting and sentencing Matthews all on their own, without the aid of a bothersome justice system.Police have not provided any evidence that a larceny took place, or that Matthews was implicated as the suspect.Police state that Matthews was wanted on a misdemeanor probation violation, and that the officer recognized him from the earlier larceny.Voice of Detroit did a thorough records search and found that no such warrant exists.The search showed that the 35-year-old man had one misdemeanor conviction in 2013, and no other convictions.Dearborn police chief Ronald Haddad wants the public to know that he stands by the officer who shot Matthews. And in the very same sentence he said there will be a  full investigation  into the shooting. I stand behind the officer, and we re going to have a full investigation with Detroit police. It should go without saying that an impartial investigation cannot begin with a biased premise.Many details about what happened that day are not available. It appears that an unidentified Dearborn police officer spotted Matthews walking on the sidewalk at the border of Detroit and Dearborn. The Dearborn officer placed a call to dispatch stating that he was  approaching one on foot. Three minutes later the officer placed a  shots fired  call.It is clear that the officer crossed the boundary between Detroit and Dearborn to  approach  Matthews.They claim that Matthews fled on foot into a nearby backyard. Police also claim that a struggle ensued and that Matthews reached for the officers gun. This is why he was shot at least six times.According to family members, Matthews was disabled. Aside from being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, a recent car accident had left one of his arms virtually unusable. Voice of Detroit reports that a cast had just been removed from his arm, and that his fingers  remained clenched up. The officer, who is described as a white male with five years on the force, pursued Matthews out of his own jurisdiction, and away from the area where his vehicle s dashcam would record what took place. Police have not stated whether there is any video or audio evidence in this case.Social justice advocates are calling for an independent investigation into the shooting.Detroit police commissioner, Ricardo Moore, also called for an independent investigation into the shooting. Moore expressed concern about Police Chief Craig s statements to the press, criticizing him for  escalating tensions in the community,  rather than increasing public trust. Because of   Craig s biased statement against the deceased suspect, this situation would warrant an independent investigation from the Michigan State Police, solely. Craig should be trying to give the public trust in this investigation, as opposed to creating tension between the community and the police. Both Craig and Dearborn police chief Haddad have worked hard to demonize Matthews in the press. Although he has no felony criminal record, both the Detroit and Dearborn police chiefs want the public to believe that Matthews had a  crime problem. According to Reverend Charles Williams II, chair of the National Action Network (NAN) Matthews was both well-loved and well-respected in the community, in spite of the challenges he faced. He was one of those folks in the community who was definitely a respected person. Not only did they know him well, they knew his challenges well. Police officers on the Detroit side knew him also. When they saw him wandering, they would give him a ride to his mother s house. It is concerning to me that the officer claimed he felt threatened. Not only did Kevin have a broken arm, but he was a very small guy. Here s more on the story from WXYZ.*Featured image credit: video screen capture WXYZ",0
8953, Hero Activist Corners ‘Full Of Sh*t’ Ben Carson For Saying Homosexuality Is A Choice (VIDEO),"Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was confronted by an LGBT activist on Monday evening about the retired neurosurgeon s previous remarks that gay people have made the choice to be gay   and luckily the awkward encounter was recorded on camera and posted by ABC News.Carson had been meeting with supporters at a town hall meeting in Staten Island. As he posed for pictures, a woman wearing a Pride Center of Staten Island t-shirt approached him and said she wanted to ask him a question. She said: I have a quick question. Do you think I chose to be gay? Carson was taken completely off guard and repeated her question back to her, avoiding a clear answer as many others looked on. He replied, Did you choose to be gay? That s a long conversation. Fully aware that the answer really wasn t that complicated, the activist walked away   but not before telling Carson, I think you re full of sh*t. You can watch the Carson squirm in the footage below:WATCH: @realBenCarson confronted at Staten Island town hall:  Do you think I chose to be gay?  https://t.co/gL3N7TXpO1  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) January 5, 2016Like many of his fellow Republicans, Carson s rhetoric is plagued by anti-gay remarks. Carson clearly expressed his stance on whether or not he felt homosexuality was a choice when he spoke to CNN s Chris Cuomo in March. Cuomo had asked Carson what his opinion was on the matter and Carson s unwavering response was: Absolutely. Because a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight, and when they come out they re gay. So, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question. Carson has said plenty of other equally ridiculous things about the LGBT community as well. In the past, he s likened homosexuals to pedophiles and those who engage in bestiality, and claimed that God thinks being gay is an  abomination.  And despite all his anti-LGBT comments and attempts to make sure that the LGBT community doesn t get the same rights as heterosexuals, Carson still has the nerve to say gay people are more protected than Christians.Featured image video screen capture",0
8954, This Insane GOP Congressman WANTS The Mentally Ill To Have Guns (TWEET),"For years now, sane-minded individuals in Congress alongside President Obama have tried to enact common sense gun reform. And now, where those in Congress have failed to act, the president is doing what he can to tighten up existing gun laws and make sure those who shouldn t have guns don t get them.With Obama s bold actions to curb the epidemic of gun violence comes very open dissent from several members of Congress. They ve chosen to side with insanity and the gun lobby over common sense.One member of Congress, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) decided to opt so far away from common sense, that he tweeted this regarding President Obama s actions: Under Obama s executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. Under Obama's executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. https://t.co/MOEAmQdgDa  John Fleming (@RepFleming) January 5, 2016Now, any human being with even the slightest bit of common sense would agree that doctors better damn well be reporting mentally ill patients to the FBI.Furthermore, the disclosure to the FBI from doctors restricts any form of revealing what a diagnosis would be, so privacy is still protected while safety concerns still reached. Starting next month, no legal repercussions can effect the doctors doing their due diligence. The new rule states: The disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for NICS purposes. Chief executive of the mental health rights advocate Mental Health America, Paul Gionfriddo, even stated: That could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it, and they didn t. The administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group. All of this begs the question, who would be against such measures? And clearly Rep. Fleming raised his hand in enthusiastic agreement that doctors should keep their mouths shut and the mentally ill should have easy access to firearms.This goes directly against the NRA and right-wing aphorism that it s not the gun, it s the person. However, if you re against keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, then you aren t following through with that logic, and now Rep. Fleming can forevermore be labeled a dangerous hypocrite.Thank goodness President Obama is in power and is taking action when Congress refuses to do their job. It is the job of those who represent us to act in our best interest. However, so many choose to act in the best interest of those lining their pockets with lobbying dollars, and in this case, it s the gun lobby.Shame on you, Rep. Fleming.Featured image via Flickr",0
8955, NRA Thugs Threaten Lawmakers With Bullets For Sponsoring Bill Limiting Purchase Of Ammo (IMAGE),"As President Obama rolls out executive orders to strengthen background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, two New York lawmakers are being threatened by the NRA for introducing legislation to restrict the sale of ammunition.The bill would limit the amount of ammo a person can purchase over a 90-day stretch and would ban gun dealers from selling ammunition to people who are prohibited from buying guns.The NRA, of course, is not happy about the legislation sponsored by state Senator Roxanne Persaud and Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon.But rather than simply protest, the thugs over at the National Rifle Association decided to pull a Sarah Palin and make targets of the pair of Democrats.In a Twitter post by NRA publication  America s 1st Freedom,  pictures of both lawmakers are taped to a board as if someone is preparing to use their images for target practice. To make it even more threatening, bullets are scattered next to the pictures in what appears to be an attempt to incite gun violence against them. Underneath the image, the NRA whines that the measure is a  ridiculous anti-gun scheme. Here s a screenshot of the tweet.The image comes nearly five years to the day a congresswoman was forced to leave office after being attacked by a deranged shooter.As you ll recall, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was nearly assassinated by a gunman after Sarah Palin posted a map on Facebook with crosshair symbols denoting which lawmakers conservatives should target because of their support of gun control. The map, which still exists on Palin s Facebook page, served as a  hit list  and caused national outrage. Giffords survived despite being shot in the head, but the NRA seems to be hoping for a repeat.Persaud and Simon blasted the image as an attempt to intimidate and threaten them into bowing down to gun nuts. I think it is irresponsible in the times that we are living in to place a target around someone,  Persaud told the Daily News.  By placing someone s picture with bullets next to them, you are playing on the fears of people. The New York Daily News reports:Persaud said the picture has  the potential to cause harm  because you don t know if a psycho who is upset about the proposal will react to something like that.Simon slammed the tweet for inciting gun nuts, who have been sending threats to both lawmakers since they proposed the legislation last month. They are clearly trying to be intimidating and it is not working,  she said.The Daily News also reports that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams condemned the tweet as well.Once again, the NRA is acting like the terrorist organization it has become over the years. Even a veiled threat against lawmakers is outrageous and should not be tolerated in this country. If a gun nut does end up taking a shot at Persaud or Simon, the blame should be placed squarely on the NRA.Featured Image: Raw Story",0
8956, President Obama Brought To Tears In Emotional Speech About Needing Smarter Gun Laws (VIDEO),"President Obama could not hold back the tears while discussing the excessive amount of lives lost over the years at the hands of guns during his press conference on Tuesday. In what is perhaps one of his most emotional speeches in recent memory, President Obama asked the nation to start having a  sense of urgency  to finally get rid of gun violence, once and for all.Now, every time the president speaks, the nation notices. This time, however, the president practically cried on live TV. It wasn t the type of crying a baby would do, but rather the sort of emotional embrace you would expect a strong leader to show talking about an issue as critical as this one.With that said, actions speak louder than words   and even tears. That is why the president not only gave a great speech but announced what his new executive actions on gun control would entail. The gun lobby might be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot be holding America hostage. Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40%. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked. 1 in 30 people looking to buy guns from one website had a criminal record. This is not a plot to take away everybody s guns We can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. People are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do. No longer suffice. That s why we re here today. Featured image via screen capture.",0
8957, Restaurant Owner OBLITERATES Customer Who Said Woman’s Death Ruined Her New Year’s (IMAGES),"Working in the service industry can really be a test, as you will eventually and inevitably come in contact with an impossibly difficult, insensitive customer that makes you question your faith in humanity. And if you haven t worked in the service industry, this story about a customer named Holly Jones will give you a pretty good idea of what a complete nightmare of a customer looks like.For New Year s Eve, Jones visited Kilroy s Bar N Grill in Indianapolis, Indiana   an experience that left her less than satisfied. Jones said that she and her party s experience was  ruined  due to the fact that she had to witness a dead person be wheeled out from an overdose.  And of course, because of this  dead person,  her table didn t get the attention she felt entitled to. Jones was so upset, that she took to Kilroy s Facebook page to blast the restaurant for making her holiday celebration so awful. She wrote: I will never go back to this location for New Year s Eve!!! After the way we were treated when we spent 700+ and having our meal ruined by watching a dead person being wheeled out from an overdose my night has been ruined!!! Every year we have come to Kilroys to enjoy New Years Eve and tonight we were screamed at and had the manager walk away from use while (we) were trying to figure out our bill being messed up.The manager also told us someone dying was more important than us being there making us feel like our business didn t matter, but I guess allowing a Junkie in the building to overdose on your property is more important than paying customers who are spending a lot of money!! Our waitress when we were trying to ask about our bill being messed up also said  what do you want me to do (expletive) pay your bill for you?  What a great way to talk to a paying customer! I get that working on New Years Eve (is) stressful but being a complete (expletive) to us all night knowing you get an automatic gratuity is not right!!! Kilroy sJones  bad review is awful enough, but it was Kilroy s response that made this incident gain widespread media attention. Kilroy manager Chris Burton replied to Jones and kindly informed her that the  dead person  who was  wheeled out from an overdose  was actually a 70-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack while she was also celebrating NYE with her family. For Jones  insensitive remarks, Chris offered some harsh words of his own in return. First of all, the  overdosing junkie  that you speak of was a 70-year-old woman who had a heart attack. Thankfully she was revived at the hospital and survived. It sounds like you were very concerned about her so I thought you should know. This poor lady, who was celebrating New Year s Eve with her husband and son, had to be placed on the floor of a completely packed bar and have her shirt removed in front of everyone so the paramedics could work on her. You can read Burton s full post in the screenshots below, as he closed his post with I m glad to hear you won t be coming back to Kilroy s because we wouldn t want anyone as cold-hearted and nasty as you returning. Kilroy sKilroy sAfter Burton masterfully put Jones in her place, the incident went viral. In another post, Kilroy s reported that the victim who suffered a heart attack was stable, but still had a long way to recover. The bar set up a GoFundMe page, allowing supporters to donate in support of her recovery. The goal of the page was $5,000, but the donations have exceeded twice that amount. If there was one good thing that came out of Jones  nasty attitude and review, it was this   as one donor pointed out: I wonder if the lady who was upset realizes that her negativity has been a major blessing to this family .her anger and the subsequent comment from Kilroy s has lead to people learning about this gofundme and supporting this family. You are almost at the amount you requested in 17 hours. Without that woman, this incident could have happened all too quietly. Featured image via Google and Screenshots",0
8958, The Pathetic List Of Supplies The Oregon ‘Patriots’ Brought With Them To Last The Winter,"To the modern conservative  revolutionary,  the men dubbing themselves the Citizens For Constitutional Freedom   aka the morons who have laid siege to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere   may appear to be a well-organized militia worthy of the name. To normal people, they are a group of radicalized right-wing extremists who have taken up arms against their government in the commission of a felony on taxpayer-owned land.Nothing could possibly prove this point more effectively than the statement made by Ammon Bundy himself that his movement would be there for years if necessary coupled with the desperate plea for snacks we heard Monday after only 3 days in the woods.That s not even close to the best part. The Bundy militia allowed The Guardian to photograph their  storeroom,  which looks more like a pile of stuff ready to be tossed in the trunk for a weekend camping trip:Courtesy of The GuardianRemember that this stash is not just supposed to keep the 12-15 people there fed during the revolt, but also provided sustenance for anyone who shows up armed and ready to die for no good reason. The Guardian did an actual inventory of the items in the room:It included a cardboard box of apples and oranges, a few dozen pots of instant ramen, 24 cans of chicken noodle soup, a similar number of cans of sweetcorn, peas, beans and chili, and 20 boxes of macaroni and cheese.There were also three sacks of potatoes, one bag of flour, another of rolled oats, boxes of raisins, a single bag of pretzels and one granola bar.Not very impressive. Fish and Wildlife Services, the agency that runs the wild bird reserve the militia is intent on giving to ranchers, miners and loggers, is planning on shutting down the power to the building, which will leave the criminal trespassers in the cold of the Oregon forest.They say they re prepared, but shutting the power down is just the first step. The FBI is reportedly working on its own plan to shut off any and all access to the outside world to flush out the armed insurrectionists.Hopefully, when the federal government does show up, the imbeciles will throw down their weapons and surrender. It s not like they have a lot of food to survive on.Featured image via The Guardian",0
8959, Good ‘Christian’ Bristol Palin Responds To ‘Babygate’ Accusation With EXTREME Profanity And Guns (IMAGES),"In case you haven t heard, there s a theory going around that Bristol Palin s baby was actually born in November. but the family held out on the announcement until Christmas Eve. With a pile of circumstantial evidence that leads to the conclusion that Bristol was impregnated during a Vegas romp with a known Alaskan  adult industry worker  on or around Valentine s Day 2015, The blog Right Wing Crooks broke a very compelling story.Bristol, good  Christian  spokesperson that she is, responded to her critics in a less than Christly way. Using her Instagram screen name,  bsmp2,  she first offered a denial, worded strongly enough that people would take notice:OK, well that solves that then, right? Wrong. If there is no truth to the story the Palins could avoid the internet shitstorm headed their way and comply with one request:Well now we sound like Donald Trump and the birthers of 2008, don t we? Not really, since nobody really cares when Bristol Palin had her baby or who the father is. Things like this are the left s form of divine justice. Every so often karma swings at people like the Palins who preach how much better they are because they love God and America, building fake reputations off of some purity that doesn t exist.Where Bristol is concerned, it s almost too much to handle. While pregnant with her second child out of wedlock she was defending her position as an abstinence counselor. To find out she got knocked up during a one night stand in Vegas wouldn t change any elections, it wouldn t alter the course of human history, and the Palins would still manage to somehow stay relevant because people love stupidity. It would, however, be absolutely hilarious, especially if the whole thing comes tumbling down over a piece of tape.Bristol has already had enough, not bothering to indulge the question or deny it further. She simply abandons her own decency with this:Whoa. Pretty strong. Is Bristol sending a message that she won t engage in questions about it all, or is this all a part of the ruse? Making it seem ludicrous and blowing it off would be much easier than releasing a birth certificate or time-stamped images.Since the story was released Bristol has had little to say. She has been posting, however. Is this maybe another message to people who would question the abstinence princess and her 2 illegitimate children? Let s hope not:Guns, guns and more guns! It seems like someone may be using all of the grains of powder at her disposal to deal with some anger issues.This is the legacy of Bristol Palin. Teenage girl who should have just hidden behind her couch during her idiotic mother s run for the Vice Presidency turned 25-year-old woman whose only accomplishment is a high placement on Dancing With The Stars that she didn t deserve.Nobody really cares, Bristol. If you had your baby to cover up slutty behavior just admit it. If not, then well   good for you.Featured image via screen capture",0
8960, Trevor Noah Compares Texans Excited About Open Carry Law To Gay Pride Parade Celebrators (VIDEO),"Trevor Noah compared the excitement of the people of Texas over the new open-carry law to men celebrating their homosexuality at a gay pride parade. Texans already could carry hand guns but had to conceal their weapons. Now they could simply be open about it.He said: You see, gun lovers in Texas they just want to stop hiding who they really are. Although it is a little odd how as soon as people got this right they immediately went out into the streets. They were just running like yah! Ooh now I m gonna bring my gun everywhere! We re in the streets! Let s go shopping and at the laundry-mat and hey I m late at my shift at the coffee shop! He then went on to compare the excitement of gun owners over the new law to a gay pride parade: You know what, a little exuberance is fine but what made this weird for me is this is almost a little bit like when gay people first realized that society was starting to accept them for being openly gay and they immediately went out and started dancing on trucks dressed as giant penises, which on the one hand, is great. But after a certain point, we get it: you love giant penises. Texas expanded its open-carry laws to include handguns. Military rifles and other long guns have been legally openly carried for years.Featured image via video screen capture ",0
8961, Conservatives Invent Conspiracy Theory To Blame White Oregon Militia On A Black Guy (VIDEO),"Even the crankiest section of America s right wing is starting to sense that the armed take over of the Oregon refuge is creating some bad press for their movement. But instead of questioning the values that led them there, right-wing nut jobs have created a conspiracy theory that lays the blame at the feet of just one, liberal black man. President Obama.Leading conspiracy nut Alex Jones issued a YouTube rant on Monday, outlining his theory for who is really behind the Oregon attacks. According to Jones, federal plants funded by billionaire liberal George Soros and the Southern Poverty Law Center are manipulating events in Oregon in order to steal our guns. Ladies and gentlemen, don t let Obama be successful when it comes to starting civil unrest and riots in this country,  Jones said.  They will use that as a civil emergency to bring in a type of soft martial law. But Jones is not alone.Right Wing Watch reports that Mike Vanderboegh, the leader of the Three Percenters militia group, issued a blog post over the weekend which laid out a similar conspiracy theory to Jones. He argued that the militia group responsible for the armed takeover of a federal building in Oregon consists of federal provocateurs, sociopaths and idiots with a John Brown complex.   Vanderbough foresees an even darker end to the stand off than Jones though, claiming the militants have  written a check that they expect the rest of us to cash in our own blood in a ghastly civil war. However, despite his criticisms of the group, Vanderboegh states that he and his militia would have no choice but to join a civil war against the federal government and all agencies and individuals acting on its behalf.In short, a group of armed white men take launch a terror attack on U.S. soil, and blame any future fall out on a liberal black guy who favors more effective gun control.And every step of the way, the craven mainstream media is helping the militia group along. It is utterly breathtaking that African American s affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement have been branded  domestic terrorists for non-violent protests over police brutality, yet these white militia-men can seize a federal building, call any enforcement of law an act of civil war   and they are called  protesters. It is little wonder that these gun-wielding lunatics have such a sense of entitlement. They are able to flout the law and threaten extreme violence, while facing zero consequences. While 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot dead 2.5 seconds after cops found him playing with a toy gun, these men have been able to seize a building with the force of real arms and none suffered so much as a bruised ego. Something is wrong with this picture America.Feature image via CubsInsider",0
8962, Did You Spot The ‘Pants On Fire’ Moment In Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad? Politifact Did (VIDEO),"The Trump campaign is busy attempting to clean up the mess after Politifact exposed an incident of gross misrepresentation in its first TV ad.During the 30-second ad which was released Monday, a scene shows supposed migrants rushing through a national border while the voiceover states: He ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for. The clear implication is that the viewer is watching Mexican migrants running across the U.S. border with zero controls or checks.  But  as PolitiFact discovered,  it s not   it s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. The fact checkers uncovered that the footage was first shown on Italian station RepubblikaTV on May 3 2014, and rather than showing Mexican migrants entering the U.S., actually shows: migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. The footage has been shared multiple times across various social media since that time. For example, one YouTube user posted the video in July this year. Again, no mention is made of the U.S. border. Trump scored himself a  pants on fire  rating for putting this nonsense on the air and attempting to mislead the American people as to the state of border security.However, Trump appeared unrepentant when he was called on to Bill O Reilly s show to explain his actions. He told the Fox host on Monday night: I think it s irrelevant. It s really merely a display of what a dumping ground is going to look like. And that s what our country is becoming very rapidly. Proving once again that he has all the personal integrity of a toddler with a cookie jar, the GOP front runner simply steps over his lie and moves on.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons",0
8963, Watch Seth Meyers’ Hilarious And Convincing Argument About Trump’s Chances In The Primaries (VIDEO),"With the Republican primaries less then a month away, Donald Trump has started to spend millions on his campaign. While the billionaire can throw plenty of money at Trump-style racist and crazy television ads, he s already received lots of free media attention and leads in most polls. However, late night talk show host Seth Meyers isn t convinced. Myers said: But here s the thing about those polls: There s reason to think they might not really mean anything. One reason is that people hate talking to pollsters   the response rate has fallen from 90 percent to a dismal 8 percent, according to one study, which is a lower response rate than student-loan collector and mother-in-law. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zmnGlWjFWM]Meyers said that there s a correlation with Trump saying  outrageous and offensive things  and the media coverage he receives. The enormous attention he s getting  in combination with these polls makes it seems like Trump is the winning horse. But Meyers isn t buying it. Rudolph Giuliani had a three point lead for the Republican nomination and Howard Dean had a whopping 15 point lead and both went on to fade. For all of us very concerned folks out there that Trump has a shot at the presidency, here are more examples that give us hope that Trump will also fade.In 2007, Hillary Clinton was the clear front runner, polling ahead of John Kerry and John Edwards and she had a huge advantage over Barack Obama by 15 points from January all the way through June. In 2003, Joe Lieberman led in most polls of the Democratic primary but he lost to John Kerry.So, it all comes down to the people who go out and vote and not the polls that precede an election. In one of his speeches that Meyers broadcasts, Trump says,  If I don t win, I will consider this, and I mean it, a total and complete waste of time.  As Meyers said and as I m sure most of the readers out there also think, Trump,  you are not alone. Featured image via video screen capture",0
8964, Here’s Exactly What Would Happen To The Bundy Militia If They Were Black,"In 1972, a group called the  Christian Movement For Life  was founded by John Africa. Africa and his followers advocated a radical form of green politics, calling for a return to a more natural hunter-gatherer type existence while being opposed to things like scientific advancement and technology. Is this starting to sound similar to certain modern right-wing groups yet?Africa and his followers, who were almost exclusively African-American, eventually renamed their group to MOVE. The members established a commune in a house in West Philadelphia. They participated in demonstrations against institutions they opposed by using bullhorns and shouting out their opinions at all hours of the day or night.MOVE s activities drew the scrutiny of law enforcement over time. This culminated first in 1978 when a nearly year-long standoff with police who were ordering MOVE to leave their collective home ended in violence. MOVE members would not vacate so police decided to break into their home and force them to leave. When this happened, shooting started and a policeman was killed. MOVE claimed none of its own members shot the officer, as he was shot in the back of the head and was facing towards the house at the time. Seven other officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were injured also. As a result of the shooting, nine MOVE members were all sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison for third-degree murder over the officer s death.After the shooting and arrests, remaining MOVE members continued on and in 1981, they re-established their commune in a row house in West Philadelphia. After they settled in, they began the same bullhorn-aided protests they gained notoriety for previously. As before, they got onto local law enforcement s watch list.Neighbors began complaining about the protests and filed health complaints about piles of compost that the group kept on their property. Further pressure from police resulted in indictments of MOVE members for crimes like parole violation, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats. Is this starting to sound even more like certain right-wing groups yet?Eventually, then-Mayor Wilson Goode classified MOVE as a terrorist organization.On May 13th, 1985 all hell broke loose. City manager Leo Brooks arrived with a sizeable police contingent in order to force the eviction of all MOVE members from their home, and arrest of indicted MOVE members. This quickly turned into an armed standoff with police, who began firing tear gas into the rowhomes. Gunfire began, with police returning fire with automatic weapons.This is the most insane part. Police Commissioner Sambor then ordered that the compound was to  be bombed while the MOVE members were still inside. A police helicopter dropped bombs on the roof of the house. Explosions and fires ensued that destroyed sixty-five nearby homes. Firefighters that were on scene stood idle and allowed the fire to continue burning the homes. The same firefighters were just earlier trying to flood the members out of the homes with their hoses.Below is a picture of the aftermath of the MOVE bombing and ensuing fires:MOVE bombing Photo: Phillymag One of the survivors, Ramona Africa, said that police were firing at those who were trying to escape the burning buildings. The firefighters were given orders by the police to allow the fire to continue burning. This allowed the fire to spread to adjacent homes and left two hundred and fifty people homeless. Eleven people (six adults, and five children) burned to death in the fire. Ramona Africa managed to escape the gunfire and flames by crawling out through a broken basement window, even though she suffered severe burns.A commission was quickly formed to investigate the police response, which denounced the actions of the city government, but did not press any criminal charges against anyone involved.Let s compare this, to the response of police and federal law enforcement to the Bundy Militia s armed seizure of a federal public building.Literally not one person from law enforcement is on the scene, as per Oregon Live:During Saturday s rally, not a police officer was visible. And so far law enforcement agencies have not approached the refuge or blocked access to the territory. The FBI is in charge because the refuge is federal property. The Harney County Sheriff s Office and the Oregon State Police are engaged as well.Source: Oregon LiveMOVE was living in their own private home, or homes at the time. Each time, the Bundys were occupying property that did not belong to them.MOVE was classified a terrorist organization. The Bundy militia has yet to receive this distinction after the same amount of incidents as MOVE had occurred.MOVE was ready to shoot, but cops went in anyway. The Bundys are ready to shoot, and the cops are afraid to move in because they didn t want to cause a scene.MOVE ended up in a standoff with cops twice, and violence and death were the results both times. The Bundys have been in a standoff with cops twice, and each time authorities are afraid to act against people literally pointing guns at them because of how it will look if they do.Let s face it. MOVE was mostly black. The Bundys are mostly   if not all   white. Militias seem to be the new pinnacle of the white privilege pyramid in America. How shameful for us all.Featured image via Phillymag",0
8965, Fox News Host Megyn Kelly Completely Embarrasses Traitorous Bundy Terrorist (VIDEO),"In an amazing take down of Cliven Bundy s terrorist spawn, Fox News host Megyn Kelly explained how the law works and gave the right-wing loon just enough rope to hang himself with on live television.During the Monday night edition of The Kelly File, Ammon Bundy appeared on the show to defend the armed takeover of a federal wildlife building in Oregon in protest of a pair of ranchers being sent to prison for setting fire to federal land.Bundy made an oft-repeated claim that the federal government has no legal authority under the Constitution to own land. As usual, Bundy is just another right-wing extremist who is totally wrong about the law.According to the Property Clause of the Constitution: The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States. Politifact has also rated this claim as  pants on fire  in the past. As their final verdict states:The underlying legal argument rests on a tenuous interpretation of constitutional language and the rejection of about 125 years of Supreme Court decisions. The legal scholars we reached, regardless of any political leanings they might have, agreed that the Constitution clearly grants Washington the power to own land and that arguments to the contrary are baseless.Despite this, poor Megyn Kelly had to sit and listen as an ignorant fool tried to explain his argument to her. Keep in mind that Kelly is a trained attorney.Prior to letting Bundy embarrass himself, Kelly destroyed the idea that the prosecution of Dwight and Steven Hammond was illegal. The Hammonds set fire to federal land and a court of law found them guilty and they were sentenced to five years in prison. The United States Attorney General charged them for burning 139 acres of federal public land that the Hammonds had leased for grazing in order to cover up the illegal killing of several deer.The Hammonds appealed their case all the way to the Supreme Court and lost and surrendered themselves to authorities after denouncing Bundy s group of armed domestic terrorists. You know the argument on the other side,  Kelly said. These ranchers   who you support but are not directly involved [with]   had their day in court. They were found guilty, and it went all the way up to the US Supreme Court, which denied their appeal. Isn t that the way it s supposed to work in our country when it comes to the rule of law? Bundy dodged the question by trying to ask Kelly a question, which she refused to answer because she asks the questions on her show. And that led to Bundy bumbling his way through arguing that the federal government can t own land.Kelly then changed the topic to Bundy s brother Ryan and remarks he made to the Oregonian newspaper that he was prepared to  kill and be killed  for the cause. Well, Ammon Bundy walked that back in quite a hurry, suggesting that his band of gun-toting rednecks are just putting on an act. Well, I have a family. I have six children, a beautiful wife. I have a wonderful home. I have a business, several employees. I m not here to die. I m here to defend my freedoms and my liberties, and will I? Yes. But it s not going to come to that. Here s the video via Raw Story.In short, it appears the right-wing gun nuts are all talk and no walk. They were just hoping the federal government would react but the group has received nothing but ridicule from all sides. Even Ted Cruz is urging them to end the pathetic standoff.

Just ask Republican Tom Cotton.For a lousy $1 million paycheck, Israel hired Cotton to lead an effort to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama Administration toiled for months to achieve.Bill Kristol s Emergency Committee for Israel donated to Cotton s senatorial campaign and not long after taking office, Cotton penned a letter signed by 47 of his colleagues to Iranian leaders in an attempt to get them to abandon the negotiations by warning that a Republican president will not honor any deal struck.His effort to sabotage important diplomatic negotiations even drew criticism from a former Army General who expressed disappointment because as a former veteran himself, Cotton should know better than to undermine the Commander-in-Chief.In July, Cotton continued his effort by comparing Secretary of State John Kerry and the Iran Deal to Pontius Pilate and the crucifixion of Jesus.Then Cotton openly made an oath to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a trip to Israel in which he pledged his allegiance to Israel and vowed to sabotage the Iran deal. Today s meeting only reaffirms my opposition to this deal,  Cotton announced.  I will stand with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israel and work with my colleagues in Congress to stop this deal and to ensure that Israel has the means to defend itself against Iran and its terrorist surrogates. And this perfectly illustrates how Israel got Republicans to turn against their own country, and is fitting since a recent NSA leak has revealed that Israel did, indeed, bribe GOP members of Congress to rail against the Iran deal.As Addicting Info reported last week,A U.S. intelligence official who was involved in managing the NSA intercepts said Israel s communications with Republicans included such questions as:  How can we get your vote? What s it going to take?  What further denial of treason can be made by either Republicans or Israel at this point?Clearly, Israel successfully bought their new puppets considering Republicans crusaded against the deal for months. And the fact that America s broken campaign finance laws gave Israel the secret opportunity to donate to campaigns like Cotton s only makes Republican and Israeli treachery all the more credible.Cotton got a million dollars for his campaign from an Israel Super PAC and then went to work for his Israeli overlords to sabotage American foreign policy.Sometimes, it really is that simple.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8967, The Worst Environmental Disaster Since The BP Oil Spill Is Happening And The Media Is IGNORING It,"One of the largest environmental disasters in American history is happening right now, and there is a great chance that you never heard of it thanks to corporate-owned media.There is a colossal leak of methane gas currently pouring out of the ground in Aliso Canyon, California, at an astonishing rate of 110,000 pounds per hour. The fallout is intense. 1700 homes in the area have been evacuated so far, prompting many lawsuits to be filed against the corporation that owns the faciliy.Southern California Gas Company is the entity that s responsible for the disaster, which began in October of 2015. A statement by SCGC in December said that stopping the leak would take at least 2 more months.Below you can see video footage of just how bad the leak is:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exfJ8VPQDTY&w=420&h=315]The severity of this can t understated. This single leak is accounting for 25 percent of the entire state s methane emissions, and has been classified as the worst environmental disaster since the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas as well, marking this as a signicant ecological threat.Anne Silva, spokesperson for SCGC, made the following statement: Our efforts to stop the flow of gas by pumping fluids directly down the well have not yet been successful, so we have shifted our focus to stopping the leak through a relief well.The relief well process is on schedule to be completed by late February or late March. Source: MotherboardThe part that is making it so difficult to deal with, is the fact that the well is 8,000 feet deep. This is preventing the normal disaster recovery method of plugging the leak with fluids from working, due to too much pressure coming up from underground. The hope is that the relief well will drain off some pressure from the main well, allowing the fluid plug to work as intended.If you thought this was the only methane leak in California, you were wrong. The reality is far worse.In Pasadena, 35 miles from the Aliso Canyon leak, investigators found a cluster of leaks at 4 miles or less from each other. Below is a map of them, courtesy of Earth Defense Fund:Image credit: EDFWhere the hell is the accountability for this? The map above should be a criminal offense.The story of Southern California Gas Company is a pretty damning one. EDF has found that more than 38 percent of the methane pipes that SCGC manages are more than 50 years old, and 16 percent are made from sub standard materials prone to leaks and corrosion. Over 150 million pounds of methane have been released by the leak so far, and that isn t counting the huge cluster of leaks shown above.Lets put this into perspective. If 1700 families had to evacuate a California town because of volcano suddenly springing up, it would be everywhere in the media. There would be a nightly obsession over it on cable news. Politicians on every level would be pledging to help, and doing everything they can to hasten relief efforts.If we had a terrorist act that caused 1700 people to have to evacuate an American town, we would already be invading multiple middle eastern countries that had nothing to do with it.Instead, we have 1700 people displaced by an ecological disaster caused by a corporation, and the media response is  What disaster?

8968, Obama Details 4 Actions He’s Doing NOW To Fight Gun Violence: NRA Rage Incoming (TWEETS),"President Obama isn t lying down and playing dead as the NRA and their congressional lackeys allow guns to proliferate across America at an alarming pace. In the first month of his last full year in office, President Obama is launching a new series of executive actions squarely aimed at cutting down the amount of victims of gun violence we see from coast to coast.The White House released a fact sheet detailing 4 immediate steps the President would be taking to try to break the back of the gun lobby.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will demand that businesses selling guns   at a store, a gun show, online, or out of the trunk of a car   get a license and conduct background checks before selling a weapon. The ATF will also work on a rule requiring background checks for sales of dangerous weapons through trusts, corporations or other legal entities.The FBI will also overhaul the background check system and hire 230 additional examiners and other staff to process applications.The 2017 budget will include funds for 200 new ATF investigators and agents to fight gun crime, while the ATF has established an investigation center to track guns sold over the internet used for crimes. A new ATF rule will push gun dealers to notify law enforcement officials if their guns are lost and stolen while in transit   something many probably assumed was a law already.After each mass shooting, Republicans often blame  mental health  treatment for the shooting   but then do nothing legislative to help families dealing with mental health issues. President Obama will propose $500 million in funding for increased access to mental health care.Additionally, the Social Security Administration and Department of Health and Human Services will issue new rules adding information about mental health conditions to background checks and removing barriers to states receiving information about the mental health problems for those trying to buy guns.President will direct the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology, including the availability of smart gun technology. That tech would help to prevent the  accidental  firing of weapons, seemingly no-brainer technology that many gun owners support, but which is opposed by the NRA.President Obama issued a series of tweets kicking off the administration s rollout of these executive actions.Each year, more than 30,000 American lives are cut short by guns   two-thirds coming from suicides. Too many Americans have lost loved ones.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016Tomorrow, I'm taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives   protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. pic.twitter.com/vNqXEhaC9M  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives.  President Obama (@POTUS) January 4, 2016The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.

8969, You Have To See Ammon Bundy’s Ridiculous Press Conference In Oregon (VIDEO),"Ammon Bundy, the son of the secessionist rancher Cliven Bundy, held a rambling, incoherent press conference on Monday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. The 40-year-old Bundy rancher defended convicted ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond, even though the Hammonds don t really want help from the Bundy brothers. Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder told reporters,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family. But off he went anyway: We have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution. They have come down upon on the people,  Ammon Bundy said in a press conference Monday.  They are coming down into the state and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress. Among other things, Bundy announced the name of his group: Citizens For Constitutional Freedom.Bundy also presented a  redress of grievances,  read by another member of his group. The grievances were endorsed by other militia groups, such as (we re not making these up) Oregon Bearded Bastards, the Oregon Oath Keepers and the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard. I know, I know. The  Oregon Bearded Bastards  sound like they could totally annihilate the U.S. government and its pawns in the military. Look out, Marines! (Meanwhile, the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard smartly used the word  guard  instead of the original suggestion,  Central Oregon Constitutional Klan  or  C.O.C.K.  The acronym would ve been problematic. #Joke)The big takeaway from the press conference is this: the Bundys are clearly milking their 15 minutes by piggybacking their ridiculous agenda onto the Hammond agenda. Together, it s one big dumb agenda, fueled by fantasies of 1776   as if there s any realistic chance that an armed conflict with the government wouldn t end with these posers in body bags.Featured image via video screen grab.",0
8970, This Anti-Government Oregon Terrorist Took Thousands In Government Money,"One of the ringleaders of the terror-minded militia group who are illegally occupying a National Park service building got a six figure loan from the government   the same government that they accuse of being a despotic, criminal enterprise.Ammon Bundy, the son of rogue Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, heads the group and has been their front man in communication with the press. He already tasted the national standoff when his father refused to pay his bill to the Bureau of Land Management, even after using the government land for his personal enrichment.It turns out that despite the Bundy rhetoric about government and its supposed encroachment into their personal liberty, they were not above putting their hands out for some green.Ammon Bundy runs a Phoenix-based company called Valet Fleet Services LLC, which specializes in repairing and maintaining fleets of semitrucks throughout Arizona. On April 15, 2010 Tax Day, as it happens Bundy s business borrowed $530,000 through a Small Business Administration loan guarantee program. The available public record does not indicate what the loan was used for or whether it was repaid. The SBA website notes that this loan guarantee was issued under a program  to aid small businesses which are unable to obtain financing in the private credit marketplace.  The government estimated that this subsidy could cost taxpayers $22,419. Bundy did not respond to an email request for comment about the SBA loan.This is the same sort of mindset we ve seen for years and years on the mainstream right. Out of one side of the mouth comes words condemning the government, often attacking those who have sought help from the government   particularly ethnic minorities who dare to receive government support, even temporarily. From the other side of the mouth they are more than willing to build their personal fortunes on top of government help and assistance. Help for me, not for thee. They may as well be part of the Tea Party crowd demanding that the government take its hands off Medicare.Featured image via YouTube",0
8971," Anti-Government Terrorists Forgot Snacks, Want You To Send Via U.S. Mail","On Thursday Blaine Cooper, one of the anti-government terrorists who is participating in the armed takeover of a bird sanctuary in Oregon, put out a call for snacks on social media.According to the terrorist group, now known as Ya llQueda, the armed militants decided to seize the more than 100 year old wildlife refuge because it is a symbol of everything that is wrong in America, such as not being able to set fire to public lands, turn your freeloading cattle loose to feed off American taxpayers, or even ride your ATV through ancient archaeological sites, the way, according to Ammon Bundy  we used to could do. The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1908. ATV s came on the market in the U.S. in the 1960 s. The stupidity of right wing extremism is timeless.In case you needed more proof that this is the dumbest armed takeover of a bird sanctuary EVER, the anti-government terrorists who told America that they plan to stay holed up inside the visitor s building of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge  for as long as it takes,  even  for years,  are asking people to send snacks.During a secretive press conference held on the second day of Ya llQueda s armed occupation of the federal wildlife refuge, Bundy told the press, We do have a plan and that plan is going to take several months to accomplish. What kind of idiotic plan involves living in the visitor s building of a wildlife sanctuary for  months,  even  years if necessary,  but does not also include packing snacks?Image credit: screen capture, Blaine Cooper, via Independent UKNot only is Ya llQueda already begging for snacks, but these admitted haters of the federal government would like you to send them snacks via the U.S. mail.You just cannot get any dumber than these people.(You might recognize self-proclaimed militia leader Blaine Cooper from this video, or even from the Bundy ranch fiasco, last year.)During the press conference on Saturday, Bundy referred to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, with its 320 bird species, as a  tool of tyranny. According to the official website, the Harney County Migratory Bird Festival is a major tourist attraction and a staple of the local economy. The festival draws visitors from all over the world, and reservations for bird-viewing tours fill up almost as soon as they become available.In Bundy s delusional mind he s a hero and a patriot setting an oppressed people free from bird tyranny. In the minds of the residents of Harney County, he s a lunatic.More than 50 percent of the residents of Harney County work for the government. As OPB reports here, the town has always had a collaborative, rather than an antagonistic relationship with the federal government. Signs posted throughout the town, reading  Go home militia,  make it clear enough that Bundy and his followers aren t wanted there.Bundy claims he s  giving the land back to the people.  Never mind that it s PUBLIC land, or that it already belongs to the people. Need we mention that Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was accessible to everyone right up until the day these assholes took it over, causing the government to have to close it down for public safety reasons?What these dipshits have a problem with is being asked to respect public land, and to help protect it for future generations. They want to be able to let their cows graze on it at the expense of other taxpayers. They want to be able to ride their ATV s through it and drive their pickup trucks over it (in other words exploit and destroy it) and who the hell cares about nesting birds anyways? They also want to be able to poach wildlife and burn down the forest if they feel like it, just like the two criminals they re trying so hard to turn into martyrs for their utterly stupid cause.If the government is smart, they ll send these idiots a dozen boxes of Ding Dong s laced with some hard core tranquilizers. Knock their dumb-asses out. Take away their guns. Let them wake up in jail where they belong. No-one gets hurt. The public gets its land back from these delusional lunatics. Bundy and the rest of the #Yeehawdists with him all get prison time and felony records, meaning they ll never be allowed to own guns or terrorize their fellow citizens again.Sounds like a good plan to me.Watch: Ryan Bundy, one of the leaders behind the terrorist takeover in Oregon, explains the Constitution and stuff on youtube.*Featured image credit: video screen capture, via Southern Nevada Watchdogs on youtube",0
8972, Bill Clinton Reminds People Of Hillary’s LONG History Of Getting Things Done (VIDEO),"If there s one couple that Republicans love to attack, it s the Clintons. For decades, they have been under constant dubious scrutiny, more so than almost any other politician. Why? Because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done. Stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed, and work they would rather not see being accomplished. If Republicans can successfully make a scandal of the Clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments, that will help Republicans beat Hillary in 2016. It s political theater at its best and worst.Appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in Nashua, New Hampshire, was former President Bill Clinton. If anyone can explain the exemplary work Hillary has done throughout her long career, it s Bill. And while many like to say Hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea, or copies other candidates, they clearly don t know the work she s done, and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done, but getting it done. This pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office.The former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at Yale, and while she really could have done anything with her career, she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the Children s Defense Fund. He said: There she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  She hadn t been elected to anything, but everything she touched became better. As TIME so perfectly summed up Clinton s remarks: He remembered that Hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in Arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of African-American children in adult prisons in South Carolina.In another anecdote, Bill said that Hillary as First Lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late 1990s with Tom DeLay, then a leading Republican in the House of Representatives. This is all in addition to her later political work, like in helping get the Iran Deal passed, or her part in capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe, all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation.Clinton stated: I do not believe in my lifetime, anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now. Her experience speaks volumes. Her calm under pressure is unmatched, and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished.It s clear Bill is in this to win it for Hillary, and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition.It will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer.

8973, Guns In Schools Advocate Slammed By BBC Host (AUDIO),"During an interview with a BBC Live Host, a Texas gun advocate defended his state s new gun law policies by saying that the only way to stop gun violence is to arm more people. C.J. Grisham, president of the gun advocacy group Open Carry Texas and a candidate for the state senate believes that law-abiding citizens should be able to access guns easily in order to counter those who have them illegally. He said: You can pass all the background checks you want, but a criminal gang member in Chicago isn t going to run a background check on another gang member. The host then interrupted Grisham and asked:  Sorry. How many of the mass college shootings were carried out by criminal gang members? Grisham responds,  Well they were all carried out by criminals, not licensed carriers. The host then asks,  So how did those people manage to access the weaponry that led to all of those deaths then? Illegally. That s what I m saying,  said Grisham.The host continues to drill Grisham by asking,  How do you tighten that up then?  Grisham s response is ridiculous: Well, you can t stop all crime. You tighten it up by getting rid of gun-free zones and allowing people to defend themselves no matter where they walk, no matter where they go, no matter where they study. So, just to be clear, C.J.  asked the host,  The solution is actually having more guns in circulation in America. Therefore, when a Columbine happens, a teacher can open fire in a classroom against the assailant. So, guns in classrooms? You advocate that? Well, there s already guns in classrooms. It s just that they re in the hands of criminals and the good guys can t defend themselves,  said Grisham.The guns used in the Columbine shooting were bought from an unlicensed private seller.  The guns: Were all purchased for them by Dylan Klebold s girlfriend, 18-year-old Columbine student Robyn Anderson, who accompanied the two 17-year-olds to the Tanner Gun Show outside Denver, shopping with their cash. She was what is called a straw purchaser, but it would not have been necessary, since youths were allowed to buy rifles and shotguns in Colorado and no background checks are necessary when guns are sold by individuals rather than federally-licensed gun dealers. President Obama is currently proposing laws that would crack down on that type of easy access.Grisham s logic is very flawed. His idea is that if a person is in possession of a gun, then that person is likely to be safer in an unsafe situation. However,  a gun is more likely to discharge accidentally in the home or be used by a family member against another family member rather than against an intruder. The reality is that the more guns are around, the more likely the gun will not be used  for self-defense against a criminal.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQKpAmC3ASk]Feature Image Via YouTube",0
8974, Watch These Students SHUT DOWN Fox Host For Mocking ‘Rape Hysteria’ And ‘Repeated Consent’ (VIDEO),"It s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious, life-threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important. So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called  Campus Rape Hysteria,  and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable. Stossel also laughed at campus  initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience. Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex. California s law says  consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity. That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say,  Yes, please proceed.  I doubt many college students do that  but it is the law! To get his point across and show just  how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process   except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously   leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women. He said: The kids must laugh at it. I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent. Yet many students voiced the exact opposite. One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done. I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.

8975, The Three Things The Oregon ‘Patriots’ REALLY Want That Nobody Is Talking About (VIDEO),"As soon as the news spread that there was some kind of a  takeover  of federal land combined with the name  Bundy,  ears across America perked up. However, this isn t Cliven Bundy himself but rather his son Ammon, who is just as stubborn   and since everyone seems to have missed it   extremely greedy.Greedy like his Daddy. In 2014, Cliven decided his cattle should get to graze for free and that the more than million dollars in fees he owed the US taxpayer was  tyranny.  Armed freaks from across the country showed up when BLM agents seized Bundy s cattle and pointed assault rifles at them until the cattle were returned and Bundy was left alone.The federal government allowed the cattle to be returned, but Bundy is far from out of the woods.Now son Ammon has started his very own revolution, breaking into a federal building located on a wildlife refuge in Oregon, a federally protected plot of land with the strictest of rules as far as fires, hunting, alcohol and stupidity go, four things the  patriots  who have moved in will certainly partake in.The episode started when a local rancher and his son were sentenced to federal prison for setting over 100 acres of public land on fire to cover up their poaching. After a protest of their incarceration, Bundy and company took the piece of forest and released a video recruiting more  Murikans, promising them food and a place to stay. Just bring your guns.At the beginning of that video, Bundy lays out three goals for the area, highlighting the kind of person he actually is. Bundy clearly says he s going to  protect  the people and bring back the ranchers, miners and loggers:When you cast aside all of the  I love my country  BS and the  we re here for the people  garbage, you ll see that Bundy and pals targeted a wildlife management area because the things they think they re going to start doing there are strictly forbidden.Ranchers aren t welcome to graze their thousands of head of cattle, because the land has been designated as a natural resource. It s a place where a natural ecosystem can actually survive without being decimated by cattle. Bundy would, of course, change that and with his intention to be there  for years  if necessary, you know he s thinking setting up a cattle operation might be a good idea.Miners aren t allowed to strip or tunnel, because it s been determined that the risk to the environment of that area is too great from the pollution mining inherently brings to streams and groundwater. You d think the ranchers would care about the heavy metal poisoning of their cattle, but for some reason they don t.Loggers aren t allowed to chop down the forest in an area like this for obvious reasons. Things live in trees, and in this area, this tiny protected little world of plants, animals, streams and ponds, living things are essential.The Bundy stance is about greed. It s about the mentality that just because you ve lived in a place a long time you have the right to destroy it. For private property that may be true; you may destroy your own property at will, but that land next door owned by the taxpayer? We have laws and such about that land. It isn t yours. These people have been mooching for free for so long off of the U.S. government   and therefore the taxpayer   that they would have no idea how to live on their own.Yes, these are the same people who call people getting food benefits  lazy.

8976, Tennessee GOP Lawmaker Offers To Fund Bundy Terrorists’ Armed Insurgency (SCREENSHOTS),"Most Republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right-wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in Oregon   but not Tennessee state Rep. Andy Holt.Despite that this group of Yee-Hawdists made tear-filled  goodbye  videos in case they died in a shootout with the Army,  occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (or, as ABC said with plenty of sugarcoating, engaged in an  action  after a peaceful protest), and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause, all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation (protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land)   the very definition of terrorism   we don t even see 1/100 of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality.Holt tweeted   and deleted   what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to Vanilla ISIS.Holt compared the armed militia, which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to  kill or be killed  with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in Ferguson or Baltimore: While Holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which African-Americans are standing up for their rights, he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation-state by force.The Tenth Amendment, of course, does not authorize a mob of right-wing terrorists to occupy anything, by force or not   nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government. However, as one Democrat, Chattanooga City Councilman Chris Anderson,  pointed out, Holt s offer to help the Bundy terrorists may constitute Treason.While Holt may think he understands the 10th Amendment, he doesn t quite grasp Article III of the Constitution, which states:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.In fact, U.S.C.S 2383 covers insurrection quite nicely, as well:Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Anderson has asked the Justice Department to investigate. Holt, of course, dismissed Anderson s concerns with the tried-and-true  Yeah, well you re gay  response:He says that he deleted his treasonous offer  so liberal loons will quit responding  but whines that  More liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate.  Get off Twitter & read the Constitution, kids,  he said, ironically.Perhaps Anderson is right that Holt   who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government   should be investigated for treason.Featured image via screengrab/YouTube",0
8977," Celebrity Gun Nut Threatens To Shoot His Girlfriend, Gets Arrested With His Pants Down – Literally","A man known primarily for posting videos of himself making the sounds of different types of guns   yeah, apparently there is a market for that   was arrested after he threatened to shoot his underage girlfriend and then kill cops in a rampage. Just another day in gun crazy America!Bryan Silva, 25, has over two million followers on Facebook and Vine, where he thrills fellow gun lovers with short videos of his obsession with firearms.However he went from  good guy with a gun  to violent nutcase in a hurry. On January 4, Charlottesville, Virginia, police received a call from a distraught 17-year-old girl who said she had just escaped Silva s home after he held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her. She also told police that Silva was planning on killing cops.Police responded to a domestic dispute call around 6 a.m. Sunday at the home where the barricade situation occurred.According to police, the call was made by a neighbor. It was a domestic disturbance,  said Longo.  A female caller said that she was threatened with a firearm, we responded and began an investigation. Apparently, a 17-year-old girl had been at the residence when a dispute occurred. She then left go to the neighbor s house.The girl told police she had been held against her will by her boyfriend and that he had also threatened her with a handgun. She also told officers that he had threatened to shoot the police.Virginia is one of several Republican states that recently pushed to make it easier for people to have and carry guns. It seems to be working out well.The police surrounded Silva s house, and Silva took advantage of his infamy by   what else?   posting to his social media accounts about his siege with police and chatting with friends.But while Silva would have loved to posture himself as a gun-toting badass, things didn t work out that way. He eventually surrendered   and was promptly arrested with his pants falling to his ankles. In the ultimate bit of karma, the Vine  star  was immortalized in this hilarious Vine.I can't believe this vine of Bryan Silva being arrested with his pants down #Gratata https://t.co/iSwWXfWvg0  Ryan Broderick (@broderick) January 4, 2016It turns out that Silva was not legally allowed to have all those guns he was bragging about daily on social media. Silva was already a convicted felon. On top of the new charges of abduction, he was slapped with another felony, illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.His legions of gun nut fans will probably be disappointed, but the streets are probably much safer with Bryan Silva off of Vine and the streets.Feature image via Newsplex",0

His actions, throughout his career, have spoken louder than words.From his $100 million donation to Newark, New Jersey schools, to giving $25 million in the fight against Ebola, to most recently saying this in a Facebook post to his new daughter:Now, in yet another Facebook post, Zuckerberg offered his New Years resolution which included reading two books a month, creating a Jarvis from  Iron Man  artificial butler for his own personal use, and exploring the future advancement of technology.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Every year, I take on a personal challenge to learn new things and grow outside my work at Facebook. My challenges in Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday, January 3, 2016Your basic range of typical resolutions to that of utter genius, but great resolutions nonetheless.It was in a comment, though, to his post that Zuckerberg showed how fiercely feminist he is. When a grandmother commented on his post and said: I keep telling my grand daughters to Date the nerd in school, he may turn out to be a Mark Zuckerberg! Thanks for FB, I ve reconnected with family and many old friends and classmates. via FacebookHowever, this is how Zuckerberg replied to the comment: Even better would be to encourage them to *be* the nerd in their school so they can be the next successful inventor! via FacebookDamn right! Don t tell your daughters or teach your daughters to date the nerds, tell them to BE the life-changing geniuses!And while what this woman was saying was all done with a good heart, and good intentions, Zuckerberg s quick shift in thought process, and ability to point out that women are just as capable as men, is pretty damn awesome.Well done, Mark! Way to stand up for women everywhere!Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",0
8979," Patriot Can’t Wait To Go Fight Gubmint With Oregon Militia, Just Needs Welfare Check First","You know that feeling when you want to overthrow the oppressive federal government, but you can t afford it until that same oppressive federal government sends you your disability check? This right-wing patriot sure does!Among the thousands (upon thousands) of delusional anti-government comments the Bundy Ranch Facebook page has gotten in support of their violent takeover of a Oregon wildlife refuge to protest the punishment of convicted arsonists comes this gem from a bona fide right-wing nut job, who is chomping at the bit to grab his gun and join the cause   if only he could afford it.You read that right, Daniel Brewer here can t spend the $300 he estimates he ll need to get to Oregon because the government hasn t sent him his disability check yet. Instead, he sends his  prayers  to the Oregon militia and instructs them to go down shooting in a firefight with law enforcement.First identified by blogger Jim Wright of Stonekettle.com, the comment perfectly illustrates the absurd delusional fantasy the anti-government extremists manage to live in. It may be fun to pretend you and your warm gun can take on the big bad government, but you like the benefits that same government gives you   in this case, a literal check every month so you can get by.This isn t the first time we ve seen right-wingers confused about just what exactly it is they hate about the government. During the ugly healthcare debate, one of the most embarrassing rallying cries coming from those who opposed Obamacare was that the government should  keep its hands out of medicare.  Medicare, you may remember, is a government healthcare plan. President Obama himself mocked the sheer idiocy of these anti-government government users. He recounted a baffling letter he had received from one concerned woman   no doubt told by Fox News that the government would ruin her health insurance   who pleaded with him to not pass the ACA: I got a letter the other day from a woman. She said,  I don t want government-run health care. I don t want socialized medicine. And don t touch my Medicare.' Yikes.Our hapless anti-government militia sympathizer is, unsurprisingly, a conspiracy enthusiast as well. Scattered among pictures of his family, Brewer s Facebook page features dozens of right-wing memes and articles suggesting Muslims are imposing Sharia Law in America (they re not) and calls for Obama to resign (he isn t).The conclusion we can draw from this is clear: Many of the people who say they hate the government wouldn t know what to do without it. They don t want to pay taxes (who does?) and they don t like being told they can t do everything they want, but they sure do love the services  gubmint  gives them.Feature image via SBNation",0
8980, Megyn Kelly Reveals The Creepy Way Donald Trump Tried To ‘Woo’ Her (IMAGE),"Donald Trump has singled out many people during his campaign, but none have remained a target in Trump s eyes and Twitter feed quite like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump s issue with Kelly exploded after the first Republican debate, when Kelly understandably called Trump out on his long-winded history of sexist, misogynistic comments toward women. Trump, being the abrasive a**hole that he is, blew the incident way out of proportion and continued to slam Kelly both on and off Twitter for weeks after the debate. Now Kelly is speaking out against Trump, claiming that the business mogul had actually tried to  woo  her in some incredibly creepy ways   which may have influenced why he was so bitter when she called him out.Vanity FairThis month Kelly graces the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, in which the 45-year-old journalist spoke about her interactions with The Donald at length. Kelly said that Trump used to send her press clippings that were signed  Donald Trump , and called her numerous times to tell her how much he enjoyed certain segments of her show (ironically, after the debate Trump criticized Kelly s show extensively). Kelly didn t think much of this at first, but when Trump announced he was going to run for president, Kelly said  it became more clear. But, Kelly said that Trump s efforts were completely futile. She said: I can t be wooed. I was never going to love him, and I was never going to hate him. I would have crawled over a pile of hot coals to make it to that debate. No one was going to be sitting in for me, reading my questions. And I can say with confidence that neither Bret nor Chris wanted to read my questions   for many reasons! Kelly revealed that her decision to focus on Trump s sexist remarks was because she knew Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton would zero in on them if they faced each other in the general election. Part of what Kelly said to Trump was: Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about womens  looks. You once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president? And how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton   who is likely to be the Democratic nominee   that you are a part of the war on women? It was one of the most reported moments from the debate, and Kelly received attacks from both Trump AND his loyal followers for holding him accountable. Trump lovers sent her death threats, called her a c t  and a  hag  on social media   even Trump s top deputy retweeted  gut her. Trump was especially immature about the situation, and he took his disdain for being confronted to new heights when he told CNN s Don Lemon that Kelly had  blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her   wherever.  Then, the Republican frontrunner threatened to boycott Fox and continued to diss Kelly for weeks after the debate   only further proving her point about Trump s misogyny.Featured image via Vanity Fair",0
8981, Wow: Did The Palins Lie About When Bristol’s Baby Was Born To Cover Up The Truth? (IMAGES),"Conspiracy theories aren t something I take seriously very often. The type of people who engage in conspiracy theories spend their time on Alex Jones  site talking about false flags and how mass shootings are a hoax. Fourteen years later, and they just can t admit that steel does in fact bend and melt and buildings fall down when you crash big planes into them.To be grouped with the crazies is inconceivable, but every so often something comes along that seems far-fetched   until you look closely. This particular theory is brought to you by the Blogspot Right Wing Crooks, who seem to have figured out how and why Bristol Palin s baby was born in November and not December like she claims.The entire story goes into great detail about individual Instagram, Facebook and Twitter posts, friends of the family and the supposed father and former fiance brought in to make it all neat and clean. In a nutshell, the theory is that Bristol Palin was impregnated in or around the time she was in Las Vegas last year complaining about  the night that ruined her life  a month before a Medal of Honor winner mysteriously appears to sweep her off her feet, propose and become an immediate fixture in all aspects of her public, private and online life.The timeline begins on Palin s Instagram on Valentines Day.  A selfie of her and an Alaskan prostitute adult industry worker dressed to impress for a night on the town appears with the caption  The night before the worst mistake of my life.  The picture is still there, but the caption, as reported by Right Wing Crooks, has been changed to #Vegas.If that was the night Bristol Palin was impregnated, a typical gestation period would bring her into early to mid-November for a due date. The fist picture of Bristol with her new daughter, Sailor, appeared on Christmas Eve:The Palins are notorious attention seekers. Up to this point, there was no mention of babies or deliveries or hospitals. All of a sudden, bam. There s Bristol, looking content with her daughter.Sarah hadn t posted at all either, but when she did there was a bit of a problem. When you post to Facebook your location is logged. Sarah Palin was somehow holding and loving on her brand new granddaughter in a Hospital in Parker, Alaska but posting to Facebook from New Orleans. Here is the actual post:https://www.facebook.com/sarahpalin/posts/10153836923483588Things got really fishy when a picture of Bristol and her little girl showed a piece of tape with an IV date on it. After enhancing, both Right Wing Crooks and Winning Democrats are convinced that the date most likely reads 11/4/15. November 4th, which by the Vegas pregnancy theory puts Sailor at exactly where she s supposed to be gestation-wise.Here are the pictures with enhancements:Right Wing CrooksThe theory is simple. To keep Bristol from looking like she got knocked up during a one night stand, a plan was formulated to move the birth. Bristol took pictures along the way, posting them a month or two in advance. If yopu check out her Instagram account, you ll see that at 32 weeks (according to her) pregnant she looked pretty along:32 weeks with my babe girl ?   A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Oct 29, 2015 at 10:36pm PDTThat from October 29th to this on Thanksgiving, an entire month later? And what s with the Christmas tree? It s almost like the whole thing is just staged:Happy Thanksgiving ? .. thankful for my babies  A photo posted by Bristol Palin (@bsmp2) on Nov 26, 2015 at 12:03pm PSTHow far-fetched is it really? You would simply have to consider what Sarah and the Palins would do to keep Bristol safe from the career (doing whatever it is she does) ending publicity of a one-night stand Vegas baby. Already her position as an abstinence counselor makes absolutely no sense, so that s kind of a wash, but with the Duggaresque hypocrisy of Bristol being a faith blogger on Patheos and possibly a future  where are they now  Dancing With The Stars special guest, the concept of changing a couple of months for a clean(er) slate may have been just that appealing.Did she fake the birth of her daughter nearly two months after it happened? According to Right Wing Crooks there are a slew of other tidbits that add to their theory:That is all admittedly very compelling stuff. It is also very circumstantial. If it turns out to be true it will go down as a not-so-well-planned scandal from America s first family of fools. If it s not true, well shame on the Palins for having an existence that makes it seem plausible.Featured image via Instagram",0
8982," Scalia Admits He’s Never Read The Constitution, Says Government Can Endorse Religion","It s clear as day in the First Amendment, but Justice Antonin Scalia apparently has never read it or he is blatantly ignoring it. Either way, such idiocy does not belong on the Supreme Court.The Establishment Clause of the Constitution states: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof This means that the government cannot support one religion over another , and nor can government promote religion over non-religion.But conservative Justice Scalia declared otherwise during a speech at a Catholic high school in Louisiana.According to the Associated Press,  Scalia said Saturday the idea of religious neutrality is not grounded in the country s constitutional traditions and that God has been good to the U.S. exactly because Americans honor him. To tell you the truth there is no place for that in our constitutional tradition,  Scalia claimed.  Where did that come from?  he asked.  To be sure, you can t favor one denomination over another but can t favor religion over non-religion? Scalia went on to claim that America has been successful because of God and argued that the government should honor the Christian deity, telling the students to not let anyone tell them otherwise. God has been very good to us. That we won the revolution was extraordinary. The Battle of Midway was extraordinary. I think one of the reasons God has been good to us is that we have done him honor. Unlike the other countries of the world that do not even invoke his name we do him honor. In presidential addresses, in Thanksgiving proclamations and in many other ways. There is nothing wrong with that and do not let anybody tell you that there is anything wrong with that. The Hill reports that Scalia also had words for Americans who support secularism. Don t cram it down the throats of an American people that has always honored God on the pretext that the Constitution requires it. This is a man who sits on the Supreme Court of the United States, yet he has a profound ignorance of one of the most important parts of the Constitution. The Founding Fathers added the Establishment Clause precisely because they did not want the government supporting religion in any way.Apparently, Scalia thinks he knows more about the Constitution than Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, both of whom wrote that the Establishment Clause erected a wall of separation between church and state. I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, 1802 Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person s life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the  wall of separation between church and state,  therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society. We have solved   the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries.  ~Founding Father Thomas Jefferson: in a speech to the Virginia Baptists, 1808 The civil government functions with complete success by the total separation of the Church from the State.  ~Founding Father James Madison, 1819, Writings, 8:432, quoted from Gene Garman,  Essays In Addition to America s Real Religion Every new and successful example of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance.  ~Founding Father James Madison, letter, 1822Scalia is an embarrassment who should resign from the bench in disgrace. For someone who calls himself an originalist on the Court when it comes to interpreting the Constitution, it sure sounds like he has no idea what the Establishment Clause means even though it s pretty clearly worded and has been clearly explained by two Founding Fathers. If Scalia had his way, the United States would be declared a Christian state and Christianity would be forced down our throats every day despite the fact that such a thing is forbidden by the Constitution.Featured Image: Flickr",0
8983, Happy 2016! Republicans Already Promise To Be F*cking Useless This Year,"Well that didn t take long at all did it? 2016 is only a few days old and already Republicans have vowed to do everything in their power to continue screwing America. Why? Because they re absolutely spineless and don t want to make the Tea Party mad. Seriously, that s the entire reason. One of the two major parties of the United States of America is so afraid of a tiny group of racist morons that they re willing to do or say ANYTHING to keep them happy.Speaker of the Mouse House Paul Ryan has already promised that Republicans are going to vote on repealing Obamacare again:Now it appears that Ryan earned the faint support of Congressional Republicans by promising to get back to the business of negation and legislative navel-gazing. This was evident in Ryan s statement about his plans for Congress in January: When we return in January, the House will put an ObamaCare repeal bill on the floor and pass it and put it on the president s desk We are going to keep working to give families relief from this law while we work to dismantle and replace it altogether. Yes, because millions of families that have never had health insurance before need relief from the burden of having health insurance. And someone please let me know when Republicans figure out exactly what the  replace  part of their big plan is.Salon s Sean Illing summed up the GOP s actions quite nicely when he pointed out that,  each of these votes, like the recent Benghazi hearing, was a masturbatory exercise in political theater.  In other words, Republicans are wasting the taxpayer s time and money for the sole purpose of creating anti-government Tea Party porn.Senate Republicans will be just as useless as Mitch McConnell has promised to keep persecuting refugees. Refugees, if you ll recall, are the Greatest Threat To America Of All Time  because 1 of them might someday do something bad. Meanwhile, a group of armed white Christian extremists have seized a federal building and are threatening to shoot government officials. But, you know, McConnell is worried about those wascally refugees fleeing war and violence. Murika.Featured image via Cagle Cartoons",0
8984, John Oliver Has Brilliant Advice For Breaking That New Year’s Resolution You Won’t Keep Anyway (VIDEO),"It s a new year. For many of us, that means that we probably made a few resolutions. You know   quit smoking, eat better, drink less, get more sleep   all good things that could improve life. There s just one problem, though: most people don t keep those resolutions. They go right out the window before the first month of the new year is even over for most people. Well, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight has some advice in that arena: You re going to break these resolutions anyway, so quit being so hard on yourself.Oliver said: Every December, for some reason, we decide that next year will be the one that everything turns around and we ll finally quit drinking, or learn how to pronounce the name of these berries.  He then continued: But let s be honest, we re a few days into the new year now, and if you haven t broken your New Year s resolutions yet, statistically you are about to. That can be depressing. But don t panic, all hope is not lost. Because the key thing with resolutions is not how to keep them   it s how to revise them once you ve failed. The main problem with New Year s resolutions is that we set our expectations way too high. For instance, lots of people say they want to exercise more   but that s hard. Exercise is like reading for your muscles. Except you can t watch a movie of someone else exercising and basically get the gist of it. He s right. Humans are set in our ways. Small changes are better than big ones, because they are easier to stick to. You re not going to change your whole life just because a new year rolls in, and that really is okay.Watch Oliver s hilarious  yet completely accurate   thoughts on New Year s resolutions below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8985," FBI FINALLY Does Its Job, Starts Monitoring Oregon Militia Terrorists","Some of America s pretend patriots have taken over the federal building of a wildlife reserve in Oregon. Over the weekend as the internet and news organizations were abuzz with news of this outrageous and illegal activity, one entity was suspiciously and conspicuously missing from the equation: The federal government. Yes, you read that right. At first, the government had absolutely no plans to take action against these people. Why? Because they are white Christians. That really is it. Look at how, in stark contrast, they treat Black Lives Matter protesters, or think of how this situation would have played out if these people had been brown Muslims instead.Well, finally, the government has decided to do its job. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now monitoring the situation with the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation by self proclaimed militia members and supposed defenders of the Constitution, which they have clearly not read and understood. If they had, they would not be doing this at all.The occupation is taking place in Harney County, where the sheriff there, David. M. Ward, has told his law abiding citizens to avoid the situation. While the militia members claim to be there defending local ranchers, Ward says that the group s intent is something much more sinister: These men came to Harney County claiming to be part of militia groups supporting local ranchers, when in reality these men had alternative motives, to attempt to overthrow the county and federal government in hopes to spark a movement across the United States. As per usual with such people, known anti-government extremist Jon Ritzheimer has warned authorities that the group is armed: Yes, there are some people that are armed. We need to defend our rights. That s what the Second Amendment is there for, people. Senator Ron Wyden (D- Oregon), who has been in touch with the local authorities on this ongoing situation, says that the FBI is definitely monitoring things: The FBI is on this every minute. But based on comments from what we ve heard in the community and what s been reported, we may be in just the early stages of this. Indeed. These are right-wing nuts, some of whom have already said that they are prepared to die here. They won t give up easily.This is nothing more than bona fide domestic terrorism. Arrest them. All of them. They really need to be made to realize that they are not above the law.Americans seem to be so worried about terrorism. Well, we re growing it right here at home   and we aren t doing anything about it. And that s the problem.Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",0
8986, Paul Krugman: Obama Rolled Back RONALD REAGAN’S Tax Cuts For The Rich,"Paul Krugman, by his own admission, has been drooling over the release of the IRS s 2013 tax tables. If you re still awake after reading that sentence, congratulations! You have the stamina of a bull! But seriously, while tax codes and forms and statistics and charts and zzzzzzzz .. may be boring as all hell to you and me, they re still useful. Specifically, they re useful in determining the impact of Obama s Nazi Socialist Commie Homosexual Muslim Agenda  on America.And no matter how  disappointed  you are that Obama did not turn the United States into Utopia, he still managed to do something amazing:According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.And what does that mean? It means Obama, that terrible, terrible disappointment that supposedly only serves his corporate masters took a large bite out of Reganomics:But the available numbers are consistent with Congressional Budget Office projections of the effects of the 2013 tax increases   projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre-Reagan level. No, really: for top incomes, Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan s as well.Any economist not working for a billionaire s think tank will tell you in no uncertain terms that Reagan s (and Bush s) claims were total bullshit. Giving more money to the rich does not improve the economy, it only makes the rich richer and hurts everyone else. Since the 80s, we ve handed billions every year to the rich and they took that money and invested it in buying politicians and factories in other countries. Now we have definitive proof, in the form of the strongest job growth since the Dot Com bubble of the 90s, that taking those tax cuts away will not hurt the economy in any way whatsoever.Thanks, Obama!Featured image via Business Insider",0

8988," Donald Trump’s First Campaign TV Ad Is Here, And It’s Worse Than We Imagined (VIDEO)","While an armed militia group of domestic terrorists seize and occupy a federal building by force, GOP Presidential hopeful Donald Trump has released his first campaign TV ad. It s worse than we imagined.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. In this small catchphrase lay a few assumptions. Firstly, that America is not great now. Secondly, that it ever was great. Thirdly, all the assumptions around what exactly is wrong, and what would restore the nation to greatness.Let s pretend for a moment that the first and the second assumptions are true. It is certainly ground that liberals and conservatives might share. That is what is so enticing about the statement, but when progressives list the greatest issues facing America, they often come up with things like:But if you were hoping optimistically that any of these issue were going to be addressed in Trump s campaign ad   you ll be bitterly disappointed. What three things will Donald Trump do to make America great again?The eagle-eyed amongst you will note, none of these three things in any way relates to the major issues facing America in the coming decade and century.Where are our next great engineers, inventors and scientists going to come from when we have the worst education system in the developed world? If we aren t growing them at home, and we can t import them due to immigration bans, how on earth is America going to be great in these fields?It is not only that Trump and the GOP do not have the answers to the biggest questions of our age, it s that they aren t even asking those questions. Trump doesn t want to make America great again, he wants to make America white again. He is speaking only to the frightened, white folks of the land who genuinely believe anybody other than rich white people (lawmakers, business leaders and presidents past) are responsible for the decline of the nation.As Hillary Clinton put it in New Hampshire this week: You can t make America great again if you insult and demean the people of America.

8989, Nobody In Oregon Seems To Want The Bundy Militia There,"After going to all the trouble of leaving their bunkers that are stocked with toilet paper and bullets, the Bundy militia arrived in Oregon just to be told to go the hell home by the locals.Both the Hammond family who are at the center of this ruckus and local residents alike are critical of the Bundys  idiot militia being in their town. A lawyer for the Hammond family released a statement on the situation saying,  Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond Family. Koin.com reports that even though some locals did march with the protesters, many others felt the out-of-towners should just leave them to deal with their own problems without interfering:While some locals did march with the protesters, others felt it was too much. Some posted signs to protest the protesters. I want them to go home,  resident Bee Bee Sitz said.  We take care of ourselves. Another resident, Kainan Jordan, said,  I don t think all of these outsiders coming here is necessary. I think they intimidate the local people. Source: koin.comOne protest organizer, Pete Santilli, is a right-wing internet radio hack and current resident on the terrorist watch list. Santilli doesn t even appear to be a resident of the state of Oregon. His website shows that he broadcasts his internet radio show from Ohio. The Bundy boys are not residents of Oregon, either. This entire operation seems to be an uninvited patriot telethon requesting  donations  so the masterminds of this fiasco can play soldier instead of getting a real job.People can t even send their children to school because they are closed all week due to the militia presence. It took only two days for these so-called patriots to cause negative effects on the town they are supposedly there to improve.MILITIA UPDATE: The local school district in Burns announced it will keep schools closed all week because of the militia situation.  Les Zaitz (@LesZaitz) January 3, 2016The irony of the situation is that the militia has become the very thing they claim the federal government to be   an outside non-authoritative entity trying to force their own rules onto how the local people deal with their land.Featured image via Twitter",0
8990, WATCH The Hilarious ‘Goodbye’ Video Posted By One Of Oregon’s Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Thus far, the Oregon militia members who have occupied the federal building of a wildlife reserve are facing absolutely no threat of action being taken against them by government officials. Nonetheless, at least one of them has admitted that  he actually went to join these domestic terrorists with the intention of dying in a standoff, and subsequent statements and actions have shown that the others are likely thinking along those same lines. For instance, at least one of the militiamen has actually taken the time to film and upload a goodbye video to his family and other loved ones. While the videos are serious and tearful to the right-wing loons, they are nothing short of hilarious to those of us who aren t completely insane. Here is the one from known domestic terrorist and Muslim hater Jon Ritzheimer: Honestly, if this loon cared about his children that much, he d realize that missing the entire holiday season for this nonsense is doing them a tremendous disservice. All in the name of  what? Wanting to be above the law? Wanting to die as some kind of  free man?  I don t think that means what he thinks it means.Take your meds and go home, Mr. Ritzheimer. Even if you don t die there, you ll likely spend a lengthy stretch of time in federal prison for these ridiculous antics. Either way, your children need you home, not out terrorizing and occupying government facilities. If you knew anything about being a good father, you d know that. Then again, those kids would be better off not being raised by such a loon anyway. Good luck to them, they ll need it.Featured image via video screen capture",0
8991, Why The NRA Could Be In Big Trouble For Breaking Federal Law,"The National Rifle Association may be in violation of federal law, according to documents the NRA itself filed with the Internal Revenue Service.While the NRA often refers to itself as a membership organization with millions of members that contribute to its operations, they said something completely different on their tax forms.The NRA, which was founded in New York in 1871 and claims to have millions of members, even told the IRS it didn t receive membership dues, thus enabling it to avoid disclosing more about its activities. Last year, it spent $345 million.At the same time as this deceptive practice reportedly occurred the NRA also conveniently disappeared the existence of its political slush fund, the Political Victory Fund, the PAC the organization uses to target any and all politicians attempting to reduce gun violence, including President Obama.The forms the NRA signed omitting the existence of its PAC and membership status state that they must be truthfully signed under  penalties of perjury.  The NRA also ignored the box requiring that it disclose whether it engaged in lobbying   despite the NRA often flooding congressional offices with lobbyists seeking to flood neighborhoods with guns and ammunition. How that form wasn t intended to mislead the IRS, I don t know. I don t know how you come to any other conclusion,  said lawyer Marcus Owens, a former IRS official and leading expert on non-profit tax law.Unbelievably, the NRA told the IRS it hadn t spent any money on lobbying between 2008 and 2014. But the Manchin-Toomey gun bill, which the NRA opposed, came up in the U.S. Senate in 2013 in the months after the Sandy Hook gun massacre.Then when news organizations began pointing out these possibly illegal discrepancies, the NRA suddenly began adding information about its donation and lobbying efforts on its 2014 returns.According to the New York Post, NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman s office hasn t commented on whether the NRA is being investigated for its incomplete filings with the federal government. Schneiderman received widespread coverage for going after fantasy football providers Draft Kings and Fanduel, if he began criminally looking into the NRA it would create huge shockwaves across the world of politics.Featured image via Flickr",0
8992, Oregon Right-Wing Terrorist Makes CHILLING Confession: ‘I Came Here To Die’ (SCREENSHOTS),"If anyone questions whether or not the Bundy-led right-wing terrorists who violently took over  a federal building in Oregon are actually violent terrorists, they need only ask Capt. Moroni,  one of the reported more than 100 armed men who seized control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge over the weekend. Bundy s people demand nothing short of  complete surrender  of the land to the conservative terrorist cell, a move they allegedly made in support of two felons and arsonists who don t want their brand of  help. While some   like ABC and CNN   seek to downplay this  action,  the rest of us see it for what it is: the Stupid Part of America has finally mobilized its  militia  and is willing to  kill or be killed  to achieve their goals. Though early estimates have said 100 to 150 men were holding down the newly-established terrorist base, OPB s Amanda Peacher says that only a few dozen men are occupying the federal building. According to Peacher, federal employees were warned to steer clear of the wildlife refuge in a memo that reads: Our top concern is employee safety. All employees are accounted for, and the Refuge will be closed until further notice. Employees of all land management agencies in the area will operate from alternate worksites, telework, or administrative leave. No matter how many people are there, one man to whom Peacher spoke revealed that not only are the insurrectionists willing to use violence to accomplish their goals   but they are ready and willing to die in the process. A man who would identify himself only as  Capt. Moroni  told Peacher I didn t come here to shoot, I came here to die.  A series of tweets from Peacher detailed not only the chilling admission, but showed that the Bundy Army is already establishing supply lines to fuel their mini-revolution:          Since an unarmed demonstration by African-American protesters over the unjust killing of one or more black men attracts a heavily-armed force, surely law enforcement is responding heavily to this very real terrorist threat. There were no law enforcement agents visible in the area around the refuge. A man with a goatee beard and wraparound sunglasses stood guard, armed with an AR-15-style rifle, and refused entry to the federally owned facility,  writes The Guardian s Jason Wilson. One of the occupiers, who  declined to give his name or affiliation, citing  operational security,  confirmed that the heavily-armed men  would be camping on the site  because it s  public land  and they view themselves to be  The People. It s time we stop coddling right-wing extremists. If they want a war, let s give them one. It will be short-lived.Featured image via Twitter ",0
8993, Hillary Clinton Shuts Down GOP Lawmaker Rudely Heckling Her At Town Hall Event (VIDEO),"A Republican lawmaker in New Hampshire showed up to one of Hillary Clinton s town hall events in the state on Sunday and apparently thought it would be smart to heckle Mrs. Clinton. Bad idea. Not only did it not work out as planned, but the former Secretary of State called out the state representative in front of everyone. You are very rude, and I m not ever going to call on you. Thank you. The comment earned Mrs. Clinton an enormous round of applause, as the heckler just stood there continuing to point her finger at Hillary while waving her hands like a crazy person. It s these kinds of tactics that don t go over so well. Perhaps there s a better way to get your message across?So, what exactly was Katherine Prudhomme O Brien, the GOP state representative from Rockingham, trying to say? She followed up with a reporter after the event and was mad that Hillary didn t want to talk about Bill Clinton s past marital infidelities from decades ago. Really? That s what was so important? I asked her how in the world she can say that Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Wiley are lying when she has no idea who Juanita Broderick is. She told me this summer she doesn t know who she is and doesn t want to know who she is. How can she access that they are lying, which she told someone last month? Expect for more below-the-belt tactics like these now that Bill Clinton is set to make his first appearance on the campaign trail starting on Monday. Republicans are looking for any and every chance to use Bill s past indiscretions against Hillary. It s the kind of dirty campaign tactics that people claim cause them to hate politics, yet somehow they still get the most attention.With that said, Bernie Sanders, unlike Republicans, doesn t intend on bringing up Bill Clinton s sexual past anytime soon: No, I think we ve got more important things to worry about in this country than Bill Clinton s sex life.

8994, Texas Governor Directs Violent Threat At President Obama On Twitter (TWEET),"The lack of respect for the office of the President of the United States from Republicans is utterly appalling. No matter who the president is, or how much you disagree with their policy proposals or how they conduct business, you respect the office. You don t have the respect the person, but you respect the role they play as the leader of the nation. However, Republicans seem to have forgotten this unwritten rule, especially under the presidency of Barack Obama. Their utter disrespect borders on utter impudence.For the last seven years we ve even had members of the right-wing say that President Obama wasn t born in the United States. It s as if they don t consider him valid as a president, so they don t need to offer him the respect and dignity the office of the presidency so rightly deserves.Yet another example of this insolence can be found in a recent tweet by the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott.Abbott, upset that President Obama wants to curb the epidemic of gun violence after mass shootings have become all too common in occurrence, decided that he would directly threaten the president.What did the president say that got Abbott s Underoos in a bunch? A few months ago, I directed my team at the White House to look into any new actions I can take to help reduce gun violence. And on Monday, I ll meet with our attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to discuss our options Because I get too many letters from parents, and teachers, and kids to sit around and do nothing. I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every time these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that right while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a massive scale. You know, because God forbid we, as a nation, care enough to curb the epidemic of gun violence.However, Abbott takes it personally, and pandering to his base of voters and the right-wing lunatics who feel they should be able to own their personal arsenal to cater to their paranoia, he tweets this at President Obama:Obama wants to impose more gun control. My response.#? COME & TAKE IT @NRA #tcot #PJNET https://t.co/RUPbcev5jY pic.twitter.com/8VNwisj966  Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) January 1, 2016And, of course, this tween is also directed at the NRA, because Abbott feels the need to whine like the immature child that he presents himself to be, and needs them to help him fight his selfish battles.What Abbott, and all the other right-wing loons need to realize is, when you say,  COME AND TAKE IT  to the president of the United States with a picture of a gun or cannon, as the case may be, you are threatening the President of the United States.  Come and take it  implies you are willing to kill to have your way. You take your argument of clear dissent to that of a direct threat of violence against the president for wanting to impose policy you disagree with.Abbott also needs to realize that Texas is only a state, not its own nation, and they are to abide by the laws of the United States, and any action taken by President Obama. Otherwise, they are in clear violation of the U.S. Constitution.These words from Abbott need to be called what they are   a threat, and Abbott needs to held accountable. As the governor of one of the largest states in the U.S. he should have a little more maturity than this, act like an adult, and apologize. You don t have to agree with the president, but you need to respect the office.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)",0
8995, Why Is The ‘Y’all Qaeda’ Militia Being Mostly Ignored By Law Enforcement?,"They re calling them  Y all Qaeda.  It s all at once appropriate and ridiculous. The fact that a group of armed traitors are occupying a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge shouldn t be treated as a cute internet meme, but there it is.Rather, this is serious business made more serious by the infuriating reality that local law enforcement appears to be allowing it to happen without much interference.According to The Oregonian, police officers were nowhere to be found during the Saturday rally at the site which led to several members seizing the headquarters at the refuge. Furthermore, law enforcement hasn t revealed its plans   if any   to repel the militia from the government land. And now that Ammon Bundy, the son of Nevada secessionist ranched Cliven Bundy, has taken over as the leader of the occupation, the militiamen are sure to be joined by more attention-seeking seditionists.But going back to the lack of law enforcement presence. Do we really need to underscore the lopsided injustice here? Do we really need to emphasize the fact that if this had been Black Lives Matter activists or, hell, Islamic terrorists, how the facility would ve been surrounded and the situation greeted with law enforcement gunfire. If just one African-American gunman has stepped foot into the building, recent history and more than enough video footage has proved that the black gunman would ve been decimated in an onslaught of police gunfire. Full stop.Instead, a group of secessionist weekend warriors with enough disposable income to play military dress-em-up are being allowed to seize government property   taxpayer-owned land and facilities   in an effort to exert their independence from the rest of the nation, law enforcement appears to be completely blas  about it. Why? The answer should be obvious.So, what next? If these bastards want a fight, and if they want to die for their stupid cause, give it to them. They ve seized our land. Mine. Yours. It s time to stop dicking around and show them they re not above the law just because of their white privilege.Featured image via Twitter",0
8996, CNN Analyst: White Militia Are Not A Threat Because They Are Not ‘Looting Anything’ (VIDEO),"People have been quick to point out that there is a clear double standard in the media and people s attitudes regarding the armed occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge headquarters in Oregon. CNN law enforcement analyst Art Roderick gave a blatant example of this double standard when he appeared on a broadcast of CNN s, in this case, dubiously titled Reliable Sources, on Sunday.During the segment, Roderick made the case that the militia members occupying the federal building are not  looting anything  which makes them way less of a threat to people s safety than say, Black Lives Matters protestors. The last thing we need is some type of large confrontation because that s when stuff goes bad,  Roderick explained.  And I think in this particular instance, if we just wait them out, see what they ve got to say, then eventually, they re all going to go home. CNN host Brian Stelter was quick to point out that some have said that if,  [These were] Black Lives Matter protesters, or if these were peaceful Muslim Americans, they would be treated very differently by law enforcement. This is a very rural area,  Roderick responds.  It is out in the middle of nowhere. What are they actually doing? They re not destroying property; they re not looting anything. It s important to remember that in the United States,  rural  means white, and  urban  means black. I mean, there s a whole separate situation going on as to exactly why they re there and that will be worked out through the legal process,  he continued.  But I think now that they ve taken over this location out at the fish and wildlife, this brings in the federal side. And I know the federal government has learned over the years how to deal with these types of incidences. Let s face it, we all know if a Black Lives Matter group of protesters, or any group that isn t legitimized by the white supremacist narrative of the right wing, was to do the same thing as these wannabe revolutionary cowboys are doing, they would have been demonized in the press and probably killed outright by federal authorities. No one was calling for  calmer heads  when police beat the hell out of BLM protesters.You can watch the segment below.Featured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
8997, Texas Lt. Governor Uses Fake Statistics To Defend New Open Carry Law (VIDEO),"The Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, appeared on Meet The Press with Chuck Todd on Sunday to discuss his state s new open carry law. Now, while we must say Mr. Patrick did a pretty good job at making it seem like he defended the merits of the law, in reality, all he did was provide outdated, heavily debunked statistics.Here s what Dan Patrick had to say about the relation of guns to crime data: Everywhere that we have more citizens carrying guns, crime is less. There s a study showing that where states have open carry, or concealed carry, but particulary open carry, crime is down 25%, murders are down (even). Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing. In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass-shootings except two in America since 1950 have been gun-free zones. Where people have guns, bad guys don t go. Lt. Governor Patrick doesn t cite his source in the interview, but given how he just said open carry causes crime to go down 25%, we re going to assume he s referring to Florida State Rep. Matt Gaetz s (R-Fort Walton Beach) research. Matt Gaetz is the guy who came up with all this from when he sponsored a bill in October to allow open carry in his state.During a press conference, he claimed to show research that proved violent crime was  23 percent lower in states that allowed open carry, and the murder rate was 5 percent lower.  There are just a few problems with this. Politifact decided to fact-check this and determined that it was very misleading. For one, Gaetz only used data for one full year (not very historical by any means) and compiled it in such a manner that would make it impossible to draw a reasonable conclusion from. It noted that no policy makers should rely on it. Yes, anyone can come up with stats, but that doesn t make them applicable. If a policy maker were to try then and use these stats to make the claim that this proves open carry laws make people safer, then that deserves the title of fake.Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck doesn t think you can use just one statistic to back up a claim when several other studies are proving otherwise. Plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding having no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other. And, not only that but the opposite appears to be true. The Washington Post published an article entitled: More gun, more crime: New research debunks central thesis of the gun rights movement. In it, it points out how Stanford law professor John Donohue has advanced decades of analysis showing that guns do in fact equal more crime. So much for the Texas Lt. Governor s argument that we need more guns to be safe. I guess this is what you get when you pick and choose your facts, heavily debunked ones at that.Featured image via screen capture.",0
8998, Chris Christie Calls Obama A ‘Petulant Child’ For Executive Orders On Guns (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama has recently announced that he will be issuing executive orders on guns after a series of horrific attacks involving firearms. Predictably, the NRA and Republicans are absolutely freaking out over this, and one of the outspoken GOPers whining about this just happens to be Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.During an interview with Fox News on Sunday, Christie criticized Obama for trying to improve gun control laws, calling him a  boy  for trying to keep the American people safe from terrorism and violence within the home.When Fox moderator Chris Wallace asked Christie what he thought about Obama s intention to expand background checks and prevent guns from getting into the hands of accused domestic abusers and terrorists, Christie went off on a rant: This President is a petulant child. Whenever he can t get what he wants, because frankly, the American people have rejected his agenda by turning over the House and the Senate to republicans, going from 21 Republican governors when he came into office, now 31, now he wants to act as a king. The fact is if he wants to make changes to these laws, go to congress and convince congress they re necessary, but this is going to be another illegal executive action which I m sure will be rejected by the courts. When I become president, they will be stricken from executive action by executive action I will take. You can watch Christie go off on Obama below: Christie had no issue criticizing Obama, even though he is unaware of what Obama will actually do, or the potential legality of those actions. The crazy thing is, Christie later said that he is FOR the restriction on guns to terror watch suspects, but isn t comfortable with Obama taking immediate, responsible action! Wallace pointed out that Christie had previously been supportive of gun control measures, and asked him if he d changed his stance. Christie said: I haven t changed my tune. I signed the bill that banned guns for people on the terror watch list. As president, I would make sure that terror watch list was actually accurate. Interestingly enough, Republicans are fine when Obama takes executive action for things like bombing Syria   however when it comes to protecting women from their abusers or stopping terrorists from getting guns, they ve proven time after time that it s just not a priority.Tomorrow, Obama will see Attorney General Loretta Lynch to finalize his proposal. A town hall will be held on Thursday, and the new executive actions on background checks are expected in the next few days. Featured image via Marc Nozell / Flickr",0
8999, Bernie Sanders Calls Out Trump Over His Obsession With Bill Clinton’s Sex Life (VIDEO),"During a segment on ABC s This Week, Bernie Sanders hammered Donald Trump for talking about Bill Clinton s sex life rather than the real issues that the United States should be focusing on.The show s host, Martha Raddatz, brought the subject up, asking Sanders if he thought that Bill Clinton s sex life should be considered  fair game  during the election.: Donald Trump and Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus think Bill Clinton s sexual history is fair game. Do you? No, I don t,  Sanders replied, and then continued: I think, you know, we have enormous problems facing this country and I think we got more things to worry about than Bill Clinton s sexual life. I think   interestingly enough, maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change, understand that climate change is not a hoax, as he believes that it is, that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country, which he opposes, and maybe we should not be giving huge tax breaks to fellow billionaires like Donald Trump. So I think maybe he should focus on those things,  Sanders concluded.Sanders made a similar critique of Trump last week. Sanders claimed that he could win over Trump supporters. That claim must have scared the hell out of Trump. In less than 24 hours, Trump responded to Bernie Sanders, saying that he is in support of raising wages. That s a complete flip from Trump s earlier claims that wages in the United States are too high. Of course, Trump called him a liar and acted like a complete douche bag about the whole thing. Trump still insists that he doesn t think that the minimum wage should be raised, but statements he made in Politico show that he is playing defense on the issue.Bernie Sanders got the Republican presidential primary runner to flip his script and adopt a more progressive message on a major issue. So who knows, maybe sometime this week Trump will go all in on the importance of fighting climate change? Sanders has become a force to be reckoned with because of his unrelenting commitment to his platform. A platform that even the Republican primary front runner is beginning to co-opt.You can watch the segment below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCkSFlxJFMYFeatured Image Credit: Screenshot via YouTube",0
9000, Teen Records Himself Abusing Girl: ‘This Is What You Do When People Act Up’ (VIDEO),"A young man recorded himself as he maliciously abused a young woman, apparently his girlfriend. He then uploaded the video to the internet. The man, who appears to be in his mid-to-late teens, seems to think that his horrific treatment of the girl in the video is either funny or cool.The 34-second video shows the male seated behind the wheel of his car. The first thing he says is,  I just don t want people to act up. The girl is standing outside the vehicle, her arms folded across her chest in a protective stance.By the five second mark it becomes obvious that he has her trapped by the hair, which is rolled up in the window of the car.At this point he explains, clearly amused with himself, that this is exactly what he has done. Pull her hair through the window,  he says.  Roll the window up. He then laughs as he begins to put the car into gear.The young woman is clearly terrified, and begins to beat on the window of the car. The driver laughs harder, as she becomes more visibly frightened by his behavior, pleading with him to  Stop, stop. He continues to laugh, saying something that sounds like it could be the girl s name,  Jenny,  repeatedly.Watch the 34-second video below, via LiveLeak.https://youtu.be/SF0s9ycMi9oThe video appears to have been uploaded anonymously. The young man who did this needs to be named and shamed. Not only that, but the video needs to be turned over to police, so that they can arrest him on charges of domestic abuse.In most states, if the police have sufficient evidence to believe that domestic abuse has occurred, they do not need the victim to cooperate or press charges, in order to arrest the perpetrator.The young woman in this video may well be too afraid of what this abuser will do if she reports him.Domestic violence is defined as  a pattern of behavior used to establish power and control over another person through fear and intimidation, often including the threat or use of violence. The actions of the perpetrator in this video are clearly designed to terrify this young girl. By his own admission, he s using terror-tactics to control her behavior or keep her from  acting up. One in four U.S. women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. Two out of every three female homicide victims are killed during an act of domestic violence.The perpetrator and victim in this video happen to be Black. But research shows that domestic violence impacts women from all walks of life, regardless of race, ethnicity, or economic circumstances.While Black women between the ages of 20 and 24 are more likely to experience domestic violence than white women, in all other age groups, Black women and white women experience domestic violence at an equal rate. So before you even start to imply that the couple s race has something to do with it, don t. Domestic violence is not an issue that is confined to any race.While the couple in this video may appear to be young, women between the ages of 16 and 24 years are most likely to be victims of intimate partner abuse.Domestic violence is everyone s problem. Between 2003 and 2012, domestic violence accounted for more than 20 percent of all violent crimes in the U.S. It costs society $37 billion annually in law enforcement involvement, legal work, medical and mental health treatment, and lost productivity.While the perpetrator in the above video is unidentified at this time, the internet has a way of finding people out.What if the young lady in this video was your daughter, sister or friend?Our society needs to send a clear message that this kind of terror-inducing behavior is not funny and it is certainly not cool. This is a sadistic crime, and the young man that committed it needs to be held accountable for his actions.",0
9001, Professional Panderer Carly Fiorina Says Ted Cruz Will Say Anything To Get Elected (VIDEO),"Just days after forsaking her Stanford Cardinals by supporting the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Rose Bowl to pander for votes, Carly Fiorina complained that Ted Cruz says  whatever  to get elected.During an interview on CNN, Fiorina launched an attack on the Texas Tea Party hero, who is currently leading in some Iowa polls ahead of the first primary vote in February. The failed former CEO of Hewlett-Packard whined about Cruz saying whatever it takes to get voters to support him. Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa. He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he s going to do as he pleases. I think the American people are tired of the political class that promises much and delivers much of the same. But as right as she is about Ted Cruz, Fiorina completely ignored her own hypocrisy when it comes to pandering.For weeks, Fiorina pandered to conservative  Christians  by claiming that heavily edited Planned Parenthood videos featured footage of a live fetus being butchered for body parts. Fiorina s claims have since been thoroughly debunked by media and medical professionals.She has also pandered to women by falsely claiming that  92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama s first term belonged to women,  when in fact, women actually gained jobs.Fiorina also pandered to the military by accusing President Obama of ending the careers of several generals. However, only two of the five she mentioned retired due to policy differences with their commander-in-chief.Time and time again, Fiorina has lied in an effort to gain support. Politifact has caught her lying around 70 percent of the time.But her worst attempt to pander came on Friday when she wrote a Twitter post rooting for the Iowa Hawkeyes football team against her own alma mater in a clear effort to gain support from Iowa voters.Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today. #RoseBowl  Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) January 1, 2016CNN host Dana Bash also pointed out Fiorina s hypocrisy on Sunday, to which Fiorina responded by claiming that the tweet was just her way of having a little fun and was not meant to pander at all. For heaven s sake. Can t a girl ever have a little bit of fun?  Fiorina asked. That was a tongue in cheek tweet which the people of Iowa understand, because I was asked over and over again in Iowa, having attended a Hawkeye tailgate, I was asked, they knew that my heart was torn. Let s just say if the biggest mistake I make is a tongue in cheek Tweet about a Rose Bowl, the American people will sleep safely when I am President of the United States,  she added.  It was tongue in cheek, for heaven s sake. A girl needs to have a little fun sometimes. I guess it was a slow news day in the media. Here s the video via YouTube.However, contrary to what Fiorina claims, Iowa fans, nor anyone else for that matter, did not understand and were definitely not happy about Fiorina s tweet as she was roundly criticized in reply after reply to her tweet.Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, Fiorina s tweet is not the only mistake she has made throughout her campaign, nor is it the biggest. And it should also be noted that Fiorina played the woman card to spin out of her Twitter fiasco. Rather than own up to her obvious pandering play, Fiorina framed it as a girl just having fun and suggested that the media is being sexist.Sorry, Carly. But that just doesn t fly. You are currently polling at 2 percent in Iowa. Clearly, you are desperate for higher poll numbers as it becomes ever more clear that your campaign is doomed. So, you made a choice to pander to Iowans by throwing your own team under a bus instead of displaying loyalty to the university you graduated from. And then your decision was made worse after Stanford absolutely destroyed Iowa on the football field to win the Rose Bowl. If any other team had been playing the Hawkeyes, perhaps your tweet would have been appropriate, but that was not the case. You got caught pandering and now you re trying to frame it as a girl having a little fun and an evil sexist media attacking you for it. That s called playing the victim and it s not very appealing to voters either.Carly Fiorina should be so embarrassed right now that she ends her campaign in disgrace instead of continuing to pretend that people actually like her and that she has a chance to actually win.Featured Image: Flickr",0
9002, Poll Finds White Republicans Are Angry Nearly All The Time,"In a new poll that asked Americans to comment on their anger issues, Republicans and white people reported being angry nearly all the time.Perhaps stoked by hate-mongering organizations like Fox News and right-wing radio, a large portion of conservative white people said they got enraged over current events at least once a day, and many felt that they were angrier now than they were just one year ago.Overall, 49 percent of Americans said they find themselves feeling angrier now about current events than they were one year ago. Whites are the angriest, with 54 percent saying they have grown more outraged over the past year. That s more than Latinos (43 percent) and African-Americans (33 percent).Seventy-three percent of whites said they get angry at least once per day, compared with 66 percent of Hispanics and 56 percent of blacks.The poll also found Republicans are angrier than Democrats. Sixty-one percent of Republicans say current events irk them more today than a year ago, compared to 42 percent of Democrats.The poll, while not exactly scientific, does reinforce earlier research that found white, conservative Americans feel they are more oppressed than any other group. Oftentimes, this anxiety is  explicitly about not coming to grips with a black president.Peter Brimelow, author of  Alien Nation: Common Sense About America s Immigration Disaster,  asserts that much of white America s anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics.Diversity, he says,  is not strength. The Tea Party is a response to this emerging white fear. Conservative politicians, sensing an opportunity, seized hold of those anxieties and exploited them for votes. It was also impossible to contain. The hatred and fear-mongering on the right has turned into an uncontrollable inferno. The results are toxic new realities like Donald Trump s popularity and   more recently   the armed takeover of a federally owned wildlife reserve by right-wing extremists who think paying grazing fees for their cattle is tyranny.On the face of things, Americans should have less to be angry about. Conservatives may not like it, but the economy has roared back to life under Obama. More Americans have health insurance than at any time in history. Social injustices that have long plagued the country are finally being reckoned with. Crime, in large part, is down.What s left is the shrieking, hollow screams from pundits and politicians who desperately need you to stay mad. The Tea Party was an utter disaster, and many of its beneficiaries have been booted out of office by voters with a Tea Party hangover, but its initial surge of racist, xenophobic rage proved to many that  voting angry  is a legitimate   if pathetic   electoral strategy. And as America approaches its next election, it s clear that they are madder than ever.Feature image via Flickr",0
9003," What’s Happening In Oregon Is TREASON, Our Founders Explicitly Wrote AGAINST Insurrection","What s happening in Oregon isn t, by any means, an act of  patriotism  or the  duty  of citizens. What s happening in Oregon is a temper tantrum, and nothing short of treason. This seditious behavior is quite illegal, and the United States Constitution explicitly states that a well regulated militia can be used against insurrections, not in the allowance of such horrific behavior.In Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, it states: To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; The founders use of civilian militias was not one to  overthrow  the government if citizens felt they were being wronged, it was to protect the union from insurrectionists who were a threat to the nation.How did they make sure these militias were well regulated and armed in case of insurrection, invasion, or to maintain the law of the land? With this thing called the Second Amendment: A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. See how everything pieces together when you don t just cherry pick the parts of the Constitution you want to make sure every dimwitted Tom, Dick or Sally is armed to the teeth. The purpose of the militias was to protect the newly formed government. And while dissent is patriotic, sedition is not. If you don t like how the government is being run, we have this glorious thing in the United States called  democracy  and we re able to vote for who writes our laws.What s happening in Oregon, by definition, is exactly treason. It could also be considered a  Seditious conspiracy. If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both. These  patriots  need to be locked up for a good long time.If you still question the intent of the Founding Fathers  effort to thwart insurrection, please take note of the Whiskey Rebellion. Not much unlike what s happening in Oregon with pissed off farmers, the government imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which these farmers decided to rebel against. Well, President George Washington called forth the use of the militia to stop the insurrection and this refusal to follow the law. In fact, here is the transcript of his proclamation from September 25, 1794: Whereas, from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution and laws of the United States, in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania, would yield to time and reflection, I thought it sufficient, in the first instance, rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody them; but the moment is now come, when the overtures of forgiveness, with no other condition than a submission to law, have been only partially accepted; when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government has been adopted, without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury, and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy, endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support, and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is manifest, that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at defiance, the contest being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole Union, and, at the expense of those who desire peace, indulge a desperate ambition;Now, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, in obedience to that high and irresistible duty, consigned to me by the Constitution,  to take care that the laws be faithfully executed;  deploring that the American name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government; commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved, in perfect reliance on that gracious Providence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country, to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the laws; do hereby declare and make known, that, with a satisfaction which can be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received intelligence of their patriotic alacrity, in obeying the call of the present, though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force, which, according to every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency, is already in motion to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confided or shall confide in the protection of Government, shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity, will be treated with the most liberal good faith, if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct, and that instructions are given accordingly.And I do, moreover, exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men, to contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those crimes, which produce this resort to military coercion; to check, in their respective spheres, the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth, and their discontents in the place of stable government; and to call to mind, that as the people of the United States have been permitted, under the Divine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, in an enlightened age, to elect their own Government, so will their gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain the Constitution and the laws.And, lastly, I again warn all persons, whomsoever and whersoever, not to abet, aid, or comfort the insurgents aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at their peril; and I do also require all officers and other citizens, according to their several duties, as far as may be in their power, to bring under the cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises. If there were such a thing as a  mic drop  in the day, it would have hit the floor with the strength of a thunderous boom.Honestly? Washington s words could be said today in the same regard to the thousands of armed wannabe  patriots  who are taking up arms against the nation in wrongful insurrection. These men in Oregon need to be stopped, they need to be arrested, and this sort of behavior, in any way, cannot be condoned or allowed. It goes against everything we are as the United States of America.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons",0
9004, Here Are The Right-Wing Scumbags The Bundy Militiamen Say They’ll Kill People To Protect,"When the tense standoff between federal agents and a group of right-wing extremists at Cliven Bundy s ranch ended in a stalemate, it was only a matter of time before we heard from the emboldened  patriots  again. On January 2, they showed up unannounced   and unwelcome   in Oregon.Towing with them a large arsenal of weapons and vowing to die in a shoot out if police or federal agents removed them, Cliven s sons Ammon and Ryan Bundy seized a federal wildlife building and said they were prepared to stay there indefinitely until their demands   the unconditional surrender of the United States government and the ceding of federal land to ranchers like the Bundy family   are met. It s clear that Ammon Bundy, the ringleader, wants to build an army. In a statement, he begged fellow anti-government patriots to  stand up and come to Harney County. We need your help and we are asking for it. And the Bundy family made no secret of the violence underlining the  protest. I talked to Ryan Bundy on the phone again. He said they're willing to kill and be killed if necessary. #OregonUnderAttack  Ian Kullgren (@IanKullgren) January 3, 2016While Ammon has framed the issue as one of freedom vs. tyranny, the real reason they showed up was to protect two Oregon ranchers, father and son Dwight and Steven Hammond. Like Cliven Bundy, the Hammonds had gotten used to abusing public lands to feed their livestock on and felt that it was now their  right  to do so.Who are the Hammonds? Based on their actions: A pair of scumbags who were willing to destroy a large area of federally protected land just to protect themselves from being exposed as criminals.In 2001, they purposely set a series of wildfires on government land in order to hide their poaching activities. The fires turned into a raging inferno that nearly killed a few local residents, destroyed 139 acres of public land and killed countless animals that were meant to be safe.The jury convicted both of the Hammonds of using fire to destroy federal property for a 2001 arson known as the Hardie-Hammond Fire, located in the Steens Mountain Cooperative Management and Protection Area.  Witnesses at trial, including a relative of the Hammonds, testified the arson occurred shortly after Steven Hammond and his hunting party illegally slaughtered several deer on BLM property.  Jurors were told that Steven Hammond handed out  Strike Anywhere  matches with instructions that they be lit and dropped on the ground because they were going to  light up the whole country on fire. These are the people Bundy s armed militia group came to Oregon to defend. They would set a deadly wildfire to protect themselves and ruin the land for anyone else because  freedom.  If the definition of terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation to achieve a political goal, then let s call this what it is: Terrorism.Ironically, the Hammonds themselves want nothing to do with the standoff. Their lawyer disavowed the group from the start. The Hammonds are already facing jail sentences for their crimes. They ve correctly guessed that adding  stoking an armed insurrection  would only keep them in jail longer.From interviews Ammon Bundy has given while in Oregon, it s clear that he has an idea of himself as a right-wing martyr. As such, he and his fellow group of anti-government terrorists are clearly willing to die for their cause. They ve brought with them enough guns to see that they take down as many innocent people as they can before that happens.So far, federal agencies and the Harney County Sheriff s Department are taking a light approach the the occupation. Not keen to start another Waco, the authorities are trying to reason with the group rather than go in shooting. It remains to be seen whether a group that invaded a small wildlife reserve building while wearing camo fatigues and carrying rifles can be reasoned with.Feature image via CBC screengrab",0
9005, Fox News Defends The Confederacy After Right-Wing Militia Seizes Federal Building (VIDEO),"Hours after right-wing militia members committed treason against the United States, Fox News defended the Confederacy and the Confederate flag.Fox and Friends host Tucker Carlson declared that attacking the Confederate flag as a symbol of racism is an assault on middle America during the Sunday morning broadcast.Carlson took particular issue with director Quentin Tarantino s recent remarks on the subject, in which he said,  I ve always felt the rebel flag was some American swastika. This caused Carlson to fly into a rage against the the Hateful Eight director before going on to defend the flag and the Confederacy. I don t think he knows anything about the Confederacy,  the Fox host said.  I would be shocked if Quentin Tarantino could name three Civil War battles if his life depended on it. This is an attack by the elites on middle American culture. Using the Confederacy and the battle flag and all that stuff, they re just symbols to them of what they believe is the backward culture between Malibu and Georgetown. It s like they look out and, man, everyone is in the Klan. You know, they eat pork rinds, they watch NASCAR, they re horrible. Co-host Clayton Morris pointed out that Nazis and American white supremacists both use the Confederate flag as a symbol of their racist and anti-government views, which seemed to cause Carlson to step back for a moment to claim that he isn t defending the flag even though that s what he was doing the entire time. He also claimed that he doesn t support armed rebellion against the government. But, of course, Carlson concluded by trying to enrage conservatives enough to the point where they might become even more violent against the government. I would say that [Tarantino] is not making a reasonable point here. He s making the point that the president always makes, that the real threat is middle America. They have too many guns, they re into this Christianity thing. They are opposed to abortion. They have all kinds of Medieval views that are a threat to America. It really is an attack on middle American culture. Here s the video via YouTube.As right-wing militias continue to become more emboldened, conservative media appears to be supportive of their actions. After all, Carlson and his co-hosts only devoted about 15 seconds to covering an armed attack on the United States government while focusing much more time on defending the losers of the Civil War who tried to overthrow the United States via armed rebellion. Clearly, these thugs in Oregon need to be arrested and locked away from civilized society and Fox News should be shut down for trying to anger more people into supporting violence against government.Because that s exactly what they are doing by claiming that the government thinks people in middle America are a threat. They are trying to gin up fundamentalist Christians, anti-abortion fanatics, and gun nuts into getting angry enough to start shooting and committing acts of terrorism that will get people killed. It s one thing to have a conservative point of view, but what Fox News is doing now looks an awful lot like support for treason and terrorism.Featured Image: Tumblr",0
9006," Pres. Obama Starts 2016 With A Huge Win: Iran Turns Over Nuclear Program, GOP Silenced"," The Nuclear Deal  became a Republican talking point as soon as it became inevitable that the Obama administration was going to move forward and try to do what no Democrat or Republican could do for 30 years: tell the Iranians to sit down and do as they re told so people can stop finding reasons to bomb each other.We were told from the beginning that Iran wasn t suddenly a friendly nation. We were told flat out that they support terrorism and that they have human rights issues and women s rights issues and all kinds of things to sort out. All of that being true is also the reason we couldn t just sit back and allow a potentially unpredictable rogue nuclear nation to decide to eliminate a neighbor, friend or foe.You see, we can t just have people nuking each other. When the deal was made the GOP immediately called it a giveaway. They rang up the total of how much the Iranian economy   and therefore its people   would gain with sanctions lifted and called that number the amount Obama was  giving to terrorists.  The amount of enriched product Iran would have left would be enough to kill Israel 50 times. They spewed lie after lie to make people afraid   it s what they do   of the very thought of Iran having anything nuclear at all within its borders.The Republican plan is simple: keep the sanctions on Iran, making them as helpless as possible on the oil market, and then start a war. It s just the next inevitable Republican War. If we elect a Republican president we can pretty much bank on it. Several candidates have said they would  tear up the deal  on their first day in office.Unfortunately for the GOP, Iran just surrendered its entire stockpile of enriched uranium to the Russians. What little material they have left will be downgraded to fissionable reactor plates for an internationally supervised test reactor with zero capability of producing weapons-grade material.The transfer included tons of low-grade material that could have potentially been enriched along with the entire inventory of enriched uranium the Iranians possessed. At this point, the Iranians are reduced to a pre-nuclear industrial era where the only thing nuclear reactors do are experiments.That s what the people who listen to the voices of doom on stage at GOP debates don t get. There never was any way for Iran to get out of the stipulations of the deal. Their path to a nuclear weapon was cut off at the knees. This latest step to full implementation is yet another incredible win for a president who refuses to allow his legacy to die during his  lame duck  years.Featured image via Instagram",0
9007, Donald Trump Rings In The New Year With A Vicious Twitter Rampage (TWEETS),"Donald Trump s insane ways are no longer surprising but have become very predictable. He rung in the new year with yet more Trump negativity and the usual antics we ve all become accustomed to. Unabashed, like a spoiled baby that constantly gets reinforcement from the few people that actually like him, Trump went on another tantrum that he thinks will garner him yet more support. He let loose on his Republican opponent Jeb Bush and on Hillary Clinton. Take a look at his Twitter posts. First comes his rant against his Republican rival, the squirmy Jeb Bush:.@JebBush is a low energy ""stiff"" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016I don t know about this one. George Bush takes the cake for the biggest embarrassment, not only to his family, but to the nation. After all, he s a certified war criminal. As Americans, we have to constantly explain how we elected him once in the first place. Yes, once. His daddy helped him steal the first election.The next rant comes against former president Bill Clinton. Harking on allegations that he s a sexist, Trump immediately took the opportunity to attack Hillary by going after Bill:I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016Low blow by Trump. After all, Bill s escapades have nothing to do with Hillary. In fact, one can argue that she s shown both class and courage in the face of her husband s alleged extra-marital affairs.Here s another attack on Hillary. This time it s against her alliance with Israel:Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2016This one is difficult to argue. The bipartisan support for anything Israel is quite disturbing. Trump is referencing Israel s illegal apartheid wall that has made islands of Palestinian towns and villages, cutting them off from each other and creating a situation in the West Bank that South African anti-apartheid activist Desmond Tutu has said is worse than anything he witnessed under the white regime that exploited blacks for decades. We know how that system crashed, so the hope is that Hillary can change her ways and be on the side of justice and help end Israel s crazy experiment. Former president Jimmy Carter even wrote a book about Israel s insanity.However, Trump gets no credit for this tweet since he s advocating a similar approach for Muslims in the United States and he s arguing that Hillary is a hypocrite since she supports walling the Palestinians, the majority of whom are Muslims (a large Christian Palestinian population including Bethlehem is walled as well).Donald Trump has received lots attention not only from his supporters but from those opposed to his stances. He s an expert at generating attention by entertaining people. But, just like a long running sitcom that slowly yet surely fades, many people are looking forward to the day when Trump is canceled.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",0
9008, 43-Year-Old Virgin With Bionic Penis Set To Have Sex For First Time (VIDEO),"A 43-year-old man with a surgically implanted bionic penis is set to actually use it  for the first time. Mohammed Abad, from Edinburgh, will take the life changing step next week with 35-year-old sex worker Charlotte Rose after they get to know each other when they go on a dinner date in London. Abad lost his organ as a result of a freak road side accident and was fitted with a bionic one that apparently allows him to perform. Abad said: I have waited long enough for this   it ll be a great start to the new year. My penis is working perfectly now so I just want to do it. I m really excited. I can t wait for it to finally happen.  [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nQF39iUyYg]When he was six, Abad was pushed into a road and fell under a moving car which dragged him 600 feet resulting in serious injuries, including to his genitals. He was fitted with a bionic replacement in 2012 but it s only been fully functional since 2015, when surgeons performed a special operation which will apparently allow him to have intercourse. Here is how the device works: The sexual device contains two tubes which fill up using liquid from his stomach, allowing him to maintain an erection. The contraption   complete with  on  and  off  buttons in his testicles to pump it up or deflate it   was made from the flesh of his arm and fitted by surgeons at University College London. It has a button in his testicles which he can press to pump it up, as well as another button which drains the penis after use, so it deflates. Here is how the gadget was attached: Molding and attaching it took three years, with doctors from University College London using a skin graft from his arm to line its shaft. The skin and fat from his forearm was removed to create the new penis, which was then attached during an 11-hour operation. Along with giving him a sex life it has also allowed him to pass urine standing up for the first time. It took surgeons at University College London three years to mold Mohammed Abad s new penis using skin taken from his arm. However, it wasn t that simple. Abad said that he s had some complications as a result of the surgery: I got out of hospital on the 10th of July and got a train back up to Scotland. I had to keep it erect for two weeks. I had to do that for it to heal, because that s the way it works. My old penis didn t go to waste   my surgeon used it to make my scrotum. In the last three years, Abad has had 119 operations. But that s not stopping him. His soon-to-be partner Charlotte Rose, who s a campaigner for sexual freedom and a dominatrix, said that that she is  honored  that Abad picked her and that she will not charge him. Abed, who was married for over two years, never told his wife that he didn t have a penis until their wedding night. She would later leave him. Rose said that she hopes that Abad will have more confidence after he loses his virginity.Hopefully everything will work out for Abad and he can be on his way to living a normal life.",0
9009, Why The Hell Are Our News Media Whitewashing Domestic Terrorism In Oregon?,"We all rely on the media every day to know what s going on in our world. Many media sources these days have an opinion informing the content they provide, but the majority usually try to avoid outright lying about things. That doesn t seem to be the case in what s happening right now in Oregon.There is an ongoing armed insurrectionist seizure of a federal building happening at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in Oregon. Depending on what news source you rely on for your  facts , you might be unaware of the reality of the situation.To bring you up to speed: Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, lit fires in an attempt to protect some of their property from invasive plant species. They ended up burning federal land   twice. Their actions netted them an eventual conviction for arson, which they served time for. After they were released, their sentences from a previous judge were found to be illegal   due to them being too short for the minimum sentencing requirements   and they were sent back to jail for longer sentences. The second conviction is what set off the protests, and caused Cliven Bundy s idiot militia to take up arms. To be fair, the Hammonds never asked anybody for help, especially not the Bundys.Here is where this all takes an incredibly weird turn. Many media outlets have been picking up this story, but the major ones are pants-on-fire lying about the event.Below is an excerpt from the Fox News reporting of the situation. Remember, Fox News  article published at 12:00 midnight at the earliest:Some local residents feared the Saturday rally would involve more than speeches, flags and marching. But the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs, flowers and pennies.As marchers reached the courthouse, they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door. Their message: civilians were buying back their government. After the march passed, two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies.A few blocks away, Hammond and his wife Susan greeted marchers, who planted flower bouquets in the snow. They sang some songs, Hammond said a few words, and the protesters marched back to their cars.Dwight Hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.Source: Fox NewsBelow are excerpts from Oregon Live. This is the exact story Fox News credited at the bottom of their article for the information in their reporting. Oregon Live s story was posted with the updates on weapons and threats of violence at 9:15 pm and again at 12:00 am:In phone interviews from inside the occupied building Saturday night, Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan Bundy, said they are not looking to hurt anyone. But they would not rule out violence if police tried to remove them, they said. The facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds,  Ammon Bundy said. We re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,  he added.  This is not a decision we ve made at the last minute. Neither man would say how many people are in the building or whether they are armed. Ryan Bundy said there were no hostages, but the group is demanding that the Hammonds be released and the federal government relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest.He said many would be willing to fight   and die, if necessary   to defend what they see as constitutionally protected rights for states, counties and individuals to manage local lands.Source: Oregonlive.comBelow is a video of Oregon Live s local news coverage   The people walking around in combat gear carrying long rifles seems to be too nuanced for ABC, AP or Fox News to notice:Many people have been calling out Fox for their total bullsh*t coverage on twitter:@FoxNews You misspelled ""Armed Christian terrorists.""

These are three major news outlets that operate 24/7 with up-to-date breaking coverage on everything   except this one story. All of the articles were posted at a time equal to or later than the local news which covered the full details   including the part about the guns and threats of violence. All three news sites credited the local news but chose not to report what the local news actually said, even mischaracterizing it from social media. This was not a journalistic mistake. This was corporate media propaganda. I would be any amount of money if a group of armed minority citizens seized a federal building, coverage would be vastly different.Featured image: custom image via Wikicommons",0
9010, Racists Go CRAZY after Samuel L Jackson Trashes Trump On Jimmy Kimmel Live (VIDEO),"The racists came out in full force when Jimmy Kimmel put up a minute of video that is too outstanding to ignore. In a segment called,  The Hateful 8 Ball,  Kimmel gets advice from a mystical Samuel L Jackson inside a magic 8 ball toy. Jackson plays the part as you d expect, nailing the role of angry black man with iconic voice ever so perfectly.Definitely a great moment captured for all time   not only for a funny comedic piece, but as a historical record for the kind of racism that follows Donald Trump around. On hearing the name, the Trump trolls who keep this buffoon relevant enough that he might just win the GOP nomination hopped all over the comments on The Patriot Nation, the right-wing propaganda rag posting the video for other racists to be outraged at.This rocket doctor doesn t understand why racism has to be about race:When Bill Taylor, who went to Ball State University, says that President Obama had no qualifications other than he s black to run for president, that s it. All bets are off, Obama is worthless. Bill was obviously far too involved with the investigation into how little Obama was vetted to notice the birther movement, college transcript fiasco and fake Barry Soetoro stuff that still thrives in circles of stupidity all over the internet.Bill says he s a racist, pretty sure it s because he s black, not sure if we re talking about Jackson or Obama anymore; It s very sad.Then there are the people who just really are that stupid:It takes a classy person to be a Donald Trump supporter. You have to be able to just hate so indiscriminately. Can you actually consider yourself to be fair if you truly hate everyone equally? Hate just for hate s sake.You can enjoy the comments and maybe even make yourself a new conservative friend HERE.Featured image via screen capture",0
9011, Cliven Bundy’s Sons Occupy Oregon Wildlife Reserve With Armed Militia Of ‘U.S. Patriots’ (VIDEO),"Last year, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made national headlines for his insane standoff with government officials over the illegal grazing of his cattle, and now his three sons have followed in his footsteps by taking up arms with  about 150  armed and dangerous militia members in an Oregon wildlife reserve. They are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in protest of the expected detainment of two ranchers in the area who are expected to face federal arson charges. Ammon Bundy, the presumed leader of this ridiculous occupation, made a video that was later uploaded to social media, where he said: We re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that s been set upon them. These people need to learn that they are not above the law. This  occupation  is illegal, and if they are taking up arms against the government they and all of their participants and supporters need to be hauled into federal custody and charged. That was the mistake before   Cliven Bundy and his right-wing militiamen never spent so much as a day behind bars for their insanity. Now, Ammon Bundy, his brothers, and other like-minded morons want to rule themselves free from government oversight in their own nutty enclave.Another presumed group leader, a man by the name of Blane Cooper, speaks in the video and trashes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the equivalent of  high school bullies : Until that line is drawn and say  we ve had enough of this tyranny, you are going to leave us alone  it will not change. Cooper goes on to encourage more occupations like this one across the country: It doesn t have to stop here. This could be a hope that spreads through the whole country, the whole United States. Everybody s looking for this hope because the government has beat us, and oppressed us, and took everything from us; they will not stop until we tell them no. Perhaps this time, the feds will take these lunatics seriously and arrest them.Watch the video of this insane anti-government speech below:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Here it is.

9012, Watch Heartbreaking Cries From An Abused Puppy As She Is Shown Love For The First Time (VIDEO),"A video of a terrified and previously abused puppy being shown love for the first time by her handler has captured the hearts and minds of many. The puppy, Priscilla, is crying out as a caretaker pets her. Not knowing how to react to the love she s shown for the first time, Priscilla cries out in anguish and fear but as the video progresses, amazing things happen.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogpZHkfN2I]Defenseless and petrified, Priscilla keeps snapping her head back to the hand of the caretaker, anxiously anticipating what the caretaker will do next. Watching Pricilla s trauma gives the viewer an idea of the magnitude of abuse Priscilla previously suffered.However, after a few strokes around her head, eyes, and ears, Priscella slowly yet surely calms. Later on in the video, Priscella is in the arms of her caretaker and she seems both comfortable and reassured that the people around her mean no harm.The last part of the video shows a happy Priscilla playing with her handler and another dog. She is bright, happy, and physically healthy, unlike the Priscilla we saw in the previous video. Not much is known about Priscilla other than the clear abuse she clearly incurred from her previous owner and that she is from Romania.It is striking what a little love and affection can do. If we treated all creatures in this manner, including each other, one can only imagine how wonderful the world we live in would be.Featured Image via YouTube Screen Capture from Daily Mail ",0
9013, Obama’s Photographer Releases White House’s Most Captivating Moments Of 2015 (IMAGES),"Having stayed close to the Obama family for both of President Barack Obama s terms, White House photographer Pete Souza has shared a variety of moments with our president and his family. Souza has gotten to witness both light-hearted and challenging moments for America s first African American president, and has had the privilege of capturing many of them on camera.As January marks the beginning of a new year, it also represents the last year that Barack Obama will lead the country. On Wednesday, Souza released his annual  Year in Photographs  list, revealing over 100 of the most memorable public and intimate moments of the Obama s life inside and outside of the White House. Souza explained: Editing photographs, especially for a project like this, is both subjective and personal. I not only found key historic moments from the year, but also chose moments that give people a more personal look at the lives of the President and First Lady. I ve also included many photographs that rely more on their graphic qualities, including light and composition. In Souza s collection, monumental wins such as the White House being lit with rainbow colors after the nationwide legalization of gay marriage are portrayed alongside heartbreaking losses such as the funeral of Vice President Joe Biden s son, Beau.

9014, Bernie Sanders Shows How To Properly Handle Hecklers As Trump Goon Interrupts His Rally (VIDEO),"A Donald Trump supporter came up with the worst idea ever when he got it into his head that it would be a good idea to try to heckle Bernie Sanders at a Massachusetts campaign rally. Clearly he did not know what he was getting himself into.The heckler was wearing a Trump shirt, and holding a sign that said  Obama is as Christian as Bruce Jenner is a woman.  As he started being an obnoxious twit, interrupting Bernie s speech and making a spectacle of himself, Bernie pointed right at him and said into the mic: Here s a Trump supporter worried about Mr. Trump s money. The crowd  took over at that point and started chanting Bernie s name over and over   completely denying the Trump goon s ability to speak.Waving his arms around and cheering for himself, the heckler was eventually escorted from the gathering by security while looking quite satisfied that he was immortalized on YouTube.After the interruption was over and without missing a beat, Bernie declared: I say to Mr. Trump and his supporters that the billionaires of this country will not continue to own this nation. Watch Bernie and his supports completely shut down the heckler below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJD0yUgb4J4&w=560&h=315]Protesting during political speeches is nothing new. Ever since Obama became president it has gone mainstream as a way to get candidates to immediately address issues. However, let s contrast Bernie and his supporters  reaction to your average Donald Trump rally.Bernie s people got a bit loud and drowned out the heckler while Bernie mostly stayed on topic without getting ugly towards him. When these same things happened at Trump rallies, the interrupters literally risked their lives. On one occasion, Trump encouraged his supporters to attack a black man, and on another yet another black man got ganged up on with Trump supporters saying Shoot him!   Kick his ass,  and  Light the motherf -r on fire! Featured image via video screen capture",0
9015, What Twitter Just Did To Right-Wingers Makes Them Look Even More Like Terrorists (VIDEO),"Right-wing pundits on Fox and Friends this week went on a little tirade about the rules of Twitter and how unfair they are to conservatives. Host Clayton Morris joined National Review writer Katherine Timf in shredding Twitter s  Abusive Behavior Policy,  designed to keep people from bullying others on the internet. The problem the conservatives have with the rule isn t that you could be suspended or banned from Twitter for a few malicious reports   it s that there isn t enough distinction between them and ISIS terrorists.Yes, really. Conservatives are concerned that because the policy doesn t specifically mention ISIS that a bunch of other extremist loudmouths with violent agendas and histories may be targeted and removed from Twitter. They don t argue the point at all from the perspective that there s no reason to compare right-wing American  patriots  to terrorists because to suggest such a thing would be as ludicrous as any claim ever made about anything. Ever.Right-wingers are brash, crass, low-information degenerates. Occasionally you come across a right-winger with an intelligence level worthy of a game of Connect Four, but nothing you d consider the upper middle class to wealthy American they vote to please. They are led by their puppet masters on missions to free the world from the tyrannical rule of Barack Obama, the evils of Islam and atheism, and plain red Christmas cups. They have no argument because the facts the party that rules them feeds them are fabrications and fear tactics.If right-wingers don t like the fact that they have an extremist problem and that their own kind become radicalized and commit unimaginable acts of terror, they should do something about their own message. You can t have people running around vowing to die for their country when their country needs them to just stay home and count their rounds of ammo.Nobody wants that kind of person near them, which extends to our online persona. When a right-winger takes to social media and promises some  libtard  180 grains of Chris Kyle-like justice, they ve just broken the rules and committed a crime, all at the same time.They shouldn t be kicked off of Twitter why? Enough of those people together in groups become what terrorist organizations call  cells.  Here in America, we call them  militias.  Twitter is said to have deleted 44,000 accounts associated with ISIS. Right-wingers should be happy they aren t just denied access on general principle.Watch Fox and cronies bash Twitter for having rules about being decent human beings below:Featured image via liberalplanet.com",0
9016, Donald Trump Once Took Away A Sick Baby’s Medical Because Of A Family Feud,"It s undeniable that Donald Trump is a giant asshat. His entire campaign built upon the exploitation of American conservatives  racism, and faux populist rhetoric that is completely at odds with his economic policies that he has put forward. But Trump s asshattery isn t just reserved for people he can exploit for political gain.The New York Times recently ran an article that detailed the relationship between Trump and his brother Freddy. Trump s younger brother was an alcoholic who died at the age of 43. Freddy s alcoholism caused a major rift to form in the two brothers  relationship. One of the most scandalous revelations in the piece is that Trump once revoked medical benefits to his nephew s sick infant son. Trump had promised that he would pay for Fred III (Trump s nephew) child s medical care. But a feud over an inheritance dispute devolved, that changed all of that.The New York Times reports: Then came the unveiling of Fred Sr. s will, which Donald had helped draft. It divided the bulk of the inheritance, at least $20 million, among his children and their descendants,  other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr. Freddy s children sued, claiming that an earlier version of the will had entitled them to their father s share of the estate, but that Donald and his siblings had used  undue influence  over their grandfather, who had dementia, to cut them out.A week later, Mr. Trump retaliated by withdrawing the medical benefits critical to his nephew s infant child. Trump s family did not want to talk to the media about the matter. Trump offered the New York Times an explanation for his actions during an interview, saying,  I was angry because they sued.  Trump claims the whole thing was eventually settled  very amicably. Trump s villainy has officially reached daytime soap opera levels. For sure, much of Trump s hateful antics are a campaign tactic that he is using to get free media coverage. However, when a story like this come out, it shows that Trump actually is a terrible, vindictive person.Featured Image Credit: Gage Skidmore [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons",0
9017, Christian Family Kills 41-Year-Old Mom During Attempted Exorcism,"On December 9, an unidentified 41-year-old mother was killed in a hotel room during an attempt by five family members to exorcise a demon which they claim was possessing her.According to authorities, the woman s family exerted massive force on her chest and stomach area,  as well an extreme amount of  violence to her neck.  A towel and a clothes hanger were shoved down her throat, reportedly to keep her from screaming.Prosecutors say that the woman was subjected to at least two hours of  pain and agony,  before she finally died from a combination of asphyxiation and traumatic injuries, all of which were sustained during the  exorcism. The killers include a 44-year-old female relative, along with the relative s children, a 21-year-old son, 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son. The 15-year-old son of the woman who was killed is also suspected of participating in the violence.Instead of calling police or paramedics after the woman died, the family called a priest.The priest immediately notified authorities, who ultimately discovered the woman s body at the Frankfurt InterContinental hotel.A second victim was later found, another 41-year-old woman, who is believed to be another family member. She was discovered inside a garage.According to Fox 10 in Phoenix, the second victim was taken to a hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia, dehydration and undisclosed injuries.The family involved in the woman s murder is South Korean, and had recently relocated to the Frankfurt, Germany area.The practice of exorcising demons, known as anchal-gido, is common among Charismatic Christians living Korea.As reported here and here, the western media often refers to these exorcisms as  Shamanism  when in fact they are legitimized by the Protestant Church in Korea.As Kyung Hong explains in the International Journal of Religion and Spirituality: anchal gido rituals are their own kind of abuse, since they often involve forms of physical violence against those deemed to be possessed.  The intensity of the healing prayers for cleansing demonic spirits also often accompanies intense physical contact in the belief that physical assaults intimidate and assist to expel demons. Thus, the healing ritual may well become so intense as to involve physical striking, beating, poling, or choking the possessed individual, though each action is viewed by the healers as attacking the demon, not the person. There is a similarity between Korean exorcism and shamanic rituals, but the latter often lacks the violence and is more about appeasing unfriendly nature or ancestral spirits than outright spiritual warfare. Religion Watch reports that in Korea, protestant women  who are seen as demon possessed are often viewed as disobedient to their husbands and are subject to shame and condemnation, even in their deaths. The facts about anchal-gido don t fit in with the western narrative of the Christian religion.When 18-year-old Rayoung Kim was killed in her home during a similar exorcism in Fairfax County, Virginia, the media reported that her death was due to a  Shamanistic exorcism,  although the facts in the case show that she died during the type of violent exorcism that is associated with anchal-gido, not kut or mudang, as the media routinely reported.The Shamanistic ritual of Kut involves singing, dancing and offering sacrifices. It is not associated with the violent  driving out of demons,  seen in these cases.That is far more typical of Korean Charismatic Christianity.In the case of the women killed in Frankfurt, the most telling sign that the family was conducting the kind of violent, Christian exorcism associated with anchal-gido is that the first person they called was a priest.Here in the U.S. we are constantly subjected to right-wing propaganda about the violent nature of the Muslim religion. At the same time, the media often presents us with a filtered version of current events, especially as they pertain to the Christian religion.Whether this is done purposely or out of ignorance and unconscious bias is up for debate.Either way, had this family killed a relative during a religious ceremony associated with Islam, the right wing would be all over that. In this case, however, the narrative will no doubt seek to shift the blame away from the Christian church and onto  Shamanism,  without a shred of evidence or single fact to support that theory.*Featured image credit: Michal via Flckr, CC 2.0",0
